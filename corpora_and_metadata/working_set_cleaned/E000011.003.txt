defence of usury showing the impolicy of the present legal restraints on the terms of pecuniary bargains in letters to a friend to which is added a letter to adam smith esq lld on the discouragements opposed by the above restraints to the progress of inventive industry by jeremy bentham originally printed in          defence of usury jeremy bentham january      crichoff in white russia adam smith letter i introduction crichoff in white russia january      among the various species or modifications of liberty of which on different occasions we have heard so much in england i do not recollect ever seeing anything yet offered in behalf of the liberty of making ones own terms in moneybargains from so general and universal a neglect it is an old notion of mine as you well know that this meek and unassuming species of liberty has been suffering much injustice a fancy has taken me just now to trouble you with my reasons which if you think them capable of answering any good purpose you may forward to the press or in the other case what will give you less trouble to the fire in a word the proposition i have been accustomed to lay down to myself on this subject is the following one viz that no man of ripe years and of sound mind acting freely and with his eyes open ought to be hindered with a view to his advantage from making such bargain in the way of obtaining money as he thinks fit nor what is a necessary consequence anybody hindered from supplying him upon any terms he thinks proper to accede to this proposition were it to be received would level you see at one stroke all the barriers which law either statute or common have in their united wisdom set up either against the crying sin of usury or against the hardnamed and littleheardof practice of champerty to which we must also add a portion of the multifarious and as littleheardof offence of maintenance on this occasion were it any individual antagonist i had to deal with my part would be a smooth and easy one you who fetter contracts—you who lay restrains on the liberty of man it is for you i should say to assign a reason for your doing so that contracts in general ought to be observed is a rule the propriety of which no man was ever yet found wrongheaded enough to deny if this case is one of the exceptions for some doubtless there are which the safety and welfare of every society require should be taken out of that general rule in this case as in all those others it lies upon him who alleges the necessity of the exception to produce a reason for it this i say would be a short and very easy method with an individual but as the world has no mouth of its own to plead by no certain attorney by which it can come and defend this force and injury i must even find arguments for it at a venture and ransack my own imagination for such phantoms as i can find to fight with in favour of the restraints opposed to the species of liberty i contend for i can imagine but five arguments—   prevention of usury   prevention of prodigality   protection of indigence against extortion   repression of the temerity of projectors   protection of simplicity against imposition— of all these in their order jeremy bentham russia adam smith letter ii reasons for restraint—prevention of usury i will begin with the prevention of usury because in the sound of the word usury lies i take it the main strength of the argument or to speak strictly of what is of more importance than all argument of the hold which the opinion i am combating has obtained on the imaginations and passions of mankind usury is a bad thing and as such ought to be prevented usurers are a bad sort of men a very bad sort of men and as such ought to be punished and suppressed these are among the string of propositions which every man finds handed down to him from his progenitors—which most men are disposed to accede to without examination and indeed not unnaturally nor even unreasonably disposed for it is impossible that the bulk of mankind should find leisure had they the ability to examine into the grounds of an hundredth part of the rules and maxims which they find themselves obliged to act upon very good apology this for john trot but a little more inquisitiveness may be required of legislators you my friend by whom the true force of words is so well understood have i am sure gone before me in perceiving that to say usury is a thing to be prevented is neither   more nor less than begging the matter in question i know of but two definitions that can possibly be given of usury one is the taking of a greater interest than the law allows of this may be styled the political or legal definition the other is the taking of a greater interest than it is usual for men to give and take this may be styled the moral one and this where the law has not interfered is plainly enough the only one it is plain that in order for usury to be prohibited by law a positive description must have been found for it by law fixing or rather superseding the moral one to say then that usury is a thing that ought to be prevented is saying neither more nor less than that the utmost rate of interest which shall be taken ought to be fixed and that fixation enforced by penalties or such other means if any as may answer the purpose of preventing the breach of it a law punishing usury supposes therefore a law fixing the allowed legal rate of interest and the propriety of the penal law must depend upon the propriety of the simplyprohibitive or if you please declaratory one one thing then is plain that antecedently to custom growing from convention there can be no such thing as usury for what rate of interest is there that can naturally be more proper than another what natural fixed price can there be for the use of money more than for the use of any other thing were it not then for custom usury considered in a moral view would not so much as admit of a definition so far from having existence it would not so much as be conceivable nor therefore could the law in the definition it took upon itself to give of such offence have so much as a guide to steer by custom therefore is the sole basis which either the moralist in his rules and precepts or the legislator in his injunctions can have to build upon but what basis can be more weak or unwarrantable as a ground for coercive measures than custom resulting from free choice my neighbours being at liberty have happened to concur among themselves in dealing at a certain rate of interest i who have money to lend and titius who wants to borrow it of me would be glad the one of us to accept the other to give an interest somewhat higher than theirs why is the liberty they exercise to be made a pretence for depriving me and titius of ours nor has blind custom thus made the sole and arbitrary guide anything of steadiness or uniformity in its decisions it has varied from age to age in the same country—it varies from country to country in the same age and the legal rate has varied along with it indeed with regard to times past it is from the legal rate more readily than from any other source that we collect the customary among the romans till the time of justinian we find it as high as    per cent in england so late as the time of henry viii we find it at  0 per cent succeeding statutes reduced it to   then to   and lastly to   where it stands at present even at present in ireland it is at   per cent and in the west indies at   per cent and in hindostan where there is no rate limited by law the lowest customary rate is  0 or    at constantinople in certain cases as i have been well informed  0 per cent is a common rate now of all these widely different rates what one is there that is intrinsically more proper than another what is it that evidences this propriety in each instance—what but the mutual convenience of the parties as manifested by their consent it is convenience then that has produced whatever there has been of custom in the matter what can there then be in custom to make it a better guide than the convenience which gave it birth and what is there in convenience that should make it a worse guide in one case than in another it would be convenient to me to give six per cent for money i wish to do so no says the law—you shant why so because it is not convenient to your neighbour to give above five for it can anything be more absurd than such a reason much has not been done i think by legislators as yet in the way of fixing the price of other commodities and in what little has been done the probity of the intention has i believe in general been rather more unquestionable than the rectitude of the principle or the felicity of the result putting money out at interest is exchanging present money for future but why a policy which as applied to exchanges in general would be generally deemed absurd and mischievous should be deemed necessary in the instance of this particular kind of exchange mankind are as yet to learn for him who takes as much as he can get for the use of any other sort of thing a house for instance there is no particular appellation nor any mark of disrepute nobody is ashamed of doing so nor is it usual so much as to profess to do otherwise why a man who takes as much as he can get be it six or seven or eight or ten per cent for the use of a sum of money should be called usurer should be loaded with an opprobrious name any more than if he had bought a house with it and made a proportionable profit by the house is more than i can see another thing i would also wish to learn is why the legislator should be more anxious to limit the rate of interest one way than the other why he should set his face against the owners of that species of property more than of any other why he should make it his business to prevent their getting more than a certain price for the use of it rather   than to prevent their getting less why in short he should not take means for making it penal to offer less for example than five per cent as well as to accept more let any one that can find an answer to these questions it is more than i can do i except always the distant and imperceptible advantage of sinking the price of goods of all kinds and in that remote way multiplying the future enjoyments of individuals but this was a consideration by far too distant and refined to have been the original ground for confining the limitation to this side jeremy bentham russia adam smith letter iii reasons for restraint—prevention of prodigality having done with sounds i come gladly to propositions which as far as they are true in point of fact may deserve the name of reasons and first as to the efficacy of such restrictive laws with regard to the prevention of prodigality that prodigality is a bad thing and that the prevention of it is a proper object for the legislator to propose to himself so long as he confines himself to what i look upon as proper measures i have no objection to allow at least for the purpose of the argument though were this the principal question i should look upon it as incumbent on me to place in a fair light the reasons there may be for doubting how far with regard to a person arrived at the age of discretion third persons may be competent judges which of two pains may be of greater force and value to him—the present pain of restraining his present desires or the future contingent pain he may be exposed to suffer from the want to which the expense of gratifying these desires may hereafter have reduced him to prevent our doing mischief to one another it is but too necessary to put bridles into all our mouths—it is necessary to the tranquillity and very being of society but that the tacking of leadingstrings upon the backs of grown persons in order to prevent their doing themselves a mischief is not necessary either to the being or tranquillity of society however conducive to its wellbeing i think cannot be disputed such paternal or if you please maternal care may be a good work but it certainly is but a work of supererogation for my own part i must confess that so long as such methods only are employed as to me appear proper ones and such there are i should not feel myself disinclined to see some measures taken for the restraining of prodigality but this i cannot look upon as being of the number my reasons i will now endeavour to lay before you in the first place i take it that it is neither natural nor usual for prodigals as such to betake themselves to this method i mean that of giving a rate of interest above the ordinary one to supply their wants in the first place no man i hope you will allow prodigal or not prodigal ever thinks of borrowing money to spend so long as he has ready money of his own or effects which he can turn into ready money without loss and this deduction strikes off what i suppose you will look upon as the greatest proportion of the persons subject at any given time to the imputation of prodigality in the next place no man in such a country as great britain at least has occasion or is at all likely to take up money at an extraordinary rate of interest who has security to give equal to that upon which money is commonly to be had at the highest ordinary rate while so many advertise as are to be seen every day advertising money to be lent at five per cent what should possess a man who has anything to offer that can be called a security to give for example six per cent is more than i can conceive you may say perhaps that a man who wishes to lend his money out upon security wishes to have his interest punctually and that without the expense and hazard and trouble and odium of going to law and that on this account it is better to have a sober man to deal with than a prodigal so far i allow you but were you to add that on this account it would be necessary for a prodigal to offer more than another man there i should disagree with you in the first place it is not so easy a thing nor i take it a common thing for the lender upon security to be able to judge or even to form any attempt to judge whether the conduct of one who offers to borrow his money is or is not of such a cast as to bring him under this description the question prodigal or not prodigal depends upon two pieces of information neither of which in general is very easy to come at on the one hand the amount of his means and reasonable expectations on the other hand the amount of his expenditure the goodness or badness of the security is a question of a very different nature upon this head every man has a known and ready means of obtaining that sort of information which is the most satisfactory the nature of things affords by going to his lawyer it is accordingly i take it on their lawyers opinion that lenders in general found their determination in these cases and not upon any calculations they may have formed concerning the receipt and expenditure of the borrower but even supposing a mans disposition to prodigality to be ever so well known there are always enough to be found to whom such a disposition would be rather an inducement than an objection so long as they were satisfied with   the security everybody knows the advantage to be made in case of mortgage by foreclosing or forcing a sale and that this advantage is not uncommonly looked out for will i believe hardly be doubted by any one who has had occasion to observe the course of business in the court of chancery in short so long as a prodigal has anything to pledge or to dispose of—whether in possession or even in reversion—whether of a certain or even of a contingent nature i see not how he can receive the smallest benefit from any laws that are or can be made to fix the rate of interest for suppose the law to be efficacious as far as it goes and that the prodigal can find none of those monsters called usurers to deal with him does he lie quiet no such thing he goes on and gets the money he wants by selling his interest instead of borrowing he goes on i say for if he has prudence enough to stop him anywhere he is not that sort of man whom it can be worth while for the law to attempt stopping by such means it is plain enough then that to a prodigal thus circumstanced the law cannot be of any service on the contrary it may and in many cases must be of disservice to him by denying him the option of a resource which how disadvantageous soever could not well have proved more so but would naturally have proved less so than those which it leaves still open to him but of this hereafter i now come to the only remaining class of prodigals viz those who have nothing that can be called a security to offer these i should think are not more likely to get money upon an extraordinary rate of interest than an ordinary one persons who either feel or find reasons for pretending to feel a friendship for the borrower cannot take of him more than the ordinary rate of interest persons who have no such motive for lending him will not lend him at all if they know him for what he is that will prevent them of course and even though they should know nothing of him by any other circumstance the very circumstance of his not being able to find a friend to trust him at the highest ordinary rate will be sufficient reason to a stranger for looking upon him as a man who in the judgment of his friends is not likely to pay the way that prodigals run into debt after they have spent their substance is i take it by borrowing of their friends and acquaintance at ordinary interest or more commonly at no interest small sums such as each man may be content to lose or be ashamed to ask real security for and as prodigals have generally an extensive acquaintance extensive acquaintance being at once the cause and effect of prodigality the sumtotal of the money a man may thus find means to squander may be considerable though each sum borrowed may relatively to the circumstances of the lender have been inconsiderable this i take to be the race which prodigals who have spent their all run at present under the present system of restraining laws and this and no other i take it would be the race they would run were those laws out of the way another consideration there is i think which will complete your conviction if it was not complete before of the inefficacy of these laws as to the putting any sort of restraint upon prodigality this is that there is another set of people from whom prodigals get what they want and always will get it so long as credit lasts in spite of all laws against high interest and should they find it necessary at an expense more than equal to any excess of interest they might otherwise have to give i mean the tradesmen who deal in the goods they want everybody knows it is much easier to get goods than money people trust goods upon much slenderer security than they do money it is very natural they should do so ordinary profit of trade upon the whole capital employed in a mans trade—even after the expense of warehouserent journeymens wages and other such general charges are taken into the account and set against it—is at least equal to double interest say  0 per cent ordinary profit upon any particular parcel of goods must therefore be a great deal more say at least triple interest    per cent in the way of trading then a man can afford to be at least three times as adventurous as he can in the way of lending and with equal prudence so long then as a man is looked upon as one who will pay he can much easier get the goods he wants than he could get the money to buy them with though he were content to give for it twice or even thrice the ordinary rate of interest supposing anybody for the sake of extraordinary gain to be willing to run the risk of supplying him although they did not look upon his personal security to be equal to that of another man and for the sake of the extraordinary profit to run the extraordinary risk—in the trader—in short in every sort of trader whom he was accustomed to deal with in his solvent days he sees a person who may accept of any rate of profit without the smallest danger from any laws that are or can be made against usury how idle then to think of stopping a man from making six or seven or eight per cent interest when if he chooses to run a risk proportionable he may in this way make  0 or  0 per cent or any rate you please and as to the prodigal if he cannot get what he wants upon these terms what chance is there of his getting it upon any terms supposing the laws against   usury to be away this then is another way in which instead of serving it injures him by narrowing his option and driving him from a market which might have proved less disadvantageous to a more disadvantageous one as far as prodigality then is concerned i must confess i cannot see the use of stopping the current of expenditure in this way at the fosset when there are so many unpreventable ways of letting it run out at the bunghole whether any harm is done to society upon the whole by letting so much money drop at once out of the pockets of the prodigal who would have gone on wasting it into the till of the frugal tradesman who will lay it up is not worth the inquiry for the present purpose what is plain is that so far as the saving the prodigal from paying at an extraordinary rate for what he gets to spend is the object of the law that object is not at all promoted by fixing the rate of interest upon money borrowed on the contrary if the law has any effect it runs counter to that object since were he to borrow it would only be in as far as he could borrow at a rate inferior to that at which otherwise he would be obliged to buy preventing his borrowing at an extra rate may have the effect of increasing his distress but cannot have the effect of lessening it allowing his borrowing at such a rate might have the effect of lessening his distress but could not have the effect of increasing it to put a stop to prodigality if indeed it be worth while i know but of one effectual course that can be taken in addition to the incomplete and insufficient courses at present practicable and that is to put the convicted prodigal under an interdict as was practised formerly among the romans and is still practised among the french and other nations who have taken the roman law for the groundwork of their own but to discuss the expediency or sketch out the details of such an institution belongs not to the present purpose jeremy bentham russia adam smith letter iv reasons for restraint—protection of indigence besides prodigals there are three other classes of persons and but three for whose security i can conceive these restrictive laws to have been designed i mean the indigent the rashly enterprising and the simple those whose pecuniary necessities may dispose them to give an interest above the ordinary rate rather than not have it and those who from rashness may be disposed to venture upon giving such a rate or from carelessness combined with ignorance may be disposed to acquiesce in it in speaking of these three different classes of persons i must beg leave to consider one of them at a time and accordingly in speaking of the indigent i must consider indigence in the first place as untinctured with simplicity on this occasion i may suppose and ought to suppose no particular defect in a mans judgment or his temper that should mislead him more than the ordinary run of men he knows what is his interest as well as they do and is as well disposed and able to pursue it as they are i have already intimated what i think is undeniable that there are no one or two or other limited number of rates of interest that can be equally suited to the unlimited number of situations in respect of the degree of exigency in which a man is liable to find himself insomuch that to the situation of a man who by the use of money can make for example    per cent   per cent is as well adapted as   per cent is to the situation of him who can make but  0—to that of him who can make    per cent   and so on so in the case of his wanting it to save himself from a loss which is that which is most likely to be in view under the name of exigency if that loss would amount to    per cent   per cent is as well adapted to his situation as   per cent would be to the situation of him who had but a loss amounting to  0 per cent to save himself from by the like means and in any case though in proportion to the amount of the loss the rate of interest were even so great as that the clear saving should not amount to more than   per cent or any fraction per cent yet so long as it amounted to anything he would be just so much the better for borrowing even on such comparatively disadvantageous terms if instead of gain we put any other kind of benefit or advantage—if instead of loss we put any other kind of mischief or inconvenience of equal value the result will be the same a man is in one of these situations suppose in which it would be for his advantage to borrow but his circumstances are such that it would not be worth anybodys while to lend him at the highest rate which it is proposed the law should allow—in short he cannot get it at that rate if he thought he could get it at that rate most surely he would not give a higher he may be trusted for that for by the supposition he has nothing defective in his understanding but the fact is he cannot get it at that lower rate at a higher rate however he could get it and at that rate though higher it would be worth his while to get it so he judges who has nothing to hinder him from judging right—who has every motive and every means for forming a right judgment—who has every motive and every means for informing himself of the circumstances upon which rectitude of judgment   in the case in question depends the legislator who knows nothing nor can know anything of any one of all these circumstances—who knows nothing at all about the matter comes and says to him—it signifies nothing you shall not have the money for it would be doing you a mischief to let you borrow it upon such terms and this out of prudence and lovingkindness there may be worse cruelty but can there be greater folly the folly of those who persist as is supposed without reason in not taking advice has been much expatiated upon but the folly of those who persist without reason in forcing their advice upon others has been but little dwelt upon though it is perhaps the more frequent and the more flagrant of the two it is not often that one man is a better judge for another than that other is for himself even in cases where the adviser will take the trouble to make himself master of as many of the materials for judging as are within the reach of the person to be advised but the legislator is not cannot be in the possession of any one of these materials what private can be equal to such public folly i should now speak of the enterprising class of borrowers those who when characterized by a single term are distinguished by the unfavourable appellation of projectors but in what i shall have to say of them dr smith i begin to foresee will bear so material a part that when i come to enter upon that subject i think to take my leave of you and address myself to him jeremy bentham russia adam smith letter v reasons for restraint—protection of simplicity i come lastly to the case of the simple here in the first place i think i am by this time entitled to observe that no simplicity short of absolute idiotism can cause the individual to make a more groundless judgment than the legislator who in the circumstances above stated should pretend to confine him to any given rate of interest would have made for him another consideration equally conclusive is that were the legislators judgment ever so much superior to the individuals how weak soever that may be the exertion of it on this occasion can never be any otherwise than useless so long as there are so many similar occasions as there ever must be where the simplicity of the individual is equally likely to make him a sufferer and on which the legislator cannot interpose with effect nor has ever so much as thought of interposing buying goods with money or upon credit is the business of every day borrowing money is the business only of some particular exigency which in comparison can occur but seldom regulating the prices of goods in general would be an endless task and no legislator has ever been weak enough to think of attempting it and supposing he were to regulate the prices what would that signify for the protection of simplicity unless he were to regulate also the quantum of what each man should buy such quantum is indeed regulated or rather means are taken to prevent buying altogether but in what cases in those only where the weakness is adjudged to have arrived at such a pitch as to render a man utterly unqualified for the management of his affairs in short when it has arrived at the length of idiocy but in what degree soever a mans weakness may expose him to imposition he stands much more exposed to it in the way of buying goods than in the way of borrowing money to be informed beforehand of the ordinary prices of all the sorts of things a man may have occasion to buy may be a task of considerable variety and extent to be informed of the ordinary rate of interest is to be informed of one single fact too interesting not to have attracted attention and too simple to have escaped the memory a few per cent enhancement upon the price of goods is a matter that may easily enough pass unheeded but a single per cent beyond the ordinary interest of money is a stride more conspicuous and startling than many per cent upon the price of any kind of goods even in regard to subjects which by their importance would if any justify a regulation of their price such as for instance land i question whether there ever was an instance where without some such ground as on the one side fraud or suppression of facts necessary to form a judgment of the value or at least ignorance of such facts on the other a bargain was rescinded merely because a man had sold too cheap or bought too dear were i to take a fancy to give a hundred years purchase instead of thirty for a piece of land rather than not have it i dont think there is any court in england or indeed anywhere else that would interpose to hinder me much less to punish the seller with the loss of three times the purchase money as in the case of usury yet when i had got my piece of land and paid my money repentance were the law ever so well disposed to assist me might be unavailing for the seller might have spent the money or gone off with it but in the case of borrowing money it is the borrower always who according to the indefinite or short term for which money is lent is on the safe side any imprudence he may have committed with regard to the rate of interest may be corrected at any time if   i find i have given too high an interest to one man i have no more to do than to borrow of another at a lower rate and pay off the first if i cannot find anybody to lend me at a lower there cannot be a more certain proof that the first was not in reality too high but of this hereafter jeremy bentham russia adam smith letter vi mischiefs of the antiusurious laws in the preceding letters i have examined all the modes i can think of in which the restraints imposed by the laws against usury can have been fancied to be of service i hope it appears by this time that there are no ways in which those laws can do any good but there are several in which they cannot but do mischief the first i shall mention is that of precluding so many people altogether from the getting the money they stand in need of to answer their respective exigencies think what a distress it would produce were the liberty of borrowing denied to everybody denied to those who have such security to offer as renders the rate of interest they have to offer a sufficient inducement for a man who has money to trust them with it just that same sort of distress is produced by denying that liberty to so many people whose security though if they were permitted to add something to that rate it would be sufficient is rendered insufficient by their being denied that liberty why the misfortune of not being possessed of that arbitrarily exacted degree of security should be made a ground for subjecting a man to a hardship which is not imposed on those who are free from that misfortune is more than i can see to discriminate the former class from the latter i can see but this one circumstance viz that their necessity is greater this it is by the very supposition for were it not they could not be what they are supposed to be willing to give more to be relieved from it in this point of view then the sole tendency of the law is to heap distress upon distress a second mischief is that of rendering the terms so much the worse to a multitude of those whose circumstances exempt them from being precluded altogether from getting the money they have occasion for in this case the mischief though necessarily less intense than in the other is much more palpable and conspicuous those who cannot borrow may get what they want so long as they have anything to sell but while out of lovingkindness or whatsoever other motive the law precludes a man from borrowing uponterms which it deems too disadvantageous it does not preclude him from selling upon any terms howsoever disadvantageous everybody knows that forced sales are attended with a loss and to this loss what would be deemed a most extravagant interest bears in general no proportion when a mans moveables are taken in execution they are i believe pretty well sold if after all expenses paid the produce amounts to twothirds of what it would cost to replace them in this way the providence and lovingkindness of the law costs him    per cent and no more supposing what is seldom the case that no more of the effects are taken than what is barely necessary to make up the money due if in her negligence and weakness she were to suffer him to offer    per cent per annum for forbearance it would be three years before he paid what he is charged with in the first instance by her wisdom such being the kindness done by the law to the owner of moveables let us see how it fares with him who has an interest in immoveables before the late war thirty years purchase for land might be reckoned i think it is pretty well agreed a medium price during the distress produced by the war lands which it was necessary should be sold were sold at twenty eighteen nay i believe in some instances even so low as fifteen years purchase if i do not misrecollect i remember instances of lands put up to public auction for which nobody bid so high as fifteen in many instances villas which had been bought before the war or at the beginning of it and in the interval had been improved rather than impaired sold for less than half or even the quarter of what they had been bought for i dare not here for my part pretend to be exact but on this passage were it worth their notice mr skinner or mr christie could furnish very instructive notes twenty years purchase instead of thirty i may be allowed to take at least for illustration an estate then of £ 00 ayear clear of taxes was devised to a man charged suppose with £  00 with interest till the money should be paid five per cent interest the utmost which could be accepted from the owner did not answer the incumbrancers purpose he chose to have the money but   per cent perhaps would have answered his purpose if not most certainly it would have answered the purpose of somebody else for multitudes there all along were whose purposes were answered by five per cent the war lasted i think seven years the depreciation of the value of land did not take place immediately but as on the other hand neither did it immediately recover its former price upon the peace if indeed it has even yet recovered it we may put seven years for the time during which it would be more advantageous to pay this extraordinary rate of interest than sell the land and during which accordingly this extraordinary rate of interest would have had to run one per cent for seven years is not quite of  0 equal worth to seven per cent the first year say however that it is the estate which before the war was worth thirty years purchase that is £ 000 and which the devisor had given to the devisee for that value being put up to sale fetched but twenty years purchase £ 000 at the end of that period it would have fetched its original value £ 000 compare then the situation of the devisee at the seven years end under the law with what it would have been without the law in the former case the land selling for twenty years purchase i e £ 000 what he would have after paying the £  00 is £ 00 which with the interest of that sum at five per cent for seven years viz £    makes at the end of that seven years £    in the other case paying six per cent on the £  00 that is £ 0 ayear and receiving all that time the rent of the land viz £ 00 he would have had at the seven years end the amount of the remaining £ 0 during that period that is £ 0 in addition to his £ 000 £    subtracted from £ 0 0 leaves £    this £    then is what he loses out of £ 0 0 almost thirtyseven per cent of his capital by the lovingkindness of the law make the calculations and you will find that by preventing him from borrowing the money at six per cent interest it makes him nearly as much a sufferer as if he had borrowed it at ten what i have said hitherto is confined to the case of those who have present value to give for the money they stand in need of if they have no such value then if they succeed in purchasing assistance upon any terms it must be in breach of the law their lenders exposing themselves to its vengeance for i speak not here of the accidental case of its being so constructed as to be liable to evasion but even in this case the mischievous influence of the law still pursues them—aggravating the very mischief it pretends to remedy though it be inefficacious in the way in which the legislator wishes to see it efficacious it is efficacious in the way opposite to that in which he would wish to see it so the effect of it is to raise the rate of interest higher than it would be otherwise and that in two ways in the first place a man must in common prudence as dr smith observes make a point of being indemnified not only for whatsoever extraordinary risk it is that he runs independently of the law but for the very risk occasioned by the law he must be insured as it were against the law this cause would operate were there even as many persons ready to lend upon the illegal rate as upon the legal but this is not the case a great number of persons are of course driven out of this competition by the danger of the business and another great number by the disrepute which under cover of these prohibitory laws or otherwise has fastened itself upon the name of usurer so many persons therefore being driven out of the trade it happens in this branch as it must necessarily in every other that those who remain have the less to withhold them from advancing their terms and without confederating for it must be allowed that confederacy in such a case is plainly impossible each one will find it easier to push his advantage up to any given degree of exorbitancy than he would if there were a greater number of persons of the same stamp to resort to as to the case where the law is so worded as to be liable to be evaded in this case it is partly inefficacious and nugatory and partly mischievous it is nugatory as to all such whose confidence of its being so is perfect it is mischievous as before in regard to all such who fail of possessing that perfect confidence if the borrower can find nobody at all who has confidence enough to take advantage of the flaw he stands precluded from all assistance as before and though he should yet the lenders terms must necessarily run the higher in proportion to what his confidence wants of being perfect it is not likely that it should be perfect it is still less likely that he should acknowledge it so to be it is not likely at least as matters stand in england that the worstpenned law made for this purpose should be altogether destitute of effect and while it has any that effect we see must be in one way or other mischievous i have already hinted at the disrepute the ignominy the reproach which prejudice the cause and the effect of these restrictive laws has heaped upon that perfectly innocent and even meritorious class of men who not more for their own advantage than to the relief of the distresses of their neighbour may have ventured to break through these restraints it is certainly not a matter of indifference that a class of persons who in every point of view in which their conduct can be placed whether in relation to their own interest or in relation to that of the persons whom they have to deal with as well on the score of prudence as on that of beneficence and of what use is even benevolence but in as far as it is productive of beneficence deserve praise rather than censure should be classed with the abandoned and profligate and loaded with a degree of infamy which is due to those only whose conduct is in its tendency the most opposite to their own this suffering it may be said having already been taken account of is not to be brought to account a second time they are aware as you yourself observe of this inconvenience and have taken care to get such amends for it as they themselves look upon as sufficient true but is it sure that the compensation such as it is will always in the event have proved a sufficient one is there no room here for miscalculation may    there not be unexpected unlookedfor incidents sufficient to turn into bitterness the utmost satisfaction which the difference of pecuniary emolument could afford for who can see to the end of that inexhaustible train of consequences that are liable to ensue from the loss of reputation—who can fathom the abyss of infamy at any rate this article of mischief if not an addition in its quantity to the others above noticed is at least distinct from them in its nature and as such ought not to be overlooked nor is the event of the execution of the law by any means an unexampled one several such at different times have fallen within my notice then comes absolute perdition loss of character and forfeiture not of three times the extrainterest which formed the profit of the offence but of three times the principal which gave occasion to it the last article i have to mention in the account of mischief is the corruptive influence exercised by these laws on the morals of the people by the pains they take and cannot but take to give birth to treachery and ingratitude to purchase a possibility of being enforced the law neither has found nor what is very material must it ever hope to find in this case any other expedient than that of hiring a man to break his engagement and to crush the hand that has been reached out to help him in the case of informers in general there has been no troth plighted nor benefit received in the case of real criminals invited by rewards to inform against accomplices it is by such breach of faith that society is held together as in other cases by the observance of it in the case of real crimes in proportion as their mischievousness is apparent what cannot but be manifest even to the criminal is that it is by the adherence to his engagement that he would do an injury to society and that by the breach of such engagement instead of doing mischief he is doing good in the case of usury this is what no man can know and what one can scarcely think it possible for any man who in the character of the borrower has been concerned in such a transaction to imagine he knew that even in his own judgment the engagement was a beneficial one to himself or he would not have entered into it and nobody else but the lender is affected by it jeremy bentham russia adam smith letter vii efficacy of antiusurious laws before i quit altogether the consideration of the case in which a law made for the purpose of limiting the rate of interest may be inefficacious with regard to that end i cannot forbear taking some further notice of a passage already alluded to of dr smiths because to my apprehension that passage seems to throw upon the subject a degree of obscurity which i could wish to see cleared up in a future edition of that valuable work no law says he† can reduce the common rate of interest below the lowest ordinary market rate at the time when that law was made notwithstanding the edict of      by which the french king attempted to reduce the rate of interest from five to four per cent money continued to be lent in france at five per cent the law being evaded in several different ways as to the general position if so it be so much according to me the better but i must confess i do not see why this should be the case it is for the purpose of proving the truth of this general position that the fact of the inefficacy of this attempt seems to be adduced for no other proof is adduced but this but taking the fact for granted i do not see how it can be sufficient to support the inference the lw we are told at the same time was evaded but we are not told how it came to be open to evasion it might be owing to a particular defect in the penning of that particular law or what comes to the same thing in the provisions made for carrying it into execution in either case it affords no support to the general position nor can that position be a just one unless it were so in the case where every provision had been made that could be made for giving efficacy to the law for the position to be true the case must be that the law would still be broken even after every means of what can properly be called evasion had been removed true or untrue the position is certainly not selfevident enough to be received without proof yet nothing is adduced in proof of it but the fact above noticed which we see amounts to no such thing what is more i should not expect to find it capable of proof i do not see what it is that should render the law incapable of reducing the common rate of interest below the lowest ordinary market rate but such a state of things such a combination of circumstances as should afford obstacles equally powerful or nearly so to the efficacy of the law against all higher rates for destroying the laws efficacy altogether i know of nothing that could serve but a resolution on the part of all persons anyway privy not to inform but by such a resolution any higher rate is just as effectually protected as any lower one suppose the resolution strictly speaking universal and the law must in all instances be equally inefficacious—all rates of interest    equally free and the state of mens dealings in this way just what it would be were there no law at all upon the subject but in this case the position in as far as it limits the inefficacy of the law to those rates which are below the lowest ordinary market rate is not true for my part i cannot conceive how any such universal resolution could have been maintained or could ever be maintained without an open concert and as open a rebellion against government nothing of which sort appears to have taken place and as to any particular confederacies they are as capable of protecting any higher rates against the prohibition as any lower ones thus much indeed must be admitted that the low rate in question viz that which was the lowest ordinary market rate immediately before the making of the law is likely to come in for the protection of the public against the law more frequently than any other rate that must be the case on two accounts first because by being of the number of the ordinary rates it was by the supposition more frequent than any extraordinary ones secondly because the disrepute annexed to the idea of usury a force which might have more or less efficacy in excluding from the protection above spoken of such extraordinary rates cannot well be supposed to apply itself or at least not in equal degree to this low and ordinary rate a lender has certainly less to stop him from taking a rate which may be taken without disrepute than from taking one which a man could not take without subjecting himself to that inconvenience nor is it likely that mens imaginations and sentiments should testify so sudden an obsequiousness to the law as to stamp disrepute today upon a rate of interest to which no such accompaniment had stood annexed the day before were i to be asked how i imagined the case stood in the particular instance referred to by dr smith—judging from his account of it assisted by general probabilities i should answer thus—the law i should suppose was not so penned as to be altogether proof against evasion in many instances of which it is impossible any account should have been taken it was indeed conformed to in some of those instances people who would have lent otherwise abstained from lending altogether in others of those instances people lent their money at the reduced legal rate in other instances again the law was broken the lenders trusting partly to expedients recurred to for evading it partly to the good faith and honour of those whom they had to deal with in this class of instances it was natural for the two reasons above suggested that those where the old legal rate was adhered to should have been the most numerous from the circumstance not only of their number but of their more direct repugnancy to the particular recent law in question they would naturally be the most taken notice of and this i should suppose was the foundation in point of fact for the doctors general position above mentioned that no law can reduce the common rate of interest below the lowest ordinary market rate at the time when that law was made in england as far as i can trust my judgment and imperfect general recollection of the purport of the laws relative to this matter i should not suppose that the above position would prove true that there is no such thing as any palpable and universally notorious as well as universally practicable receipt for that purpose is manifest from the examples which as i have already mentioned every now and then occur of convictions upon these statutes two such receipts indeed i shall have occasion to touch upon presently but they are either not obvious enough in their nature or too troublesome or not extensive enough in their application to have despoiled the law altogether of its terrors or of its preventive efficacy in the country in which i am writing the whole system of laws on this subject is perfectly and very happily inefficacious the rate fixed by law is   per cent many people lend money and nobody at that rate the lowest ordinary rate upon the very best real security is   per cent   and even  0 upon such security are common six or seven may have place now and then between relations or other particular friends because now and then a man may choose to make a present of one or two per cent to a person whom he means to favour the contract is renewed from year to year for a thousand roubles the borrower in his written contract obliges himself to pay at the end of the year one thousand and fifty before witnesses he receives his thousand roubles and without witnesses he immediately pays back his thirty roubles or his forty roubles or whatever the sum may be that is necessary to bring the real rate of interest to the rate verbally agreed on this contrivance i take it would not do in england but why it would not is a question which it would be in vain for me to pretend at this distance from all authorities to discuss jeremy bentham russia adam smith letter viii virtual usury allowed having proved as i hope by this time the utter impropriety of the laws limiting the rate of interest in every case that can be conceived it may be rather matter of curiosity than anything else to inquire how far the law on this head is consistent with itself and with any principles upon which it can have built      drawing and redrawing is a practice which it will be sufficient here to hint at it is perfectly well known to all merchants and may be so to all who are not merchants by consulting dr smith in this way he has shown how money may be and has been taken up at so high a rate as    or    per cent a rate nearly three times as high as the utmost which the law professes to allow the extra interest is in this case masked under the names of commission and price of exchange the commission is but small upon each loan—not more i think than one half per cent custom having stretched so far but no farther it might be thought dangerous perhaps to venture upon any higher allowance under that name the charge being repeated a number of times in the course of the year makes up in frequency what it wants in weight the transaction is by this shift rendered more troublesome indeed but not less practicable to such parties as are agreed about it but if usury is good for merchants i do not very well see what should make it bad for everybody else   at this distance from all the fountains of legal knowledge i will not pretend to say whether the practice of selling accepted bills at an undervalue would hold good against all attacks it strikes my recollection as a pretty common one and i think it could not be brought under any of the penal statutes against usury the adequateness of the consideration might for aught i know be attacked with success in a court of equity—or perhaps if there were sufficient evidence which the agreement of the parties might easily prevent by an action at common law for money had and received if the practice be really proof against all attacks it seems to afford an effectual and pretty commodious method of evading the restrictive laws the only restraint is that it requires the assistance of a third person a friend of the borrowers as for instance b the real borrower wants £ 00 and finds u a usurer who is willing to lend it to him at  0 per cent b has f a friend who has not the money himself to lend him but is willing to stand security for him to that amount b therefore draws upon f and f accepts a bill of £ 00 at   per cent interest payable at the end of a twelvemonth from the date f draws a like bill upon b each sells his bill to u for £ 0 and it is endorsed to u accordingly the £ 0 that f receives he delivers over without any consideration to b this transaction if it be a valid one and if a man can find such a friend is evidently much less troublesome than the practice of drawing and redrawing and this if it be practicable at all may be practised by persons of any description concerned or not in trade should the effect of this page be to suggest an expedient and that a safe and commodious one for evading the laws against usury to some to whom such an expedient might not otherwise have occurred it will not lie very heavy upon my conscience the prayers of usurers whatever efficacy they may have in lightening the burthen i hope i may lay some claim to and i think you will not now wonder at my saying that in the efficacy of such prayers i have not a whit less confidence than in that of the prayers of any other class of men one apology i shall have to plead at any rate—that in pointing out these flaws to the individual who may be disposed to creep out at them i point them out at the same time to the legislator in whose power it is to stop them up if in his opinion they require it if notwithstanding such opinion he should omit to do so the blame will lie not on my industry but on his negligence these it may be said should they even be secure and effectual evasions are still but evasions and if chargeable upon the law at all are chargeable not as inconsistencies but as oversights be it so setting these aside then as expedients practised or practicable only behind its back i will beg leave to remind you of two others practised from the day of its birth under its protection and before its face the first i shall mention is pawnbroking in this case there is the less pretence for more than ordinary interest inasmuch as the security is in this case not only equal to but better than what it can be in any other to wit the present possession of a moveable thing of easy sale on which the creditor has the power and certainly does not want the inclination to set such price as is most for his advantage if there be a case in which the allowing of such extraordinary interest is attended with more danger than another it must be this which is so particularly adapted to the situation of the lowest poor that is of those who on the score of indigence or simplicity or both are most open to imposition this trade however the law by regulating avowedly protects what the rate of interest is which it allows to be taken in this way i cannot take upon me to remember but i am much deceived if it amounts to less than    per cent in the year and i believe it amounts to a good deal more whether it were    per cent or   00 i believe would make in practice but little difference what commission is in the business of drawing and redrawing warehouseroom is in that of pawnbroking whatever limits then are set to the profits of this trade are set i take it not by the vigilancy of the law but as in the case of other trades by the competition    amongst the traders of the other regulations contained in the acts relative to this subject i recollect no reason to doubt the use the other instance is that of bottomry and respondentia for the two transactions being so nearly related may be spoken of together bottomry is the usury of pawnbroking respondentia is usury at large but combined in a manner with insurance and employed in the assistance of a trade carried on by sea if any species of usury is to be condemned i see not on what grounds this particular species can be screened from the condemnation oh but says sir william blackstone or anybody else who takes upon himself the task of finding a reason for the law this is a maritime country and the trade which it carries on by sea is the great bulwark of its defence it is not necessary i should here inquire whether that branch which as dr smith has shown is in every view but the mere one of defence less beneficial to a nation than two others out of the four branches which comprehend all trade has any claim to be preferred to them in this or any other way i admit that the liberty which this branch of trade enjoys is no more than what it is perfectly right it should enjoy what i want to know is what there is in the class of men embarked in this trade that should render beneficial to them a liberty which would be ruinous to everybody else is it that sea adventures have less hazard on them than land adventures or that the sea teaches those who have to deal with it a degree of forecast and reflection which has been denied to landmen it were easy enough to give farther and farther extension to this charge of inconsistency by bringing under it the liberty given to insurance in all its branches to the purchase and sale of annuities and of postobits in a word to all cases where a man is permitted to take upon himself an unlimited degree of risk receiving for so doing an unlimited compensation indeed i know not where the want of instances would stop me for in what part of the magazine of events about which human transactions are conversant is certainty to be found but to this head of argument this argument ad hominem as it may be called the use of which is but subsidiary and which has more of confutation in it than of persuasion or instruction i willingly put an end jeremy bentham russia adam smith letter ix blackstone considered i hope you are by this time at least pretty much of my opinion that there is just the same sort of harm and no other in making the best terms one can for ones self in a money loan as there is in any other sort of bargain if you are not blackstone however is whose opinion i hope you will allow to be worth something in speaking of the rate of interest he starts a parallel between a bargain for the loan of money and a bargain about a horse and pronounces without hesitation that the harm of making too good a bargain is just as great in the one case as in the other as moneylending and not horsedealing was what you lawyers call the principal case he drops the horsebusiness as soon as it has answered the purpose of illustration which it was brought to serve but as in my conception as well the reasoning by which he supports the decision as that by which anybody else could have supported it is just as applicable to the one sort of bargain as to the other i will carry on the parallel a little farther and give the same extent to the reasoning as to the position which it is made use of to support this extension will not be without its use for if the position when thus extended should be found just a practical inference will arise which is that the benefits of these restraints ought to be extended from the moneytrade to the horsetrade that my own opinion is not favourable to such restraints in either case has been sufficiently declared but if more respectable opinions than mine are still to prevail they will not be the less respectable for being consistent the sort of bargain which the learned commentator has happened to pitch upon for the illustration is indeed in the case illustrating as in the case illustrated a loan but as to my apprehension loan or sale makes in point of reasoning no sort of difference and as the utility of the conclusion will in the latter case be more extensive i shall adapt the reasoning to the more important business of selling horses instead of the less important one of lending them a circumstance that would render the extension of these restraints to the horsetrade more smooth and easy is that in the one track as well as in the other the public has already got the length of calling names jockeyship—a term of reproach not less frequently applied to the arts of those who sell horses than to the arts of those who ride them—sounds i take it to the ear of many a worthy gentleman nearly as bad as usury and it is well known to all those who put their trust in proverbs and not less to those who put their trust in party that when we have got a dog to hang who is troublesome and keeps us at bay whoever can contrive to fasten a bad name to his tail has gained more than half the battle i now proceed with my application the words in italics are my own all the rest are sir william blackstones    and i restore at bottom the words i was obliged to discard in order to make room for mine to demand an exorbitant price is equally contrary to conscience for the loan of a horse or for the loan of a sum of money but a reasonable equivalent for the temporary inconvenience which the owner may feel by the want of it and for the hazard of his losing it entirely is not more immoral in one case than in the other     as to selling horses a capital distinction must be made between a moderate and an exorbitant profit to the former of which we give the name of horsedealinga to the latter the truly odious appellation of jockeyshipb the former is necessary in every civil state if it were but to exclude the latter for as the whole of this matter is well summed up by grotius if the compensation allowed by law does not exceed the proportion of the inconvenience which it is to the seller of the horse to part with itc or the want which the buyer has of itd its allowance is neither repugnant to the revealed law nor to the natural law but if it exceeds these bounds it is then an oppressive jockeyshipe and though the municipal laws may give it impunity they never can make it just we see that the exorbitance or moderation of the price given for a horsef depends upon two circumstances—upon the inconvenience of parting with the horse one hasg and the hazard of not being able to meet with such anotherh the inconvenience to individual sellers of horsesi can never be estimated by laws the general price for horsesk must depend therefore upon the usual or general inconvenience this results entirely from the quantity of horsesl in the kingdom for the more horsesm there are running aboutn in any nation the greater superfluity there will be beyond what is necessary to carry on the business of the mailcoacheso and the common concerns of life in every nation or public community there is a certain quantity of horsesp thus necessary which a person well skilled in political arithmetic might perhaps calculate as exactly as a private horses dealerq can the demand for running horses in his own stablesr all above this necessary quantity may be spared or lent or sold without much inconvenience to the respective lenders or sellers and the greater the national superfluity is the more numerous will be the sellerss and the lower ought the national price of horseflesht to be but where there are not enough or barely enough spare horsesu to answer the ordinary uses of the public horsefleshx will be proportionably high for sellersy will be but few as few can submit to the inconvenience of sellingz so far the learned commentator i hope by this time you are worked up to a proper pitch of indignation at the neglect and inconsistency betrayed by the law in not suppressing this species of jockeyship which it would be so easy to do only by fixing the price of horses nobody is less disposed than i am to be uncharitable but when one thinks of the £  00 taken for eclipse and £ 000 for rockingham and so on who can avoid being shocked to think how little regard those who took such enormous prices must have had for the law of revelation and the law of nature whoever it is that is to move for the municipal law not long ago talked of for reducing the rate of interest—whenever that motion is made then would be the time for one of the yorkshire members to get up and move by way of addition for a clause for fixing and reducing the price of horses i need not expatiate on the usefulness of that valuable species of cattle which might have been as cheap as asses before now if our lawgivers had been as mindful of their duty in the suppression of jockeyship as they have been in the suppression of usury it may be said against fixing the price of horseflesh that different horses may be of different values i answer—and i think i shall show you as much when i come to touch upon the subject of champerty—not more different than the values which the use of the same sum of money may be of to different persons on different occasions jeremy bentham russia adam smith letter x grounds of the prejudices against usury it is one thing to find reasons why it is fit a law should have been made—it is another to find the reasons why it was made in other words it is one thing to justify a law—it is another thing to account for its existence in the present instance the former task if the observations i have been troubling you with are just is an impossible one the other though not necessary for conviction may contribute something perhaps in the way of satisfaction to trace an error to its fountainhead says lord coke is to refute it and many men there are who till they have received this satisfaction be the error what it may cannot prevail upon themselves    to part with it if our ancestors have been all along under a mistake how came they to have fallen into it is a question that naturally presents itself upon all such occasions the case is that in matters of law more especially such is the dominion of authority over our minds and such the prejudice it creates in favour of whatever institution it has taken under its wing that after all manner of reasons that can be thought of in favour of the institution have been shown to be insufficient we still cannot forbear looking to some unassignable and latent reason for its efficient cause but if instead of any such reason we can find a cause for it in some notion of the erroneousness of which we are already satisfied then at last we are content to give it up without further struggle and then and not till then our satisfaction is complete in the conceptions of the more considerable part of those through whom our religion has been handed down to us virtue or rather godliness which was an improved substitute for virtue consisted in selfdenial—not in selfdenial for the sake of society but in selfdenial for its own sake one pretty general rule served for most occasions not to do what you had a mind to do or in other words not to do what would be for your advantage by this of course was meant temporal advantage to which spiritual advantage was understood to be in constant and diametrical opposition for the proof of a resolution on the part of a being of perfect power and benevolence to make his few favourites happy in a state in which they were to be was his determined pleasure that they should keep themselves as much strangers to happiness as possible in the state in which they were now to get money is what most men have a mind to do because he who has money gets as far as it goes most other things that he has a mind for of course nobody was to get money indeed why should he when he was not so much as to keep what he had got already to lend money at interest is to get money or at least to try to get it of course it was a bad thing to lend money upon such terms the better the terms the worse it was to lend upon them but it was bad to lend upon any terms by which anything could be got what made it much the worse was that it was acting like a jew for though all christians at first were jews and continued to do as jews did after they had become christians yet in process of time it came to be discovered that the distance between the mother and the daughter church could not be too wide by degrees as old conceits gave place to new nature so far prevailed that the objections to getting money in general were pretty well overruled but still this jewish way of getting it was too odious to be endured christians were too intent upon plaguing jews to listen to the suggestion of doing as jews did even though money were to be got by it indeed the easier method and a method pretty much in vogue was to let the jews get the money any how they could and then squeeze it out of them as it was wanted in process of time as questions of all sorts came under discussion and this not the least interesting among the rest the antijewish side of it found no unopportune support in a passage of aristotle that celebrated heathen who in all matters wherein heathenism did not destroy his competence had established a despotic empire over the christian world as fate would have it that great philosopher with all his industry and all his penetration notwithstanding the great number of pieces of money that had passed through his hands more perhaps than ever passed through the hands of philosopher before or since and notwithstanding the uncommon pains he had bestowed on the subject of generation had never been able to discover in any one piece of money any organs for generating any other such piece emboldened by so strong a body of negative proof he ventured at last to usher into the world the result of his observations in the form of an universal proposition that all money is in its nature barren you my friend to whose cast of mind sound reason is much more congenial than ancient philosophy—you have i dare to say gone before me in remarking that the practical inference from this shrewd observation if it afforded any should have been that it would be to no purpose for a man to try to get five per cent out of money—not that if he could contrive to get so much there would be any harm in it but the sages of those days did not view the matter in that light a consideration that did not happen to present itself to that great philosopher but which had it happened to present itself might not have been altogether unworthy of his notice is that though a daric would not beget another daric any more than it would a ram or an ewe yet for a daric which a man borrowed he might get a ram and a couple of ewes and that the ewes were the ram left with them a certain time would probably not be barren that then at the end of the year he would find himself master of his three sheep together with two if not three lambs and that if he sold his sheep again to pay back his daric and gave one of his lambs for the use of it in the meantime he would be two lambs or at least one lamb richer than if he had made no such bargain these theological and philosophical conceits the offspring of the day were not ill seconded by principles of a more permanent complexion    the business of a moneylender though only among christians and in christian times a proscribed profession has nowhere nor at any time been a popular one those who have the resolution to sacrifice the present to future are natural objects of envy to those who have sacrificed the future to the present the children who have eaten their cake are the natural enemies of the children who have theirs while the money is hoped for and for a short time after it has been received he who lends it is a friend and benefactor by the time the money is spent and the evil hour of reckoning is come the benefactor is found to have changed his nature and to have put on the tyrant and the oppressor it is an oppression for a man to reclaim his own money it is none to keep it from him among the inconsiderate that is among the great mass of mankind selfish affections conspire with the social in treasuring up all favour for the man of dissipation and in refusing justice to the man of thrift who has supplied him in some shape or other that favour attends the chosen object of it through every stage of his career but in no stage of his career can the man of thrift come in for any share of it it is the general interest of those with whom a man lives that his expense should be at least as great as his circumstances will bear because there are few expenses which a man can launch into but what the benefit of them is shared in some proportion or other by those with whom he lives in that circle originates a standing law forbidding every man on pain of infamy to confine his expenses within what is adjudged to be the measure of his means saving always the power of exceeding that limit as much as he thinks proper and the means assigned him by that law may be ever so much beyond his real means but are sure never to fall short of them so close is the combination thus formed between the idea of merit and the idea of expenditure that a disposition to spend finds favour in the eyes even of those who know that a mans circumstances do not entitle him to the means and an upstart whose chief recommendation is this disposition shall find himself to have purchased a permanent fund of respect to the prejudice of the very persons at whose expense he has been gratifying his appetites and his pride the lustre which the display of borrowed wealth has diffused over his character awes men during the season of his prosperity into a submission to his insolence and when the hand of adversity has overtaken him at last the recollection of the height from which he has fallen throws the veil of compassion over his injustice the condition of the man of thrift is the reverse his lasting opulence procures him a share at least of the same envy that attends the prodigals transient display but the use he makes of it procures him no part of the favour which attends the prodigal in the satisfactions he derives from that use—the pleasure of possession and the idea of enjoying at some distant period which may never arrive—nobody comes in for any share in the midst of his opulence he is regarded as a kind of insolvent who refuses to honour the bills which their rapacity would draw upon him and who is by so much the more criminal than other insolvents as not having the plea of inability for an excuse could there be any doubt of the disfavour which attends the cause of the moneylender in his competition with the borrower and of the disposition of the public judgment to sacrifice the interest of the former to that of the latter the stage would afford a compendious but a pretty conclusive proof of it it is the business of the dramatist to study and to conform to the humours and passions of those on the pleasing of whom he depends for his success it is the course which reflection must suggest to every man and which a man would naturally fall into though he were not to think about it he may and very frequently does make magnificent pretences of giving the law to them but woe be to him that attempts to give them any other law than what they are disposed already to receive if he would attempt to lead them one inch it must be with great caution and not without suffering himself to be led by them at least a dozen now i question whether among all the instances in which a borrower and a lender of money have been brought together upon the stage from the days of thespis to the present there ever was one in which the former was not recommended to favour in some shape or other—either to admiration or to love or to pity or to all three—and the other the man of thrift consigned to infamy hence it is that in reviewing and adjusting the interests of these apparently rival parties the advantage made by the borrower is so apt to slip out of sight and that made by the lender to appear in so exaggerated a point of view hence it is that though prejudice is so far softened as to acquiesce in the lenders making some advantage lest the borrower should lose altogether the benefit of his assistance yet still the borrower is to have all the favour and the lenders advantage is forever to be clipped and pared down as low as it will bear first it was to be confined to ten per cent then to eight then to six then to five and now lately there was a report of its being to be brought down to four with constant liberty to sink as much lower as it would the burthen of these restraints of course has been intended exclusively for the lender in reality as i think    you have seen it presses much more heavily upon the borrower i mean him who either becomes or in vain wishes to become so but the presents directed by prejudice dr smith will tell us are not always delivered according to their address it was thus that the millstone designed for the necks of those vermin as they have been called the dealers in corn was found to fall upon the heads of the consumers it is thus—but further examples would lead me further from the purpose jeremy bentham russia adam smith letter xi compound interest a word or two i must trouble you with concerning compound interest for compound interest is discountenanced by the law—i suppose as a sort of usury that without an express stipulation the law never gives it i well remember whether in case of an express stipulation the law allows it to be taken i am not absolutely certain i should suppose it might remembering covenants in mortgages that interest should become principal at any rate i think the law cannot well punish it under the name of usury if the discountenance shown to this arrangement be grounded on the horror of the sin of usury the impropriety of such discountenance follows of course from the arguments which show the unsinfulness of that sin other argument against it i believe was never attempted unless it were the giving to such an arrangement the epithet of a hard one in doing which something more like a reason is given than one gets in ordinary from the common law if that consistency were to be found in the common law which has never yet been found in mans conduct and which perhaps is hardly in mans nature compound interest never could have been denied the views which suggested this denial were i dare to say very good the effects of it are i am certain very pernicious if the borrower pays the interest at the day—if he performs his engagement that very engagement to which the law pretends to oblige him to conform—the lender who receives that interest makes compound interest of course by lending it out again unless he chooses rather to expend it he expects to receive it at the day or what meant the engagement—if he fails of receiving it he is by so much a loser the borrower by paying it at the day is no loser—if he does not pay it at the day he is by so much a gainer a pain of disappointment takes place in the case of the one while no such pain takes place in the case of the other the cause of him whose contention is to catch a gain is thus preferred to that of him whose contention is to avoid a loss—contrary to the reasonable and useful maxim of that branch of the common law which has acquired the name of equity the gain which the law in its tenderness thus bestows on the defaulter is an encouragement a reward which it holds out for breach of faith for iniquity for indolence for negligence the loss which it thus throws upon the forbearing lender is a punishment which it inflicts on him for his forbearance the power which it gives him of avoiding that loss by prosecuting the borrower upon the instant of failure is thus converted into a reward which it holds out to him for his hardheartedness and rigour man is not quite so good as it were to be wished he were but he would be bad indeed were he bad on all the occasions where the law as far as depends on her has made it his interest so to be it may be impossible say you—it often is impossible for the borrower to pay the interest at the day—and you say truly what is the inference that the creditor should not have it in his power to ruin the debtor for not paying at the day and that he should receive a compensation for the loss occasioned by such failure he has it in his power to ruin him and he has it not in his power to obtain such compensation the judge were it possible for an arrested debtor to find his way into a judges chamber instead of a spunginghouse might award a proper respite suited to the circumstances of the parties it is not possible but a respite is purchased proper or not proper perhaps at ten times perhaps at a hundred times the expense of compound interest by putting in bail and fighting the creditor through all the windings of mischievous and unnecessary delay of the satisfaction due either for the original failure or for the subsequent vexation by which it has been aggravated no part is ever received by the injured creditor but the instruments of the law receive perhaps at his expense perhaps at the debtors perhaps ten times perhaps a hundred times the amount of that satisfaction such is the result of this tenderness of the law it is in consequence of such tenderness that on so many occasions a man though ever so able would find himself a loser by paying his just debts—those very debts of which the law has recognized the justice the man who obeys the dictates of common honesty—the man who does what the law pretends to bid him is wanting to himself hence your regular and securely profitable writs of error in the house of lords—hence your random and vindictive costs of one hundred pounds and two hundred pounds now and then given in that house it is natural and it is something    to find in a company of lords a zeal for justice it is not natural to find in such a company a disposition to bend down to the toil of calculation jeremy bentham russia adam smith letter xii maintenance and champerty having in the preceding letters had occasion to lay down and as i flatter myself to make good the general principle that no man of ripe years and of sound mind ought out of lovingkindness to him to be hindered from making such bargain in the way of obtaining money as acting with his eyes open he deems conducive to his interest i will take your leave for pushing it a little farther and extending the application of it to another class of regulations still less defensible i mean the antique laws against what are called maintenance and champerty to the head of maintenance i think you refer besides other offences which are not to the present purpose that of purchasing upon any terms any claim which it requires a suit at law or in equity to enforce champerty which is but a particular modification of this sin of maintenance is i think the furnishing a man who has such a claim with regard to a real estate such money as he may have occasion for to carry on such claim upon the terms of receiving a part of the estate in case of success what the penalties are for these offences i do not recollect nor do i think it worth while hunting for them though i have blackstone at my elbow they are at any rate sufficiently severe to answer the purpose the rather as the bargain is made void to illustrate the mischievousness of the laws by which they have been created give me leave to tell you a story which is but too true a one and which happened to fall within my own observation a gentleman of my acquaintance had succeeded during his minority to an estate of about £ 000 ayear i wont say where his guardian concealing from him the value of the estate which circumstances rendered it easy for him to do got a conveyance of it from him during his nonage for a trifle immediately upon the wards coming of age the guardian keeping him still in darkness found means to get the conveyance confirmed—some years afterwards the ward discovered the value of the inheritance he had been throwing away private representations proving as it may be imagined ineffectual he applied to a court of equity the suit was in some forwardness the opinion of the ablest counsel highly encouraging but money there remained none we all know but too well that in spite of the unimpeachable integrity of the bench that branch of justice which is particularly dignified with the name of equity is only for those who can afford to throw away one fortune for the chance of recovering another two persons however were found who between them were content to defray the expense of the ticket for this lottery on condition of receiving half the prize the prospect now became encouraging—when unfortunately one of the adventurers in exploring the recesses of the bottomless pit happened to dig up one of the old statutes against champerty this blew up the whole project however the defendant understanding that somehow or other his antagonist had found support had thought fit in the meantime to propose terms which the plaintiff after his support had thus dropped from under him was very glad to close with hereceived i think it was £ 000 and for that he gave up the estate which was worth about as much yearly together with the arrears which were worth about as much as the estate whether in the barbarous age which gave birth to these barbarous precautions—whether even under the zenith of feudal anarchy such fettering regulations could have had reason on their side is a question of curiosity rather than use my notion is that there never was a time—that there never could have been or can be a time—when the pushing of suitors away from court with one hand while they are beckoned into it with another would not be a policy equally faithless inconsistent and absurd but what everybody must acknowledge is that to the times which called forth these laws and in which alone they could have started up the present are as opposite as light to darkness a mischief in those times it seems but too common though a mischief not to be cured by such laws was that a man would buy a weak claim in hopes that power might convert it into a strong one and that the sword of a baron stalking into court with a rabble of retainers at his heels might strike terror into the eyes of a judge upon the bench at present what cares an english judge for the swords of a hundred barons neither fearing nor hoping hating nor loving the judge of our days is ready with equal phlegm to administer upon all occasions that system whatever it be of justice or injustice which the law has put into his hands a disposition so consonant to duty could not have then been hoped for one more consonant is hardly to be wished wealth has indeed the monopoly of justice against poverty and such monopoly it is the direct tendency and necessary effect of regulations like these to strengthen and confirm but with this monopoly no judge that lives now is at all chargeable the law created this monopoly the law whenever it pleases may dissolve it  0 i will not however so far wander from my subject as to inquire what measure might have been necessary to afford a full relief to the case of that unfortunate gentleman any more than to the cases of so many other gentlemen who might be found as unfortunate as he i will not insist upon so strange and so inconceivable an arrangement as that of the judges seeing both parties face to face in the first instance observing what the facts are in dispute and declaring that as the facts should turn out this way or that way such or such would be his decree at present i confine myself to the removal of such part of the mischief as may arise from the general conceit of keeping men out of difficulties by cutting them off from such means of relief as each mans situation may afford a spunge in this as in so many other cases is the only needful and only availing remedy one stroke of it for the musty laws against maintenance and champerty another for the more recent ones against usury consider for example what would have respectively been the effect of two such strokes in the case of the unfortunate gentleman i have been speaking of by the first if what is called equity has any claim to confidence he would have got even after paying off his champertyusurers £  00 ayear in land and about as much in money instead of getting and that only by an accident £ 000 once told by the other there is no saying to what a degree he might have been benefited may i be allowed to stretch so far in favour of the law as to suppose that so small a sum as £ 00 would have carried him through his suit in the course of about three years i am sensible that may be thought but a short sum and this but a short term for a suit in equity but for the purpose of illustration it may serve as well as a longer suppose he had sought this necessary sum in the way of borrowing and had been so fortunate or as the laws against the sin of usury would style it so unfortunate as to get it at  00 per cent he would then have purchased his £ 000 ayear at the price of half as much once paid viz £ 000 instead of selling it at that price whether if no such laws against usury had been in being he could have got the money even at that rate i will not pretend to say perhaps he might not have got it under ten times that rate perhaps he might have got it at the tenth part of that rate thus far i think we may say that he might and probably would have been the better for the repeal of those laws but thus far we must say that it is impossible he should have been the worse the terms upon which he met with adventurers willing to relieve him though they come not within that scanty field which the law in the narrowness of its views calls usury do in the present case at twenty years purchase of the £ 000 ayear he was content to have sacrificed for such assistance amount in effect to  000 per cent whether it was likely that any man who was disposed to venture his money at all upon such a chance would have thought of insisting upon such a rate of interest i will leave you to imagine but thus much may be said with confidence because the fact demonstrates it that at a rate not exceeding this the sum would actually have been supplied whatever becomes then of the laws against maintenance and champerty the example in question when applied to the laws against usury ought i think to be sufficient to convince us that so long as the expense of seeking relief at law stands on its present footing the purpose of seeking that relief will of itself independently of every other afford a sufficient ground for allowing any man or every man to borrow money on any terms on which he can obtain it crichoff in white russia march      jeremy bentham russia adam smith letter xiii to dr smith on projects in arts c sir—i forget what son of controversy it was among the greeks who having put himself to school to a professor of eminence to learn what in those days went by the name of wisdom chose an attack upon his master for the first public specimen of his proficiency this specimen whatever entertainment it might have afforded to the audience afforded it may be supposed no great satisfaction to the master for the thesis was that the pupil owed him nothing for his pains for my part being about to show myself in one respect as ungrateful as the greek it may be a matter of prudence for me to look out for something like candour by way of covering to my ingratitude instead therefore of pretending to owe you nothing i shall begin with acknowledging that as far as your track coincides with mine i should come much nearer the truth were i to say i owed you everything should it be my fortune to gain any advantage over you it must be with weapons which you have taught me to wield and with which you yourself have furnished me for as all the great standards of truth which can be appealed to in this line owe as far as i can understand their establishment to you i can see scarce any other way of convicting you of any error or oversight than by judging you out of your own mouth in the series of letters to which this will form a sequel i had travelled nearly thus far in my researches into the policy of the laws fixing the rate of interest combating such arguments as fancy rather than observation had suggested to my view when on a sudden recollection presented me with your formidable image bestriding the ground over    which i was travelling pretty much at my ease and opposing the shield of your authority to any arguments i could produce it was a reflection mentioned by cicero as affording him some comfort that the employment his talents till that time had met with had been chiefly on the defending side how little soever blest on any occasion with any portion of his eloquence i may on the present occasion however indulge myself with a portion of what constituted his comfort for if i presume to contend with you it is only in defence of what i look upon as not only an innocent but a most meritorious race of men who are so unfortunate as to have fallen under the rod of your displeasure i mean projectors under which invidious name i understand you to comprehend in particular all such persons as in the pursuit of wealth strike out into any new channel and more especially into any channel of invention it is with the professed view of checking or rather of crushing these adventurous spirits whom you rank with prodigals that you approve of the laws which limit the rate of interest grounding yourself on the tendency they appear to you to have to keep the capital of the country out of two such different sets of hands the passage i am speaking of is in the fourth chapter of your second book volume the second of the  vo edition of      the legal rate you say it is to be observed though it ought to be somewhat above ought not to be much above the lowest market rate if the legal rate of interest in great britain for example was fixed so high as eight or ten per cent the greater part of the money which was to be lent would be lent to prodigals and projectors who alone would be willing to give the high interest sober people who will give for the use of money no more than a part of what they are likely to make by the use of it would not venture into the competition a great part of the capital of the country would thus be kept out of the hands which were most likely to make a profitable and advantageous use of it and thrown into those which were most likely to waste and destroy it where the legal interest on the contrary is fixed but a very little above the lowest market rate sober people are universally preferred as borrowers to prodigals and projectors the person who lends money gets nearly as much interest from the former as he dares to take from the latter and his money is much safer in the hands of the one set of people than in those of the other a great part of the capital of the country is thus thrown into the hands in which it is most likely to be employed with advantage it happens fortunately for the side you appear to have taken and as unfortunately for mine that the appellative which the custom of the language has authorized you and which the poverty and perversity of the language has in a manner forced you to make use of is one which along with the idea of the sort of persons in question conveys the idea of reprobation as indiscriminately and deservedly applied to them with what justice or consistency or by the influence of what causes this stamp of indiscriminate reprobation has been thus affixed it is not immediately necessary to inquire but that it does stand thus affixed you and everybody else i imagine will be ready enough to allow this being the case the question stands already decided in the first instance at least if not irrevocably in the judgments of all those who unable or unwilling to be at the pains of analyzing their ideas suffer their minds to be led captive by the tyranny of sounds that is i doubt of by far the greater proportion of those whom we are likely to have to judge us in the conceptions of all such persons to ask whether it be fit to restrain projects and projectors will be as much as to ask whether it be fit to restrain rashness and folly and absurdity and knavery and waste of prodigals i shall say no more at present i have already stated my reasons for thinking that it is not among them that we are to look for the natural customers for money at high rates of interest as far as those reasons are conclusive it will follow that of the two sorts of men you mention as proper objects of the burthen of these restraints—prodigals and projectors—that burthen falls exclusively on the latter as to these what your definition is of projectors and what description of persons you meant to include under the censure conveyed by that name might be material for the purpose of judging of the propriety of that censure but makes no difference in judging of the propriety of the law which that censure is employed to justify whether you yourself were the several classes of persons made to pass before you in review would be disposed to pick out this or that class or this and that individual in order to exempt them from such censure is what for that purpose we have no need to inquire the law it is certain makes no such distinctions it falls with equal weight and with all its weight upon all those persons without distinction to whom the term projectors in the most unpartial and extensive signification of which it is capable can be applied it falls at any rate to repeat some of the words of my former definition upon all such persons as in the pursuit of wealth or even of any other object endeavour by the assistance of wealth to strike into any channel of invention it falls upon all such persons as in the cultivation of any of those arts which have been by    way of eminence termed useful direct their endeavours to any of those departments in which their utility shines most conspicuous and indubitable upon all such persons as in the line of any of their pursuits aim at anything that can be called improvement whether it consist in the production of any new article adapted to mans use or in the meliorating the quality or diminishing the expense of any of those which are already known to us it falls in short upon every application of the human powers in which ingenuity stands in need of wealth for its assistant high and extraordinary rates of interest how little soever adapted to the situation of the prodigal are certainly as you very justly observe particularly adapted to the situation of the projector—not however to that of the imprudent projector only noreven of his case more than anothers but to that of the prudent and wellgrounded projector if the existence of such a being were to be supposed whatever be the prudence or other qualities of the project—in whatever circumstance the novelty of it may lie—it has this circumstance against it viz that it is new but the rates of interest the highest rates allowed are as you expressly say they are and as you would have them to be adjusted to the situation which the sort of trader is in whose trade runs in the old channels and to the best security which such channels can afford but in the nature of things no new trade—no trade carried on in any new channel can afford a security equal to that which may be afforded by a trade carried on in any of the old ones in whatever light the matter might appear to perfect intelligence—in the eye of every prudent person exerting the best powers of judging which the fallible condition of the human faculties affords the novelty of any commercial adventure will oppose a chance of ill success superadded to every one which could attend the same or any other adventure already tried and proved to be profitable by experience the limitation of the profit that is to be made by lending money to persons embarked in trade will render the moneyed man more anxious you may say about the goodness of his security and accordingly more anxious to satisfy himself respecting the prudence of a project in the carrying on of which the money is to be employed than he would be otherwise and in this way it may be thought that these laws have a tendency to pick out the good projects from the bad and favour the former at the expense of the latter the first of these positions i admit but i can never admit the consequence to follow a prudent man—i mean nothing more than a man of ordinary prudence—a prudent man acting under the sole governance of prudential motives i still say will not in these circumstances pick out the good projects from the bad for he will not meddle with projects at all he will pick out old established trades from all sorts of projects good and bad for with a new project be it ever so promising he never will have anything to do by every man that has money five per cent or whatever be the highest legal rate is at all times and always will be to be had upon the very best security that the best and most prosperous oldestablished trade can afford traders in general i believe it is commonly understood are well enough inclined to enlarge their capital as far as all the money they can borrow at the highest legal rate while that rate is so low as five per cent will enlarge it how it is possible therefore for a project be it ever so promising to afford to a lender at any such rate of interest terms equally advantageous upon the whole with those he might be sure of obtaining from an oldestablished business is more than i can conceive loans of money may certainly chance now and then to find their way into the pockets of projectors as well as of other men but when this happens it must be through incautiousness or friendship or the expectation of some collateral benefit and not through any idea of the advantageousness of the transaction in the light of a pecuniary bargain i should not expect to see it alleged that there is anything that should render the number of wellgrounded projects in comparison of the illgrounded less in time future than it has been in time past i am sure at least that i know of no reasons why it should be so though i know of some reasons which i shall beg leave to submit to you by and by which appear to me pretty good ones why the advantage should be on the side of futurity but unless the stock of wellgrounded projects is already spent and the whole stock of illgrounded projects that ever were possible are to be looked for exclusively in the time to come the censure you have passed on projectors measuring still the extent of it by that of the operation of the laws in the defence of which it is employed looks as far backward as forward it condemns as rash and illgrounded all those projects by which our species have been successively advanced from that state in which acorns were their food and raw hides their clothing to the state in which it stands at present for think sir let me beg of you whether whatever is now the routine of trade was not at its commencement project—whether whatever is now establishment was not at one time innovation how it is that the tribe of wellgrounded projects and of prudent projectors if by this time i may have your leave for applying this epithet to some at least among the projectors    of time past have managed to struggle through the obstacles which the laws in question have been holding in their way it is neither easy to know nor necessary to inquire manifest enough i think it must be by this time that difficulties and those not inconsiderable ones those laws must have been holding up in the way of projects of all sorts of improvement if i may say so in every line so long as they have had existence reasonable therefore it must be to conclude that had it not been for these discouragements projects of all sorts—wellgrounded and successful ones as well as others would have been more numerous than they have been and that accordingly on the other hand as soon if ever as these discouragements shall be removed projects of all sorts and among the rest wellgrounded and successful ones will be more numerous than they would otherwise have been in short that as without these discouragements the progress of mankind in the career of prosperity would have been greater than it has been under them in time past so were they to be removed it would be at least proportionably greater in time future that i had done you no injustice in assigning to your idea of projectors so great a latitude and that the unfavourable opinion you have professed to entertain of them is not confined to the above passage might be made i think pretty apparent if it be material by another passage in the tenth chapter of your first book the establishment of any new manufacture of any new branch of commerce or of any new practice in agriculture all these you comprehend by name under the list of projects of every one of them you observe that it is a speculation from which the projector promises himself extraordinary profits these profits you add are sometimes very great and sometimes more frequently perhaps they are quite otherwise but in general they bear no regular proportion to those of other old trades in the neighbourhood if the project succeeds they are commonly at first very high when the trade or practice becomes thoroughly established and well known the competition reduces them to the level of other trades but on this head i forbear to insist nor should i have taken this liberty of giving you back your own words but in the hope of seeing some alteration made in them in your next edition should i be fortunate enough to find my sentiments confirmed by yours in other respects what is essential to the public is what the error is in the sentiments entertained not who it is that entertains them i know not whether the observations which i have been troubling you with will be thought to need or whether they will be thought to receive any additional support from those comfortable positions of which you have made such good and such frequent use concerning the constant tendency of mankind to get forward in the career of prosperity—the prevalence of prudence over imprudence in the sum of private conduct at least—and the superior fitness of individuals for managing their own pecuniary concerns of which they know the particulars and the circumstances in comparison of the legislator who can have no such knowledge i will make the experiment for so long as i have the mortification to see you on the opposite side i can never think the ground i have taken strong enough while anything remains that appears capable of rendering it still stronger with regard to misconduct the number of prudent and successful undertakings you observe† is everywhere much greater than that of injudicious and unsuccessful ones after all our complaints of the frequency of bankruptcies the unhappy men who fall into this misfortune make but a very small part of the whole number engaged in trade and all other sorts of business not much more perhaps than one in a thousand tis in support of this position that you appeal to history for the constant and uninterrupted progress of mankind in our island at least in the career of prosperity calling upon any one who should entertain a doubt of the fact to divide the history into any number of periods from the time of cæsars visit down to the present proposing for instance the respective eras of the restoration the accession of elizabeth that of henry vii the norman conquest and the heptarchy and putting it to the sceptic to find out if he can among all these periods any one at which the condition of the country was not more prosperous than at the period immediately preceding it spite of so many wars and fires and plagues and all other public calamities with which it has been at different times afflicted whether by the hand of god or by the misconduct of the sovereign no very easy task i believe the fact is too manifest for the most jaundiced eye to escape seeing it but what and whom are we to thank for it but projects and projectors no i think i hear you saying i will not thank projectors for it i will rather thank the laws which by fixing the rates of interest have been exercising their vigilance in repressing the temerity of projectors and preventing their imprudence from making those defalcations from the sum of national prosperity which it would not have failed to make had it been left free if during all these periods that adventurous race of men had    been left at liberty by the laws to give full scope to their rash enterprises the increase of national prosperity during these periods might have afforded some ground for regarding them in a more favourable point of view but the fact is that their activity has had these laws to check it without which checks you must give me leave to suppose that the current of prosperity if not totally stopped or turned the other way would at any rate have been more or less retarded here then you conclude lies the difference between us what you look upon as the cause of the increase about which we are both agreed i look upon as an obstacle to it and what you look upon as the obstacle i look upon as the cause instead of starting this as a sort of plea that might be urged by you i ought perhaps rather to have mentioned it as what might be urged by some people in your place for as i do not imagine your penetration would suffer you to rest satisfied with it still less can i suppose that if you were not your candour would allow you to make use of it as if you were to prevent your resting satisfied with it the following considerations would i think be sufficient in the first place of the seven periods which you have pitched upon as so many stages for the eye to rest at in viewing the progress of prosperity it is only during the three last that the country has had the benefit if such we are to call it of these laws for it is to the reign of henry viii that we owe the first of them here a multitude of questions might be started—whether the curbing of projectors formed any part of the design of that first statute or whether the views of it were not wholly confined to the reducing the gains of that obnoxious and envied class of men the moneylenders—whether projectors have been most abundant before that statute or since that statute—and whether the nation has suffered as you might say—benefited as i should say—most by them upon the whole during the former period or the latter all these discussions and many more that might be started i decline engaging in as more likely to retard than to forward our coming to any agreement concerning the main question in the next place i must here take the liberty of referring you to the proof which i think i have already given of the proposition that the restraints in question could never have had the effect in any degree of lessening the proportion of bad projects to good ones but only of diminishing as far as their influence may have extended the total number of projects good and bad together whatever therefore was the general tendency of the projecting spirit previously to the first of these laws such it must have remained ever since for any effect which they could have had in purifying and correcting it but what may appear more satisfactory perhaps than both the above considerations and may afford us the best help towards extricating ourselves from the perplexity which the plea i have been combating and which i thought it necessary to bring to view as the best that could be urged seems much better calculated to plunge us into than bring us out of is the consideration of the small effect which the greatest waste that can be conceived to have been made within any compass of time by injudicious projects can have had on the sum of prosperity even in the estimation of those whose opinion is most unfavourable to projectors in comparison of the effect which within the same compass of time must have been produced by prodigality of the two causes and only two causes which you mention as contributing to retard the accumulation of national wealth as far as the conduct of individuals is concerned projecting as i observed before is the one and prodigality is the other but the detriment which society can receive even from the concurrent efficacy of both these causes you represent on several occasions as inconsiderable and if i do not misapprehend you too inconsiderable either to need or to warrant the interposition of government to oppose it be this as it may with regard to projecting and prodigality taken together—with regard to prodigality at least i am certain i do not misapprehend you on this subject you ride triumphant and chastise the impertinence and presumption of kings and ministers with a tone of authority which it required a courage like yours to venture upon and a genius like yours to warrant a man to assume after drawing the parallel between private thrift and public profusion—it is you conclude the highest impertinence and presumption therefore in kings and ministers to pretend to watch over the economy of private people and to restrain their expense either by sumptuary laws or by prohibiting the importation of foreign luxuries they are themselves always and without exception the greatest spendthrifts in the society let them look well after their own expense and they may safely trust private people with theirs if their own extravagance does not ruin the state that of their subjects never will that the employing the expedients you mention for restraining prodigality is indeed generally perhaps even without exception improper and in many cases even ridiculous i agree with you nor will i here step aside    from my subject to defend from that imputation another mode suggested in a former part of these papers but however presumptuous and impertinent it may be for the sovereign to attempt in any way to check by legal restraints the prodigality of individuals to attempt to check their bad management by such restraints seems abundantly more so to err in the way of prodigality is the lot—though as you well observe not of many men in comparison of the whole mass of mankind—yet at least of any man the stuff fit to make a prodigal of is to be found in every alehouse and under every hedge but even to err in the way of projecting is the lot only of the privileged few prodigality though not so common as to make any very material drain from the general mass of wealth is however too common to be regarded as a mark of distinction or as a singularity but the stepping aside from any of the beaten paths of traffic is regarded as a singularity—as serving to distinguish a man from other men even where it requires no genius no peculiarity of talent—as where it consists in nothing more than the finding out a new market to buy or sell in it requires however at least a degree of courage which is not to be found in the common herd of men what shall we say of it where in addition to the vulgar quality of courage it requires the rare endowment of genius as in the instance of all those successive enterprises by which arts and manufactures have been brought from their original nothing to their present splendour think how small a part of the community these must make in comparison of the race of prodigals—of that very race which were it only on account of the smallness of its number would appear too inconsiderable to you to deserve attention yet prodigality is essentially and necessarily hurtful as far as it goes to the opulence of the state projecting is so only by accident every prodigal without exception impairs—by the very supposition impairs if he does not annihilate—his fortune but it certainly is not every projector that impairs his it is not every projector that would have done so had there been none of those wise laws to hinder him for the fabric of national opulence—that fabric of which you proclaim with so generous an exultation the continual increase—that fabric in every apartment of which innumerable as they are it required the reprobated hand of a projector to lay the first stone has required some hands at least to be employed and successfully employed when in comparison of the number of prodigals which is too inconsiderable to deserve notice the number of projectors of all kinds is so much more inconsiderable—and when from this inconsiderable number must be deducted the not inconsiderable proportion of successful projectors—and from this remainder again all those who can carry on their projects without need of borrowing—think whether it be possible that this last remainder could afford a multitude the reducing of which would be an object deserving the interposition of government by its magnitude even taking for granted that it were an object proper in its nature if it be still a question whether it be worth while for government by its reason to attempt to controul the conduct of men visibly and undeniably under the dominion of passion and acting under that dominion contrary to the dictates of their own reason—in short to effect what is acknowledged to be their better judgment against what everybody even themselves would acknowledge to be their worse—is it endurable that the legislator should by violence substitute his own pretended reason the result of a momentary and scornful glance the offspring of wantonness and arrogance much rather than of social anxiety and study in the place of the humble reason of individuals binding itself down with all its force to that very object which he pretends to have in view nor let it be forgotten that on the side of the individual in this strange competition there is the most perfect and minute know ledge and information which interest—the whole interest of a mans reputation and fortune can insure on the side of the legislator the most perfect ignorance all that he knows all that he can know is that the enterprise is a project which merely because it is susceptible of that obnoxious name he looks upon as a sort of cock for him in childish wantonness to shie at shall the blind lead the blind is a question that has been put of old to indicate the height of folly but what then shall we say of him who being necessarily blind insists on leading in paths he never trode in those who can see it must be by some distinction too fine for my conception if you clear yourself from the having taken on another occasion but on the very point in question the side on which it would be my ambition to see you fix— what is the species of domestic industry which his capital can employ and of which the produce is likely to be of the greatest value every individual you say it is evident can in his local situation judge much better than any statesman or lawgiver can do for him the statesman who should attempt to direct private people in what manner they ought to employ their capitals would not only load himself with a most unnecessary attention but assume an authority which could safely be trusted not only to no single person but to no council or senate whatsoever    and which would nowhere be so dangerous as in the hands of a man who had folly and presumption enough to fancy himself fit to exercise it to give the monopoly of the home market to the produce of domestic industry in any particular art or manufacture is in some measure to direct private people in what manner they ought to employ their capitals and must in almost all cases be either a useless or a hurtful regulation—thus far you and i add—to limit the legal interest to a rate at which the carriers on of the oldest and bestestablished and least hazardous trades are always glad to borrow is to give the monopoly of the moneymarket to those traders as against the projectors of newimagined trades not one of which but were it only from the circumstance of its novelty must as i have already observed appear more hazardous than the old these in comparison are but inconclusive topics i touched upon them merely as affording what appeared to me the only shadow of a plea that could be brought in defence of the policy i am contending against i come back therefore to my first ground and beg you once more to consider whether of all that host of manufactures which we both exult in as the causes and ingredients of national prosperity there be a single one that could have existed at first but in the shape of a project but if a regulation the tendency and effect of which is merely to check projects in as far as they are projects without any sort of tendency as i have shown to weed out the bad ones is defensible in its present state of imperfect efficacy it should not only have been defensible but much more worthy of our approbation could the efficacy of it have been so far strengthened and completed as to have opposed from the beginning an unsurmountable bar to all sorts of projects whatsoever—that is to say if stretching forth its hand over the first rudiments of society it had confined us from the beginning to mud for our habitations to skins for our clothing and to acorns for our food i hope you may by this time be disposed to allow me that we have not been ill served by the projects of time past i have already intimated that i could not see any reason why we should apprehend our being worse served by the projects of time future i will now venture to add that i think i do see reason why we should expect to be still better and better served by these projects than by those i mean better upon the whole in virtue of the reduction which experience if experience be worth anything should make in the proportion of the number of the illgrounded and unsuccessful to that of the wellgrounded and successful ones the career of art the great road which receives the footsteps of projectors may be considered as a vast and perhaps unbounded plain bestrewed with gulphs such as curtius was swallowed up in each requires a human victim to fall into it ere it can close but when it once closes it closes to open no more and so much of the path is safe to those who follow if the want of perfect information of former miscarriages renders the reality of human life less happy than this picture still the similitude must be acknowledged and we see at once the only plain and effectual method for bringing that similitude still nearer and nearer to perfection i mean the framing the history of the projects of time past and what may be executed in much greater perfection were but a finger held up by the hand of government the making provision for recording and collecting and publishing as they are brought forth the race of those with which the womb of futurity is still pregnant but to pursue this idea the execution of which is not within my competence would lead me too far from the purpose comfortable it is to reflect that this state of continuallyimproving security is the natural state not only of the road to opulence but of every other track of human life in the war which industry and ingenuity maintain with fortune past ages of ignorance and barbarism form the forlorn hope which has been detached in advance and made a sacrifice of for the sake of future the golden age it is but too true is not the lot of the generation in which we live but if it is to be found in any part of the track marked out for human existence it will be found i trust not in any part which is past but in some part which is to come but to return to the laws against usury and their restraining influence on projectors i have made it i hope pretty apparent that these restraints have no power or tendency to pick out bad projects from the good is it worth while to add which i think i may do with some truth that the tendency of them is rather to pick the good out from the bad thus much at least may be said and it comes to the same thing that there is one case in which be the project what it may they may have the effect of checking it and another in which they can have no such effect and that the first has for its accompaniment and that a necessary one a circumstance which has a strong tendency to separate and discard every project of the injudicious stamp but which is wanting in the other case i mean in a word the benefit of discussion it is evident enough that upon all such projects whatever be their nature as find funds sufficient to carry them on in the hands of him whose invention gave them birth these laws are perfectly and if by this time you will allow me to say so very happily without    power but for these there has not necessarily been any other judge prior to experience than the inventors own partial affection it is not only not necessary that they should have had but it is natural enough that they should not have had any such judge since in most cases the advantage to be expected from the project depends upon the exclusive property in it and consequently upon the concealment of the principle think on the other hand how different is the lot of that enterprise which depends upon the good opinion of another man that other a man possessed of the wealth which the projector wants and before whom necessity forces him to appear in the character of a suppliant at least happy if in the imagination of his judge he adds not to that degrading character that of a visionary enthusiast or an impostor at any rate there are in this case two wits set to sift into the merits of the project for one which was employed upon that same task in the other case and of these two there is one whose prejudices are certainly not most likely to be on the favourable side true it is that in the jumble of occurrences an oversanguine projector may stumble upon a patron as oversanguine as himself and the wishes may bribe the judgment of the one as they did of the other the opposite case however you will allow i think to be by much the more natural whatever a mans wishes may be for the success of an enterprise not yet his own his fears are likely to be still stronger that same pretty generally implanted principle of vanity and selfconceit which disposes most of us to overvalue each of us his own conceptions disposes us in a proportionable degree to undervalue those of other men is it worth adding though it be undeniably true that could it even be proved by ever so uncontrovertible evidence that from the beginning of time to the present day there never was a project that did not terminate in the ruin of its author not even from such a fact as this could the legislator derive any sufficient warrant so much as for wishing to see the spirit of projects in any degree repressed the discouraging motto sic vos non vobis may be matter of serious consideration to the individual but what is it to the legislator what general let him attack with ever so superior an army but knows that hundreds or perhaps thousands must perish at the first onset shall he for that consideration alone lie inactive in his lines every man for himself—but god adds the proverb and it might have added the general and the legislator and all other public servants for us all those sacrifices of individual to general welfare which on so many occasions are made by third persons against mens wills shall the parties themselves be restrained from making when they do it of their own choice to tie men neck and heels and throw them into the gulphs i have been speaking of is altogether out of the question but if at every gulph a curtius stands mounted and caparisoned ready to take the leap is it for the legislator in a fit of oldwomanish tenderness to pull him away laying even public interest out of the question and considering nothing but the feelings of the individuals immediately concerned a legislator would scarcely do so who knew the value of hope the most precious gift of heaven consider sir that it is not with the inventionlottery that great branch of the projectlottery for the sake of which i am defending the whole and must continue so to do until you or somebody else can show me how to defend it on better terms it is not i say with the inventionlottery as with the minelottery the privateeringlottery and so many other lotteries which you speak of and in no instance i think very much to their advantage in these lines success does not as in this arise out of the embers of illsuccess and thence propagate itself by a happy contagion perhaps to all eternity let titius have found a mine it is not the more easy but by so much the less easy for sempronius to find one too let titius have made a capture it is not the more easy but by so much the less easy for sempronius to do the like but let titius have found out a new dye more brilliant or more durable than those in use—let him have invented a new and more convenient machine or a new and more profitable mode of husbandry—a thousand dyers ten thousand mechanics a hundred thousand husbandmen may repeat and multiply his success and then what is it to the public though the fortune of titius or of his usurer should have sunk under the experiment birmingham and sheffield are pitched upon by you as examples the one of a projecting town the other of an unprojecting one can you forgive my saying i rather wonder that this comparison of your own choosing did not suggest some suspicions of the justice of the conceptions you had taken up to the disadvantage of projectors sheffield is an old oak birmingham but a mushroom what if we should find the mushroom still vaster and more vigorous than the oak not but the one as well as the other at what time soever planted must equally have been planted by projectors for though tubal cain himself were to be brought post from armenia to plant sheffield tubal cain himself was as arrant a projector in his day as ever sir thomas lombe was or bishop blaise but birmingham it seems claims in common parlance the title of a projecting town to the exclusion of the    other because being but of yesterday the spirit of project smells fresher and stronger there than elsewhere when the odious sound of the word projector no longer tingles in your ears the race of men thus stigmatized do not always find you their enemy projects even under the name of dangerous and expensive experiments are represented as not unfit to be encouraged even though monopoly be the means and the monopoly is defended in that instance by its similarity to other instances in which the like means are employed to the like purpose when a company of merchants undertake at their own risk and expense to establish a new trade with some remote and barbarous nation it may not be unreasonable you observe to incorporate them into a jointstock company and to grant them in case of their success a monopoly of the trade for a certain number of years it is the easiest and most natural way in which the state can recompense them for hazarding a dangerous and expensive experiment of which the public is afterwards to reap the benefit a temporary monopoly of this kind may be vindicated upon the same principles upon which a like monopoly of a new machine is granted to its inventor and that of a new book to its author private respect must not stop me from embracing this occasion of giving a warning which is so much needed by mankind if so original and independent a spirit has not been always able to save itself from being drawn aside by the fascination of sounds into the paths of vulgar prejudice how strict a watch ought not men of common mould to set over their judgments to save themselves from being led astray by similar delusions i have sometimes been tempted to think that were it in the power of laws to put words under proscription as it is to put men the cause of inventive industry might perhaps derive scarcely less assistance from a bill of attainder against the words project and projectors than it has derived from the act authorizing the grant of patents i should add however for a time for even then the envy and vanity and wounded pride of the uningenious herd would sooner or later infuse their venom into some other word and set it up as a new tyrant to hover like its predecessor over the birth of infant genius and crush it in its cradle will not you accuse me of pushing malice beyond all bounds if i bring down against you so numerous and respectable a body of men as the members of the society for the encouragement of arts i do not must not care for you command too much respect to have any claim to mercy at least you will not accuse me of spiriting up against you barbarian enemies and devoting you to the vengeance of cherokees and chicasaws of that popular institution the very professed and capital object is the encouragement of projects and the propagating of that obnoxious breed the crushing of which you commend as a fit exercise for the arm of power but if it be right to crush the acting malefactors it would be downright inconsistency not to crush at the same time or rather not to begin with crushing these their hirers and abettors thank then their inadvertence or their generosity or their prudence if their beadle has not yet received orders to burn in ceremony as a libel on the society a book that does honour to the age after having had the boldness to accuse so great a master of having fallen unawares into an error may i take the still farther liberty of setting conjecture to work to account for it scarce any man perhaps no man can push the work of creation in any line to such a pitch of completeness as to have gone through the task of examining with his own eyes into the grounds of every position without exception which he has had occasion to employ you heard the public voice strengthened by that of law proclaiming all round you that usury was a sad thing and usurers a wicked and pernicious set of men you heard from one at least of those quarters that projectors were either a foolish and contemptible race or a knavish and destructive one hurried away by the throng and taking very naturally for granted that what everybody said must have some ground for it you have joined the cry and added your suffrage to the rest possibly too among the crowd of projectors which the lottery of occurrences happened to present to your observation the prejudicial sort may have borne such a proportion to the beneficial or shown themselves in so much stronger colours as to have given the popular notion a firmer hold in your judgment than it would have had had the contrary proportion happened to present itself to your notice to allow no more weight to examples that fall close under our eyes than to those which have fallen at ever so great a distance—to suffer the judgment on no occasion to indulge itself in the licence of a too hasty and extensive generalization—not to give any proposition footing there till after all such defalcations have been made as are necessary to reduce it within the limits of rigid truth—these are laws the complete observance whereof forms the ultimate and hitherto perhaps for ever ideal term of human wisdom you have defended against unmerited obloquy two classes of men—the one innocent at least the other highly useful the spreaders of english arts in foreign climes and those whose industry exerts itself in distributing that necessary commodity which is called by    the way of eminence the staff of life may i flatter myself with having succeeded at last in my endeavours to recommend to the same powerful protection two other highly useful and equally persecuted sets of men—usurers and projectors yes i will for the moment at least indulge so flattering an idea and in pursuance of it leaving usurers for whom i have said enough already i will consider myself as joined now with you in the same commission and thinking with you of the best means of relieving the projector from the load of discouragement laid on him by these laws in so far as the pressure of them falls particularly upon him in my own view of the matter indeed no temperament no middle course is either necessary or proper the only perfectly effectual is the only perfectly proper remedy—a spunge but as nothing is more common with mankind than to give opposite receptions to conclusions flowing with equal necessity from the same principle let us accommodate our views to that contingency according to this idea the object as far as confined to the present case should be to provide in favour of projectors only a dispensation from the rigour of the antiusurious laws—such for instance as is enjoyed by persons engaged in the carrying trade in virtue of the indulgence given to loans made on the footing of respondentia or bottomry as to abuse i see not why the danger of it should be greater in this case than in those whether a sum of money be embarked or not embarked in such or such a new manufacture on land should not in its own nature be a fact much more difficult to ascertain than whether it be embarked or not embarked in such or such a trading adventure by sea and in the one case as in the other the payment of the interest as well as the repayment of the principal might be made to depend upon the success of the adventure to confine the indulgence to new undertakings the having obtained a patent for some invention and the continuance of the term of the patent might be made conditions of the allowance given to the bargain to this might be added affidavits expressive of the intended application and bonds with sureties conditioned for the performance of the intention so declared to

members of the board waste of time in opening their understandings clenched perhaps by ignorance at any rate by disdain and selfsufficiency and vanity and pride the favour for pride will make it a

themselves engaged in this impertinent inquiry waste of somebodys money in paying them for this waste of time all these may be necessary evils where the money to be bestowed is public money how idle

the committees of the society of arts there you have a body of men ready trained in the conduct of inquiries which resemble that in question in every circumstance but that which renders it ridiculous

crichoff in white russia march       0    a manual of political economy now first edited from the mss of jeremy bentham       manual of political economy chapter i introduction political economy is at once a science and an art the value of the science has for its efficient cause and measure its subserviency to the art† according to the principle of utility in every branch of the art of legislation the object or end in view should be the production of the maximum of happiness in a given time in the community in question in the instance of this branch of the art the object or end in view should be the production of that maximum of happiness in so far as this more general end is promoted by the production of the maximum of wealth and the maximum of population the practical questions therefore are—how far the measures respectively suggested by these two branches of the common end agree—how far they differ and which requires the preference—how far the end in view is best promoted by individuals acting for themselves and in what cases these ends may be best promoted by the hands of government those cases in which and those measures or operations by which the end is promoted by individuals acting for themselves and without any special interference exercised with this special view on the part of government beyond the distribution made and maintained and the protection afforded by the civil and penal branches of the law may be said to arise sponte acta what the legislator and the minister of the interior have it in their power to do towards increase either of wealth or population is as nothing in comparison with what is done of course and without thinking of it by the judge and his assistant the minister of police the cases in which and the measures by which the common end may be promoted by the hands of government may be termed agenda with the view of causing an increase to take place in the mass of national wealth or with a view to increase of the means either of subsistence or enjoyment without some special reason the general rule is that nothing ought to be done or attempted by government the motto or watchword of government on these occasions ought to be—be quiet for this quietism there are two main reasons—  generally speaking any interference for this purpose on the part of government is needless the wealth of the whole community is composed of the wealth of the several individuals belonging to it taken together but to increase his particular portion is generally speaking among the constant objects of each individuals exertions and care generally speaking there is no one who knows what is for your interest so well as yourself—no one who is disposed with so much ardour and constancy to pursue it   generally speaking it is moreover likely to be pernicious viz by being unconducive or even obstructive with reference to the attainment of the end in view each individual bestowing more time and attention upon the means of preserving and increasing his portion of wealth than is or can be bestowed by government is likely to take a more effectual course than what in his instance and on his behalf would be taken by government it is moreover universally and constantly pernicious in another way by the restraint or constraint imposed on the free agency of the individual pain is the general concomitant of the sense of such restraint wherever it is experienced without being productive of such coercion and thereby of such pain—in a way more or less direct—more or less perceptible with this or any other view the interposition of government can hardly take place if the coercion be not applied to the very individual whose conduct is endeavoured to be made immediately subservient to this purpose it is at any rate applied to others—indeed to the whole community taken together in coercive measures so called it is only to the individual that the coercion is applied in the case of measures of encouragement    the field of coercion is vastly more extensive encouragements are grants of money or moneys worth applied in some shape or other to this purpose but for this any more than any other purpose money is not raised but by taxes and taxes are the produce of coercive laws applied to the most coercive purpose this would not be the less true though the individual pieces of money thus applied happened to come from a source which had not been fed by any such means in all communities by far the greatest share of the money disposed of by government being supplied by taxes whether this or that particular portion of money so applied be supplied from that particular source makes no sort of difference to estimate the good expected from the application of any particular mass of government money compare it always with the mischief produced by the extraction of an equal sum of money by the most burthensome species of tax since by forbearing to make application of that sum of money you might forbear levying the amount of that same sum of money by that tax and thereby forbear imposing the mass of burthen that results from it it would however be a gross error and an extremely mischievous one to refer to the defalcation thus resulting from the mass of liberty or free agency as affording a conclusive objection against the interposition of the law for this or any other purpose every law which does not consist in the repeal total or partial of a coercive law is itself a coercive law to reprobate as a mischief resulting from this or that law a property which is of the very essence of all law is to betray a degree of blindness and ignorance one should think hardly possible on the part of a mind accustomed to the contemplation of any branch of the system of laws—a total unacquaintance with what may be called the logic of the laws yet so imperfect is the state of legal knowledge—marks of this perfectly surprising as it will one day be as well as much to be lamented ignorance are to be found among the most experienced pens not to mention the most loquacious tongues power knowledge or intelligence and inclination where these requisites concur on the part of him on whom the production of the desirable effect in question depends it is produced when any one of them is wanting it is not produced when these requisites exist already in perfection with reference to the production of any effect operating in addition to the mass of wealth on the part of the members of the community taken respectively in their individual capacities it will be produced without the interference of the government and as this interference is never a matter of pure indifference—never otherwise than hurtful when it is not beneficial these cases are among the cases in which that interference is not desirable in the cases where any one of these requisites is deficient insomuch that for want of it the effect cannot be produced—in such case the interposition of government may be desirable or not according to the state of the account—according as the inconveniences attached to the measures in which the interposition of government consists preponderate or fail of preponderating over the advantage attached to the effect which it is proposed should be produced if the effect fail of being produced without the interposition of government for want of any one or more of these requisites it is by the supply of the requisite or requisites so wanting that the action of government may display itself thence on every such occasion these questions present themselves for consideration—   whether the effect in question fail of being produced in the degree in which it might be produced   to the want of what requisite or requisites such failure is to be ascribed   what are the means by which such failure may be supplied by government at the least expense   when reduced to its least dimensions is the expense necessary for the purpose in question such that the advantage will preponderate over the expense in a general view of the three requisites inclination appears least apt to be deficient on the part of individuals the general mass of national wealth is composed of the particular masses appertaining to individuals on the part of the individual there is seldom any deficiency in respect of inclination to make addition to the amount of that particular mass of wealth which has fallen to his share it is in respect to the two other requisites power and intelligence that deficiency is much more apt to take place to these deficiencies the abilities of government are happily adapted inclination it could not give—it has not power to give it in the great mass of cases—not by punishments on account of the expensiveness and in such cases the comparative inefficacy of such means—not by reward for want of a sufficient stock of that scarce and valuable matter which is not to be extracted but by taxes—that is by punishments    intelligence and power may be administered by government at a much cheaper rate a mite of reward skilfully applied is often sufficient to produce an immensity of intelligence in many instances it frequently requires nothing more than the removal of coercion from one hand to another or even the repeal of it altogether in order to confer the sort and degree of requisite power the operation in either case not being attended in the shape of pain with any perceptible effect the two most extensive descriptions of the cases in which it is necessary or expedient to interfere for the purpose of regulating the exertions of individuals in respect to the increase of wealth are those in which it is necessary to regulate the pursuit of the several objects in view according to the order of their importance—in giving to the matter of wealth that modification which adapts it to the several purposes of subsistence and defence—security in respect of subsistence and security in respect of defence—in preference to that which adapts it to the mere purpose of enjoyment with few exceptions and those not very considerable ones the attainment of the maximum of enjoyment will be most effectually secured by leaving each individual to pursue his own maximum of enjoyment in proportion as he is in possession of the means inclination in this respect will not be wanting on the part of any one power the species of power applicable to this case—viz wealth pecuniary power—could not be given by the hand of government to one without being taken from another so that by such interference there would not be any gain of power upon the whole the gain to be produced in this article by the interposition of government respects principally the head of knowledge there are cases in which for the benefit of the public at large it may be in the power of government to cause this or that portion of knowledge to be produced and diffused which without the demand for it produced by government would either not have been produced or would not have been diffused we have seen above the grounds on which the general rule in this behalf—be quiet—rests whatever measures therefore cannot be justified as exceptions to that rule may be considered as non agenda on the part of government† the art therefore is reduced within a small compass security and freedom are all that industry requires the request which agriculture manufactures and commerce present to governments is modest and reasonable as that which diogenes made to alexander stand out of my sunshine we have no need of favour—we require only a secure and open path chapter ii analytical survey of the field of political economy for the genesis of the matter of wealth—the causes and mode of its production under its several modifications—reference may for the present be made to adam smith who has not left much to do except in the way of method and precision the following are the first steps in an analytical survey of the field of political economy showing how to draw a circle round the subject and how to invent or discover what remains to be invented or discovered in this quarter of the field of human knowledge on the part of the individuals by whom increase of wealth is produced the production of it is either purely spontaneous or with or without design directed to the increase of it either promoted or obstructed by the operations of government the correspondent practical division of acts and operations the effect of which is to exert an influence on the quantity of the national to which may be added the mundane stock of the matter of wealth is—  sponte acta   agenda   nonagenda in the track of political economy as in any other whatever is done towards the attainment of the object must be by creating inclination or by bestowing power inclination can only be operated upon by inducements as—   by applications of a coercive or obligatory nature—which are either injunctions or prohibitions      by applications of an invitative nature or encouragements—which are either direct or indirect power may to this purpose be distinguished into—  legal   physical   intellectual or knowledge   legal power may be conferred—  by forbearing to impose on the party proposed to be assisted coercion of any kind   by coercing others in such a manner as to prevent them from obstructing his making use of the power of the preceding kind   by compelling them to afford him assistance in the two first of these cases power is no more than liberty   physical power is conferred by giving to a party the physical instruments requisite to the attainment of the end proposed—viz money or something that is to be had for money this can only be done by legal power of one or other of the three kinds above mentioned   intellectual power is either—  active power or   knowledge if active power be given by law it can only be in some indirect way through physical and thence through legal power knowledge is either—  of the modes of operating towards the end proposed—viz which are good which bad—which worst and which best or   of matters of fact—which may be conducive to this end either—  by pointing out inducement   by pointing out legal power   by conducing to physical power or to intellectual power—either as leading to knowledge of the modes of operating or to other matters of fact more immediately leading to such knowledge encouragements may be distinguished into—  direct and   indirect direct consist of rewards commonly called in this instance bounties given to him who shall exercise his industry in such or such a way indirect consist in discouragements opposed in the way of others in the view of restraining them from exercising their industry in such or such a way i e in such a way as shall prevent his exercising his in the way desired if discouragements thrown in the way of a answer the purpose of encouragement to b it is because as acting in the track he is thus discouraged from would have tended to discourage b from acting in the track he is meant to be encouraged to act in by diminishing the reward natural or factitious he would have got in some way by acting in it to the head of encouragements may also be added operations the tendency of which is to confer power and in particular physical power such as the giving or lending money or moneys worth to be employed in the shape of a capital towards the carrying on a branch of industry meant to be encouraged in whichever of the above ways aid is applied it must be either—  with a view of increasing the quantity of industry in general or   with a view of increasing the relative quantity of a particular branch of industry the causes of wealth or say rather the matter of wealth are—   final—wellbeing   material—matter considered in respect of its possessing or being capable of possessing value—viz subservency to wellbeing the final cause   efficient—viz motion the modifications of wellbeing ranged in the order of their importance are—   subsistence present   security in respect of defence—viz against the evils to which human nature is exposed particularly from the action of agents exterior to a mans body security in respect of future subsistence   enjoyment—viz mere enjoyment distinct from the maintenance of subsistence and the contemplation of security matter considered with reference to the final cause—wellbeing may be termed such parts of it as by the use made of them become subservient to wellbeing the final cause matter of wealth†    the term matter of wealth is applicable in common to—   articles or instruments of subsistence   instruments of defence   instruments of enjoyment articles of subsistence are either of constant or occasional use articles of constant use are—   articles of nourishment—viz food and drink i e liquid or solid the distinction between which is at their point of nearest approach undeterminable   articles serving for the regulation of temperature and state of the air in respect of moisture these are—either lodging or clothing   articles of occasional use are articles of medicine the evils to which defence bears reference may be considered as having their source in the agency of irrational agents or rational agents defence against evils apprehended from the agency of irrational agents is defence against calamities among rational agents those from whose agency evil is apprehended are either considered as members of the community in question or not in the first case the defence is against delinquency in the other case against hostility a modification of the matter of wealth may be referred to that one of the above three heads to which it is conducive in the greatest degree—for the same article which is principally subservient to one may occasionally be subservient to either or both of the two others enjoyment being in a manner inseparable from the application of articles of subsistence to their use all articles of subsistence are instruments of enjoyment likewise the distinction is therefore not between articles of subsistence and instruments of enjoyment but between articles of subsistence and instruments of mere enjoyment—viz that by their application to use contribute nothing to subsistence any more than to defence† the practice of exchange being established each modification of the matter of wealth to whichsoever of the abovementioned divisions it belongs is in virtue of that practice convertible with more or less facility and certainty into every other‡ the richer a community the better secured it is thereby against hostility and famine a stock of instruments of mere enjoyment presupposes on the part of each individual a preassured stock of the articles of subsistence the stock of articles of subsistence capable of being produced and kept up in a country in any other view than that of exchange has its limits it can never extend much beyond the stock necessary for the subsistence of the inhabitants—the stock of instruments of mere enjoyment is without limit it is only in respect and in virtue of the quantity of the stock of instruments of mere enjoyment that one country can exceed another country in wealth the quantity of wealth is as the quantity of its instruments of enjoyment in cases where two articles of subsistence contributing in an equal degree to that end one contributes in a greater degree to enjoyment as is testified by the greater price given for it it may be considered as possessed of a compound value which by analysis may be resolved as it were into two values    one belonging to it in its capacity of an article of subsistence the other in its capacity of an article of mere enjoyment it is out of the fund for enjoyment that the portion of wealth allotted to defence and the portion if any allotted to security in respect of subsistence must be taken for out of the portion allotted to subsistence none can be spared but though security increase in proportion as opulence increases and inequality be an inseparable accompaniment of opulence security does not increase in proportion as inequality increases take away all the ranks in respect of opulence between the highest and the lowest—the inequality will be increased but the degree of security will be diminished luxury is not only an inseparable accompaniment to opulence but increases in proportion to it as men rise one above another in the scale of opulence the upper one may without excess give into expenses which those below cannot give into without prodigality it is therefore no more desirable that luxury should be repressed than it is that opulence should be repressed—that is that security should be diminished if it were desirable that luxury should be repressed it could be done no otherwise than either by depriving the more opulent classes of a part of their property in this view or coercing them in the use of it it would be less unreasonable to restrain prodigality wherever it is to be found than to restrain the highest imaginable pitch of luxury on the part of those whose expense does not exceed their income the mass of that matter which is the material cause of wealth has for its sources—   land—i e dry land uncovered with water   water—i e land covered with water the matter of wealth considered in respect of its modifications may be distinguished in the first place into matter in an unimproved state—in the state in which it comes out of the hands of nature and matter in an improved state i e modified by human labour for the purpose of its being adapted to whatever uses it may be designed for any distinguishable portion of the matter of wealth may be either an article of immediate or of subservient use it is an article of immediate use when it is itself applicable to any one of the three abovementioned ends viz subsistence security or enjoyment it is an article of subservient use when though it contribute to some one or more of those ends it does so not by any immediate application of its powers to any one of the above three ends but by the instrumentality of some other article which is of immediate use and which it renders or contributes or tends to render subservient to that use the operations by which an increase of the matter of wealth is produced or promoted may be enumerated under the following principal heads viz—   discovery—viz of the source of the raw material or portion of matter of wealth in an unimproved state   discovery of this or that portion of land considered as the source from which portions of matter in an unimproved state are extracted   extraction—viz of the raw material from the portion of land which is its source when an increase of wealth to any given amount takes place it is either by means of an increase of labour or without any increase when it takes place without any increase in the quantity of labour it takes place by means of an increase in the effect or say efficiency of the quantity of labour employed the degree of efficiency in the quantity of labour employed being given the increase of wealth produced by the labour will be as the quantity of it if the quantity of wealth which before the increase of efficiency required a years labour of two thousand men be now produced by a years labour of one thousand there remains the years labour of one of the sets of a thousand men which when employed in the same way or with the same degree of efficiency as that of the first set will produce a fresh mass of wealth equal to the original one reducing by onehalf the number of men employed about an individual mass of work the quantity of the work done not being diminished by such reduction is therefore the same thing in effect as doubling the number of men employed with the same degree of efficiency as before but this supposes that the number of hands thus rendered unnecessary with regard to the production of the given quantity of work are employed with the same degree of efficiency or at any rate are employed if not    employed at all no increase in the quantity of wealth will be brought about by the increase in the efficiency of the mass of labour which continues to be employed—if employed but employed with a less degree of efficiency then the fresh quantity of wealth thus produced by the expelled hands will fail of being equal to the quantity produced by the hands retained in a degree proportioned to the difference in the degree of efficiency if by means of the introduction of machinery or improvement in the machinery in use a manufacturer be enabled with one thousand hands to perform the same quantity of work as that which before the improvement required two thousand hands it might seem at first sight from this statement that the natural effect of the improvement would be the retaining the same quantity of hands employed in that branch of manufacture and thence the doubling the quantity of goods manufactured in the time but without an addition to the mass of pecuniary capital which is a circumstance accidental and not belonging to the case the retaining of the same number of hands so employed would in no instance be possible for the production and keeping up of the machinery or other auxiliary means would always require a considerable quantity of labour the payment of which would be attended with a proportionable mass of expense by which a proportionable part of the capital would be absorbed if the hands employed on the machinery should be paid at a higher rate than the hands employed in the manufacture the capital being the same after the improvement as before the number of manufacturing hands would be still further decreased on this account hence it follows that increase of wealth by saving of labour is not so great as increase of wealth by increase of quantity of labour and that consequently opposition to machinery is well grounded if no care be taken to provide immediate employment for the discharged hands at first the temporary distress will outweigh the temporary enjoyment but so far as depends on increase of wealth the increase of enjoyment is perpetual the quantity of wealth or matter of wealth existing in a community at the end of a given space of time say forty years will be as the quantity of wealth existing therein at the commencement of the period—plus the quantity of wealth that has come into it minus the quantity that has gone out of it hence two modes of increasing the quantity of wealth—  the direct and positive mode increasing the quantity that comes in   the indirect and negative mode diminishing the quantity that goes out wealth has two sources to which correspond two modes of coming into a community—  home production   importation it has in like manner two correspondent modes of going out—  consumption   exportation in the case of importation the increase is only relative relation being had to the community in question importation alone being considered by so much as the wealth of this community is increased by so much is the wealth of some other community decreased in the like manner in the case of exportation the decrease is only relative exportation alone being considered by so much as the wealth of this community is decreased that of some other is increased in relation to the world at large the quantity suffers not in either case any change in general import in respect of one portion of wealth does not take place but export in respect to another and correspondent portion a portion generally regarded as being of equal value takes place at nearly the same time the transfer or selfdeprivation having the acquisition for what in the language of english law is called its consideration and in the language of general logic its final cause but between community and community as between individuals from matters of fear amity or remote personal interest it will sometimes happen that export from this community shall take place without a correspondent import into it from that—import into this country without export from it into that though import into this cannot take place unless it be from spots occupied in common by the two such as the greater part of the sea and some unappropriated parts of the land without export from that consumption again takes place in either of two ways—  purposely in the way of use or   undesignedly in the way of deperition without use deperition is either total or partial partial is deterioration deperition is in strictness no otherwise true of any portion of matter than in as far as it respects form and value as resulting from that form—value i e subserviency to use an act whereby deperition is produced is called destruction an act whereby deterioration is produced may be termed deterioration the word being used in the active sense or endamagement acts whereby destruction or deterioration is produced and thereby loss without preponderant benefit it is the province of the nonpenal branch of the law to define and of the penal to prevent preservation may be either total or partial  0 it can only be partial in cases where decrease to a greater or less amount is indispensable as in case of taxes taxes may be imposed either to furnish means for future expenditure or to afford compensation to those who in times past have furnished the means for expenditure which then was future in other words for growing expenses or for discharge of debts the amount of taxes imposed for growing expenses takes from the amount of national wealth in certain ways and adds to it in other ways more or less according as it is employed it takes from the means or instruments of enjoyment present or future immediate or more or less remote according as it would have been spent lent out or hoarded had it not been for the tax it adds to the security of the whole in proportion as it is employed for the purpose of national security in the way of national defence and otherwise it adds to the subsistence and enjoyment of a part in proportion as it is applied to those purposes by those among whom it is distributed in consideration of the services by which they have respectively contributed to that end the amount of taxes imposed in discharge of debt of itself neither adds to nor takes from the mass of national wealth but is the necessary result of measures of expense necessary or unnecessary avoidable or unavoidable beneficial or pernicious by which in former times a decrease in the mass of national wealth was produced but when and in so far as the money produced by these taxes is actually employed in discharge of debt it adds to capital and thereby to growing wealth finance is an appendix and inseparable accompaniment to political economy taxes are sacrifices made of wealth and opulence at the expense of enjoyment to security in respect of defence and security in respect of subsistence taxes and other means of supply for the expenses of government—wars with their taxes and their devastations are means by which of necessity in a certain degree and too often beyond the extent of the necessity decrease in the amount of wealth and population is produced in this way the field of political economy includes within it the field of finance a tax in as far as the thing taxed is abstained from operates as a prohibition—as a discouragement to that branch of trade or production to which the thing belongs and as an encouragement to rival branches that is more or less to all other branches hence another head of connexion between finance and political economy in its narrower sense the same illusion which has recommended the encouragement of particular branches of wealth as a means of increase to the whole has led to the exaggeration of the bad effect of taxes in this point of view hence the care taken by governments to throw the weight of taxes upon imports and home productions rather than upon exports that is upon their own subjects rather than upon foreigners under the above heads may be reduced without violence everything that can be said on the subject of political economy including finance chapter iii of wealth §   sponte acta the national wealth is the sum of the particular masses of the matter of wealth belonging respectively to the several individuals of whom the political community—the nation—is composed every atom of that matter added by any one such individual to his own stock without being taken from that of any other individual is so much added to the stock of national wealth to add to his own particular stock and to add in each portion of time more than by use or otherwise is taken from it in that same portion of time is with a very few exceptions the constant aim and occupation of every individual in every civilized nation enjoyment is the offspring of wealth—wealth of labour what men want from government is not incitement to labour but security against disturbance—security to each for his portion of the matter of wealth while labouring to acquire it or occupied in enjoying it for the purpose of increasing wealth individuals require neither to be forced to labour nor allured the want of that which is not to be had without labour is sufficient force the assurance of being able to enjoy it is sufficient allurement leave men to themselves each man is occupied either in the acquisition of wealth the instrument of enjoyment or in some actual enjoyment which in the eyes of the only competent judge is of more value if idleness be to be discouraged it is not because it is the nonacquisition of wealth but because it is the source of crimes whoever takes upon him to add to national wealth by coercive and thence vexatious measures stands engaged to make out two propositions—  that more wealth will be produced by the coercion than would have been produced without it   that the comfort flowing from the extra wealth thus produced is more than equivalent to whatever    vexation may be found attached to the measure by which it was produced §   agenda the application of the matter of wealth to its several purposes in the character of an instrument of general security is evidently of anterior and superior importance to the increase of it but this class of operations belongs to other heads—to legislation and administration in general—to the establishment of laws distributive and laws penal and the institution collation and exercise of powers military fiscal judicial and of police the operations coming under the head of agenda—viz on the part of government—may be described as those which are conducive either to the increase of the national stock of the matter of wealth or to the application of it in the most efficient mode to any of its three uses viz subsistence security and enjoyment and which not being attended with preponderant vexation are not to be expected to be performed by the spontaneous exertions of individuals of the three conditions requisite for the production of this or any other effect viz inclination power and knowledge some one or more being wanting on the part of individuals a particular case for the interference of government in this view is where inclination and knowledge both adequate to the purpose and even power so far as depends on the possession of the matter of wealth being preexistent on the part of individuals nothing but an allotment of political power of an appropriate kind requires to be supplied on the part of government such is the case where corporate powers are requisite for the management of a common stock and thereby for enabling individuals spontaneously associated for the purpose to give a more effectual combination to their exertions in the pursuit of a common end whenever nonagenda have been acta the doing away of these male acta may form so many additions to the catalogue of agenda to this head belong those operations which consist in the removal of obstructions to sponte acta† from the catalogue of agenda having for their object the increase of the national stock of the matter of wealth in all its three shapes together must be distinguished any such measures the aim of which is confined to the increasing of it in any one of those shapes at the expense of either of the two others measures of this tendency will so far as they are justifiable find their justification in the same considerations which prescribe the application of the matter of wealth to its several uses in this way if a sacrifice be made of the matter of wealth in the most agreeable of its shapes to the same matter in one or other of the two necessary ones—of the matter of enjoyment to the matter of subsistence    or the matter of defence—if the assumed necessity be real the transformation belongs by the supposition to the catalogue of agenda if in any nation for the use of the whole or any part of such nation government were to establish in the character of security funds magazines of the matter of subsistence not to be drawn upon but in times of extraordinary scarcity—an institution of this sort would hardly be thought of much less be regarded as beneficial and desirable under the notion of its producing a clear addition to the aggregate mass of the national stock of the matter of wealth in all its shapes taken together in the catalogue of agenda it could not be placed in any other character than as a sacrifice of enjoyment to subsistence if the nature of the case be such that the aggregate of the securityfunds laid up in the country in question by dealers may at all times be safely depended upon as sufficient the establishment of such funds by government on its own account will be plainly indefensible being pregnant with loss instead of gain as in the business of buying and selling trustmanagement will naturally be when compared with interested management it would disturb the operations of individual dealers and be prejudicial rather than conducive to the end aimed at—viz national security in respect of subsistence if on the other hand in that same country seasons are continually liable to recur in which the aggregate of these private securityfunds cannot with safety be depended upon the proposition is reversed government need not scruple to insure its subjects in this way against loss and distress by scarcity in each country the establishment of such securityfunds is an affair of calculation for the meridian of england a very considerable stock of data have already been furnished by experience but what is shorter than calculation is the reflection that the world is wide and should the country ever receive another visit from famine a visit too unpleasant to be thought of what is not to be had here may perhaps be to be got elsewhere in a similar manner sacrifices may be made of enjoyment to national defence an example of this kind was found in the english navigation act it operated in diminution rather than in augmentation of the aggregate mass of the matter of wealth it made england pay more for freight than she would otherwise and pro tanto drove the foreign nations in question from this line of industry into some less profitable one this loss whatever was the amount of it was the price paid by england for whatever addition it thus made to its stock of the matter of defence viz for a sort of navy of reserve for an extra portion of possible marine force—convertible into actual at pleasure the measure could only be deemed eligible by assuming the necessity for the maintenance of the sort of securityfund thus kept up i e for that part of the national stock of maritime skill which owed its production and maintenance to this measure another example may be found in the allowances in money given for the encouragement of certain fisheries the object was the same as in the former case the mode of encouragement being not as in that case indirect but direct—the money being given at the expense of national wealth and thence of national enjoyment if without this encouragement the trade would not have been beneficial enough to be carried on the quantity of the matter of wealth thus bestowed upon it was so much taken from enjoyment and given to defence—and thence if not necessary to defence thrown away if the trade would have been beneficial the result of the measure is besides the transfer of so much of the matter of wealth from the account of enjoyment to the account of defence a net addition to the quantity of the whole but it is only in the supposed necessity of it for the purpose of defence that such sacrifice of national enjoyment can receive its justification take away the necessity there remains wealth purchased at the expense of justice—enjoyment given to one man at the expense of enjoyment taken from another a case conceivable and perhaps realized is—that as to part the allowance may fall under one of the above suppositions as to another part under the other §   nonagenda whatever is not sponte actum on the part of individuals falls thereby into the class of nonagenda on the part of government coercion the inseparable accompaniment precedent concomitant or subsequent of every act of government is in itself an evil to be anything better than a pure evil it requires to be followed by some more than equivalent good spontaneous action excludes it action on the part of government and by impulse from government supposes it among nonagenda therefore must be reckoned the attempting to give birth or increase to this or that particular branch of industry productive of wealth under the notion of giving an increase thereby to the aggregate of the national mass of wealth    no kind of productive labour of any importance can be carried on without capital hence it follows that the quantity of labour applicable to any object is limited by the quantity of capital which can be employed on it if i possess a capital of £ 0000 and two species of trade each yielding twenty per cent profit but each requiring a capital of £ 0000 for carrying them on are proposed to me it is clear that i may carry on the one or the other with this profit so long as i confine myself to one but that in carrying on the one it is not in my power to carry on the other and that if i seek to divide my capital between them both i shall not make more than twenty per cent but i may make less and even convert my profit into a loss but if this proposition be true in the case of one individual it is true for all the individuals in a whole nation production is therefore limited by capital there is one circumstance which demonstrates that men are not sensible of this truth apparently so obvious when they recommend the encouragement of particular branches of trade they do not pretend that they are more profitable than others—but that they are branches of trade and they cannot possess too many in a word they would encourage trade in general—as if all trade did not yield its own reward—as if an unprofitable trade deserved to be encouraged—and as if a profitable trade stood in need of encouragement as if indeed by these capricious operations it were possible to do any other thing than transfer capital from one branch of trade to another the quantity of capital being given the increase of wealth will in a certain period be in proportion to the good employment of this capital—that is to say of the more or less advantageous direction which shall have been given to it the advantageous direction of capital depends upon two things—  the choice of the undertaking   the choice of the means for carrying it on the probability of the best choice in both these respects will be in proportion to the degree of interest which the undertaker has in its being well made in connexion with the means he has of acquiring the information relative to his undertaking but knowledge itself depends in a great measure upon the degree of interest which the individual has in obtaining it he who possesses the greatest interest will apply himself with the greatest attention and constancy to obtain it the interest which a man takes in the concerns of another is never so great as he feels in his own if we consider everything necessary for the most advantageous choice of an undertaking or the means of carrying it on we shall see that the official person so fond of intermeddling in the detail of production and trade is in no respect superior to the individuals he desires to govern and that in most points he is their inferior a prime minister has not so many occasions for acquiring information respecting farming as a farmer—respecting distillation as a distiller—respecting the construction of vessels as a shipbuilder—respecting the sale of commodities as those who have been engaged in it all their lives it is not probable that he should either have directed his attention to these objects for so long a time or with the same degree of energy as those who have been urged on by such powerful motives it is therefore probable that in point of information relative to these professions he is inferior to those who follow them if by chance a minister should become informed of any circumstance which proves the superior advantage of a certain branch of trade or of a certain process it would not be a reason for employing authority in causing its adoption publicity alone would produce this effect the more real the advantage the more superfluous the exercise of authority to justify the regulatory interference of government in the affairs of trade one or other of these two opinions must be maintained—that the public functionary understands the interests of individuals better than they do themselves or that the quantity of capital in every nation being infinite or that the new branches of trade not requiring any capital all the wealth produced by a new and favourite commerce is so much clear gain over and above what would have been produced if these advantages had not been conferred on this trade these two opinions being contrary to the truth it follows that the interference of government is altogether erroneous—that it operates rather as an obstacle than a means of advancement it is hurtful in another manner by imposing restraints upon the actions of individuals it produces a feeling of uneasiness so much liberty lost—so much happiness destroyed divide the aggregate mass of profitseeking industry into any number of branches each calls or at least has an equal right to call upon government for encouragement—for encouragement at the expense of the public purse that is of all the other branches gratify all alike—there is as between them at least no injustice on the one hand no profit on the other gratify any number short of the whole—injustice is certain—profit questionable the measures which present themselves in the character of nonagenda may be distinguished    into broad measures and narrow measures—broad measures having for their effect or their object the augmentation of wealth in all its shapes without distinction narrow measures having for their object the augmentation of wealth by the increase of profitseeking industry in this or that particular branch in preference to others under the notion of its producing more wealth in that than in others we shall proceed more particularly to consider some of the measures which have been so employed §   nonagenda—broad measures example   forced frugality by raising money as other money is raised by taxes the amount of which is taken by individuals out of their expenditure on the score of maintenance government has it in its power to accelerate to an unexampled degree the augmentation of the mass of real wealth by a proportionable sacrifice of present comfort it may make any addition that it pleases to the mass of future wealth that is to the increase of comfort and security but though it has it in its power to do this it follows not that it ought to exercise this power—to compel the community to make this sacrifice to a certain degree—to a degree which in the ordinary course of things is quite sufficient for the purpose the community makes this sacrifice of itself this voluntary sacrifice is at least in the ordinary state of things amply sufficient for the purpose—for every purpose and as the impulse is spontaneous so far all is right on the other hand the application of money raised by taxes in the shape of capital to the endeavour to promote national opulence can only be carried into effect at the expense of justice in the first place it operates unjustly by forcing a man to labour though it were for his own benefit when he wishes to enjoy it operates unjustly in the second place by forcing one man to labour for the sake of increasing the enjoyments of another man—increasing his enjoyments or rather the stock of the instruments of enjoyment in his hands for all that government can do in behalf of enjoyment otherwise than by security is to increase the quantity of the mass of instruments of enjoyment—application of these instruments in such manner as to produce actual enjoyment depending altogether upon the individual and being an effect altogether out of the reach of government the effect of forced frugality is produced by paying off national debts in this case the production of the effect is not only unexceptionable but necessary it is a collateral result and that a very advantageous one from a necessary act of justice on the buyingin or payingoff of the government annuities in which the debt in great britain consists the money raised by taxes—of which the whole mass with a trifling exception or two bears not upon capital but upon income passes into the hands of the expelled annuitants who to make it afford them an income as before must employ it themselves in the shape of capital or lend it to others who will employ it in that shape if the sum of money paid by government to such annuitants on the redemption of their annuities be greater than the sum received by government on the creation of those same annuities the quantity of the sum thus raised by forced frugality and poured into the money market receives a proportionable increase the effect of forced fruganty is also produced by the creating of paper money by government or the suffering the creation of paper money on the part of individuals    in this case the effect is produced by a species of indirect taxation which has hitherto passed almost unnoticed §   nonagenda—broad measures example   increasing money labour and not money is the real source of wealth all hands being employed and employed in the most advantageous manner wealth real wealth could admit of no further increase—but money would be increasable ad infinitum the effect of every increase of money understand of the ratio of the quantity of money employed in the purchase of things vendible to the quantity of things vendible for money is to impose an unprofitable income tax upon the incomes of fixed incomists† if on the introduction of the additional money into the circulation it pass in the first instance into hands which employ it in the way of unproductive expenditure‡ the suffering from this tax remains altogether uncompensated—if before it come into any hands of that description it have come into hands by which it has been employed in the shape of capital∥ the suffering by the income tax is partly reduced and partly compensated it is reduced by the mass of things vendible produced by means of it—a mass by the amount of which were it not for the correspondent increase in the mass of money the value of the mass of money would pro tanto have been increased and the prices of things vendible decreased it is in a certain degree though in a very inadequate degree compensated for§ by the same means—viz by the amount of the addition made to the quantity of sensible wealth—of wealth possessing a value in the way of use¶ here as in the above case of forced frugality national wealth is increased at the expense of national comfort and national justice on those who receive no share of the fresh addition to money—on those whose sole income consists in an unincreasing sum of money the income tax bears with all its pressure whilst those who receive a share of the fresh money equal to the amount of the depreciation receive beforehand a compensation adequate in money at least howsoever it may be in regard to feelings to their loss by the indirect tax in this case the measure coincides with the one already reprobated—the increasing the mass of real capital by money raised by taxes the difference is that the mode in which the    money is raised is disadvantageous to a degree of usuriousness much beyond anything ever exemplified under that name—the money being raised at an interest of  00 per cent payable for ever by the possessors of fixed incomes—subject to a small deduction as an equivalent for the goods produced in each year by the addition made to the mass of real capital no sooner however does such additional sum of money pass on from the hands by which it is employed in the shape of capital into those hands by which it is employed in adding to unproductive expenditure than its operation in the way of making an addition to real wealth is at an end no sooner does it go in addition to money employed in the purchase of articles for consumption than its power of producing an addition to the mass of the matter of real wealth is at an end—thenceforward and for ever it keeps on contributing by its whole amount to the increase of prices in the same manner as if from the mines it had come in the first instance into an unproductive hand without passing through any productive one in all cases where the addition thus made to wealth is not illusory in toto it is so as to part and that by far the greater part of the proportion between the illusory and the real part of the supposed addition to real wealth the rise of prices in a country where no fresh money has been poured into unproductive hands without first passing through a productive hand is at once a demonstration and a measure so much of the added wealth as hath not been accompanied by a countervailing addition to wealth whether it have contributed anything to that addition or no is over and above that portion which has been solely employed in producing the rise of prices supposing that within the last half century in the whole commercial world together wealth has received an increase to the amount of onefourth and at the same time prices have doubled—it follows that of the money now existing in that world nearly half has to a certainty been worse than thrown away having been employed in the imposition of the unproductive income tax above described—and as to the addition to wealth it is a matter of uncertainty what part and even whether any part has been produced by the addition to money since without any such addition it might have been produced as well as by it in respect of the ratio of money to things vendible—of the aggregate of the one to the aggregate of the other—the state of things most desirable is—that it should continue the same at all times—no increase at any one time no decrease at any other the tendency of a decrease if sudden and to a certain degree considerable is to produce general bankruptcy the mass of pecuniary engagements entered into within any given period of time being grounded of course on the existing ratio of money to things vendible at that time and not on the supposed suddenly supervening or any inferior ratio if at any time the mass of things vendible not being in the same proportion decreased out of the quantity of money of all kinds habitually in circulation a portion of any sort in the supposed degree considerable be suddenly defalcated the deficiency must be supplied by some portion of another sort or something that will be accepted as equivalent or the supposed general bankruptcy follows of course the tendency of the like decrease in so far as it is permanent but too gradual to be productive of general bankruptcy is—to impose an unproductive income tax parallel to that above mentioned but upon a different set of parties—upon all parties charged with annuities or other fixed payments on the ground of contracts to which it is not in their power to put an end as to an increase in the ratio of money to things vendible the tendency of it in respect of the unprofitable income tax by increase of prices of things vendible—by depreciation of money—has been shown above so far as addition to money is made in the shape of metallic money the mischief producible by it is confined to that of the depreciation as above so far as it is made in the shape of paper money—consisting in promises of metallic money—the amount of which promises is accordingly exigible in the shape of metallic money—to the actual mischief of depreciation is superadded the contingent mischief of general bankruptcy when governments add to money by paper money it is commonly in a noncommercial way when individuals singly or in association make the like addition it is most commonly in a commercial way—though in a noncommercial way it is natural that these coiners of money at the public expense—these uncommissioned sovereigns or unpunishable and irreproachable robbers for they may be called both or either should put off as much of it as they can get anybody to take whether by governments or individuals it may now be seen at what expense the profit is acquired and at how much cheaper a rate the end whatever it be would be accomplished without any such addition by money drawn out of the old stock    §   nonagenda—broad measures example   forced reduction of the rate of interest of reducing the rate of interest allowed to be given by individuals for money borrowed of individuals the principal mischief consists in another sort of unproductive income tax imposed upon all such individuals whose income arises out of a mass of money lent out at interest to individuals—the produce of which tax instead of being paid in to the public treasury for the service of the public and in lieu of the burthen which would otherwise be to be imposed to the same amount in some other shape is made over gratis to those whose circumstances oblige them to borrow money or enable them to borrow it with a profit it imposes not as in the former case an indirect unproductive income tax but a direct one it is not as in the case of the increase of money gradual and in its amount in some measure uncertain and questionable but sudden and determinate reduction from   to   per cent would be a tax of exactly  s in the pound as to the effect in the way intended it would be purely illusory to the proportion of money employed in the shape of capital it would make no addition if by impoverishment it forced some who by anterior opulence had been either withholden from trade or withdrawn from it to embark in trade so much capital as they thus embarked in a trade of their own so much would they withdraw from the trade of those other traders to whom otherwise it would have been lent instead of adding to it would defalcate from the aggregate mass of wealth being a tax on money lent in the shape of capital within the country it would in effect be a prohibition—prohibiting the keeping it there and under a penalty equal to the amount of the tax it would have the effect of a bounty on the exportation of it—on the exportation of it to any country where any rate of interest higher than the reduced rate would be to be had the expectation that the reduction of interest would produce an addition to the aggregate mass of wealth is an illusion which has its source in another illusion increase of wealth though not the effect is apt to be an accompaniment of a reduction in the rate of interest as capital increases wealth increases—and as capital increases if the effectual demand for capital for money in the shape of capital do not increase in so great a proportion men will not give so high a price for the use of it as they did before the reduction in this case is the result of freedom and though it do not itself increase wealth it cannot take place any further than as wealth is increased by other causes the reduction here contended against is the product of coercion and whenever the illusion prevails it may be carried into effect at any time in the poorest country as well as the richest in the most declining as well as the most prosperous accelerating and aggravating the decline the mischief that would be produced by a reduction in the rate of lawful interest is over and above the constant mischief produced by the fixation of that rate §   rates of interest—evils of fixation if it be reasonable for legislators to encourage inventive industry by fictitious rewards it is much more reasonable that they should not oppose obstacles to the productiveness of natural rewards the natural reward of inventions when carried into effect is the profit to be derived from them in the way of trade but all trade requires capital if the inventor have it of his own it is well if not he must seek it from others many circumstances however conspire to hinder his obtaining it does he endeavour to borrow it upon what conditions can he hope to find a lender upon the ordinary conditions it is naturally impossible that he should find one a new undertaking cannot fail of being hazardous if it were only because it is new it is therefore necessary to grant to the lender an advantage proportionate to the apparent degree of risk there are two methods of granting this advantage the english laws proscribe them both one method consists in granting interest at a rate superior to the ordinary rate but this is prohibited by the laws fixing the rate of interest this prohibition is partly inefficacious and partly pernicious that it was altogether useless would be its greatest elogium† the second method consists in granting a variable interest proportioned to the profits of the undertaking‡    in france there is one branch of commerce at least in which it is possible to limit the portion of property that one is willing to risk it is in the business of banking the sum employed in this manner is said to be en commandite if this liberty be useful in this branch of commerce why should it not be equally so in every other and especially in newlydiscovered branches which have so many natural obstacles to overcome which it is needless to increase by legal interference this liberty under certain restrictions for the prevention of monopolies from the unrestrained accumulation of capital has been established in ireland when will england have the wisdom to imitate this example an inventor therefore in want of funds can only apply to a tradesman or merchant to enter into partnership with him but persons engaged in business are those who have the least portion of disposable capital and as they are enabled to make their own terms inventive industry is often stifled or oppressed were it lawful for every one to engage in commercial undertakings for a limited amount how many facilities would be afforded to men of genius all classes of society would furnish assistance to inventive industry those who wished to risk only a small sum—those who could annually dispose of a certain sum would be enabled to engage in this species of lottery which promised to yield them an interest above the ordinary rate the most elevated classes might find an amusement in descending into the territories of industry and there staking a small part of that wealth which they risk upon games of chance the spirit of gaming diverted from its pernicious direction might serve to increase the productive energy of commerce and art there are some who are natural enemies to merit of every kind every conquest achieved by industry in the career of invention is a loss to them—every discovery an injury commonplace men have a common interest which they understand but too well it is that all should be commonplace like themselves it is to be regretted that adam smith in his wealth of nations—a work which will rise in public estimation in proportion as genius shall be held in honour—should have furnished arms which the adversaries of genius may direct against that work itself it is to be regretted that under the odious name of projects a name applied to the most useful enterprises even to the moment when they receive the sanction of success they may there be seen indiscriminately stamped with the seal of opprobrium and indiscriminately enveloped with contempt it is not only that he may prevent prodigals from obtaining money but that he may prevent its reaching the hands of projectors whom he places with them upon the same level that he approves of the fixing of the rate of interest upon the footing upon which he found it if the legal rate of interest in great britain for example were fixed so high as   or  0 per cent the greater part of the money which was to be lent would be lent to prodigals and projectors who alone would be willing to give this high interest sober people who will give for the use of money no more than a part of what they are likely to make by the use of it would not venture into the competition a great part of the capital of the country would thus be kept out of the hands which were most likely to make a profitable and advantageous use of it and thrown into those which were most likely to waste and destroy it where the legal rate of interest on the contrary is fixed but a very little above the lowest market rate sober people are universally preferred as borrowers to prodigals and projectors the person who lends money gets nearly as much interest from the former as he dares to take from the latter and his money is much safer in the hands of the one set of people than in those of the other† this is not the only passage in which this author attacks projectors see b i ch iv but it is here that he attack them more directly whilst as to prodigals it has been elsewhere shown that it is not to them that money is lent or that any are willing to lend at extraordinary interest friends will either not lend at all or will lend at the ordinary rate strangers will only lend to those who are without industry upon security but he who has security to offer has no need to give a halfpenny more because he is a prodigal it is upon his security that the money will be lent and not upon his character whether the security offered be present or future certain or contingent produces no difference a future or contingent security by means of a valuation becomes as good a pledge as if it were present or certain in a word if money be lent upon the industry of the borrower it is lent not to a prodigal but to a projector it is therefore upon the latter class alone that the burthen of these prohibitory laws presses an opinion which derives all its force from the authority of the individual who publishes it cannot be better combated than by that authority itself   the prosperity of england has been progressive ever since the number of projectors has been not only in an uninterrupted but in an accelerated state of increase—  the    aggregate of the good economy has always been greater than the aggregate of the bad—  with respect to commerce each individual is a better judge of his own interests than government can be for him—and   general laws must be much more defective with respect to commercial regulations the members of a government may take notice of particular cases but general laws can never regard them these are the general propositions of the work of adam smith—truths precious and irrefragable which no one has more successfully laboured to unfold than this illustrious politician but if these principles are followed out no laws ought to exist for the restraint of projectors and for preventing them from obtaining loans of the capital of which they stand in need the censure which condemns projectors falls upon every species of new industry it is a general attack upon the improvement of the arts and sciences everything which is routine today was originally a project every manufacture how old soever it may be was once new and when new it was the production of that mischievous and bold race who ought to be destroyed—the race of projectors i know not what can be replied to this unless it be said that the past projects have been useful but that all future projects will not be so such an assertion would however require proof strong in proportion to its opposition to general opinion in every career experience is considered as worth something the warning to be derived from past failures may contribute to future security if not to success were it even proved that no projector ever engaged in a new branch of industry without being ruined it would not be proper to conclude that the spirit of invention and of projects ought to be discouraged each projector in ruining himself may have opened a new path by which others may have attained to wealth so soon as a new die more brilliant or more economical than the old ones a new machine or a new practice in agriculture—has been discovered a thousand dyers ten thousand mechanicians a hundred thousand agriculturists may reap the benefit and then—though the original author of the invention have been ruined in the bringing the discovery to perfection—as it respects the national wealth of what consequence is this when considered as the price of so much gain that restrictions of this nature are inefficacious has been successfully shown by adam smith himself but if inefficacious this is sufficient reason for their condemnation unless they effect the purpose designed they are positively mischievous they tend in the first place to drive away useful projectors i do not say that they drive away all had that been the case we should not have attained our present degree of prosperity but they drive away a part unhappily we cannot know what part nor how great a part of their number the talent required for operating upon matter or directing the powers of nature is extremely different from that required for operating upon the mind—the talent of meditating in a study and thereby making discoveries from that requisite for making known those discoveries to the world the chance of success in the career of invention is in proportion to the talent of the individual the chance of obtaining a loan of capital from another to make an invention productive is in proportion to his reputation but this latter far from being in direct is naturally in inverse proportion with the former the more unaccustomed an individual is to society the greater his dread of mingling in it the less is he at his ease—the less is he master of his faculties when he is obliged to mingle with it the effect produced upon the mind of the individual who has or who supposes that he has made a great discovery is a mixture of pride and timidity both which feelings concur in alienating the minds of men and diminishing the probability of success in every enterprise inasmuch as it may depend upon the degree in which such individual succeeds in rendering himself and his projects estimable in the eyes of others this pride has for its cause the superiority which he believes himself to possess above them this timidity is caused by the faint hope he possesses of making them sensible of this superiority but though pride united with courage is one of the most powerful means of subjugating men pride united with timidity is one of the most certain causes of exposure to their aversion and contempt that disposition which under the name of modesty is so much praised as a companion well adapted to the introduction of true merit and which is so necessary when inferiority of situation will not allow the employment of boldness in the service is not true timidity but skill which has learnt to assume this appearance it is skill which to strength and consciousness of that strength unites the knowledge of when and how and in what sense and in what proportion this strength ought to be displayed for the most favourable exhibition of its pretensions and when and how and in what sense it ought to be hidden that the protector whose assistance is desired may enjoy the feeling of his own superiority if ever timidity has effected anything at the expense of that assurance which assumes its appearance it has been when allied with beauty which causes everything to be forgiven and which nothing can resist separated from this powerful protectrix  0 it labours in grief in darkness in awkwardness embarrassment and false shame—the bugbears of love and of esteem but the frequent and afflictive companions and most cruel enemies of merit and solitary genius not to speak of the obstacles which oppose the progress of an inventor incumbered with his projects and his wants before he reaches the antichamber of the rich or the noble whom it may be necessary to persuade—suppose these obstacles overcome and that he is admitted to their presence how will the poor inventor the necessitous man of genius behave when he has arrived there oftentimes he will lose his presence of mind forget what he was about to say stammer out some unconnected propositions and finding himself despised indignant that his merit should be thus treated he will retire resolving never again to expose himself to such an adventure and even when he is not devoid of courage there is nothing more different though in certain points the connexion may appear most intimate than the talent of conceiving new ideas of certain kinds and the talent of developing these same ideas altogether occupied with the idea itself the inventor is most frequently incapable of directing his attention to all the accessories which must be reunited before his invention can be understood and approved his attention being entirely occupied with what is passing in his own mind he is incapable of attending to what passes in the minds of others—incapable of arranging and directing his operations so that he may make the most favourable impression upon them thus the ingenious philosopher who has delivered the most excellent instructions respecting the art of developing the thoughts of others and who possessed in so perfect a degree the talent of developing his own well knew how necessary it was that in every career of invention except that of eloquence minds should be attended by an accoucheur how many difficulties did not diderot experience in effecting this development—he who possessed this talent in so excellent a degree—where the two parties were agreed had a common interest and were equally well disposed how numerous were the difficulties experienced by the ingenious artists of every description to whom he applied in making him comprehend the fruits of their studies when they had for their interpreter the man the most capable and the best disposed to understand them how much more difficult would they have found it had they been applicants for the assistance necessary to render their projects available to a rich ignoramus filled with the idea of the necessity which existed for his assistance and puffed up with that pride which commonly accompanies wealth when unattended by that politeness which education teaches and full of that distrust which a poor projector cannot fail to inspire in the mind of an individual favoured with the gifts of fortune should the inventor succeed in making his plan understood he will still find it difficult to make the interest of the capitalist accord with his desires it is in this respect that the prohibition displays its mischievous qualities how shall the poor inventor dare to propose a loan at the ordinary rate of interest this rate may at all times be obtained without risk where then would be the advantage to the capitalist in such a bargain is it possible that it could be otherwise than disadvantageous to him a loan at the ordinary rate of interest cannot be hoped for it is only to a most intimate friend that such a loan would be granted deprived of this resource how shall he dare to propose to the individual whose assistance he seeks to expose himself to the rigour of the laws scarcely daring to ask for the assistance he needs upon the most secure and unexceptionable conditions how shall he propose conditions which the laws consider criminal whilst there are laws against usury it may be said there will still be usury yes and whilst there are laws against theft there will still be thieves does it follow that the laws which forbid theft are without effect and that theft is as common as if these laws did not exist in the same proportion as the tendency of these prohibitory laws is unfavourable to true merit in the career of invention is it favourable to the cheat which assumes the appearance of merit were it only by the advantage given to imposture by preventing merit from entering into the competition the essential requisite is not merit but the gift of persuasion this gift most naturally belongs to the superficial man who knows the world half enthusiast and half rogue and not to the studious and laborious individual who is only acquainted with the abstract subjects of his studies it is true that at all times truth possesses powerful advantages but these advantages are less in proportion as the career to which it relates is more removed from the ordinary routine respecting which ordinary minds are capable of forming a judgment upon what is presented to them it has therefore happened that of all projectors those have been treated with the greatest confidence whose projects are now known to have been founded upon no basis of truth were it possible to ascertain the amount furnished under the existing laws against usury by capitalists to the authors of useful and practicable projects it would most probably be found less than the amount which in the same space of time has been drawn by the professors of alchemy from the avaricious credulity of the ignorant or half learned    truth possesses however this advantage over error of every kind it will ultimately prevail how frequent or how deplorable soever may have been the disgraces it has undergone this error respecting prohibitory laws is nearly discredited—this source of delusion is nearly closed for ever as the world advances the snares the traps the pitfalls which inexperience has found in the path of inventive industry will be filled up by the fortunes and the minds of those who have fallen into them and been ruined in this as in every other career the ages gone by have been the forlorn hope which has received for those who follow them the blows of fortune there is not one reason for hoping less well of future projects than of those which are passed but here is one for hoping better the more closely the reasons on account of which adam smith would have desired to discourage projectors are examined the more astonishing it appears that he should have so widely deviated from the principles he had himself laid down it is probable that his imagination had been preoccupied with the idea of certain incautious or dishonest projectors the history of whose proceedings had fallen under his own observation and that he had a little too promptly taken these few individuals as exact models of the whole race to preserve himself from the error of too hasty and indiscriminate generalizations never to allow any proposition to escape without having made all the reservations necessary to confine it within the limits of the exact truth is the last boundary and even now the ideal boundary of human wisdom nothing would more contribute to the preliminary separation of useless from useful projects and to secure the labourers in the hazardous routes of invention from failure than a good treatise upon projects in general it would form a suitable appendix to the judicious and philosophical work of the abbé condillac upon systems what this is in matters of theory the other would be in matters of practice the execution of such a work might be promoted by the proposal of a liberal reward for the most instructive work of this kind a survey might be made of the different branches of human knowledge and what each presents as most remarkable in this respect might be brought to view chemistry has its philosophers stone medicine its universal panacea mechanics its perpetual motion politics and particularly that part which regards finance its method of liquidating without funds and without injustice national debts under each head of error the insuperable obstacles presented by the nature of things to the success of any such scheme and the illusions which may operate upon the human mind to hide the obstacles or to nourish the expectation of seeing them surmounted might be pointed out above all dishonest projectors impostors of every kind ought to be depicted—the qualities of mind and character which they possess in common should be described their volubility their rapidity that lightness natural or affected with which they treat the arguments opposed to them that manner which they have and which for the accomplishment of their ends it is necessary they should have of declaiming instead of analyzing and reasoning—of flying off in tangents when they are pressed—of giving birth to incidents—of pretending to be tired with the species of opposition they experience—of attaching themselves to the manner in which questions and doubts or arguments are proposed to them instead of to the foundations of things themselves—of complaining of the prejudices which they pretend are experienced against them—and in quitting the ground under those circumstances in which if they were sincere it would be most proper for them to maintain themselves there but throughout the whole work that tone of malignity which seems to triumph in the disgraces of genius and which seeks to envelope wise useful and successful projects in the contempt and ridicule with which useless and rash projects are justly covered should be guarded against such is the character for example of the works of the splenetic swift under the pretence of ridiculing projectors he seeks to deliver up to the contempt of the ignorant the sciences themselves they were hateful in his eyes on two accounts the one because he was unacquainted with them the other because they were the work and the glorious work of that race which he hated ever since he had lost the hope of governing part of it the projectors who seek to deceive ought to be unmasked—those who are deceived to be instructed the interests of science and justice equally demand that they should be distinguished i cannot discern what purpose ridicule can serve if it be not to confound the distinction between useless and useful projectors in conclusion some general counsels might be added for the use of those who little versed in the fundamental sciences in which the respective projects take their rise may find themselves in a situation to be addressed by the author of a project with the design of    obtaining their assistance in effect it is true that the whole work would be a collection of more or less approved counsels but in making the recapitulation some general remarks might be added which would not have been suitable elsewhere but which might be particularly useful here they might for example be advised to apply to those learned individuals who would be able to supply their ignorance the class of learned men who ought to be found competent judges in each department might be pointed out instructions might be furnished to enable them to judge of the counsels of the judges themselves by warning them of the interests and prejudices to the seduction of which these judges may themselves be exposed §   nonagenda—broad measures example   increasing land—viz by colonization land is worth nothing but in proportion as labour is applied to it land at a distance is worth less than land at home by the amount of all the distance of the mass of labour which is employed in adding to real wealth no inconsiderable portion is employed in lessening the expense of carriage—in reducing the expense of carriage from a great distance to a level with the expense of carriage from a less distance if it could be done without destruction to existing capital and above all without vexation and destruction of security of property wealth might be increased by taking the existing population and transplanting it from greater distances with reference to the metropolis to lesser distances land newly acquired especially in the way of colonization is acquired at a greater distance the foundation of a colony is an introductory expense—the government of it a continual standing expense—war for the defence of it an occasional one all this requires money and money is not to be had for these expenses but from taxes to the mothercountry the positive profit from a colony is equal to 0 the negative profit the loss—the defalcation from national wealth—is equal to the amount of such taxes when an excess of population in relation to territory exists or is foreseen colonization is a very proper measure as a means of increasing the general wealth of a country or of increasing the revenue of the mothercountry it is a very improper measure all the common ideas upon this subject are founded in illusions that colonies add to the general wealth of the world is what cannot be doubted for if labour be necessary to production land is no less so the soil also of many colonies independently of what it annually produces is rich in raw materials which only require that they should be extracted and carried away to give them value but this wealth belongs to the colonists—to those who occupy the land and not to the mother country when first established colonies are not in a condition to pay taxes in the end they will not pay them in order to establish them—to protect them—to keep them in dependence expense is required—and all these expenses must be discharged by taxes levied upon the mothercountry colonization requires an immediate expense—an actual loss of wealth for a future profit—for a contingent gain the capital which is carried away for the improvement of the land in the colonies had it been employed in the mothercountry would have added to its increasing wealth as well as to its population and to the means of its defence whilst as to the produce of the colonies only a small part ever reaches the mothercountry if colonization be a folly when employed as a means of enrichment it is at least an agreeable folly new enjoyments insomuch as enjoyments depend upon the novelty and variety of objects result from it the substitution of sugar for honey—of tea coffee and chocolate for the beer and meat which composed the breakfast of maids of honour in the reign of elizabeth—the indigo which varies our dyes—the cochineal which furnishes the most brilliant scarlet—the mahogany which ornaments our apartments—the vessels of gold and silver which decorate our tables—are all sources of enjoyment and the pleasure which results from these objects of luxury is in part the profit of colonization whilst the medicinal and nutritive plants which have been received from the colonies in particular bark and potatoes are possessed of much superior utility novelty and variety in respect of means of enjoyment add nothing to the quantity of wealth which remains as it was if the old    productions are supplanted by the new ones it is thus also with new fruits new flowers new colours new clothes new furniture if the new supplant the old but as novelty and variety are sources of pleasure in proportion as they are increased wealth increases also if not in quantity at least in value and if these new wants are incentives to new labour a positive increase of real wealth results from them these advantages such as they are can only be derived from a colony situated in a climate whose productions cannot be naturalized in the mothercountry whilst as to the mines of mexico and potosi their effect has been to add to the quantity of vessels composed of the precious metals and to the quantity of coin the addition to the vessels increases the amount of real wealth—the addition to the coin has all been lost the new mass of gold and silver has had no other effect than to depreciate the old and to diminish in the same proportion the value of all pecuniary revenues without adding to the amount of real capital or future wealth however in taking all interests into the calculation it is certain that the welfare of mankind has been increased by the establishment of colonies there can be no doubt on this subject in respect to the nations who by degrees have become established there and who owe their existence to colonization the mothercountries also have themselves gained in happiness in another point of view let us take england for example according to the progress which population has made during the last century it may be supposed that it would soon have attained its extreme limits—that is to say that it would have exceeded the ordinary means of subsistence if the superabundance had not found means of discharging itself in these new countries but a long time before population has reached these limits there will be a great diminution of relative opulence a painful feeling of general poverty and distress a superabundance of men in all the laborious classes and a mischievous rivalry in offering their labour at the lowest price for the benefit of mankind at large it is desirable that the offsets which are to be employed as new plants should be taken from the most healthy stocks and the most flourishing roots that the people who go forth to colonize unoccupied lands should go forth from the nation whose political constitution is most favourable to the security of individuals that the new colonies should be swarms from the most industrious hive and that their education should have formed them to those habits of frugality and labour which are necessary to make transplanted families succeed it may often be advantageous for colonies to remain a long time under the government of the mothercountry provided always that such government be what it ought to be it would without doubt have been advantageous to egypt to have remained under the government of great britain—a government which would have bestowed upon it peace security the fine arts and the enjoyment of the magnificent gifts which nature has lavished upon it but in respect to wealth the possession of egypt far from being advantageous to england would have proved only a burthen i hear a universal cry raised against this paradox so many profound politicians divided upon every other point are unanimous upon the importance of colonies—are they only agreed that they may fall into an error so many merchants—have they deceived themselves in so simple a calculation as that of the profit or loss of colonial commerce the experience of two or three centuries—has it not opened the eyes of governments would it not be extraordinary that they should still obstinately sustain the enormous weight of these distant establishments if their advantages were not clear and manifest i might reply that a long train of alchymists after all the misfortunes of their predecessors long continued obstinately to seek after the philosophers stone and that this great work yet has its partisans—i might reply that many nations in the east have during many ages been governed by astrology—i might enumerate a long list of errors which have misled both governments and people but a question of this nature ought not to be obscured by declamation he who alleges the number of partisans by which a system is supported instead of supporting it by proofs desires to intimidate and not to convince his adversery let us examine all the arguments by which the advantages of colonies in respect of wealth have been endeavoured to be proved we shall not find a single one which is not in opposition to the most firmly established principles of political economy i the wealth of the colonies is poured into the mothercountry it is brought thither by commerce it consequently animates manufactures and they support the large towns the prosperity of bordeaux for example is one proof its wealth depends upon its trade with the west indies this reasoning proves nothing in favour of a system of colonies there is no necessity for governing or possessing any island in order that we may sell merchandise there the inhabitants of the antilles stand in need of the productions of england and france were they independent states it would still be necessary that they should buy them during their state of dependence what can they do more they will not give their sugars to the    mothercountry they exchange them for corn and cloth those who supply these commodities if they had not sold them to these parties would have sold them to others suppose that the inhabitants of st domingo in place of buying their corn in france were to buy it in england france would lose nothing because on the whole the consumption of corn would not be less england having supplied st domingo would not be able to supply other countries which would be obliged to supply themselves from france trade is in proportion to capital this is the principle the total amount of trade in each country is always in proportion to the capital which each country possesses i am a merchant—i have a capital of £ 0000 employed in commerce suppose spanish america were opened to me could i with my £ 0000 carry on a greater trade than i do at present suppose the west indies were shut against me would my £ 0000 become useless in my hands should i not be able to apply them to some other foreign trade or to make them useful in the interior of the country or to employ them in some enterprise of domestic agriculture it is thus that capital always preserves its value the trade to which it gives birth may change its form or its direction may flow in different channels may be directed upon one manufacture or another upon foreign or domestic undertakings but the final result is that these productive capitals always produce and they produce the same quantity the same value or at least the difference does not deserve attention it is therefore the quantity of capital which determines the quantity of trade and not the extent of the market as has been generally believed open a new market—the quantity of trade will not unless by some accidental circumstance be increased shut up an old market—the quantity of trade will not be diminished unless by accident and only for a moment should the new market be more advantageous than the old ones in this case the profit will be greater—the trade may become more extended but the existence of this extra profit is always supposed but never proved the mistake consists in representing all the profit of a new trade as so much added to the amount of national profit without considering that the same capital employed in any other branch of trade would not have been unproductive people suppose themselves to have created when they have only transferred a minister pompously boasts of certain new acquisitions certain establishments upon far distant shores and if the adventures which have been made have yielded a million of profit for example he does not fail to believe that he has opened a new source of national wealth he supposes that this million of profit would not have existed without him whilst he may have occasioned a loss he will have done so if the capital employed in this new trade have only yielded ten per cent and that employed in the ordinary trade have yielded twelve the answer to this first objection may be reduced to two points—  that the possession of colonies is not necessary to the carrying on of trade with them   that even when trade is not carried on with the colonies the capital which such trade would have required will be applied as productively to other undertakings ii the advocates of the colonial system would consider the above answer extremely weak they see in this commerce two circumstances which render it more advantageous than that which is carried on with free nations we established say they a double monopoly against the colonist first the monopoly of their productions which we permit them to sell to us alone and which we thus obtain from them at the lowest price—secondly the monopoly of their purchases which we oblige them to make among ourselves so that we are able to sell our produce and manufactures to them at a dearer rate than we could to a free people among whom other nations would enter into competition with us let us examine the effect of these two monopolies separately   you prevent your colonies from selling their productions to any but yourselves but you cannot oblige them to cultivate their lands or to manufacture at a loss there is a natural price for every commodity determined by the average rate of profit in commerce in general if the cultivator cannot obtain this natural price he will not continue to cultivate he will apply his capital to other undertakings the monopoly may produce a forced reduction of price for a time but the colonist will not continue to cultivate sugar if he lose by its cultivation instead of gaining it is therefore impossible for this monopoly to produce a constant reduction of the price of commodities below their natural price whilst free competition is sufficient to reduce them and keep them at this natural price the    high price which you wish to remedy by the monopoly is an evil which will cure itself large profits in any one branch of trade will draw thither a large number of competitors all merchants are rivals and their rivalry naturally produces a reduction of price till the rate of profit in each particular branch of trade be upon a level with all others   you may oblige your colonist to buy everything of you but the advantage you expect to derive from this exclusive commerce is deceptive if it respect commodities and manufactures which owing to a natural superiority you are enabled to furnish of better quality and at a lower price than foreigners it is clear that without monopoly your colonists would rather buy them of you than of others the monopoly will not enable you to sell them at a higher price your merchants being all in a state of competition with each other naturally seek to supplant each other by offering their goods at the lowest price possible while as to the productions and other articles which you are not able to furnish them upon terms equally favourable with foreigners it is certain that without the monopoly your colonists will not buy them of you ought we to conclude that the monopoly will be advantageous to you not in the least the nation in general will gain nothing it will only follow that a species of industry will be cultivated among you which does not naturally suit you that bad commodities will be produced and bad manufactures carried on the monopoly is similar to a reward bestowed by government for the maintenance of manufactures inferior to those of other nations if this monopoly did not exist the same capital would be applied to other species of industry in which you have a decided advantage instead of losing by this arrangement you will gain a more stable prosperity since the manufactures which cannot be maintained but by forced means are exposed to a thousand vicissitudes observe further that this monopoly is burthened with a countermonopoly it is not permitted to you to purchase productions similar to those of your colonies when you find them elsewhere at a lower price in compensation for the restraint you impose upon your colonies you impose one upon yourselves if they can buy only of you you can buy only of them how many inconveniences result from this when the harvest has been deficient in your colonies you are not able to supply yourselves from those places where the season has been more favourable in the midst of abundance you are suffering from dearth the monopoly has no effect in lowering the price of commodities but the countermonopoly is certain occasionally to produce extraordinarily high prices iii the partisans of the colonial system consider colonies under another point of view—the advantage they produce to the revenue the taxes levied upon the commerce of the colonies whether upon importation or upon exportation produce a revenue which would cease or be much diminished if they were independent the taxes levied upon the commerce with the colonies may produce a considerable amount but if they were free would they carry on no commerce could not this commerce be taxed—could it not be taxed as heavily as smuggling would permit england levies taxes upon its commerce with france france levies taxes upon its commerce with england the possession of colonies is not necessary to the levying of taxes upon the commerce carried on with them i do not repeat here that your taxes upon the articles of their production and upon those of your importation from the colonies are taxes of which you pay every farthing yourself this has already been demonstrated what you make the colonies to pay are only the taxes upon your exportation to them i allow that you may thus gain more from your colonies than you would be able to gain from foreign nations since the foreigners can quit your market when they please if they cannot obtain among you certain articles so cheap as from others you are therefore obliged to humour them but your own subjects obliged to supply themselves from you are obliged to submit you keep them in a prison and you can put what price you please upon their existence an advantage however of this nature can only be deceptive when you have made a prison of your colonies it is necessary to keep all the doors carefully shut you have to strive against the proteus of smuggling fleets are necessary to blockade their ports armies to restrain a discontented people courts of justice to punish the refractory how enormous are the expenses to be deducted before this forced commerce will yield a net revenue to the amount of the expenses of peace add that of a single armament—of a single war and you will perceive that dependent colonies cost much to the mothercountry and never yield an equal return that far from contributing to the strength of a state they are always its weak and vulnerable points that they keep up among maritime nations continual jealousy and that thus the people in france and in england are subjected to heavy taxes which have no other effect than to render the productions of the colonies dearer than if they were free to these considerations opposed to the colonial system drawn from political economy many others may be added derived from justice and humanity this system is    often mischievous to the people submitted to it government is almost always as it respects them in a state either of jealousy or indifference they are either neglected or pillaged—they are made places of banishment for the reception of the vilest part of society or places to be pillaged by minions and favourites whom it is considered desirable suddenly to enrich the sovereign at two thousand leagues distance from his subjects can be acquainted neither with their wants their interests their manners nor their character their most legitimate and weighty complaints weakened by reason of distance stripped of everything which might excite sensibility—of everything which might soften or subdue the pride of power are delivered without defence into the cabinet of the prince to the most insidious interpretations to the most unfaithful representations the colonists are still too happy if their demand of justice be not construed into a crime and if their most moderate remonstrances are not punished as acts of rebellion in a word little is cared for their affection—nothing is feared for their resentment—and their despair is contemned the most violent procedures are easily disguised under an appearance of necessity and the best intentions will not always suffice to prevent the sacrifice of the public to private interests if we proceed to consider the situation of colonies in detail we shall not fail to be struck with its disadvantages have the colonists any lawsuits in their mothercountry their witnesses must cross the seas they are at the mercy of their agents years glide away and the expenses of justice continually accumulate is there danger of a revolt are they threatened by an enemy succours arrive when the mischief is done the remedy oftentimes proves an additional calamity do they want food famine has laid waste the country before the mothercountry has been apprised of their necessities these are not mere assertions they are borne out by a faithful summary of the history of every colony it is tragical even to horror the evils suffered in these establishments from the ignorance the weakness or the insensibility of european governments exceed everything which can be imagined when we consider the multitude of men destroyed the fleets lost the treasures swallowed up the establishments pillaged—we are astonished to hear colonies spoken of as a means of enrichment the natural development of their fruitfulness and of their industry has been retarded for ages they have been covered a thousand times with ruins nations have impoverished themselves that they might hold them in servitude when they might have been sharers in their wealth by leaving to them the enjoyment of the benefits of liberty there are many arguments which prove the inutility of their dependence north america presents a striking fact which ought to enlighten europe has the trade of england diminished since her former subjects became free since she lost these immense possessions has she exhibited any symptoms of decay—has she had fewer sailors—has her maritime power been weakened she has found a new source of wealth in the independence of the united states the emancipation of this great country has carried thither a greater number of men more capital and more industry great britain relieved from the expense of defence and government has carried on a more advantageous commerce with a more numerous and wealthy people and it is thus that everything concurs in proving that the prosperity of a nation is a benefit in which all others participate every one in proportion to his means and that the colonial system is hurtful to europeans only because it is hurtful to the colonies let us however see the consequences which we ought to draw from these data   ought we not to form any colonial establishment certainly not with the intention of enriching the mothercountry it is always a certain expense for a contingent and far distant profit but we have seen that as a means of relieving the population—of preventing its excess by providing a vent for those who find themselves overburthened upon their native soil colonization offers an advantageous resource and when it is well conducted and free from any regulations which may hinder its prosperity there may result from it a new people with whom we shall possess all the connexions of language of social habits of natural and political ties   ought colonies already possessed to be emancipated yes certainly if we only consider the saving of the expenses of their government and the superior advantages of a free commerce but it is necessary to examine what is due to colonial establishments—to a family which has been created and which ought not to be abandoned can they maintain themselves will not their internal tranquillity be interrupted will not one class of the inhabitants be sacrificed to another for example the free men to the slaves or the slaves to the free men is it not necessary that they should be protected and directed in their condition of comparative weakness and ignorance is not their present state of dependence their safeguard against anarchy murder and pillage such are the points of view under which this question ought to be considered when we shall have ceased to consider colonies with the greedy eyes of fiscality the greater number of these inconveniences will cease of themselves let governments lay    aside all false mercantile notions and all jealousy of their subjects and everything which renders their yoke burthensome will fall at once there will no longer be any reason to fear hostile dispositions and wars for independence if wisdom alone were listened to the ordinary object of contention would be reversed—the mothercountry would desire to see her children powerful that they might become free and the colonies would fear the loss of that tutelary authority which gave them internal tranquillity and security against external foes §   nonagenda—narrow measures general observations—given in the shape of money encouragements so called special encouragements though they miss the good they aim at in the shape of special encouragement produce in the shape of general encouragement another good which they do not aim at—the addition made as above by forced frugality at the expense of justice given otherwise than in the shape of money—given by discouragements applied to rival branches—they make no addition to wealth by forced frugality and therefore make no addition at all to wealth discouragements to the import and thence to the production of foreign goods are discouragements to the export and thence to the production of the home goods that would have been taken by the foreigners in exchange for their goods of the favour shown to home goods in comparison with foreign goods what is the result that in each country men get their commodities either not so good or not so cheap and thence not in such plenty as they would otherwise such not only is the result of all these conflicting operations on the part of all nations taken together but to the extent of the operation would be so in each even if there were no such retaliation anywhere else giving birth or increase to this or that particular branch of productive industry under the notion of giving an increase thereby to the aggregate of the national mass of wealth is either useless or mischievous the aggregate mass of money employed in the shape of productive capital will in all branches of industry taken together be productive of so much per cent upon the amount of it—say    per cent or more or less according to the average rate of profit upon stock in the country in question which is in the inverse ratio of that portion of the mass of money in circulation which is employed within the year in the shape of productive capital to that portion of it which is employed as money is employed by a man who is said to spend his income if in one of these branches the rate of profit be greater than in others—in the one    per cent for example in the others but   —the greater the portion of capital employed in this most productive branch in preference to the other less productive ones the greater the annual addition to the aggregate mass of national wealth but so long as they do but know which of all the branches open to them is most productive individuals that have unengaged pecuniary capital to employ are already as completely disposed to employ it in this most profitable branch as all the exertions that can be employed by government can make them be† when by the exertions of government a mass of capital which otherwise would have gone into a branch of productive industry producing but    per cent is directed into a branch producing    per cent the profit by these exertions is not the    per cent but the difference between that and the    per cent viz the one per cent it is for the    per cent however and not the   per cent that credit is commonly taken by those statesmen who go to market for glory with the merit of affording encouragement to trade and if  0 per cent be the profit upon stock in the new branch the whole  0 per cent is taken credit for as profit by the measure though   per cent less have been the real fruit of it it is for the encouragement or creation of particular branches of trade or industry that statesmen have founded and defended and conquered or attempted to conquer colonies it is for the sake of colonies more than for anything else that governments have been at the expense of a marine and reciprocally for the sake of a marine that they have established or defended colonies in europe those who are governed pay for the expense in america it is become a principle that those    who govern should pay the expense it is in hindostan alone that men pay in wealth for that security which before they never knew a better bargain on both sides was never made ambition always blind stumbles sometimes upon profit—sometimes upon a loss at the command of chance man is always ready to govern no matter what the terms divide productive industry into any number of branches—for instance four as with adam smith—husbandry including mines and fishing manufactures for home consumption manufactures for foreign consumption and carrying trade every encouragement afforded to any one of the four branches operates to the amount in discouragement of all the others if however the encouragement be given in the shape of capital granted or lent it will make an addition to the amount of it to the aggregate of real capital and thence to the amount of a per centage upon that capital to the annual aggregate of growing wealth but the addition thus made to wealth will depend for its magnitude not on the choice made of the branch of industry unless as to an extremely minute part of it but on the addition made to the productive capital of the community at the expense of its income a mode that would bid as fair for disposing of the money to the best advantage would be to let a certain number of commercial men draw lots for the money with liberty to apply it each in his own way but what again would contribute in an equal degree to the same end is if the nation has a debt to employ the same sum in the buying in or paying off a portion of the debt for in that case the receivers of the money in lieu of annuities would employ each of them his money in some branch of industry in his own way of course under his own management or that of somebody to whom he lends the money the first course is attended with expense the other not in the first way the money being levied by taxes which whether direct or indirect bear principally upon income is so much added to national capital at the expense of national income—in the other way the money is so much taken from income on the same score but by the redemption of so much capital it extinguishes or transfers into the hands of government so much income in the latter case the community is exonerated from a charge upon its income—a charge to which it continues subject in the other case such are the general grounds from which it appears that these narrow measures deserve to be reckoned among the nonagenda—we shall proceed to examine a variety of examples of measures of these kinds more in detail §  0 nonagenda—narrow measures example   false encouragements—loans of all the means whereby a government may give a particular direction to production the loan of pecuniary capital to individuals to be employed in any particular branch of trade is the least open to objection it ought however at all times to be free from objection with respect to justice and prudence all the treasure of the government whence does it arise but from taxes and these taxes levied by constraint to take from one portion of its subjects to lend to another to diminish their actual enjoyments or the amount which they would have laid up in reserve is to do a certain evil for an uncertain good—is to sacrifice security for the hope of increasing wealth if loans of this nature were always faithfully repaid their injustice would be limited to a certain period let us suppose that the capital thus employed is £ 00000 and that the whole sum has been levied in one year—the injustice of the measure will have begun and ended in a year and if the money thus lent has produced an increase of industry it is an advantage to be set in opposition to the evil arising from the tax but these loans have a natural tendency to be ill employed wasted or stolen monarchs and their ministers are as liable to be deceived in the choice of individuals as in the selection of particular branches of commerce those who succeed with them prove only that they possess the talent of persuasion or understand the practices of courts but these are not the things which produce success in trade it may be seen in the work of mirabeau upon the prussian monarchy that frederick ii with all his vigilance and severity was often deceived by the ignorance or dishonesty of those who obtained from his avaricious credulity loans of this nature thus in the train of the first unjust tax for the formation of the capital lent follow other taxes rendered necessary to replace the thefts and dilapidations to which the first has been exposed it is also most probable that the capital thus employed will only be applied upon branches of industry less productive than those towards which it would naturally have directed itself what is the argument of the borrower that the trade he wishes to establish is new or that it is necessary to support an established trade but why should the government intermeddle with it if not because individuals who consider their own interests are not willing to meddle with it the presumption is therefore against the enterprise suppose even that by chance this loan should take the most advantageous direction    possible the loan is not justified by this profit it was unnecessary for employing capital in the most advantageous manner it is only necessary that the most advantageous employment should be known if it be not well employed it is because a better employment is not known it is knowledge which is wanted it is proper to teach and not to lend if the government cannot tell which is the most advantageous employment of capital it is still less able to employ it well if it can tell which is the best employment that is all it need do if the money of government had not taken this direction that of individuals would had they been instructed and left free there are circumstances in which loans of this nature are always justifiable when they are not employed for the encouragement of new enterprises but only to afford support to particular branches of commerce labouring under temporary difficulties and which need only to be sustained for a short time till the crisis of peril or suspension is past this is not a speculation on the part of government but rather an assurance against a calamity which it seeks to prevent or to lighten in such cases of distress individuals will not of themselves assist the merchants whose affairs are thus in danger it is necessary therefore that assistance be supplied and when supplied it is not in the way of regulation but of remedy §    nonagenda—narrow measures example   gift or gratuitous loan were we to judge from the number of instances in which it has been adopted we should conclude that gratuitous grants of capital for the encouragement of commerce were most excellent measures their inconveniences are of the same kinds as those of loans but they greatly exceed them in degree in case of a loan if it be repaid the same sum may serve the same purpose a second time and so of the rest the oppressive act by which the government obtained the capital need not be repeated but if in place of being lent it be given—so often as this favour is repeated so often must the amount be levied by taxes and upon every occasion it may be said that the produce of the tax is lost if we consider the use which might have been made of it in lightening the public burthens sometimes capital has been lent with this view without interest—sometimes at an interest below the ordinary rate in the first case if it be repaid it is not the capital which is lost but only the interest in the second case it is not all the interest but only the difference between the lower and the ordinary rate it is still the same false policy as to its kind all the difference is in the degree it may be observed that gratuitous grants are more likely to be wasted than loans it may be because in the latter case responsibility is always incurred it may be because money received as a gift tends to produce prodigality as it has been obtained without labour it seems to have the less value in some cases capital has been given not in the shape of money but in that of goods by advancing to a manufacturer for example those articles which he wants for the completion of his work this plan may have the good effect of insuring the employment of the articles furnished upon the intended object those articles however with which the government interferes are ordinarily dearer and worse in quality than those which the individual with the same sum of money could have obtained at his own choice it is not the best method of treating men worthy of confidence and it will not succeed with those who are unworthy of trust since after they are put in possession of them they can convert the articles into money and spend the amount there may be measures which would obviate this danger—inspection suretyship c but when it regards a plan radically bad the discussion of the comparative inconveniences of any particular scheme whereby the risk may be diminished is not worth the labour it would cost §    nonagenda—narrow measures example   bounties upon production this mode of encouragement much exceeds the two former in the career of absurdity in the two former cases it was an expense a risk without sufficient reason for supposing it would prove successful and even without sufficient reason in case of success but a bounty is an expense incurred with the certainty of not obtaining the object sought and even because it is certain that it cannot be obtained in the case of a bounty upon production it is not only the end which is absurd but the means also which possess this particular character of contributing nothing towards the end it is uniformly because the trade in question is disadvantageous that it is necessary to bestow money upon its maintenance if it were advantageous it would maintain itself it is because the workman is not able to obtain from the buyer a price for his merchandise which will yield an ordinary profit that it is necessary that he should receive from the government a bounty which shall make up the difference whether the kind of product upon which it operates be advantageous or not the bounty has no efficacy in increasing the ability of the producer to augment it since it follows the production—since he receives it when the thing is done and not before it is clear that  0 he has possessed other means of producing it the bounty may have operated upon his inclination but it cannot have contributed to his ability bounties have been bestowed upon particular branches of trade for all sorts of reasons—on account of their antiquity on account of their novelty—because they were flourishing because they were decaying—because they were advantageous because they were burthensome—because there were hopes of improving them and because it was feared they would grow worse—so that there is no species of commerce in the world which could not by one or other of these contrary reasons claim this kind of favour during every moment of its existence it is in the case of an old branch of trade that the evil of such measures is most enormous and in that of a new one that its inefficacy is most striking a longestablished branch of trade is in general widely extended this extent furnishes the best reason for those who solicit these favours for its support and to give it effect it ought at the same time to be represented as gaining and losing—gaining that there may be a disposition to preserve it—losing that there may be a disposition to assist it in the case of a new branch of trade or industry the futility of the measure is its principal feature here there is no reason which carries the mask of an apparent necessity—no pompous descriptions of its extent all which can be alleged is that once established it will become great and lucrative but what it wants is to be established what then is done for its establishment measures are taken which can only operate after it is established when the trade is established it will have such great success that it will yield for example fifty per cent profit but to establish it is requires such large advances that it is doubtful if those who possess capital will make them on account of the risks which are almost always inseparable from every new undertaking what course does the government pursue does it give capital no this would be foolish does it lend capital no this would be to run too great risk it will give a bounty upon the article when it shall have been made till then it says we shall give no money thus to the fifty per cent you will gain by your merchandize we will add a bounty of ten per cent very well and according to this reasoning at what time will you refuse assistance you refuse so long as the bestowment of it will be useful—you grant it in order that something may be done and you do not give it till it is already done by means independent of you mistrust shortsightedness a suspicious disposition and a confused head are very susceptible of union why are bounties preferred to advance of capital they are afraid of being deceived in the latter case if £ 0000 are given at once nothing may perhaps be done to avoid this risk they give when the thing is done £ 0000 per annum which they will never receive again instead of being beneficial the expense to the state becomes more burthensome in proportion as the trade becomes extended the bounty instituted for one reason is continued on an opposite account at first it was given in order to obtain—in the end it is continued for fear of losing the particular branch of trade what would have been necessary for its establishment was a trifle—what must be paid for its continuance knows no bounds the capital bestowed upon a new branch of industry for an experiment is always comparatively a small sum but what is given as a bounty is always or at least it is always hoped that it will be a large one for unless a large quantity of the merchandize be manufactured and sold and consequently unless a large bounty be paid for its production and sale the object is considered as unaccomplished—it is considered that the bounty has not answered its end when the article is one which would not have been manufactured without the bounty all that is paid is lost but if it be one of those which even without the bounty the manufacturers would have found it their interest to produce only a portion of the bounty is lost as it makes an addition and that a very sensible addition to the ordinary profit of the trade it attracts a great number of individuals towards this particular enterprise by their competition the article is sold at the lowest rate and the diminution of price is in proportion to the bounty itself allowance being made for the necessary expenses of soliciting and receiving it in this state of things it would appear at first sight that the bounty does neither good nor harm the public gains by the reduction of price as much as it loses by the tax which is the effective cause of this reduction this would be true if the individuals who paid the tax in the one case were the same who profited by the bounty in the other—if the measure of this profit were exactly the measure of their contribution—if they received the one at the same time that they paid the other and if all the labour lost in these    operations had not cost anything but all these suppositions are contrary to fact there are not two taxes which affect all the members of the state—there is not one which affects them all equally the tax is paid a long time before the indemnification by the reduction of price is received and the expenses of this useless circulation are always considerable after all that can be said it is clear that a bounty upon production cannot in the long run produce an increased abundance of the article in question whatsoever may be the diminution of price which may result from it the profit which the producer will obtain is not greater than before—the only difference is that it comes to him from another hand it is not individuals who give it him in a direct manner—it is the government without the bounty those who pay for the article are those who enjoy it with the bounty they only pay directly a part of the price—the rest is paid by the public in general that is to say more or less by those who derive no advantages from it although a bounty upon production adds nothing to the abundance of any article of general consumption it diminishes the price to the buyer suppose that in scotland there were a bounty upon the production of oats and that the bounty were paid by a tax upon beer brewed from this grain oats would not be more abundant than before but they would be sold at a less price to the buyer though the merchant would make the same profit whilst the beer brewed with this grain would be proportionally dearer the consumer of oats would not find himself richer than before but for the same price he would have a greater quantity of this grain in the form of food and less in the shape of drink i speak here of relative abundance in proportion to the ordinary consumption i speak of superfluity compared with habitual wants the lower this commodity is in price compared with others the greater will be the demand for it more will be produced in consequence of the increased demand but more will not be produced than is demanded the commodity as it respects abundance will remain upon the same footing as before if a superfluity be required—if a quantity be required exceeding what is commonly produced other measures must be resorted to than a bounty on production if a bounty upon production could be justified it would seem that it ought to be so in the case where the article thus favoured was an article of general consumption—as corn in england oats in scotland potatoes in ireland and rice in india but it would only appear so as a means of producing equality and not under any other point of view in fact this measure does not tend to produce abundance what it does is to take the money out of the pockets of the rich to put it into the pockets of the poor a commodity of general consumption is always the most necessary of all the articles of life—it is always that of which the poor make the greatest use the richer a man is the more he consumes of other commodities besides this universal commodity suppose then a bounty upon the production of oats in scotland if nothing be consumed there but oats or if there be only a tax upon oats the persons who reap the advantage of the bounty would be those who bear the burthen of the tax and that in the same proportion inasmuch as the expense of levying the tax would be the only result of this measure but commodities of all kinds are consumed in scotland and taxes are there levied upon a great variety of commodities oats the commodity of the poor being the object not of a tax but of a bounty and the articles consumed by the rich being the object not of a bounty but of a tax from the produce of which the bounty upon the production of oats is paid the result will be that the poor will obtain the commodity of which they make the greatest use at a lower price i agree to this but does it follow that their condition will be bettered not at all oats will be sold to the poor at a lower price but they will have less money wherewith to buy them all the means of subsistence in this class resolve themselves into the wages of labour but the wages of labour necessarily depend upon the degree of opulence which a country possesses that is upon the quantity of capital applicable to the purchase of labour in connexion with the number of those whose labour is for sale the low price resulting from the bounty will produce no advantage to the labourers whilst the wealth of the country remains the same if the commodity be lowered in price they will be less paid or what comes to the same thing as they work for a ration of oats they will be obliged to give more labour for this ration if oats are at a lower price all that relates to this mode of encouragement may be summed up in a few words— the natural course of things gives a bounty upon the application of industry to the most advantageous branches—a bounty of which the division will always be made in the most equitable manner if artificial bounties take the same course as the natural they are superfluous—if they take a different course they are injurious    §    nonagenda—narrow measures example   exemptions from taxes on production an exemption from a tax capable of being imposed upon any article in the hands of the maker or seller is a modification of a bounty upon production it is a disguised bounty this kind of negative favour may be extended to every species of tax upon trade the methods of encouragement in this way are as numerous as those of discouragement if of two rival manufactures the one be weighed down by a tax and the other free that which is taxed is in respect of that which is not in the same situation as if both were free from taxes and a bounty were bestowed upon one but each manufacture is a rival to every other if this rivalry be not special it is at least general and indirect for what reason because the power of purchasing is limited as to every individual by his fortune and his credit every article which is for sale and which he can desire is in a state of competition with every other the more he expends for the one the less can he spend for the others exemption from taxes upon production cannot be blamed absolutely for it is to be wished if the thing were possible that there were no taxes but relatively any particular exemption may be blamed when the article exempted has nothing which justifies this particular exemption if it were equally fit for taxation the favour granted to it is an injury to other productions that an object fit for taxation be exempt is an evil it renders necessary some other tax which by the supposition is less proper or it allows some injurious tax to remain whilst as to advantage there is none if more of this untaxed merchandise be produced less is produced of that which is taxed the evil of an unjust tax is all the difference between a more or less eligible tax and the worst of those which exist §    nonagenda—narrow measures example   bounties on exportation in the case of bounties upon exportation the error is not so palpable as in that of bounties upon production but the evil is greater in both cases the money is equally lost the difference is in the persons who receive it what you pay for production is received by your countrymen—what you pay for exportation you bestow upon strangers it is an ingenious scheme for inducing a foreign nation to receive tribute from you without being aware of it a little like that of the irishman who passed his light guinea by cleverly alipping it between two halfpence as a bounty upon production may sustain a disadvantageous trade which would cease without it by forming its sole profit it is also possible that it may for a short time increase the profit of an advantageous trade which would support itself without this aid does the bounty support a disadvantageous trade it does not produce a farthing of profit more than would have existed without it left to itself this trade would have ceased and made way for a better and the community loses the profits of a capital better employed in lucrative undertakings does the bounty support an advantageous trade the evil in the end will be greater because the extra profit drawing more rivals into this career their competition will reduce the price so low that the bounty will constitute at last the whole profit of this trade however till the price be thus reduced the bounty is a net gain for the first undertakers and the consumers being our fellowcountrymen a part of this illemployed money turns to their advantage by the low price of the commodity but in the case of a bounty upon exportation the nation which pays it never receives any advantage everything is lost as if it were thrown into the sea or at least as if it had been given to foreigners without this bounty the article would have been exported or it would not it would have been exported if foreigners were willing to pay a price which would cover the expense of the manufacturing of exporting and the ordinary profit of trade it would not have been exported if they did not offer a sufficient price in the first case they would have obtained the article by paying its worth in the second case this disadvantageous commerce would not have been carried on suppose a bounty upon exportation what are its effects the foreigners who heretofore had found the article too dear become disposed to purchase it why because you pay them to induce them to do so the more government gives to the exporter the less need the foreigner give but it is clear that he will not pay more than the lowest price which will satisfy the exporter he need not give more since if one merchant refuse to supply him at this price another will be quite ready to do it suppose an article of our manufacture already purchased by foreign nations without a bounty upon its exportation what will happen if a bounty be given solely the lowering of its price to the foreigners a bounty of one penny for every pound in weight is given upon an article which sold for fivepence per pound the manufacturer would not have found it worth while to have sold it for less than fivepence per pound he will now however find the same profit in selling it for fourpence because his own government makes    up the difference he will sell at fourpence because if he do not some other will and because in this case instead of selling for fivepence it may happen that he will not sell at all thus the whole which government gives is a net saving to the foreigners the effect in the way of encouragement is nothing the whole which is exported with the bounty is neither more nor less than would be without it though a bounty do not render such a branch of trade more flourishing than it would otherwise have been it will not render it less flourishing but the more flourishing it becomes the greater will be the loss to the nation disadvantageous branches of trade are often spoken of people are uneasy—they fear that certain manufactures left to themselves will be unprofitable it arises from error it is not possible that any branch of trade left to itself can be disadvantageous to a nation it may become so by the interference of government by bounties and other favours of the same nature it is not to the merchant himself that it can become disadvantageous for the moment he perceives there is nothing to be gained he will not persevere in it but to the nation in general it may become so—to the nation in its quality of contributor and the amount of the bounty is the exact amount of the loss the irishman who passed his light guinea was very cunning but there have been french and english more cunning than he who have taken care not to be imposed upon by his trick when a cunning individual perceives you have gained some point with him his imagination mechanically begins to endeavour to get the advantage of you without examining whether he would not do better were he to leave you alone do you appear to believe that the matter in question is advantageous to you he is convinced by this circumstance that it is proportionally disadvantageous to him and that the safest line of conduct for him to adopt is to be guided by your judgment well acquainted with this disposition of the human mind an englishman laid a wager and placed himself upon the pontneuf the most public thoroughfare in paris offering to the passengers a crown of six francs for a piece of twelve sous during half a day he only sold two or three since individuals in general are such dupes to their selfmistrust is it strange that governments having to manage interests which they so little understand and of which they are so jealous should have fallen into the same errors a government believing itself clever has given a bounty upon the exportation of an article in order to force the sale of it among a foreign nation what does this other nation in consequence alarmed at the sight of this danger it takes all possible methods for its prevention when it has ventured to prohibit the article everything is done it has refused the sixfranc pieces for twelve sous when it has not dared to prohibit it it has balanced this bounty by a counterbounty upon some article that it exports not daring to refuse the crowns of six francs for twelve sous it has cleverly slipped some little diamond between the two pieces of money—and thus the cheat is cheated a strife of this nature painted in its true colours and stripped of the eclât which dazzles by the magnitude of the object and the dignity of the agents appears too absurd to be possible but for one example among a thousand we may refer to what has happened between england and ireland respecting the trade in linens §    nonagenda—narrow measures example   prohibition of rival productions this pretended mode of encouragement can never be productive of good but it may produce evil—hurtful or useless such is the alternative   i say useless it is a particular privilege of this exercise of power to be employed in certain cases without doing any harm and these cases occur when the branch of production or trade which is prohibited would not have been introduced even had there been no prohibition in former times it was declared felony in england to import pollards and crocards a kind of base coin at that time this prohibition is yet in existence without producing any inconvenience if with the intention of encouraging the increase of poultry or with any other similarly patriotic view the importation and increase of phœnixes were prohibited it is clear that the trade in poultry would neither gain nor lose much among all the species of manufacture which england with so much anxiety has prohibited to her colonies there are many which in comparison with agriculture are no more suitable to the americans than the breeding of phœnixes the cultivation of pineapples in their fields or the manufacture of stuffs from spiders webs were the articles of foreign manufacture loaded with the expenses of importation neither better in quality nor lower in price than the articles of home manufacture they would not be imported the prohibition exists in the nature of things   hurtful by the prohibition of a rival manufacture you wish to insure the success    of a favoured manufacture and you at once create all the mischiefs of a monopoly you enable the monopolists to sell at a higher rate and you diminish the number of enjoyments you grant them the singular privilege of manufacturing inferior articles or of ceasing to improve them you weaken the principle of emulation which exists only when there is competition in short you favour the enriching of a small number of individuals at the expense of all those who would have enjoyed the benefit you give to a few bad manufacturers an excessive degree of wealth instead of supplying the wants of ten thousand good ones you also wound the feelings of the people by the idea of injustice and violence attached to the partiality of this measure prohibitions of foreign manufactures are most frequently applied to those objects which foreigners can supply less expensively on account of some peculiar advantage arising from their soil or their industry by such prohibitions you refuse to participate in this natural advantage which they enjoy you prefer what costs you more capital and labour you employ your workmen and your capital at a loss rather than receive from the hands of a rival what he offers you of a better quality or at a lower price if you hope by this means to support a trade which would otherwise cease it may be supported it is true but left to itself capital would only leave this channel where its disadvantages are unavoidable to enter upon others where it would be employed with greater advantage the greatest of all errors is to suppose that by prohibitions whether of foreign or domestic manufactures more trade can be obtained the quantity of capital the efficient cause of all increase remaining the same all the increase thus given to a favoured commerce is so much taken from other branches the collateral evils of this prohibitory system ought not to be forgotten it is a source of expense of vexation and of crimes the expense most evidently lost is that of the customhouse officers the inspectors and other individuals employed but the greatest loss is that of labour—both of the unproductive labour of the smuggler and of those who are or who appear to be employed in the prevention of smuggling to destroy foreign commerce it is only necessary to sell everything and to purchase nothing—such is the folly which has been passed off as the depth of political wisdom among statesmen among the transactions between nation and nation men have consented at great expense to support disadvantageous manufactures that they may not buy of their rivals we do not see such monstrous extravagance on the part of individuals if a merchant were to act thus we should say he was hastening to ruin but his interest guides him much better it is only public functionaries who are capable of this mistake and they only when they are acting on account of others covetousness desires to possess more than it can hold malevolence likes better to punish itself than to allow a benefit to an adversary to have its eyes greater than its belly is a proverb which nurses apply to children and which always applies to nations an individual corrects this fault by experience the politician when once affected by it never corrects himself when a child refuses physic mothers and nurses sometimes induce it to take it by threatening to give it to the dog or the cat how many statesmen—children badly educated—persist in supporting a commerce by which they lose that they may avoid the morfication of allowing a rival nation to carry it on the statesman who believes he can infinitely extend commerce without perceiving that it is limited by the amount of capital is the child whose eyes are larger than his belly the statesman who strives to retain a disadvantageous commerce because he fears another nation will gain it is the child who swallows the bitter pill for fear it should be given to the cat or the dog these are not noble comparisons but they are just ones—when errors cover themselves with an imposing mask one is tempted to set them in a light which will show them to be ridiculous §    nonagenda—narrow measures example   prohibition of rival imports in regard to the prohibition of rival imports simply inefficacious or mischievous is here the alternative if the foreign article cannot when imported after payment of the expense of importation be had as cheap in comparison of its quality as the home article meant to be favoured it will not be imported—so long as that is the case a prohibition is put upon it by nature if had it not been for the prohibition it could have been sold here cheaper the prohibition is in point of burthen a tax upon us to the amount of the difference in price i say in point of burthen for as to that benefit which it is the property of a real tax to produce viz a supply for expenditure or a relief to an equal amount from the burthen of other taxes it has no existence it is upon the same footing with a tax the produce of which as soon as collected should be thrown into the sea as to the increase of wealth in general the particular encouragement in question is for the general reason so often given of no avail the quantity of capital the efficient cause of wealth remaining the same whatever is added in consequence to the favoured trade is so much taken from the rest    §    non agenda—narrow measures example   taxation of rival branches of home manufactures the natural and only original object of taxation is revenue but considered merely as confined to that object it does not belong to our present purpose measures are however to be considered with regard to their eventual effects of all kinds—as well those which were not designed if there be any as those which were a tax upon one of two rival branches of trade can have no effect in favour of the other but in so far as it operates as a prohibition if the same quantity of the commodity meant to be discouraged be sold notwithstanding the tax as would have been sold without the tax the advantage gained by the commodity meant to be favoured amounts to nothing so far as it operates as a prohibition we have seen that good it can do none—it only transfers capital from one employment to another without producing any increase of wealth harm it may do and is likely enough to do—though we have seen that it may also happen not to do any as a tax it may do good or harm according to its particular nature good if it stand instead of a worse—harm if it stand instead of one less burthensome §    nonagenda—narrow measures example   taxation of rival imports whether the article thus taxed in the view of favouring another be an article of home production or an article of import makes in point of advantage no sort of difference as far as it prevents the import it has the effect of a prohibition in which capacity we have seen that with regard to the general increase of wealth it is of no use as far as it fails of preventing the import it gives no encouragement to the particular trade in question nor consequently to the particular portion of wealth employed in that trade its effect is to levy money on the subject in quality of a tax but the persons on whom the money is levied are our own people as much as if it were among the articles produced at home as such it may either be a good or a bad tax as it may happen—though in regard to its temporary consequences it cannot be productive of all the mischief of which a tax on a home manufacture is capable of being productive §    nonagenda—narrow measures example  0 drawbacks on exportation what is called giving a drawback on exportation is the restitution of a tax already levied—from the amount already levied in way of a tax a man is permitted to draw back so much of what he has disbursed what a bounty on exportation is to a bounty on production a drawback is to a simple exemption from a tax levied on produce in the first case of each pair foreigners come in for their share of the boon indiscriminately with our own people in the other case they get the whole of it in all cases the expected advantage is equally imaginary in one point of view however the drawback is a more expensive way of throwing away money than the bounty in the case of drawback the money is received with one hand in order to be given back again with the other and each operation is attended with a separate expense to this public expense is to be added the private expense which the individual must be at to pay the money and get it back again—an expense of which the trouble and loss of time which in the account of the financier go for nothing always form a very considerable part often the most considerable instances† have not been wanting in which the value of the supposed favour has been reduced literally to nothing by the trouble of obtaining it §  0 nonagenda—narrow measures example    nonimportation agreements nonimportation agreements as far as they extend have the effect of prohibitions—happily they are not so extensive in their action so frequent so steady so well executed good they do none happily wanting the force of prohibitory laws the mischief they do is seldom so extensive §    nonagenda—narrow measures example    premiums for the importation of foreign arts and hands that there are cases in which it would be extremely well worth the while of individuals to pay extraordinary prices to get workmen from abroad is not to be doubted meaning to employ my money to the best account in the way of trade or manufacture and looking round as far as my reach of thought and faculties and opportunities will carry me if i observe a branch of manufacture for instance new as yet to my country and which if imported from some country abroad would pay me for example five per cent interest for my capital more than any other branch i have been able to find—this five per cent would be so much more gained to me and through me to the nation i belong to than if i had embarked my capital in that one of the oldestablished trades which of all that have fallen    under my cognizance would be the most advantageous extra expenses there doubtless are and difficulties incident to the business of getting workmen from a foreign country even if there are no laws in that country or our own to add to the amount but all difficulties and expenses of this nature i suppose provided for and surmounted as in many instances they actually have been still then the same argument and still with undiminished force the more evidently advantageous for the individual the employment of his money in this way the more evidently unnecessary is it for government to employ that of the nation in this way in the first case the burthen is borne by him who receives the benefit—in the other case by those who receive no part of it in the first case the probability of success in the project and the security against unnecessary expense are at their highest pitch—in the other at their lowest on the part of governments in general the passion for getting arts and hands from abroad does not appear so conspicuous as the dread of losing their own §    nonagenda—narrow measures example    fixation of prices the limitation of the price of commodities may have two opposite objects—  the rendering them dearer   the rendering them cheaper the first of these objects is least natural so many commodities so many means of enjoyment to put them within the reach of the largest number is to contribute to the general happiness this motive however is not unexampled and intoxicating liquors are an instance of its exercise legislators have often endeavoured and not without reason to increase their price with the design of limiting their consumption on account of their dearness but imposing a tax upon them suffices to increase their price there is no necessity for resorting to the method of direct limitation is the design of these limitations the obtaining of the article at a low rate—the method will scarcely answer its end before the existence of the law the article was sold at what may be called its average or natural price that is to say it was confined within certain limits—  by the competition between the buyers and the sellers   by a competition between the branch of trade in question and that of other branches to which the merchant might find it to his advantage to transfer his capital does the law endeavour to fix the price at a lower rate than this average or natural price—it may obtain a transient success but by little and little this branch of trade will be abandoned if the constraint be increased the evil will grow worse the constraint in fact can only act upon the existing stock this being sold at a forced price the merchant will take care not to replace it what can the law effect can it oblige him to replenish his storehouse with the same commodities no legislator has ever attempted it or at least no one has ever attempted it with success this would be to convert the officers of justice into commercial agents it would be to give them a right to dispose of the capitals of the merchants and to employ the merchants themselves as their clerks the most common fixation has been that of the rate of interest it has already been discussed see ch iii §§      the fixation of the price of wages especially with regard to agriculture has often been proposed and even carried into effect for the most opposite reasons to prevent what is considered as an excess—to remedy what has been regarded as a deficiency in this latter point of view this measure is liable to great objection to fix the minimum of wages is to exclude from labour many workmen who would otherwise have been employed it is to aggravate the distress you wish to relieve in fact all that can be done is limited to determining that if they are employed they shall not receive less than the price fixed it is useless to enact that they shall be employed where is the farmer where is the manufacturer who will submit to employ labourers who cost them more than they yield in a word a regulation which fixes the minimum of wages is a regulation of a prohibitory nature which excludes from the competition all whose labour is not worth the price fixed the fixation of the rate of wages in order to prevent their excess is a favour conferred on the rich at the expense of the poor—on the master at the expense of the workman it is a violation with regard to the weakest class of the principles of security and property §    wealth—means of increase if we trace the progress of wealth in its natural channel we shall clearly perceive that the interposition of government is only beneficial and necessary when employed in the maintenance of security in the removal of obstacles or the dissemination of knowledge wealth may be increased— i by increasing the efficacy of labour ii by increasing the number of labourers iii by the more advantageous employment of capital iv by increasing the mass of capital v by means of trade i by increasing the efficacy of labour this subject might furnish most interesting and instructive historic details we shall confine ourselves to a simple enumeration of the means whereby it may be accomplished    the efficacy of labour may be augmented—   by increase of skill and dexterity   by saving the time occupied by superfluous movements   by the invention of machines   by employing instead of human labour more powerful and less costly prime movers—as water air fire explosive powders and beasts of burthen the two first advantages are obtained by the division of labour the third necessarily results from it adam smith has developed this grand means of attaining perfection with great diligence and so to speak particular affection he relates that the process of converting a morsel of brass wire into a pin requires eighteen operations and employs as many different workmen of whom the greater part borrow the assistance of machines—whereby although ten workmen would not separately have been able to make more than   0 pins aday they are enabled to make   00 it is hence that this little branch of national wealth which affords a more commodious adjustment than the buckles of the romans and the skewers employed by queen elizabeth has increased in proportion what our country people throw away would have been luxuries in the court of darius   by the simplification of intermediate processes   by the saving of materials the extension given to the quantity of gold employed in gilding silver wire is an example equally suited to astonish the natural philosopher and to charm the political economist chemistry has introduced a multitude of economical processes into all the arts it has taught the means of economically applying fuel—of producing great effect with little expense it has substituted less costly for more expensive materials it has imitated and even rivalled the productions of nature   by the improvement of the products that is to say in proportion to the price it is thus that porcelain has supplanted the coarse pottery of former times—the potteries of wedgwood and bentley have excelled the porcelain of china   by the diminution of the expense of carriage by the multiplication of roads canals and iron railways the advantage which the low countries have derived from their canals is incalculable governments may often usefully interfere in respect to these objects either by advancing the capitals and sharing in the benefit or by granting to the individuals interested the powers necessary for making arrangements among themselves and defraying the expense when however it is necessary for a government to take charge of these works it is a proof that confidence does not exist i mean confidence in the stability of the actual order of things and in the protection of the laws no other circumstance speaks so highly in praise of the british government as the disposition of individuals to unite in carrying on great undertakings in canals docks ports c a disposition to undertake such works denotes the prevalence of a feeling of security which unites the future to the present and embraces an horizon of large extent the advantage of machines consists in the increased efficacy of labour to reduce the number of men employed upon any species of labour by half without diminishing the quantity of the product is in fact the same thing as doubling the number of men employed with the same degree of efficacy as before that which required two thousand men for its performance being performed by one thousand there remains one thousand men who may be employed either upon similar or other works but this supposes that the workmen no longer required in the production of a given quantity of labour are otherwise employed for if they were without employment the quantity of wealth produced would remain the same after the invention as before if a manufacturer found himself thus in a condition to execute with one thousand workmen what had heretofore required two thousand it appears at first sight that the natural result would be that he would employ the two thousand workmen to produce a double quantity of work but unless his pecuniary capital be augmented it will be impossible for him to employ the same number the new machines the new warehouses required for this increase of produce require a proportionate increase of capital the most ordinary case therefore will be the reduction of the number of workmen and as it respects them the consequence is a temporary distress it is upon this circumstance that the popular opposition to the improvement of machines depends it is a very reasonable opposition on the part of the handicraftsmen it is they who suffer whilst the benefit is in the first instance for the manufacturer and in perpetuity for the public who obtain a better article at a less price there are two kinds of countries where this objection has no force—countries badly peopled and countries where the people are slaves do you desire an increase of population—do you desire children who may become workmen in future—i give you fullgrown men—workmen actually prepared you would charge yourself with the expense of their education—i relieve you of it you are willing to receive foreigners and i give you natives such is the language an inventor may address to a sovereign whilst to the individual proprietor he may say—with one hundred slaves you are now able to raise a    certain quantity from your mines with fifty you will in future be able to raise the same quantity if it were necessary to support the others in idleness where would be the evil in stationary or retrograde countries where the dismissed workman cannot easily find a new employment to which to apply himself where there exists no capital ready to furnish him employment that suits him this objection would not be without force it is however a transient evil to which transient remedies ought to be applied ii by the increase of the number of labourers i have nothing further to add upon this subject to what is said in the chapter on population ch iv but i shall point out those things which in an indirect manner tend to produce this effect   by the banishment of all prejudices unfavourable to labour honour has tied the hands of some—religion of others some have been kept in a state of perpetual idleness—others in a state of periodical idleness in some catholic countries the saints days occupy more than one hundred working days the loss of these days alone ought not only to be considered but also the bad habits which this idleness encourages they have not worked upon the saints day they do not work on the day following because they were intoxicated the day past   the amount of labour may be increased by giving productive employments to those classes of men who owing to their station in life produce nothing—to prisoners beggars monks and soldiers it has been pretended that to make a good soldier an individual ought to follow no other trade an exception ought at least to be made in favour of those kinds of labour which may be useful in war as the digging of ditches the construction of bridges the throwing up of embankments and the formation and repair of roads these employments afford an inexhaustible means of increasing the most permanent part of the capital of a nation   substitute alluring for coercive motives—reward for punishment with suitable precautions abolish all services in kind all forced labour and slavery a country peopled with serfs will be always poor pay for labour in money and the reward mingling drop after drop with the labour will sweeten its bitterness every free labourer is worth two slaves this reflection is often presented in this work but it is so just and favourable to humanity that it cannot be too often repeated we ought not to be afraid to repeat it iii the more advantageous employment of capital we have already seen that under the guidance of individual interest capital of itself takes the most advantageous direction—at least certainly more advantageous than when under the guidance of government of all employments of capital the most advantageous for the state is the cultivation of the earth it is at the same time as has been demonstrated by adam smith the most beneficial in itself and the most attached to the state most advantageous the capitalist must find it nearly as advantageous as any other since unless this be the case he will not engage in it and this after he has deducted the rent he pays to the landlord and which often amounts to a third of the produce it is thus that the state gains by this employment more than it can possibly gain by any other more attached to the state the workman may carry away his industry the moneylender his capital the merchant may change his warehouses but the farmer cannot carry away the land for the encouragement of this most advantageous employment of capital what ought government to do nothing that is to say nothing in the way of positive encouragement for it cannot too completely remove the clogs and obstacles to the free alienation of landed property† or too greatly favour the conversion of goods held in common into individual property‡ the condition most favourable to the prosperity of agriculture exists when there are no entails no unalienable endowments no common lands no right of redemption no tithes or taxes or dues which punish industry and levy a contribution upon agriculture increasing in proportion to the expenses incurred and the greater care paid to cultivation generally speaking the great landed proprietors give themselves little care about the improvement of their domains some leave large tracts of country sufficient for the maintenance of hundreds of families in a state of nature that they may enjoy the pleasures of the chase others prodigal in proportion to their wealth expend everything in present enjoyments and trouble themselves but little with the future where the system of leases and farms is upon a good footing the evil is not great but it is altogether otherwise when the administration is in the hands of a superintendent still less interested than his masters in the increase of the rent were    large properties divided into three or four parts the proprietors would be animated with an entirely different spirit the spur of necessity would render them intelligent and industrious where a nobleman employs twenty gardeners in raising pine apples and taking care of bowling greens five manufacturers would employ twenty husbandmen in producing corn for themselves and a hundred workmen but let it not be supposed that i recommend agrarian laws and forced divisions this would be to cut off an arm in order to avoid a scratch in the scale of public utility so far as it depends upon the general wealth after agriculture come those manufactures whose products are sold within the country after these the manufactures whose products are exported and in the last place the carrying trade adam smith has demonstrated this thus much for theory it does not follow that in practice it would be proper to favour a branch of industry higher in the scale at the expense of one which is placed below it they all exercise a reciprocal influence upon one another and benefits are divided among them with sufficient equality if for a moment one branch become more advantageous than the others a greater number of adventurers are soon drawn towards this side and the equilibrium is not long in reestablishing itself if any species of industry be more constantly useful to a nation it is because the benefit more certainly remains—because the wealth which it produces is more secure iv by increasing the mass of capital the mass of capital is increased when the products of labour exceed the amount of products consumed the addition made to the wealth of a nation in one year is the total amount of the savings of all the individuals composing that nation in that year it is the difference between the values produced or imported and the values destroyed or exported in the course of the same year the addition made to the pecuniary wealth of a community is in the same manner the difference between the sum produced or imported and the sum destroyed or exported in the period in question in the case of an individual increase of money is increase of wealth if his fortune consist today of one thousand guineas and he has two thousand tomorrow he will be twice as rich as he was the day before he can command twice the quantity of the products of all kinds of labour the case is not the same with a nation if its coin be today £ 000000 sterling and tomorrow it were to be £ 000000 its wealth would not be doubled as was that of the individual as it respects its internal condition the nation would not be richer than before instead of having at its command a double quantity of productions it would only have the same it is true that in exporting to other nations this suddenly acquired mass the community in question would obtain an addition to the mass of its nonpecuniary wealth but in proportion as this exchange is made the case which we have supposed does not continue the same it ceases to possess the additional million of coin this apparent contradiction between the two cases is easily removed when an individual finds the quantity of coin which he possesses suddenly doubled the value of the coin is not diminished by this addition the community to which he belongs does not possess more than before supposing that the amount has not been received from abroad the proportion between the amount of coin and the things to be sold remains exactly the same the value of all the things sold in the course of a year is equal in value to the sum of the coin given in exchange for them that is to the value of the actual quantity of the coin multiplied by the number of times it has been exchanged each of these masses is equal in value to the other since by the supposition the one has been exchanged for the other this equality exists whatever may be the difference in quantity between these two masses when the million of coin circulating three times during the year has purchased the whole mass of goods which were to be sold it has given to all its successive possessors the enjoyment of this mass when taking the same course the two millions of coin have produced the same effects they have only performed what the single million had performed before since by the supposition the mass of goods has not been increased in other terms that is to say the new mass of coin is swallowed up in the general mass of coin and as much as it has increased its quantity so much has it diminished its value the addition made to the coin of the community produces a proportional increase in the price of all vendible commodities—in the pecuniary price of all commodities not pecuniary and consequently it may be in the price of every article—it may be in that of the greater number of articles if an addition made to the coin of a community be employed in creating a portion of wealth not pecuniary which would not have been created without it—if it produced by labour or exchange an increase of real wealth the result is no longer the same in proportion as the real wealth is increased the addition made to the coin ceases to produce a diminution of relative value in order to simplify the case and render it  0 more striking i have supposed a large and sudden addition it is very seldom that an addition of this nature takes place with respect to the precious metals but it has often happened with respect to paper money thus the increase of the price of commodities all other things remaining the same is a proof of an addition to the coin and a measure of its quantity this defalcation of value is equivalent to an indirect tax upon pecuniary revenues—a tax which may continually increase in amount—a tax which benefits those who issue the paper money and of which the weight presses entirely upon the possessors of fixed revenues there is a compensation for this tax to producers and merchants who may raise the price of their commodities to all those who have part of this new money but those whose fortune consists in a pecuniary revenue which cannot be increased bear all the burthen when this diminution of revenue takes place gradually although it be an evil this evil may result from the general prosperity and may be compensated by a greater benefit losses which occur in the ordinary course of affairs are experienced and hardly felt they may be provided against but when the government itself interferes by operations whose effects are as great as they are sudden in order to give a sudden increase to the mass of pecuniary capital whether metallic or otherwise it confounds all the calculations of prudence it ruins one part of its subjects and its imaginary wealth becomes the instrument of its destruction this is what was experienced in france under the system of law and again under the reign of the assignâts v by means of trade some advantage results from every exchange provided it be made intentionally and without fraud otherwise such exchange would not be made there would be no reason for making it under this point of view the two contracting parties receive an equal benefit each one of them surrenders what suits him less that he may acquire what suits him more in each transaction of this kind there are two masses of new enjoyments but though all trade be advantageous a particular branch may be more advantageous to one of the parties than to the other it is more advantageous to you than it is to me if for an article which only costs you one days labour you obtain from me an article which has cost me two the real balance of trade is the quantity of labour received exceeding the quantity of labour given in exchange it is not necessary in this place to examine to what degree soil climate situation natural circumstances c may give this advantage to one state over another since this knowledge can have scarcely any influence upon practice it is of greater importance to observe that it may in a certain degree be acquired by art and that the superiority of workmanship or of instruments is a species of monopoly established by fortune in favour of genius time is saved by ingenuity the greater the number of new inventions in a country whose productions are carried into foreign lands the more favourable will the real balance of commerce be to that country the advantages belonging to dexterity are more permanent than those resulting from knowledge the discoveries of chemistry are speedily disseminated the skill of the bengalese workmen will remain peculiar to them for ages the great politicians who so much value foreign commerce consider it as a means of obtaining a balance in gold and they hasten to interfere to prevent those exchanges which require an expenditure of the precious metals if a merchant wish to send coin from london to paris it is to make a payment which will cost him less in this manner than any other or that he may obtain some kind of merchandise which he values more than the coin the politician is more clever than this he is not willing that this gain should be made because he thinks thus to gain would be to lose preventing the profits of every one is the method he has discovered of preventing loss to all he has therefore been employed in heaping one law upon another that he may prevent the exportation of the precious metals success would be a great misfortune but it has never been obtained want of success in diminishing the evil has only increased the folly i say in diminishing the evil for it never entirely disappears there will for example always be a greater or less expense on the part of the government in endeavouring to execute the law more or less vexation more or less restraint a larger or smaller number of individuals punished for having rendered service to the country by the breach of the law people will be accustomed to elude the prohibitions and to escape the vigilance of government money being more or less lowered in value the price of manufactures will be raised in proportion and the exportation of manufactures diminished such has been the folly exhibited in spain and portugal yet are they too happy only to have half succeeded grant to midas his wish he will die of hunger upon a heap of gold in recommending freedom of trade i suppose the minds of merchants in their sound that is their ordinary state but there have    been times when they have acted as though they were delirious such were the periods of the mississippi scheme in france and the south sea scheme in england the other classes of people would have had ground for seeking to divert their fellowcitizens from the purchase of the smoke sold by law or of the bubbles of the south sea what is here said may be compared with the observations in §   of the present chapter upon emigration in laying down general rules fortuitous and transient cases ought not to be forgotten what has been said respecting the precious metals is true respecting every article of trade and commerce considered as general wealth there cannot be any incompatibility between the wealth of each and the wealth of all but the same rule does not apply to subsistence and defence individuals may find their individual profit in commercial operations which may be opposed to the subsistence of all or the defence of all this particularly may happen to a small community in the neighbourhood of a large one establish an unlimited freedom of trade in the small community the great one may ruin it by means of gold in case of famine it might purchase all its provisions at the approach of war it might purchase all its arms the conduct to be pursued to insure the possession of the means of subsistence and defence are infinitely diversified by the situation the soil the climate and the extent of the country to which it may refer the great difficulty to be overcome as it respects subsistence is the difference between good and bad harvests if the produce be less than the consumption the evil is evident if it be greater the abundance lessens the price the farmer is ruined or discouraged and the year of plenty may be followed by one of dearth for the production of equality some have established public granaries for storing up the superabundance of years of plenty others have encouraged cultivation as much as possible depending upon foreigners for drawing off the excess were we to judge from abstract reasoning alone the first plan would appear best calculated to prevent accidents but forming our judgments from facts the second appears least subject to abuse it is from the adoption of this plan that england has enjoyed an abundance sufficiently regular freedom of trade therefore appears the best method for insuring an abundance of the means of subsistence in respect to subsistence and defence there is no better security than that which results from the general prosperity a superabundance is the best security against want after the examination we have given to the different methods by which real wealth may be increased we see that government may rely upon the intelligence and inclination of individuals for putting them in operation and that nothing is necessary to be done on its part but to leave them in possession of the power to insure to them the right of enjoyment and to hasten the development of general knowledge all that it can do with success may be ranged under this small number of heads—   to encourage the study of different branches of natural philosophy the difficulties of science form a barrier between practice and theory between the artisan and the philosopher   to institute prizes for discoveries and experiments   to cause the processes employed in every branch of trade to be published the french government rising above little jealousies has distinguished itself in this manner and has rendered itself a benefactor to the human race   to cause everything of the same nature in foreign countries to be observed with attention and to give the knowledge they obtain the same publicity   to cause the price of different articles of trade to be published the price of an article is an extra reward for whoever can manufacture or furnish it at a cheaper rate   to grant patents for a limited number of years with respect to a great number of inventions in the arts an exclusive privilege is absolutely necessary in order that what is sown may be reaped in new inventions protection against imitators is not less necessary than in established manufactures protection against thieves he who has no hope that he shall reap will not take the trouble to sow but that which one man has invented all the world can imitate without the assistance of the laws the inventor would almost always be driven out of the market by his rival who finding himself without any expense in possession of a discovery which has cost the inventor much time and expense would be able to deprive him of all his deserved advantages by selling at a lower price an exclusive privilege is of all rewards the best proportioned the most natural and the least burthensome it produces an infinite effect and it costs nothing grant me fifteen years says the inventor that i may reap the fruit of my labours after this term it shall be enjoyed by all the world does the sovereign say no you shall not have it what will happen it will be enjoyed by no one neither for fifteen years nor afterwards everybody will be disappointed—inventors workmen consumers—everything will be stifled both benefit and enjoyment exclusive patents in favour of inventions    have been long established in england an abuse however has crept into the system of granting them which tends to destroy the advantage derivable from them this privilege which ought to be gratuitous has afforded an opportunity for plundering inventors which the duration of the custom has converted into a right it is a real conspiracy against the increase of national wealth we may picture to ourselves a poor and timid inventor after years consumed in labour and uncertainty presenting himself at the patent office to receive the privilege which he has heard that the law bestows upon him immediately the great officers of the crown pounce upon him together as vultures upon their prey—a solicitorgeneral who levies four guineas upon him a keeper of the privy seal four guineas and a half a keeper of another seal four guineas a secretary of state sixteen guineas the lord chancellor who closes the procession as the first in dignity so also the first in rapacity—he cannot take less than twentysix guineas need it be added that in carrying on this process of extortion recourse is had to fraud—that the individual applying for a patent is referred from office to office that different pretexts may be afforded for pillage—that not one of these officers great or small takes the trouble to read a single word of the farago of nonsense which they sign and therefore that the whole parade of consultation is only a farce† suppose a law granting the patent as at present without condition—suppose another law prohibiting the obtaining of a patent under a penalty of fifty guineas what exclamations should we not hear against such contradictory laws and such folly and yet this supposed folly is only half as great as the folly actually displayed people always allow themselves to be duped by words the law or rather the customary abuse which has the force of law instead of a permission is as it respects the greater number of inventors a real although masked prohibition if you wish to strip off this mask translate the language of each into the language of the other these insults and oppressions have sometimes been approved as tending to repress the temerity of projectors in the same manner taxes upon law proceedings have been applauded as tending to repress the temerity of suitors as if poverty were synonymous with temerity—as if the rich only had need of the assistance of the laws or that they only were worthy of it—as if indeed this reason for only half opening the doors of the temple of justice were not equally conclusive for closing them altogether   to class with the crime of forgery the injustice done by the artisan who puts upon his own productions the mark of another—in order to prevent the commission of this crime through ignorance it would be necessary to establish a register in which every artisan might make an entry of his mark this would tend to secure the privilege which nature has established in favour of skill and which the legislator ought to maintain it can never be obtained without labour and it can never be abused chapter iv of population §   sponte acta with regard to increase of population by births‡ everything may be left to the spontaneous action of individuals §   agenda with regard to increase of population next to nothing is required to be done by government all that governments need do is to prevent decrease by deperition to prevent deperition is to afford security—security against the extremity of all mischief the destruction of mans life the sources of danger are—external hostility internal hostility and calamity with regard to the two first the interference of government is required for the purposes of defence and police the following are examples of institutions for preventing deperition from calamity—   hospitals for the use of curable sick and hurt among the poor   hospitals for the incurable sick and helpless   establishments for the occasional maintenance and employment of the ablebodied among the poor viz of such by whom either the one or the other is unobtainable from the    ordinary sources by their maintenance population is preserved by their employment wealth may be increased or not crimes of idleness are prevented   establishments for the prevention or mitigation of contagious diseases—establishments in former times for inoculation now for vaccination much may be done on the part of government under this head as well as so many others by instruction more or less requires to be done in proportion as by the ignorance of the people operations of this class are excluded from the class of sponte acta and thence placed among the agenda §   nonagenda institutions on the part of government having for their end in view the causation of an increase of population by births may best be characterized by a parallel example institutions punishing men for not eating or for eating food not sufficiently nourishing institutions paying all mankind for eating with premiums for those who eat most and oftenest many volumes have been written upon the subject of population because the means of promoting its increase have generally been the subject of examination i shall be very short upon this subject because i shall confine myself to showing that all these means are useless if anything could prevent men from marrying it would be the trouble which is pretended to be taken to induce them to marry so much uneasiness upon the part of the legislator can only inspire doubts respecting the happiness of this state pleasures are made objects of dread when converted into obligations would you encourage population—render men happy and trust to nature but that you may render men happy do not govern them too much do not constrain them even in their domestic arrangements and above all in that which can please only under the auspices of liberty in a word leave them to live as they like under the single condition of not injuring one another population is in proportion to the means of subsistence and wants montesquieu condillac sir james stewart adam smith the economists have only one opinion upon this subject according to this principle there is also a means of increasing population but there is only one it consists in increasing the national wealth or to speak more correctly in allowing it to increase young women says montesquieu are sufficiently ready to marry how should they not be the pleasures the avowed sentiments of love are only permitted in this condition it is thus only that they are emancipated from a double subjection and that they are placed at the head of a little empire it is the young men he adds who need to be encouraged but why do the motives which lead men to marry want force it is only by marriage that a man can obtain the favours of the woman who in his eyes is worth all others it is only by marriage that he can live freely and publicly with an honest and respectable woman and who will live only for him there is nothing more delightful than the hope of a family where proofs of the tenderest affections may be given and received—where power blended with kindness may be exercised—where confidence and security are found—where the consolations of old age may be treasured up—where we may behold ourselves replaced by other selves—where we may say i shall not entirely die a man wants an associate a confidant a counsellor a steward a mistress a nurse a companion for all seasons all these may be found united in a wife what substitute can be provided it is not among the poor that there is any aversion to marriage that is to say it is not among the labourers—that class in the increase of which alone the public is interested—that class which constitutes the strength and creates the wealth of a nation—that class which is the last in the senseless vocabulary of pride but which the enlightened politician regards as the first it is in the country especially that men seek to marry a bachelor does not there possess the resources he can find in a town a husbandman a farmer require the assistance of a wife to attend to their concerns at all the hours of the day the population of the productive classes is limited only by their real wants that of the unproductive classes is limited by their conventional wants with regard to these instead of inducing them to marry by invitations rewards and menaces as did augustus we ought to be    well pleased when they live in celibacy the increase of the purely consumptive classes is neither an advantage to the state nor to themselves their welfare is exactly in the inverse ratio of their numbers if they should insensibly become extinct as in holland where there is scarcely one citizen who does not exercise some occupation where would be the evil a workman may in a moment be converted into an idle consumer a good workman is not so soon made he needs skill and practice habits of industry are slowly acquired if indeed after a certain age they can ever be acquired on the other hand when a consumer passes into the class of labourers it is generally owing to a reverse in fortune and he is in a state of suffering when a labourer is transported into the class of consumers he is exalted in his own eyes and in the eyes of others and his happiness is increased on all these accounts it is desirable that the class of idlers be not increased their own interest requires it and it is also a great good when their number is diminished whether by celibacy or their conversion into labourers convents have been constantly accused of hurting population poor convents and the mendicant orders injure it without doubt since they add to the number of idle consumers it is not so with rich convents they add nothing to this number he who possesses the rent of land can command labour without working himself but what matters it whether a fund destined to the support of idlers be transmitted from father to son or from stranger to stranger large cities are decried they are the gulphs it is said in which the population of the country is lost that which is furnished to the towns is visible to all the world what is received from them is less apparent it is the ancient quarrel of the belly and the members cultivation increases in proportion to the consumers people live longer in the country but that a greater number of persons may be born there it is necessary that the capital of the towns which animates labour should be sent thither this imaginary evil the increase of towns has excited the most extravagant fears absurdity has been carried so far as to make rules for limiting their bounds they should rather have been made for extending them contagious disorders would thus have been prevented the air would have been rendered more salubrious the opposite regulations do not diminish the number of inhabitants but oblige them to heap themselves up within close habitations and to build one city upon another are emigrations disadvantageous to a state yes if the emigrants could have found employment at home—no if they could not but it is not natural that labourers should exile themselves if they could live at home however if they desire so to do ought they to be prevented cases must be distinguished it is possible that this desire may have been produced by some momentary distaste by some false idea some whim which may mislead a multitude of men before they have leisure to undeceive themselves i will not therefore affirm that circumstances may not happen in which emigration may not be forbidden by a law of short duration but to convert this prohibition into a perpetual law is to change the country into a prison—is to publish in the name even of the government itself that it is not good to live there it    would be proper that such a law should commence thus—we c ignorant of the art of rendering our subjects happy and well assured that if we give them an opportunity to escape they will go in search of countries less oppressed hereby prohibit c would not this be to aggravate the evil could all the frontiers of a great country be guarded louis xiv with all his authority could he accomplish it as many persons as were thus enchained so many discontented and unhappy persons who would be looked upon with distrust—whom it would be necessary perhaps to repress by violence and who would become enemies when they found themselves treated as such others who had never thought of quitting their country would become uneasy when they found themselves obliged to remain whilst others who might have thought of establishing themselves there would take care not to do it for those individuals retained against their will you lose those who would have come among you voluntarily england has sustained temporary losses of men and capital by emigrations to america but what has happened she has received from that country a mass of productions which have more than compensated the loss the men and capitals carried away employed upon new lands have produced a benefit more considerable for england itself than if they had been employed upon her own to exhibit this clearly would require a multitude of facts and calculations but it may be presumed to be the case from the vast extent of this new commerce on the subject of emigration the wisest part then is to do nothing under the guidance of liberty the benefit is certain under the guidance of constraint it is uncertain after this the advantages of immigration are easily estimated in order to people a country as yet untilled it will be advisable to invite thither strangers who depend upon their labour alone it may even be advantageous to make them advances for their support in order to establish them in respect to methods of preventing the destruction of the species they belong to that branch of police which is employed about the means of subsistence and the public health we may be tranquil therefore upon the subject of population there will be everywhere an abundance of men provided they are not deprived by a hard and tyrannical government of what is necessary for subsistence and enjoyment of which contentment constitutes a part chapter v of finance §   general observations under the head of sponte acta there is nothing except by accident there remain therefore agenda and nonagenda finance operates in toto in diminution of wealth the object or end in view should be to render the diminution as small as possible and as pure as possible from collateral vexation and inconvenience in every shape the operations of finance are reducible to receipt and disbursement or say expenditure receipt may be—  without condition of return   on condition of return i e on the footing of a loan disbursement is accordingly—  disbursement at large   disbursement in discharge of loans expenditure supposes in all cases previous receipt and in cases of loans necessitates future receipt for the purpose of replacing the money borrowed receipt and expenditure are either—  of money   of particular articles for service every sum expended supposes therefore a correspondent amount already raised or to be raised by taxes the practical rule which ought to be observed in judging of the expendiency of any branch of expenditure is—compare the benefit of it with the burthen of a correspondent portion of the produce of the most burthensome tax by striking off so much expenditure you may save so much tax    taxes take from present enjoyment they diminish comfort in proportion as they are paid by each contributor out of that portion of his wealth which had it not been for the tax would all of it have been spent within the year in the way of maintenance as money is spent by a man who is said to spend his income taxes diminish future wealth in proportion as they take from capital viz by being taken from that portion of a mans money the whole of which had it not been for the tax would have been spent on articles by the production of which real capital is increased or even by being taken from that portion of his money which is expended in the way of maintenance in so far as the money had it not been taken from him by the taxes would have been employed in the shape of pecuniary capital by which real capital is increased taxes therefore take from growing wealth—  in as far as they are levied on capital viz on money destined for employment in the shape of capital or on goods or labour of which real capital is composed—  in as far as they are levied on income or expenditure in the way of income of men who lay up money to be employed as capital or would have laid it up had it not been for the tax borrowing money to defray war expenses takes from pecuniary capital thence from growing wealth in the amount of the sum so raised—minus the amount of mercantile profit upon such part of the expense as consists of purchased articles repaying money formerly borrowed for war or other expenses adds to pecuniary capital—thence to real capital—thence to growing wealth to the amount of the money so employed in such repayment or discharge deducting such part if any as is exported without return to foreign countries which is the case with such part as is exported by the proprietor to be employed abroad by him or on his account without being reimported—that or the profit made by it by the mere discharge of a million worth of debt as much or more is therefore done towards the increase of wealth as by a million given in the way of bounties for the encouragement of this or that particular branch of trade those who in the one case receive the amount of the debts respectively due to them give up the future interest and the rest of the community is exonerated from the payment of it those who in the other case receive the million on the score of bounty give up nothing in return for it when money is to be borrowed borrowing it in part at least of foreigners is attended with two advantages at the time of borrowing it diminishes the consumption of home capital the consequent check to production and the loss to private borrowers as well as to government by the sudden rise in the rate of interest at the time of paying off it diminishes the loss produced to moneyed men at home by the sudden pouring in of capital into the market money which must be laid out in the shape of capital and by the sudden fall in the rate of interest which is the consequence by moneyed men understand here—not the opulent only but all to the very poorest whose incomes arise out of the interest of money and that interest reducible some men grieve on this occasion at the thoughts of the money that goes out of the nation to pay foreigners a housekeeper might as well grieve at the thoughts of the money that goes out of the house to pay the baker if today the money goes out of the house it is because the other day the bread came into it do without bread or bilk the baker the money will be saved taxes are either on property or on presumption of property in both cases they are either on income or on capital taxes on property in the shape of income are either direct or on consumption—called of late years from the french indirect taxes taxes on capital diminish present capital and thence future and growing wealth by the whole of their amount taxes on income by the amount of the savings that would have been made out of income and added to capital instead of being spent in maintenance had it not been for the tax the fault of direct taxes on presumption of property is inequality—that of direct taxes on property is vexation indirect taxes have no fault beyond the mere privation which must be undergone at any rate the vexation which in the case of direct taxes on property extends to everybody is confined in the case of indirect taxes to the fabricators and venders of the article taxed who make themselves amends for it in the price §   of direct and indirect taxation when a tax is imposed upon any commodity a proportionable discouragement—intended or not intended—is applied to the corresponding branch of profitseekingindustry and thence a proportionable encouragement to the most immediately rival branches in this way the branch of political economy which belongs to finance is unavoidably though often perhaps undesignedly entangled in practice and effect with the other branches to an indirect tax each man pays no more than he pleases and the vexation attendant    on the collection of it is confined to the makers and venders of the commodity taxed to a direct tax each man pays what the imposer of the tax pleases and the vexation attendant upon its collection embraces every man who pays it indirect taxation as far as it will go is therefore preferable to direct but the length to which it can be made to go depends in the instance of each nation upon its degree of relative opulence of france england and holland in the scale of absolute wealth france is at the top holland at the bottom in the scale of relative opulence france is at the bottom holland at the top comparatively speaking england till of late made little use of direct taxes france little use of any other her abstinence from indirect taxes has been chiefly the result of necessity† though in some degree of choice a tax on imports is borne by our own people—a tax upon exports to foreign countries is borne by the inhabitants of foreign countries whatever imposition of this kind foreigners can be made to bear is so much gain to us if indeed when a fresh tax is imposed upon an article of export the quantity of it produced is considerably diminished by the tax a temporary distress is thereby produced and the suffering may be less or greater than the suffering saved by the saving in the amount of taxes borne by ourselves but if the quantity produced be merely prevented from increasing no such suffering is produced and the benefit by the saving in homepaid taxes is pure the addition which had it not been for the tax would have been made to the quantity of the commodity thus taxed spreads itself among other commodities of all sorts the direct effect of the sort of tax called indirect is to make a man pay for the use of the article taxed and go on using it as before—an indirect effect is—to make him cease to use it to avoid the paying of the tax this indirect effect is the same as that of a prohibitive law—prohibiting the use of the article—viz under a penalty equal to the amount of the tax so far as the one effect takes place the other does not commonly they take place together in proportions infinitely diversifiable in the way of prohibition a tax seldom falls on the article taxed so exclusively as might be supposed the prohibition falls—not merely upon the article taxed but upon whatever article each man can best spare when a fresh tax is imposed upon wine a man who having been used to buy wine and books is fonder of wine than of books reduces the quantity not so much of his wine as of his books by a tax upon gin many a man instead of being sobered has been starved the best sort of indirect tax is that which by its effect in the character of a prohibition diminishes the consumption of an article the use of which is pregnant with future misery—the dregs of the cup of present pleasure such above all are the pabula of drunkenness the fiscal is in this case crowned by a moral use the worst sort of indirect tax is that which in the character of a prohibition lessens the use of an article to which a mans attachment is apt not to be so great as it were to be wished it were considering what is the produce of it in the shape of permanent good over and above the evanescent pleasure the fiscal use is in this case clogged with an antimoral tendency books especially of the instructive kind music instruments of pastime of all sorts not to speak of public entertainments—everything—morality is served by everything of this nature that calls a man off from drunkenness the mischief done in the way of prohibition by that species of direct tax which is imposed upon produce is frequently but too real but is apt to be exaggerated though my profit would be greater if i had nobody to share it with me my having somebody to share it with me does not make me deny myself all profit few men are so spiteful as to hate others more than they love themselves—especially the government which is nobody quarrels with nobody and protects everybody a man without a partner has the whole profit to himself—yet many men submit to saddle themselves with partners the government which imposes proportional taxes on produce is a partner who furnishes protection though nothing else i have elsewhere spoken of the best of all financial resources and the worst‡ the best    supposing public opinion to admit of it as well as the most copious seems to be that which gives to the public a share in property become vacant by death on failure of near relations the formation of counterexpectations being prevented by preestablished law receipts from this source need not be attended with that vexatious sense of privation which is the inseparable accompaniment of a tax the worst is that tax called direct or indirect which as often as it acts as a prohibition deprives a man of everything by depriving him of justice—the tax i mean upon law proceedings by which the poor that is the bulk of the community—especially the oppressed and afflicted part of it—are put out of the protection of the law abstractedly considered the tax upon medicine might be stated as still worse—the prohibition in this case bearing more immediately and exclusively as well as extensively upon health and life but the tax is not apt to be so heavy upon medicine as upon justice there are moreover hospitals and dispensaries for the relief of the poor who want medicine but there are none for the relief of poor and helpless suitors who want justice indirect and direct taxation are limited by the patience of the people the ne plus ultra is variable and unascertainable depending upon events and the temper of the times not knowing how soon it may arrive governments are anxious to pay off debt—because in proportion as debt is paid off taxes by which the interest is paid may be taken off and being taken off may in case of need be laid on again a tried tax will always be a more secure dependence than an untried one in the case of indirect taxes a common notion considers the ratio of the tax to the price of the article as limited to a maximum—limited viz by the effect of smuggling if the ratio be increased it is supposed that more will be lost by the quantity that escapes the tax than will be gained by the addition to the amount of the tax on the quantity that pays it this notion supposing it just as applied to the aggregate of taxable articles will be apt to be illusive as applied to this or that sort of article considered by itself in respect of difficulty of evasion and facility of collection the scale of variation is stretched to a great latitude by the bulkiness of the article by the local circumstances of the place at which the tax is collected and by a variety of circumstances but other causes of variation and these very powerful ones are—the organization of that part of the financial system which concerns the mode of collection—and thence the vigilance or remissness—the sufficiency or insufficiency in number and the probity or improbity of the functionaries employed—the good or bad contrivance of the taxation laws in respect of the obligations imposed on the contributors for the prevention of evasion the amplitude or scantiness the good or bad choice made—of the powers given to the collectors for the prevention of evasion—and the apposite or inapposite construction of the system of judicial procedure on this subject including the rules of evidence the limits thus set to indirect taxation are set—not by the nature of things but by the imperfection of the laws it is to this imperfection that men are indebted for the inequality and vexation attendant on direct taxes in comparison with indirect ones §   taxes—effects on production taxes ought to have no other end than the production of revenue with as light a burthen as possible when it is attempted to employ them as indirect means of encouragement or discouragement for any particular species of industry government as we have already seen only succeeds in deranging the natural course of trade and in giving it a less advantageous direction the effects of particular taxes may appear very complicated and difficult to trace by considering the subject in a general point of view and distinguishing the permanent from the temporary effects of taxes this complexity will be disentangled and the difficulty disappear first question what are the effects of a tax imposed by a foreign nation upon the articles of our manufacture permanent consequences—  if the exportation be not diminished the tax makes no difference with respect to us it is only paid by the consumers in the state which imposes the tax   if the exportation be diminished the capital which was employed in this branch of manufacture withdraws itself and passes into others temporary consequences—this diminution of exportation occasions a proportional distress among the individuals interested in this species of industry the workmen lose their occupations they are obliged to undertake labours to which they are unaccustomed and which yield them less as to the master manufacturer a part of his fixed capital is rendered useless he loses his profits in proportion as the manufacture is reduced second question what are the effects of a tax imposed by ourselves upon the manufactures we ourselves consume permanent consequences—  if the consumption    be not diminished no other difference is produced than the disadvantage of the tax to the consumer and a proportional advantage for the public   if the consumption be diminished individuals are deprived of that portion of happiness which consisted in the use of this particular article of enjoyment   capital in this as in the preceding case retires from this branch and passes into others temporary consequences—if the consumption be not diminished the tax makes no difference if it be diminished similar distress in proportion as in the case above third question what are the consequences of a tax imposed by ourselves upon the manufactures of our own country consumed by foreigners permanent consequences—  whilst the consumption is not diminished the operation produces so much clear gain for us the burthen of the tax is borne by the foreigner and the profit is reaped by ourselves if the consumption be diminished the capital which loses this employment passes into others temporary consequences—consumption not diminished no difference to us consumption diminished similar distress in proportion as in the former cases it results from hence that the permanent effects of these taxes are always of little importance as to commerce in general and that their temporary effects are evil in proportion to the diminution of the consumption the evil is greater or less according as it is more or less easy to transfer capital and labour from one branch of industry to another the least hurtful of these taxes are those which bear upon our own productions consumed by foreigners if the same quantity be exported after the tax as before so far from being prejudicial it yields us a clear benefit it is a tribute levied upon them precisely as if it were raised out of the bowels of the earth the tax imposed by us upon foreign importations is paid by ourselves and burthensome as any other tax would be to the same amount if the consumption be not diminished it would be better that the tax upon this article should be imposed by us that we might profit by it rather than by the country which produced it and which would then enjoy the benefit a nation which has a natural monopoly of an article necessary to foreigners has a natural means of taxing them for its own profit let us take tin for an example england is the only country which has mines of this metal—at least all others are too inconsiderable to satisfy the demand england might therefore lay a considerable tax upon the exportation of tin without danger of smuggling because it might be levied at the mine or at the foundry france could not impose an equal tax because it would give too great an allurement to the smugglers these principles are easy of application to commercial treaties everything which is permanent whether it be called encouragement or discouragement has but little effect upon trade and commerce in general since trade and commerce are always governed by the capital which can be employed on them but international precautions may be taken for the prevention of rapid changes from which temporary distresses result let every nation make a sacrifice by refusing to impose taxes or to augment them upon articles of its own exportation every nation would then receive indemnification by a reciprocal sacrifice commerce would thus acquire stability and that petty fiscal warfare would no longer be carried on which produces a dangerous irritation among the people always greatly disproportioned to the importance of the object the object of the first chapter of the commercial code ought to be to show the reciprocity of international interests to prove that there is no impropriety during the continuance of peace in favouring the opulence of foreigners—no merit in opposing it it may happen to be a misfortune that our neighbour is rich it is certainly one that he be poor if he be rich we may have reason to fear him if he be poor he has little or nothing to sell to or to buy of us but that he should become an object of dread by reason of an increase in riches it is necessary that this prosperity should be his alone he will have no advantage if our wealth has made the same progress as his own or if this progress has taken place in other nations equally well disposed with ourselves to repress him jealousies against rich nations are only founded upon mistakes and misunderstandings it is with these nations that the most profitable commerce is carried on it is from these that the returns are the most abundant the most rapid and the most certain great capitals produce the greatest division of labour the most perfect machines the most active competition among the merchants the most extended credits and consequently the lowest prices each nation in receiving from the richest everything which it furnishes at the lowest rate and of the best quality would be able to devote its capital exclusively to the most advantageous branches of industry wherefore do governments give so marked a preference to export trade   it is this branch which exhibits itself with the greatest show and eclat it is this which is most under the eyes of the governors  0 and which therefore most strongly excites their attention   this commerce more particularly appears to them as their work they imagine they are creators and inaction appears to them a species of impotence all these pretensions fall before the principle that production is subordinate to capital these new branches of trade these remote establishments these costly encouragements produce no new creations it is only a new employment of a part of one and the same capital which was not idle before it is a new service which is performed at the expense of the old the sap which by this operation is strained through a new branch being diverted from another gives a different product but not an increase of produce chapter vi operation of a sinking fund on the production of wealth the establishment of an effective and undivertible sinking fund has been productive of effects in respect of increase of wealth such as to judge from any indications i have met with had not presented themselves to those by whom the plan was adopted or by any of those by whom it had been proposed money borrowed for and applied to war expenses is so much taken from productive capital and growing wealth money employed in discharge of such debt whether by paying it off at par or by buying it in at an under price is so much given to productive capital and growing wealth if in a season of reimbursement viz peace the space of time employed in the discharge of the debt were no longer than the space of time employed in the contracting of it and the money employed in the reimbursement were no greater than the money borrowed the quantity added to wealth would be equal to the quantity taken from it bating only the loss of the interest at compound interest upon the several years instalments during the expenditure of it as if ten millions were borrowed every year for four years of war and ten millions were paid off every year for the four succeeding years being years of peace there would be forty millions taken from wealth forty millions added to wealth but to put the nation into the same plight in respect of wealth as if there had been no money raised for the war it would require the interest of the first years ten millions for the four years plus that of the second for the three years plus that of the third for the two years plus that of the fourth for one year supposing the whole debt to be paid off at once on the first day of the year of peace and as by the supposition it would be paid off not so but by instalments as above this would require a further addition on the score of the correspondent retardations on this supposition it is evident that a nation could never be put by reimbursement in a plight exactly as good as what it would have been in had there been no borrowing for unproductive purposes but in point of fact a circumstance attending the borrowing system is that the money paid and given to productive capital at the period of reimbursement is upon the whole considerably greater than the money borrowed and spent and taken from productive capital at the period of expenditure when money is borrowed in three per cents at six per cent that is when for every £ 00 borrowed of the individual government gives him a nominal capital of £ 00 stock each £ 00 carrying an annuity of three per cent to discharge this annuity of £  in the way of paying off buying in under par being supposed out of the question £ 00 must at the time of reimbursement be put into his hands in the course of the late wars greater interest than this has actually been given by the british government if then the circumstance of time were laid out of the account the consequence would be that in so far as mere wealth were concerned a nation with a fixed sinking fund might be—and in a word that britain would be a gainer by a war to a very considerable degree if for example in the first year of a war ten millions were borrowed on these terms and on the first day of the second year being a year of peace the money borrowed were repaid at par for which on the above terms twenty millions would be necessary the gain to wealth would be ten millions minus a years interest upon ten millions the above supposition is given only for illustration for as everybody knows neither is money on the first year of a war borrowed on terms of such disadvantage nor is it so soon repaid it may however serve to show thus much viz that the more disadvantageous the terms are on which money is borrowed the greater is the restitution made to wealth this would not in my view of the matter be any recommendation of war or borrowing for that or other purposes upon disadvantageous terms because comfort including security is the immediate and only direct object in any estimate with me—and wealth only in so far as it contributes to comfort which without due provision made for security it cannot do but in a view of the matter which to me appears much more common than my own this consideration should be a very important one and should go a great way towards reconciling men to war and bad bargains    the answer to it is that if it be wealth—future wealth you want and you are willing to pay the price for it in present comfort you have no reason to seek for it through any such disadvantageous measure as that of war raise the money and instead of spending it in war spend it in any other way—you will have still more wealth if this be just it will enable us the more clearly to appreciate two opinions which have been advanced on the subject of national debts one is that a national debt is to the whole amount of it or at any rate to a certain part of it not a defalcation but an addition to the mass of wealth the other is that admitting the debt to be a defalcation from the mass of national wealth yet the discharge of it would be not an addition to that mass but a defalcation from it both these opinions have had their partisans for in the whole field of national economy there is not a proposition how clear soever the contrary of which has not had its partisans as to the first opinion one way in which it is maintained is by looking exclusively to one side of the account—by looking at the income coming in to the annuitants and not looking at the income going out of the hands of those by whose contributions the money for the payment of these annuities is supplied another way is by imagining the existence of a capital equal to the capital borrowed and received by government in exchange for the annuities granted—borrowed and spent as fast as it is borrowed not to say faster still this being a new capital created goes according to the reckoning of these politicians in addition to whatever may have been the amount of the old one this notion appears to have had for its ground and efficient cause the language used by the man of finance and the man of law in describing transactions of this nature can a thing have been created and yet never have existed fiction is the parent of confusion and error in all its shapes false conception generates false language false language fixes false conceptions and renders them prolific and immortal such as opinions have been such is language such as language is will opinions be would not the nation be the poorer if a sponge were passed over the national debt would not there be so much property destroyed not an atom more than would be produced at the same instant would not the nation be less wealthy no not at least at the instant of the change would it be less happy yes wretched in the extreme soon after would it be less wealthy yes to a frightful degree by reason of the shock given to security in respect to property and the confusion that would ensue thirty millions ayear that used to be received by annuitants no longer received—thirty millions ayear that used to be paid in taxes by all classes and all individuals together for the payment of those annuitants no longer paid national wealth would no more be diminished by the sponge than it is when a handkerchief is transferred from the pocket of a passenger to the pocket of a thief sum for sum however the enjoyment produced by gain is not equal to the suffering produced by loss in this difference traced through all its consequences lies the mischief and the sole mischief of bankruptcy or of theft annuities paid by government are paid with a degree of regularity not to speak of certainty which would in vain be looked for to any extent in annuities paid out of particular funds by individual hands in the loss of this species and degree of convenience consists the whole of the loss that would be incurred by the complete discharge of the national debt this convenience is certainly worth something in the scale of wealth but it can scarcely be considered as any real tangible addition to the mass of those tangible things of the mass of which the matter of wealth is composed there is also inconvenience attending the payment of taxes—those taxes by the produce of which the matter of these annuities is supplied—an inconvenience superadded to that which consists merely in the privation attendant on the parting with the money paid in taxes on this convenience attending the receipt of the annuity is grounded another convenience in respect of the facility attending the purchase and the sale of it—attending the process of converting capital into income and reconverting income into capital when capital happens again to be the thing wanted as to the ground of the other opinion—it appears to be that if the money taken in taxes to be applied in discharge of the debt had not been so taken but had been left in the pockets of those to whom it belonged it would have been spent by them each in his own way and by that expenditure an addition would have been made to the mass of national wealth—but not so if applied in discharge of debt but the fact is that whatever is so applied is given received and employed—the whole of it in the shape of capital—whereas had it been left with the parties by whom it is paid in taxes it would have been employed more or less of it as income is employed when it is said to be spent without return or hope of return what the proportion may amount to between the part spent as income and the part employed as capital and thereby employed in making a growing    addition to the mass of national wealth will be considered presently for the present it is something not to say sufficient that in the one case it is only a part that is employed in making an addition to the mass of wealth and in the other case the whole the support given to this opinion is given in two ways one is by thinking nothing of what becomes of the money taken in taxes and made over to the annuitants in discharge pro tanto of the national debt but considering it as annihilated or thrown away the other is by considering the labour paid for by the money when spent by the proprietor instead of being taken from him in taxes as being employed all of it in the shape of pecuniary capital in making a correspondent addition to real capital—just as would have really been the case with the labour paid for by that money had it been been made over to annuitants in discharge of so much debt that a part of it would really have been so employed does not admit of doubt—the error consists in considering what is true only of this part as if it were true of the whole let us observe the difference between this part and the whole admitting an increase of wealth and that a gradual and regular one the productive capital of the country taken together with the growing mass of consumed and reproduced wealth continually produced by it must be considered as increasing at compound interest the rate of interest can scarcely be taken as so high as   per cent for at   per cent compound upon the capital whatever it may amount to in any year the quantity of it would be rather more than doubled in thirtyfive and a half years the most sanguine estimator will not i imagine regard the increase of national wealth to have been even for the last thirtyfive years increasing at nearly so rapid a rate if the quantity and value of productive capital have gone on increasing at this rate the quantity of growing income must have gone on increasing at the same rate since it is only from the income of that or the preceding year that the addition made to the capital of any year can be made if the quantity of growing income have gone on increasing at this rate the mass of population must have gone on increasing at the same rate save and except in so far as an increase has taken place in the degree of relative opulence i e so far as an average individual of the posterior period has been richer than an average individual at an anterior period—so far as wealth has gone on increasing faster than population that wealth has gone on increasing faster than population is what i should expect to find to be the case but that the increase should be anything like as much as double i e half as much again seems too much to believe the half or thereabouts of the aggregate wealth will be that which is shared among individuals of the poorest class—and in the case of that class the wealth of an average individual appears within the period in question to have rather diminished than increased i take therefore two per cent for the rate of accumulation—not as the true rate but for a rate which though considerably too high is near enough to the true rate to answer the purpose of illustration taking then  0 per cent as the gross ratio of the real income produced by that real capital to the real capital by the employment of which it is produced—this two per cent would constitute onetenth part of the gross income—and the part out of income added to capital every year is onetenth part of the whole mass of which the other nine parts are partly consumed for maintenance partly employed in keeping up the real capital in statu quo that is in a condition to give birth to the same quantity of real income in each subsequent as in each preceding year the whole income then of an average individual may for this purpose be considered as divided into ten parts—of which nine parts go for present maintenance added to the expense of providing for reproduction without decrease or increase and the other tenth to positive increase this being the case with the whole income of the average individual the same division in idea may be made of any part of that income and for instance of that part which he is made to pay in taxes if he had had none of it to pay in taxes onetenth is the part which would have been employed by him in making a net addition to the capital and thence to the growing wealth of the country as above on this supposition the addition made to wealth by a million taken from national income by taxes and employed in the discharge of the national debt is to the addition that would be made to it by the same million if left in the pockets of those to whom it comes in the shape of income and left to be employed by them each in his own way as ten to one i say for illustration as ten to one but twenty to one is the proportion i should expect to find come nearest

observations on the restrictive and prohibitory commercial system especially with a reference to the decree of the spanish cortes of july    0 leave us alone from the mss of jeremy bentham edited by john bowring originally printed in         preface correct views of the changes which it is desirable to introduce into our present plan of commercial policy do not appear to the writer to have been in all respects well condensed or satisfactorily developed and he was not a little gratified when the illjudged decree of the spanish cortes dated in july last induced his venerable friend mr bentham whose profound and discerning mind had been for some time directed to the interesting events of the peninsula to record his opinions of that baneful anticommercial system which has too long blinded the eyes and contracted the habits and feelings of so large a portion of society it will not be the least though it has been one of the latest practical lessons which has been taught us—and taught us too by that best of instructors suffering experience—that no system of commercial policy can be ultimately beneficial which is reared upon the selfish principle alone to sacrifice the interests of the dependent many to the ambition or the avarice of the privileged few—to build a theory of successful scheming on the mere usurpations of fraud or violence—to make the pursuits and the profits of commerce depend on the intolerant dictation of military or of naval power without any reference to the wants or wishes or interests of those concerned—would seem if now for the first time projected as idle in the conception as impracticable in the execution yet such a system has been but too long in vogue flattering to our but too prevalent feeling of national pride this system in defiance of the benign counsel of the moralist has made us deem it excellent because we have the strength of a giant to use it like a giant almost necessary perhaps to a constantly drained treasury it has ever refused to sacrifice a penny in possession to obtain a pound in reversion it has retained the saltduties by which millions are lost because through them thousands are gained it has for the miserable produce of a tax on wool miserable even in calculation and how much more so in the result driven us from some of the most important sources of commercial profit and abandoned large classes of industrious hands to hopelessness and the poorlaws we have too long and lamentably been pursuing our path of error retract return we must sooner or later and tomorrow we shall retract with a worse grace and with a greater bulk of suffering than today spain is a country which possesses immense mines of agricultural wealth and offers in consequence the strongest motives for the direction of her capital to agricultural improvement since it might be so employed in the perfect security of a profitable and a prompt return while on the other hand this new commercial system will as certainly prove calamitous as a better system might be beneficial to spain it must be confessed having little of that fictitious influence which has too often succeeded in compelling nations to unwarrantable selfsacrifices that system will be more fatal than it has been to england but the system is radically bad it is bad everywhere it is a poison that may act differently upon different subjects its progress may be concealed may be delayed it is poison still—and it is deadly the writer had originally intended the reorganization of the following pages by keeping the case of spain entirely out of view but he found every attempt to increase by any arrangement of his own the effect he seeks to produce frustrated by the constantly recurring conviction that that effect would be most assuredly produced by allowing the spanish decree still to occupy a prominent place that decree is a fair specimen of the anticommercial spirit it does not go quite so far as some of our sweeping prohibitions—prohibitions made in all the wantonness of uncalculating arrogance but it goes far enough for our arguments and for anything beyond it fewer arguments would of course suffice the writer cannot however in this place forbear expressing his astonishment at the reproaches and indignation with which he is given to understand the decree of the cortes which prohibits so many british manufactures has been received in different parts of this country spain will punish herself—is punishing herself but too severely—by her erroneous policy and interested as is the writer in the wellbeing of that country—the witness as he has been of so much of her suffering and so much of her glory—bound by strong ties of personal affection to many of the illustrious actors in the late momentous and exhilarating changes—he feels and powerfully feels disappointment and regret that her legislators should have committed an error so fatal but he may be allowed to ask on what plea of honesty or consistency can england object who so inexorably shuts her ports to the manufactured produce of foreign hands aye even of those of her own subjects—of    her own colonies is it for us forsooth to complain that high duties or severe interdictions prohibit the circulation of our fabrics while the cheap linens of russia the fine ones of germany the cambrics of france the carpets of turkey the cottons of india and the silks of china implore an admission to our markets with all the claims of superior cheapness and superior excellence and are met with a stern unyielding no we imagine—complacent souls—that other countries will give a welcome to the works of our looms because we offer them so honest an equivalent—the prohibition of everything produced by theirs their wool and their fruit their oil and wine their drugs and dyewoods we will receive from them in our abundant generosity as we are not able to produce them but what right have we to complain if they copy the example we have given them and sullenly turn our manufactures away they show how they value and how well they can apply the good lessons we have given them we would persuade them perhaps that it is for their interest to take our goods they are cheaper better—nothing more reasonable but in common justice if they have a word to say to us on that score in favour of their own let us pray let us listen to them shall our answer be—no never it would tend greatly to facilitate the fair consideration of this most important question if in reckoning up the sources of national wealth we were more accustomed to generalize and less prone to draw a broad line of demarcation between commercial and agricultural interest the prosperity of a nation is to be judged of from its aggregate productions and in our general relations if the commercial and the agricultural representatives of wealth be as two to two and if by any changes they should fluctuate in the proportions of three and one on either side the sum total of benefit remains the same such great fluctuations are no doubt calamitous in their progress and can only take place where an excessive momentum is given by the application or removal of restrictive or impelling measures from that evereager disposition to patch up temporary evils by permanent legislatorial enactments but the habit of looking at different sources of riches and strength with an exclusive and narrow vision has impelled men to the most fatal conclusions and led in a thousand instances to the most mischievous of all attempts to apply apparent remedies to the necessities of separate interests without any reference to their connexion with or proportion to the common the universal interest satisfactory it is however to observe the rapid progress which sound notions of commercial policy have made in the world and it is peculiarly satisfactory to notice their prevalence in those high quarters from whence if at all relief must ultimately come the generally correct views which have been developed in the recorded opinions of the president of the board of trade the acknowledgment from the lips of ministers that many and grievous evils have resulted from the present system the reports of the select committee of the house of commons the representations of the merchants of the metropolis which have been reechoed by the intelligent merchants of the outports and which have found a concordant voice even on the other side of the atlantic everything gives room to hope that most important changes must soon and certainly be introduced it has generally been the fate of those who have pointed out the errors defects and dangers of any longestablished institutions to be met with the taunting defiance—give us something better and though there has been generally more art than honesty in such an evasion it has too often produced the intended effect by turning men away from the honest effort at melioration which would be necessarily called into action by a conviction of the mistakes of the existing system on this question however that which nations have most earnestly to entreat from governments is that the latter would cease to honour them with any officious interference their tender mercies however well intended are cruel the best boon they can give is to let the stream of commerce flow as it will its tide is strong enough to bear away all impediments and governments are but too much the victims of selfdeception when they imagine that their decrees of prohibition or of encouragement do really produce the effects they contemplate those decrees are erected against and opposed to the natural tendency of things and are in the end as absurd and as ineffective as it would be to direct the winds by an order in council or to manage the tides by act of parliament the evils of such interference are produced uncontroulably produced—they attach necessarily and invariably to it but the good intended is not of such a character that it can be condensed into a cornucopia whose tangible riches are to be distributed or withheld at the caprice of those who fancy themselves privileged to grant or to deny them in making these observations let it not be imagined that the writer deems it practicable or desirable by any one measure violently and suddenly to shake and overthrow the now established commercial fabric he would have the great principle of the freedom of    commerce recognised by some public act and by degrees but as soon as may be everything brought into that great principle in many branches of commerce the transit would be easy with these we might begin and step by step trace back the mistaken road and finally let it not be forgotten as a motive for reverting to a better system that england no longer possesses the physical power of enforcing submission to her desires when those decrees are friendly to nations whose local circumstances formerly made them so much dependent on the protection or forbearance of our government our ships cannot now blockade their ports nor assume the exclusive right of conveying to them the foreign commodities they need they are no longer compelled to receive their supplies from our warehouses nor is that state of things likely to return franklin spoke like a practical philosopher when he said that the best plan of policy would be to make england one free port with her immense resources of mind of wealth of industry—with everything indeed which can contribute to her commercial superiority—could she be spared the interference of those who intending perhaps to protect manage constantly to wound and injure her what might she not become of the following tract everything that is emphatic in its style or irresistible in its reasonings belongs to its distinguished author he has seized on and applied with singular felicity and energy all the great bearings of this interesting and important subject and the writer has only ventured to blend with the original matter a few practical and local observations which have come under his personal cognizance observations c section i nature of the prohibitory system just as the period was expiring beyond which according to the spanish constitution the cortes had no power to continue their sittings—at a moment when affairs the most urgent and interests the most important necessarily distracted and divided their attention—the outline of a law was precipitated through its several stages prohibiting manufactured woollens cottons linens and silks and attaching heavy duties to the introduction of many other manufactured articles so hurried was this measure that its details were obliged to be referred to the finance minister and so unexpected that all the correspondence which communicated to this country the first news of the decree breathed nothing but surprise or disappointment regret or anger yet there can be no doubt the real as the averred object was to give encouragement and increase to the manufacturing branch of national industry by compelling the employment of home productions in lieu of those which spain had been accustomed to receive from other manufacturing countries it was certainly not intended to do mischief to those countries either by interfering with their trade by lessening their wealth or by exciting their feelings of hostility it was indeed neither more nor less than an application of the system of factitious encouragement of the domestic production in the indirect mode that is by discouragement applied to the same articles when produced by foreign countries the expediency of such a measure may be conveniently considered in two points of view—the general in its application to all countries the particular as especially affecting spain it may be laid down as a universal maxim that the system of commercial restriction is always either useless or mischievous or rather mischievous in every case in a less degree or in a greater degree in the judgment of the purchaser or the consumer the goods discouraged must be either better than those which are protected or not if not better of course better for a fixed equivalent they will not be bought even though no prohibition exist here then is usefulness or mischief in the lesser degree but the case and the only probable case in which the fictitious encouragement will be applied is that where the goods excluded are better or in other words cheaper than those sought to be protected here is unqualified mischief mischief in the greater degree    it may be desirable here to explain that the word better when used means better at the same price—i e cheaper price is in truth a more convenient standard because an unfluctuating and determinate standard quality not better means then that in the opinions of the purchasers or the consumers the article is more advantageous or more agreeable and it is better in the proportion in which it is more advantageous or agreeable this premised we proceed more satisfactorily to consider the results of a prohibitory law of this sort in all the points of view of which it is susceptible when in the view of favouring home commodities a prohibition inhibiting the introduction of foreign rival commodities is obtained that prohibition is either obeyed or disobeyed obeyed if the home article be purchased instead of the foreign one or if neither the one nor the other be purchased disobeyed if instead of the home article the foreign one be purchased in the case of such prohibition obedience takes place in some instances disobedience in other instances case i the prohibition obeyed and the purpose answered by the purchase and use of the home article instead of the rival foreign article—the price paid for the home article is greater than would have been paid for the rival foreign article had the prohibition not existed if not the prohibition would be without an object what then is the result to the consumer the difference between the one price and the other the injury or loss which he sustains is equivalent to the imposition of a tax of the same amount but the pocket into which the produce of this sort of tax goes whose is it that of the public no but that of the individual producer of the article thus taxed to the people at large without diminishing the amount of other taxes the effect is no other—the benefit no greater than that of a tax to the same amount would be if instead of being conveyed into the national treasury it were pocketed by the individual collectors if instead of the prohibition in question a tax to the same amount had been imposed on the rival foreign article the produce instead of being thus given to the collectors would have been conveyed into the public purse and by the whole amount have operated as a saving to the people in diminution of the contribution that would otherwise have been exacted through other channels not to the whole amount it may be said for in case of the tax the expense of collection would have been to be deducted yes to the whole amount for the expense of enforcing the prohibition would assuredly be as much as probably more than the expense of collecting the tax case ii the prohibition obeyed the rival foreign article not purchased but the home article not purchased—here though the law is obeyed the purpose of it is not answered this will be the effect insomuch as the advance of price caused by the prohibition deprives the consumer of the power of purchasing it the home article too bad in quality the foreign too dear from the excess of price produced by the risk of evading the prohibition the home article is then neglected in consequence of the disgust produced by its comparative bad quality—the foreign is not purchased on account of its dearness which dearness is the result of the prohibiting law in this case though no loss in a pecuniary form is produced to those who antecedently to the prohibition were accustomed to purchase and to enjoy the article in question—though no loss in a tangible and measurable form is suffered—yet in the form of comfort—in the form of that wonted enjoyment on which the article depends for the whole of its value the loss is not less real and the loss is incalculable true it is that whatsoever the consumers in question would have expended but for the prohibition on the articles in question is left in their hands unexpended to be employed in other articles and therefore the loss is not total true but there is a loss a loss is implied in their being compelled to purchase articles which they would not otherwise have chosen the amount of loss is not within the reach of calculation but where it is possible to erect a comparative standard of price or quality between the goods which would be purchased but for the prohibition and those which are purchased on account of the prohibition the loss presents itself in a tangible and measurable shape case iii the prohibition disobeyed the purpose not answered the home article not purchased for consumption the rival and foreign article purchased and consumed notwithstanding the prohibition—then not only is the law disobeyed but its purpose is more manifestly frustrated than in either of the foregoing cases under our present supposition the price of the foreign article to the purchaser and consumer cannot but be raised above the current price it held before the prohibition for the prohibition cannot be evaded without extra labour employed and risk incurred by those engaged in the conveyance of it from the hands by which it is exported from the foreign country to the hands of the consumer—and fraudulent labour is of all labour the most costly here too in respect of the loss and burthen to the consuming purchaser the difference between the price of the foreign article when allowed and the foreign article when prohibited has by the whole amount  0 of it the effect—the bad effect—of a tax and by every increase given to the severity or in any other way to the efficiency of the law a correspondent increase is given to the amount and burthensomeness of this unproductive substitute to a government tax and into whose pockets is the produce of this worse than useless this baneful substitute to a tax conveyed into the pockets of the public no into the pockets of the homeproducers whom at the expense of all their fellowcountrymen its endeavours are thus employed to serve no but into the pockets of those whose labours are employed whose lives and liberty hazarded in effectually causing the prohibitory law to be disobeyed and the design of it frustrated the persons for whom this favour is intended—what title have they what title can they ever have to such a preference—to a benefit to which a correspondent injury not to say injustice to others—an injury an injustice to such an extent—is unavoidably linked and in point of numbers what are the favoured when compared with the disfavoured answer the few the few always served or meant to be served at the expense of the many this one observation attaches inevitable and unanswerable condemnation to the measure unless it can be shown that the sum of profit to the few is more than equivalent to the sum of loss to the many but in favour of such a supposition no reason whatever presents itself if any one believes he can discover such a reason—if any one imagines it falls within the possibilities of the case to him it belongs to produce it the loss sustained by those on whom the burthen of the measure most immediately presses—who are as it were in actual contact with the measure is not the only loss antecedently to the prohibition the articles now prohibited were furnished by foreign producers to whom home articles to an amount regarded as a fair equivalent were supplied in return and were in fact the means of purchasing deprived now of the means of paying for the goods of the country which issues the prohibition the foreign producer is driven from the market and here on the very face of the transaction is another set of men on whom a burthen is imposed—or which is the same thing to whom a profit is denied—equivalent at least to the expected benefit supposing it received and at whatever calculation it may be taken here then in addition to the injury done to the universal interest is an injury done to a particular interest equal to the benefit contemplated to the other particular interest for whom the prohibition was made not so it may be objected—not so for what they before purchased with the prohibited goods they will continue to purchase with other notprohibited goods or with money which is still better vain however is this objection in money perhaps they would have paid for these our goods rather than have gone for the like to some other country in money they would have paid for them could they have got it but they could not have got it except by selling their goods if they have sold their goods and realized their profit why should they bring the money they have produced to you but they will pay in other goods if we want those goods and can pay for them and will allow them to be brought to us we shall have them in any case whether the others be prohibited or not so that the question remains as it was before this is the point at which any person who being determined to justify the prohibitory system at all events though at the same time conscious of its unjustifiability would be apt to attempt a diversion by leading the debate into the subject of the balance of trade but without going into the details of that controversy a demonstration of the reality of the loss founded on universal experience may satisfy even the malâ fide adversary after having been accustomed to sell the whole or a part of his produce to this or that particular customer no man who knows that that customer is prevented from sending the only goods he was used to send in return but would understand himself feel himself to have sustained a loss a loss he would necessarily sustain and by the whole value of the goods supposing him not to find another customer—and if a less advantageous customer than before the loss though less in amount not less real in fact and if in the case in question it be alleged that in the room of every person so prevented by the prohibition from giving for the goods the usual equivalent another customer comes of course—he who makes the allegation that such a second customer comes of course is bound to produce him—to provide him—for his argument at least the general result would be more clearly perceived from an individual case in point—spain sells to england wine wool oil fruits c she takes in return a great variety of manufactured and other articles on a sudden a prohibitory degree is passed—spain is no longer allowed to buy the foreign manufactured articles of the surplus of spanish produce not sold and consumed at home a great proportion was bought for england in return for the english articles sent to spain where are the spaniards now to find customers for that produce not from england for they have deprived england of the means    of buying not from other countries at least from those to whom the same prohibitions apply add to these necessary ill consequences the probable ill consequences produced by counter restrictions and prohibitions against your goods in countries the introduction of whose goods you restrict or prohibit and the quantum of loss or suffering will be greatly increased thus then must the question be finally put—the burthen to those who are injured—what is its amount the benefit to those who are meant to be favoured—what is its amount persons human feelings pounds shillings and pence in english in spanish reals of vellon—to all these subjects must the arithmetical calculation be applied before we can come to any just and wellgrounded conclusion—and when there are two parties to the question—two contending parties—the arithmetical operation must be applied with equal correctness to both sides of the account otherwise it will be no more an honest account than if in a statement of account between a and b all the items on one side were omitted yet in the account kept of the pretended or supposed encouragements in question the unreciprocal operation is the sort of operation that is performed—that has been commonly performed section ii mischiefs of the prohibitory system the prohibitory measure is introduced then into the country in question in order to compel the sale within itself of its own productions in opposition to foreign productions under the notion of their being rival productions reader whoever you may be to avoid difficulties in the expression we will call that country your country mischief i dearer commodities are forced upon your countrymen instead of cheaper and all are sufferers by whom the cheaper article was anterior to the prohibition bought or consumed in many cases the whole population of the country excepting such as were disabled by poverty from becoming purchasers the gross sum of injury will be the difference of price between the homeproduced and the foreignprohibited article calculated on the whole amount of consumption the loss in spain immeasurably great—probably not less than a fourth on all the manufactures consumed amount of imports of manufactured articles is about £ 00000 yearly from england only see table a mischief ii mischief by commodities of inferior quality being forcibly substituted to commodities of superior quality sufferers as before all those who antecedently to the prohibition employed or consumed the good article and who now are compelled to employ the bad one or who employ none—amount of loss unsusceptible of calculation—incalculable in spain as before peculiarly great with the exception of a few silk manufactures and some of fine woollens which have lately been brought to a state of great excellence without the prohibitory system and which for their continued improvement and ultimate perfection require no prohibitory system to protect them—with the exception of a few manufactured articles of silk and wool—the manufactures of spain are in a state of wretched imperfection many excluded fabrics cannot be produced there bombazines for instance an article of very general consumption—an article so peculiar and beautiful in its perfect form that it has not yet been manufactured even in france where the silkfabrics are in such an advanced state so again the articles produced by the coarse long wool of this country this wool being peculiar to england inferiority applies necessarily more or less to all homeencouraged articles compared with foreign prohibited articles manufactures become cheap and good in proportion to the advantages possessed in their creation and the state of the mechanical arts in spain being exceedingly backward the production of articles moderate in price and excellent in quality cannot be contemplated another contingent mischief then follows the prohibition—an evil even to the few producers the strongest motives to emulation being removed the homegoods will not be improved as they would be when impelled by the rivalry of the superior foreign goods permanent inferiority is therefore likely to be entailed on a nation by the prohibitory system and misdirection of capital from objects leaving certain and larger profit to objects promising only uncertain and lesser profit mischief iii mischief by the cessation or diminution of the demand for the homeproduced commodities such as before the prohibition were taken by the foreigners in exchange for the commodities now prohibited sufferers those who antecedently to the prohibition were engaged in the production of the commodities so taken in exchange amount of this suffering uncertain it will have place in so far as the prohibition takes effect so also when it is evaded for it cannot be evaded without a rise of price proportioned to the risk regarded as attached to the endeavour to evade suppose then the price to the customer in your country doubled the quantity of commodities that can be employed in the purchase of your homeproduced commodities is reduced onehalf    in spain again this third mischief singularly great of some of her exporting produce the greater part is bought for foreign markets by foreigners distress produced by the prohibition proportionably great in      an instance in point occurred when in the interior provinces particularly la mancha and castille great distress was occasioned among the agricultural producers by the excess of produce remaining unsold on their hands in some districts the harvest was left to perish on the ground but this was under the reign of the restrictive system only how much would the evil have been augmented under the prohibitory system it appears by table c that the amount of produce yearly imported into england from spain varies between £  00000 and £ 000000 sterling mischief iv mischief by the loss of the tax which antecedently to the prohibition was paid by the commodities now prohibited i e of the correspondent supply received from that source by the government for the use of the people sufferers all payers of taxes i e all the population amount of the suffering the annual amount of the supply received from this source in spain again the mischief eminently great the duties on imported goods being one of the most important sources—nearly a fourth of the whole revenue the net amount of customhouse revenue from june    0 to june      is calculated  0000000 reals de vellon the expense of collecting the customhouse revenne is nearly    per cent its gross amount is about  00000000 reals or one million sterling mischief v increase given to the number of smugglers in consequence of the prohibition and the increase of price which the persons habituated to consume or otherwise use the now prohibited commodities will determine to give rather than forego the use of them this mischief is of a very complicated nature and branches out into a variety of evil consequences pernicious to the moral feeling—pernicious to pecuniary interests of the government functionaries whose labour previously to the prohibition was employed in the collection of the tax paid on the introduction of the commodities in question the labour will now be employed in securing the exclusion of them from the hands of the intruded purchasers—or in depriving such purchasers of them should they have reached their hands suppose them to be thus seized what is to become of them are they to be destroyed here is dead and absolute loss to everybody are they to be sold for government account the benefit intended for the home producers of the rival commodity is prevented from coming into their hands if sold with permission to be employed at home as has been usually the case in spain then is suffering created to the amount of their value to the holder and not an atom of benefit obtained for the home producer if sold with an obligation to export as is the practice in england the loss is diminished but not less certain—loss of the extra value given by the labour of smuggling—loss consequent on nonadaptation to other markets—and other contingent loss unsusceptible of calculation at all events all loss attaches to your own people the commodities having passed from the hands of the foreigner whose profits have been secured into yours—with you the risk of the adventure now lies of a part of the people whose labour antecedently to the prohibition may have been and until reason appear to the contrary ought to be presumed to have been employed in some profitseeking and productive operation that labour is now under the temptation afforded by the expected increase of price obtainable for the prohibited commodities employed in the endeavour to introduce them and convey them to the hands of the venders in spite of the counterexertions of the functionaries of government—there too is the additional loss of the amount of that labour we have thus under the prohibitory decree two contending bodies not to say armies engaged in constant conflict—the customhouse officers having for the object of their exertions to give effect to the decree and to prevent the introduction of the prohibited articles—and the smugglers having for their object to evade the decree by promoting and effecting the introduction of those articles the government functionaries are paid voluntarily by the government rulers out of the contributions paid involuntarily by the people the smugglers are paid voluntarily by the people in the course of this conflict lives will be lost and other bodily harm will be sustained on both sides destruction of property will also have place particularly of such articles as are the subject of the contest thus set on foot nor can the calculations under this head of mischief be closed without reverting to another mischief procured by the giving execution—the enforcing submission to the prohibitionordinance as against those by whom that ordinance is disregarded—i e by the    execution of the law against or upon such delinquents under this head must be considered two perfectly distinguishable masses of evil—  the evil of expense attached to the officer created and paid and to the other arrangements of all sorts having for their objects the punishment of offenders the prevention of the offence   evil of punishment composed of the suffering of those in whom whether justly or unjustly under the supposition of delinquency on their parts the punishment is caused to be inflicted and when—it is a supposition due to all who have in any instance benefited by the lessons of experience and from whom we have reason to hope that there will be no obstinate persisting in a system fraught with evil—when erroneous views shall be succeeded by correct ones and these prohibitory decrees be repealed accordingly—these smugglers what becomes of them a return to honest labour is neither so agreeable nor so easy as but for the improvident law continuance in it would have been some by choice some by necessity the smugglers are transformed into freebooters corruption is thus spread over the morals of the people and those who should have been the guardians are the corruptors universally applicable as are the objections ranged under this head to spain they apply with a cogency little imagined by those who are unacquainted with the localities of the peninsula and the longestablished habits of its people the immense extent of coast the badness of the cross roads the mountainous character of the country are likely to be permanent auxiliaries to those immense bodies of organized smugglers who from time immemorial have carried on a large proportion of the commerce of spain the adventurous and dangerdefying character of the spanish mountaineer seems to have peculiarly fitted him for enterprises of this sort little reproach attaches to the profession of the smuggler and the frequent representation of his bold feats on the stage is witnessed generally with great interest often with admiration sometimes with envy the popular song yo soy un contrabandista which recounts some of his deeds of heroism has been long a favourite at the court of madrid and especially a favourite of the monarch himself the impracticability of carrying the prohibitory decrees of spain into effect is already pretty generally recognised there as if nature had provided for its certain evasion gibraltar becomes the great depôt for the south lisbon and oporto for the west and the hundred passages of the pyrenees will supply the northern and eastern provinces every merchant knows that at the principal commercial ports of spain a great part of the duties has been habitually evaded and large portions of goods constantly introduced without the payment of any duty at all except on articles of considerable bulk of peculiarly difficult transport or of trifling value the advance of price in consequence of the prohibition has been scarcely perceptible in any of the principal markets of spain and the idea is treated with ridicule that in case the system of prohibition should be persisted in the enforcement of it to any considerable extent can be practicable the amount of restrictive duties in some cases not very high ones was always deemed more than a sufficient price for the labour and risk of the smuggler the harvest will now be extended and the labourers will be abundant—the profits greater the disbanded guerillas will furnish recruits enough for the army of smugglers—recruits too who will require but little training even in the province catalonia which it is intended particularly to favour by the interdicting system there is scarcely a village without its contrabandista—scarcely a creek which does not daily witness the exploits of its smuggling adventurers—scarcely an animal which has not borne the unlawful merchandise—and scarcely an individual who does not wear part of it the frequent and bloody frays between the armed customhouse officers or the military and the armed and desperate bodies of smugglers in spain are notorious to every individual who has had the desire and the opportunity to obtain information on the subject every year numerous lives are lost and the sympathy of the public is where it ought not to be—with the criminals and not with the agents of public justice as to loss of liberty and comfort the prisons under the old regime were always full even to overflowing of the poor mendicant abandoned children who solicited charity in the streets the short tale of ninetenths of them was i have no father what is your father dead no in prison in prison for life and why por el tabaco—for smuggling tobacco—was the constant answer mischief vi national discord discord between the provinces for which the benefit is designed on the one part and on the other the provinces by which while the burthen is sustained in its full weight no share in the benefit will be received or can be looked for sufferers the whole people on the one part and on the other this mischief too bears most heavily on spain in the provinces of no country is the rivalry so strong—it might even be said the enmity so active—as among the spanish provinces different languages different habits different forms of local government different provincial privileges here total exemption from taxation—there excessive burthen of taxation in some feudality—in others the proudest and most universal individual independence—everything    in fact seemed to demand from the spanish legislator plans for general conciliation—especially where the constitution professed to level all the inhabitants of all the provinces to universal equality but these prohibitions are introduced it is avowed solely or mainly for the benefit of catalonia a small part of valencia may be perhaps included the whole population of the former is   0000 of the latter  00000 that of spain  0 00000 but of the population of the two provinces referred to a very small proportion is engaged in manufactures the number engaged in the fabrication of piece goods which the prohibition is principally meant to encourage is probably not greater than a hundredth part of the whole population of the peninsula and even though it be shown—but this cannot be shown—that the interest of every labouring manufacturer is encouraged or advanced by the prohibitory laws we have a fearful account against the legislator—for every individuals interest protected the interests of more than a hundred are sacrificed and this is a government professing to have for its object to preserve and protect by wise and just laws civil liberty property and all other legitimate rights of all the individuals who compose it mischief vii illwill produced and directed towards you by foreign rulers and people from the suffering or loss produced by the prohibition of their commodities and the consequent deprivation of the sale for them the danger may not perhaps be great that by a measure which does not appear to have had for its cause any hostile affection nor anything but a mistaken calculation of selfregarding interest any affection decidedly unfriendly—any positive act of hostility—should be necessarily produced mischiefs short of positive hostility may still with but too much probability in every case be apprehended from wounds inflicted in the course of the contest between selfregard on the one side and selfregard on the other—wounds inflicted by the hands of mere selfregard though unattended with illwill especially where no reasonable cause for illwill can be found but if illwill be kept off from a sense that no injury was intended contempt will probably occupy its place in proportion as the impolicy of the system is manifest in most cases however the prohibitory system produces a retaliatory operation and the power of retaliation possessed against spain is unfortunately very great what if other countries whose wares are excluded from spain load with excessive taxation or exclude by total prohibition the surplus of her produce for which she has no consumption at home for this plan of retorting injury has been too long current to spain it would be a great calamity whatever the result of the struggle might be if the question of commercial policy should resolve itself into the question of politically weaker or stronger mischief viii illwill on the part of your own people exerted towards the ruling and influential few by whom the burthens thus imposed have had their existence antecedently to the prohibition in whom as to the matter in question did your people in general behold their friends in the people of that nation in those people—foreigners as they were and are—by whom though not without reciprocal and equivalent benefits such additions were made to their comfort if not in point of affection their friends at the least and at the worst their actual benefactors—whether in intention or not at any rate in effect subsequently to the prohibitory system in whom in consequence of it will they behold though not their intended yet not the less their real adversaries—the authors of their sufferings—of all the sources of suffering above enumerated—in whom but in their rulers these—for so it is hoped it may by this time be allowable to call them—these their misguided rulers at the same time still looking at home in whom will the people behold in addition to their foreign friends as above a set of domestic ones even in the smugglers—in those men by whose industry and intrepidity they will have been preserved in so far as they will have been preserved in the enjoyment of those comforts of which had the endeavours of their rulers been effectual they would have been deprived thus while on the one side they will be beholding in the character of adversaries and injurers a comparatively small portion of their fellowsubjects in confederacy with their rulers on the other side they will see in the character of friends a nation of foreigners and a body of malefactors—friends linked to them by community of interest—friends in whose good offices they behold their only resource against the ill offices done to them by those who should have been their friends upon spain the eyes of the world have been fixed full of hope already they begin to turn away full of disappointment not new authorities for error not fresh instances of the reckless abandonment of the interests of the greater number to the usurpations of the lesser number did we anticipate from that land of promise alas we have been deceived a circumstance from which the evil connected with the encouragement of smugglers is liable to receive peculiar aggravation is the state of the system of judicial procedures decision being always tardy and often unobtainable and from the want of publicity on    the part of the evidence the grounds of it never known and therefore never satisfactory the connexion between delinquency and punishment is wholly broken for the benefit of the lawyers official and professional together persons suspected of being malefactors—justly and unjustly suspected—are apprehended and mingled together in jail jails are filled with them when they can hold no more they are emptied of necessity in this state of things what is done is done not by the hand of justice outstretched from her elevated station to give execution to the law upon offenders not so much in the way of judicial procedure by the exercise of authority by superiors over inferiors—but in the way of warfare between contending armies one army composed of revenue officers and their privates—the other composed of smugglers and their auxiliaries if in the course of a battle smugglers are taken prisoners it is only as prisoners that they suffer—a sort of prisoners of war not as malefactors infamyattaching punishment at the bar of public opinion is not their portion infamy is more generally attached to the function of the revenue officer than to the function of the defrauder of the revenue in every country the obtainment of good from the administration of the law depends on the excellence of the law itself in spain nothing can be worse to spain then the foregoing observations specially apply thus much as to the mischiefs attendant on such a state of things is there any percontra good the greater and more manifest the sum of mischief produced to all others the less will be the benefit to those on whom it is sought to confer that benefit the greater the mischief the more surely manifest and the more surely manifest the greater the security for the removal of the mischiefproducing ordinances which if removed the benefit for the sake of which the mischief was introduced will be removed with them thus on the part of the individuals for whom the favour was intended prudence will interdict all expensive arrangements for taking the benefit of it it will interdict the acceptance of a favour—a favour only to be obtained by perilous pecuniary adventure whose continuance depends solely on the continuance of human blindness the loss of which will accordingly be an assured consequence following the removal of the film of error but as great expectations may be excited by the promise of the exclusive benefits to be given to the homeproducer as opposed to the rivalforeigner it may be found that many will be so misguided as to stake their hopes and fortunes on the expected advantages what wonder then if the influx of competition produce a further diminution of the promised benefit if the legislating body who are engaged by such powerful motives to take an accurate view of the situation in which they stand—if the legislating body deceive themselves and err under the influence of their selfdeception what wonder that others less wellinformed—less intellectually distinguished—fall into the same or similar errors before the tribunal of public opinion the prohibitionsystem in question having nothing but misrepresentation for its support—misrepresentation in all imaginable shapes is accordingly sure to be employed the sort of misrepresentation most trusted to is that by which the whole question is stated to be altogether and merely a question between natives and foreigners—between national and antinational interests the notion sought to be conveyed being that whatever suffering is produced it is by foreigners and only by foreigners that it is sustained—that whatever benefit is produced it is byy natives and by natives alone that it is reaped and enjoyed then comes the interrogation which is meant to impose silence—will you sacrifice your own interests to the interests of these foreigners who therefore are represented to view in as unfavourable a light as can be found for them and thereupon comes the parade of patriotism displayed at a cheap rate—at the expense of only a few pompous words but the truth has been already sufficiently unveiled—the truth of universal application and in an unanswerable form in the case of spain the benefit of it has been shown to be little—next to nothing the mischief great—and greater much greater to spaniards themselves than to those whom they would call foreigners thus as towards foreigners in general—towards all the inhabitants of the globe with the few exceptions of those we call our fellowcountrymen antipathy is excited and propagated a foolish and degrading antipathy not less adverse to the dictates of selfregarding prudence than to those of benevolence and beneficence and what is the result—the melancholy result every effort which a man makes to excite his countrymen to hate foreigners is an effort made whether designedly or not to excite foreigners to hate them by every attempt in which he thus labours to bring down upon his countrymen the fruits of the enmity of these foreigners he more effectually and certainly labours to deprive his countrymen of those fruits of goodwill which they might otherwise have enjoyed the enmity which cannot but be produced on the part of those foreigners even by the calm pursuit of their own interests—the    enmity necessarily produced by the frequent and unavoidable competition of interests—is surely quite enough without making any new and needless addition without exerting and letting loose the angry passions in any other direction and giving to illwill—already too active and too prevalent—auxiliaries at once so unnecessary and so dangerous when for the purpose of encouraging homeindustry a prohibition is imposed on the produce of foreign industry when directed to the same object the branch thus meant to be encouraged is either a new one or an oldestablished one it is in the former case that the impolicy and absurdity of the measure is at its maximum it is as if a tax being imposed the produce of it—the whole produce of it—should be thrown into the deep if left to itself personal interest would direct both labour and capital to their most profitable occupation if the new favoured occupation be the most profitable it needs not this artificial support—if it be not the most favourable the effect if any of the prohibition is to call capital and labour from a more profitable to a less profitable employment at all events the consequence of the prohibition is this it leads to nothing or it leads to detriment if not useless it is calamitous in vain would it be said aye but it is only intended to apply this extraencouragement to the new occupation while in its infancy it is only in its infancy that it will stand in need of it the time of probation past and its time of maturity arrived the wealth that will then be added to the wealth of the nation will and for ever be greater than the wealth which for a time it is proposed to subtract from it by no such statement can the prohibitory measure be justified in the infancy of any such employment it is only by actual wealth in the shape of additional capital that any effectual assistance can be given to a new branch of industry by removal of competition increase may indeed be given to the rate of profit if profit be the result of the newly directed labour but it is only by the employment of capital which must necessarily be taken from other sources that this result can be obtained the prohibition of existing rival establishments will not create that capital the case in which the impolicy is less glaring and the intervention most excusable and plausible is that of an oldestablished branch of industry the object being not to bestow on it factitious encouragement and on those concerned in it factitious prosperity—but only to preserve it from decline and those connected with it from being destitute of the means of subsistence but still the former objections irresistibly apply if the establishment be prosperous factitious encouragement is needless if it be unprosperous encouragement is baneful serving only to give misdirection to capital and labour—to give permanent misdirection since without that factitious encouragement interest and common sense would correct the mistakes of miscalculation as soon as discovered in the next place comes the objection that if in this shape encouragement be given to any particular occupation it must if impartial justice be done be in like circumstances afforded to every other in whatsoever instance therefore a branch of industry should be going on in a prosperous state any rival branch of industry that found itself in a declining or less prosperous state would have right to claim the interposition of the prohibitory principle—the diminution or destruction of that rivals prosperity on this supposition a great part of the business of government would be to watch over the whole field of productive labour for the purpose—not the ultimate purpose but still the purpose—of lessening the value of the produce diminishing prosperousness for the relief of unprosperousness preventing a from selling cheap goods in order that b may be enabled to sell dear ones prohibiting a from producing superior articles for the purpose of helping b to get rid of his inferior articles here then is a vast proportion of the time and labour of the constituted authorities employed to no better purpose in no higher aim than to check prosperity as it proceeds—to sacrifice success to the want of success—to diminish the mass of habitual wealth instead of increasing it whatever be the effect of accident in this or that particular instance operating against the general principle the general principle may be safely assumed and laid down that the prosperity of every branch of industry will increase and decrease in the ratio of the degree of aptitude—of moral intellectual and active aptitude—on the part of the persons engaged in it on the degree absolute and comparative of prudence vigilance exertion appropriate information and industrious talent possessed by them among the effects of the mode of supposed encouragement in question will be its operating in the character of a prohibition on superior appropriate aptitude and giving to inferior appropriate aptitude the advantage over it it is in a word a contrivance for causing everything to be done as badly as possible—for giving to evil the encouragements due to good    section iii causes of the prohibitory system the system of injustice and impolicy thus extensively pursued—to what causes shall its existence and its domination be ascribed in this case as in others the cause will be found in the comparative strength of the producing influence concurring with the comparative weakness of the opposing and restraining influence the efficient causes—the causes of the prohibition—are— i combined public exertions ii secret or corrupt influence iii nonexistence of counterefficient influence iv legislative blindness i in proportion as an individual engaged in any one branch of industry sees or fears to see his performances outdone by any competitor whether foreign or domestic he is interested in putting a stop to such rival labour if possible—or to lessen its produce as far as he is able the individual feeling is necessarily communicated to any body of individuals in the same situation their common bond of union against those who are prejudiced by the employment of these productions is much stronger than the motives to rivalry against one another hence to obtain benefit for themselves and each other individually and collectively considered at the expense of all but themselves is of course at all times the wish and as far as any prospect of success presents itself at all times the endeavour of all persons so connected and so situated by combined public exertion what is meant to be designated is neither more nor less than the aggregate of the exertions made by all such individuals as deem themselves likely to receive benefit in any shape from the prohibitory measure in question the following are the principal circumstances on which the success of such exertion will naturally depend—   the apparent and thence the real number of the persons thus confederating of whose individual interests the particular interest in question is composed   the aggregate quantity of capital engaged in the particular interest in question   the apparent and thence the real magnitude of the loss that would be produced to that particular interest for want of the prohibitory measure in question   the facility which by local neighbourhood or otherwise they possess for combining their efforts and for concerting measures for employing them with the greatest possible effect   the ability with which such representations are framed as are intended to convey their case to the cognizance of the constituted authorities or others on whom they depend for the ultimate success of their exertions ability accompanied by energy and clearness in so far as correct conception would be favourable to their cause—with obscurity and confusion in so far as correct conception would be unfavourable to their cause   the useful extent given to the circulation of such their communications which extent will have for its measure the difference between the whole number of the persons on whose cognizance of the matter the success of their exertions will have to depend and the number of those by whom in consequence of their receipt of these communications or otherwise cognizance of the matter comes to be actually taken ii by secret influence the idea intended to be conveyed is that influence which on the occasion in question is applied to the one or the few on whose will the success of the exertion depends by the one or the few who by habitual intercourse possess in relation to them more or less facility of access in private on the part of the individual in question be he who he may the quantity of time it is possible for him to apply to the business in question be it what it may is a limited quantity—a quantity which with reference to that necessary for the reception of the whole body of information is most commonly and most probably insufficient even when the faculties of the person in question are in the highest degree possible well adapted to the prompt and correct reception of it if in any instance it happens that a person who by any consideration be it what it may stands engaged to give support to the measure is in habits of adequate familiarity with those on whom the adoption of it depends the consequent advantage possessed by the measure is great and manifest an additional and extra quantity of the arbiters time is thus applied to the subject and applied on that side the only portion of time habitually applied to the business of the office in question taken in the aggregate will be the only portion of time a part of which can in general be allotted to the particular business in question in the regular and established way if then so it be that amongst those who have habitual access to the official person amongst his ordinary companions and intimates should happen to be a person thus interested in the measure a portion of the time allotted even for refreshment will in this particular instance be added to the time allotted to official business and thus the force of that sympathy which is produced by social enjoyment of this sort is added to whatsoever force the case may afford on that side in the shape of appropriate and substantial argument    thus it is that whatsoever of just representative fact and argument together is afforded by the measure in question is capable of receiving in one way or other from secret influence an incalculable degree of force the influence let it be supposed is in the case in question no other than that which may be deemed legitimate influence—influence of understanding on understanding—influence operating no otherwise than by the direct force of such facts and arguments as the case may furnish but by the same private opportunities through which in conjunction with and addition to those of a public nature facility is given to the application of this legitimate influence—by these same private opportunities and by these alone facility is also given to the application of sinister and corruptive influence influence of will on will applied in a pecuniary or other inviting shape to the official persons private interest iii in every such case of prohibition of one branch of industry for the encouragement of another—of prohibition for example of foreign produce for the encouragement of domestic analogous produce—there are as above two distinct interests—interests opposed to each other the interest of producers the particular interest—the interest of consumers the universal interest of these opposite interests it is the lesser interest that always operates as above with peculiar force—with a force which is peculiar to every particular interest as contradistinguished from and opposed to the greater the universal interest the individuals who compose the particular interest always are or at least may be—and have to thank themselves and one another if they are not—a compact harmonizing body—a chain of iron the individuals making the universal interest are on every such occasion an unorganized uncombined body—a rope of sand of the partakers in the universal interest the proportion of interest centred in one individual is too small to afford sufficient inducement to apply his exertions to the support of his trifling share in the common interest add to which the difficulty the impossibility of confederacy to any such extent as should enable the exertions of the confederates fairly to represent the amount of the general interest—that general interest embracing with few exceptions the whole mass of society in a less degree the same observations apply to the case of the producers of the commodities with which antecedently to the prohibition the now prohibited goods were purchased much greater however is the advantage which the lesser sinister interest possesses over the greater common interest as far as secret influence is concerned of the two modes of secret influence that which is exercised by understanding on understanding comes in only in aid of the legitimate influence of appropriate facts and arguments the demand for it is therefore not altogether exclusive but in so far as that influence is exercised only on one side—in so much as that influence is misdirected by the combined means of persuasion employed by the confederated few who compose the particular interest against the diffused means of persuasion possessed by the unrepresented or imperfectly represented many who compose the general interest—in so far it is clearly pernicious but it is the exclusivelypossessed attribute of a particular interest at once to require and to create facilities for the supply of sinister and corruptive influence the universal interest—the people at large—the subject many—never see never can see engaged in support of their interest—of that universal interest—a friend and advocate established in habits of intimacy with the official person at the table of the official person an intimate whom by any favour in their power to bestow they can induce to engage that same official person to support by his individual exertions that general interest against which the particular interest is waging war for any purpose of corrupt influence the official person himself and his tablecompanion are equally inaccessible to the general interest the particular interest can come at both the consequence is that whenever the general interest is sacrificed to the particular interest a probability has place that the sacrifice has been obtained not from the sincerity of honest delusion but from the perversity of corrupt intention this probability will be more or less according to the more or less obvious impolicy of the measure and to the facilities afforded under the circumstances of the case for the introduction of corruptive influence among those who occupy the high places of authority these causes in fact apply to the whole field of government they account for the universal domination of the interests of the few over the interests of the many they account for the largest portion of the aggregate mass of misrule but it may be retorted this prevalence of particular over universal interest being according to yourself so general the necessary consequence is that no ultimate mischief ensues—everything is as it should be for what is the universal interest but the aggregate of all particular interests this is evading not meeting the argument the desire indeed exists universally to give prevalence each man to his own particular interest but not the faculty the wish is everywhere—the power not so    even of the manufacturing interests it is not every class that has the power to associate and combine in support of the common interest of the class that power only exists where similar manufactures are concentrated in small districts—where means of intercourse are frequent and easy—or where large numbers are employed by large capital lodged in the hand of a single individual or of a single partnership what facilities of general association or combination are possessed by individuals employed as general shopkeepers bakers butchers tailors shoemakers farmers carpenters bricklayers masons c none whatsoever had every one individual in every one of these classes his vote in the business all would indeed be as it should be the sum of all the several distinguishable interests being thus framed and ascertained would constitute the universal interest in a word the principle of universal suffrage would be applied very different however is the state of things separate and particular interests start up solicit and obtain protection by the exercise of the influence referred to to the danger and the detriment of the common prosperity of these the aggregate body of the influential interest is mainly composed the concentration of immense capital in single hands great facilities for combination and sometimes an union of both furnish a power of evil which is but too commonly allowed to immolate the general good against its gigantic influence appeal would seem in vain a number of small fraternities exist who if they were able to unite might maintain themselves against one large one equal to them all but as it is standing up separately separately they are opposed and crushed by the overwhelming influence one by one of the baneful effects produced by the concentrated efforts of a coalition of those individual interests which form the particular interest as opposed to the general national interest the spanish prohibitory decree is a remarkable illustration in this case a few clamorous manufacturers and a few shortsighted selfnamed patriots united their forces and besieged the cortes with their representations compared to the amount of counterinterest they were as we have shown as one to a hundred but their forces were organized—their strength was consolidated where then were the representatives of the thousand when the representatives of the ten were drawn out in battle array nowhere so the law was passed it was declared to be eminently popular for the people who had petitioned had petitioned in its favour the truth being that the people the immense majority of the people had not petitioned at all nobody was sufficiently interested the law was passed and now it is that the public injury begins to be felt and now it is that the public voice begins to be heard spain has had but too long and too calamitous an experience of the injury done by that everbusy meddling with the freedom of commerce which has for ages distinguished her shortsighted legislators and which in spite of natural advantages almost peculiar to herself has eternally involved her in financial difficulties distress and poverty in england all other particular interests are overborne and crushed by one great particular interest named in the aggregate the agricultural interest by a system of prohibition foreign grain is excluded with the avowed intent of making homeproduced grain dearer than it would be otherwise—dearer to the whole population in the character of consumers and customers and for the avowed purpose of securing to a particular class of persons a pecuniary advantage at the expense of the whole population of the country but the class of persons meant to be favoured and actually favoured by this undue advantage are not any class of persons employed in any beneficial operation but a class of persons who without any labour of their own derive from the labours of others a share of the means of enjoyment much greater than is possessed by any who employ their labour in the purchase of it they are land proprietors deriving their means of enjoyment  00 or of luxury from the rent of land cultivated by the industrious they are in a word not labourers but idlers—not the many but the few while for the support of war papermoney was issued in excess they let their lands at rates which if neither too high nor too low at that time taking into account the then value of money would necessarily be too high when by the diminution of the issue of that money the difficulty of obtaining it was increased and its value increased from the same cause and this evil is accumulating if the amount of taxes paid by the occupier of the land on account of the land or on any other account increases also in this case—the case as it now exists—the difficulty of coming to a right judgment of feeling that we have come to a right judgment is great indeed so great that in the determination of many an individual in whose breast particular interest is in operation regard for the universal interest might and would have been productive of the very line of conduct which has been determined by the more potent force of individual interest but of this difficulty wherever it exists what should be the consequence not that prohibition should be resorted to but that it should be abstained from so long as nothing is done in relation to the object by government whatever happens amiss is the result of the nations will and government is not chargeable with it but when and if and where government takes upon itself to interfere and apply to the subject its coercive power whatever mischief results from the exercise of that coercive power is the result of the agency of government and the rulers stand chargeable with it whichever course is taken—action or inaction—interference or noninterference—liberty or coercion in the shape of prohibition—distress to a vast extent—distress verging on ruin—distress on one side or the other—must be the inevitable consequence if the importation of foreign grain be left free ruin is entailed on the farmer distress on the landlords prohibit foreign grain and ruin falls not only upon the manufacturer but upon the labouring class that is the great majority even of agriculturists such is our miserable situation its cause is excessive taxation—excessive taxation the consequence of unjust war—unjust war the fruits of the determination formed by the ruling few to keep the subject many in a state of ignorance and error—in a state of dependence something beneath the maximum of degradation and oppression in england the primal and allsufficient cause of misgovernment and consequent misery the corruption of the system of national representation in every other country the want of a system of adequate national representation or rather the want of a representative democracy in place of a more or less mitigated despotism the want of the only form of government in which the greatest happiness of the greatest number is the end in view the mischiefs then of this system of partial encouragement being in all its shapes so vast so incalculable and their sum so plainly predominant over the sum of good to whom or to what shall we attribute the existence the prevalence of such a system to the general causes of misrule—to the want of the necessary elements of good government—to a deficiency of appropriate probity or intellectual aptitude or active talent in other words to a want of honesty or ability or industry one cause bearing upon the question of appropriate intellectual aptitude or ability and likely to mislead it is this—the good which constitutes the ground of the prohibitory measure the reason that operates in favour of it is comparatively prominent—the evil not equally so its place is comparatively in the back ground hence it is as in too many other instances—a good however small is by its vicinity to the eye enabled to eclipse and conceal the evil however large when reckoning from the day on which a measure has received the force of law a certain period of time has elapsed custom covers it with its mantle and regarding it as an unauthorized act of daring to look into the nature of the measure men inquire no further than into the existence of the law habit gives it a fixed authority and thus it is that in every country worship is bestowed on laws and institutions vying in absurdity with any scheme of extravagance which the imagination of man could produce thus things go on—evil is piled upon evil—till at length the burthen of evil is absolutely intolerable then it is that mens eyes are opened and a desire to retrace their erroneous steps is conceived but no sooner has the legislator turned round than he finds the way barred against him by a host of difficulties and thus when nothing would have been easier at first than to prevent the disease—that is to forbear creating it—the cure becomes ineligible insufferable not to say impossible and error and folly become immoveable and immortal  0  table a value of british produce and manufactures exported from great britain to spain in the years

at the bank of england by the conversion of stock into note annuities  0   0  circulating annuities c introduction the main principle of the proposed measure consists in the opening the market for government annuities on terms of profit to government—viz at a reduced rate of interest to a mass of money which by existing circumstances is either excluded from the faculty of yielding interest to the owners altogether or in the hands of bankers or otherwise they are obliged to accept on inferior security a rate of interest inferior all things considered to that which with a very considerable degree of profit might be allowed by government the annuities thus created to be charged upon the existing fund and the money thus raised to be employed as it comes in in the redemption of debt and thence in exoneration of that fund the result and benefit of the measure taking it on the smallest scale will besides the above profit to government consist in the affording to the least opulent and most numerous class of individuals friendly societies included—in a word to the great bulk of the community—the means of placing out small hoards however minute with a degree of advantage unattainable by any other means† and this too even at compound interest—a mode of accumulation which familiar as it is in name is not in effect capable of being realized by any other means in favour of individuals though so happily brought to bear in favour of the public in the instance of the sinking funds‡—not to speak of the collateral advantage obtained by creating on the part of the lower orders in respect of the proposed new species of property a fresh and more palpable interest in the support of that government on the tranquillity of which the existence of such their property will depend on the larger scale upon which it may be expected to expand itself the measure after accelerating the otherwise rapid ascent of government annuities to the par price† and clearing away the   and   per cents‡ would afford the means of bringing the further reduction of the rate of interest on those annuities to its maximum in point of effect rate of reduction and rapidity taken together∥ reduction of interest accelerating too in this way redemption of principal instead of taking place of it and retarding it as on the plan pursued in mr pelhams days§ other paper currencies have been either like the french assignats and mandats c engagements for money in unlimited quantity and without funds for performance or promises of minute portions of a species of property for example lands and houses incapable of being reduced into such portions or like some of the american currencies promises of metallic money payable at a period altogether indefinite dating for instance from a fixed day posterior to the conclusion of a war by the proposed currency nothing is engaged for but to pay such monies as there are already funds for paying and at such times at which there are funds for paying them and this in a quantity which by the terms of the engagement has its ne plus ultra and can in no case add to the existing amount of the engagements it finds charged upon those funds reimbursing immediately and with profit the fund on which it draws it stands distinguished by this prominent feature from all currencies as yet exemplified¶ the losses experienced or apprehended from rash or penniless issuers of promissory notes gave birth to the restrictions imposed on issues of sums below a certain magnitude but this reason has no application to notes expressive of engagements of the sort proposed on the part of government issuing from such a source the sums of the notes cannot be too minute incapable of increasing certain even of diminishing the amount of the engagements they find existing the influx of them cannot be too great the smallness of the notes adds to the multitude of the customers the multitude of the notes divides the mass of the engagements and does not add to it confined within those bounds the magnitude  0  of the emission adds not only to the profit of the measure but to the security of the fund a species of notes was not long ago proposed whereby government annuities were to stand mortgaged and yet it was supposed without diminution of their value—and which were expected to pass and be paid for as if they had engaged for the payment of so much money though without binding any assignable individual to the payment of it but the now proposed plan engages for no payment for which adequate funds are not already in existence nor without imposing on a determinate individual the obligation of making the payment out of those funds nor yet burthens those funds without immediately disburthening them to a superior amount by taking from the load of government annuities which is found pressing on the market the sale of the land tax for stock has bettered the terms of all succeeding loans on the measure now proposed hangs a profit the same in kind superior in degree reducing the mass of the national debt the operation on the land tax takes nothing from the mass of national capital—the proposed measure adds to it the former borrows from capital but refunds immediately with  0 per cent to boot the latter adds still more to capital and that as speedily without having borrowed anything† every penny of the national debt redeemed if redeemed with money not borrowed from capital is so much added it will be shown to that part of the national capital which does not consist of money the addition made by the sinking fund to the mass of national capital is little inferior to the defalcation it makes from the mass of national debt so many years as by the aid of the proposed measure may come to be struck off from the period which would otherwise have been occupied in the redemption of the debt so many years interest upon the sum equal to the greatest amount of that debt will therefore have been added and that at compound interest to the amount of national capital by the operation of the proposed measure a sort of discovery in political economy has been made of late for such it seems to be that commercial security is not less liable to suffer by deficiency than by excess in respect of the customary quantity of paper in circulation among the advantages attendant on the proposed paper will be found that of affording a remedy and that of the preventive kind against the shocks which commercial security might otherwise have to sustain from such deficiency or excess‡ shocks of that kind are not however the only mischief to which the community stands exposed not only by the abuse but even by the use of every species of circulating paper as yet known rise of prices is another mischief less heeded but not less real by gold and silver money to the same amount the same mischief would it is true be produced and in the same degree but the magnitude of the mischief is in proportion to the suddenness of the addition not to the absolute quantum of it and in the shape of cash the influx is not susceptible of any such suddenness as in the shape of paper to be capable of opposing an effectual barrier to a torrent of this sort will be found to be among the properties of the proposed paper to point out measures adequate to that end is among the tasks undertaken in the plan of the proposed measure∥ the extent of the proposed emission being given neither the efficiency nor the utility of the measure will be found open to dispute the only room for uncertainty regards the extent as to that point cases are collected

as a farthing by the end either of the first or second halfyear yet by the end of the third halfyear it will amount to a farthing with a fraction over and consequently on three such notes taken together it will amount to a farthing by the end of the first halfyear and on two by the end of the second halfyear k the reduction being from £        ¾ per cent to £       ¼ fractions of a farthing

styled gold notes it is proposed that the paper for the gold notes shall for distinction sake be yellow m the two series or scales here given with their respective halves and doubles c will be found to be the only convenient series for a currency on which daily interest is to be computed the series which has the £      s note for its standard note giving for the rate of yearly interest £        ¾ being a trifle less than £  per cent the series which has the £   note for its standard note giving for the rate of yearly interest £       ¼ being a trifle more than  ⅜ per cent by each of these series or scales even sums sums having a certain number of pieces of existing coin exactly corresponding to them are given for the amount of the several notes respectively exhibited by them in any other series that could be interposed fractional sums sums not having any number of existing coins exactly corresponding to them would present themselves in several places by altering the principal sum or purchase money for the standard amount of interest viz a farthing a day from £   to no more than half as much viz £  the rate of interest would be doubled that is raised from a trifle more than  ⅜ per cent to a trifle more than  ¾ but were this to be the rate allowed at the present period viz anno   00 instead of profit there would be loss the rate given by the last loan   st february   00 being no more than £        ¼ per cent instead of £       0½ which would be the rate allowed if no more than £  were taken for the above standard amount of interest by altering the principal or purchase money of the said standard amount of interest from £      s to as much again viz £      s the rate of interest corresponding to that amount would be reduced by onehalf i e reduced from almost £  per cent to £       ¼—being a trifle less than  ½ per cent if instead of being reduced by onehalf as above the purchase money of the said standard amount of interest were to be doubled i e raised from £   to £   the rate of interest corresponding to that amount would be reduced by onehalf—reduced from a trifle more than  ⅜ per cent to a trifle more than      per cent for all these rates of interest as well as for any number of multiples or aliquot parts of them this same table it is evident may be made to serve viz by conceiving the series of principal sums to be shifted so many degrees higher or lower the corresponding series of amounts of interest remaining unmoved or vice versâ by conceiving the series of amounts of interest to be shifted so many degrees higher or lower the corresponding series of principal sums remaining unmoved—the number of series or scales which differ in such a manner from one another as to give the amounts of the several sums comprised in them throughout and which in both instances give none but even sums being as above mentioned but two viz that which has £      s and that which has £   for the price of the standard note h in the daily augmentation table on the back of each note the periods will vary in number according to the magnitude of the note in the standard note it is proposed they should be periods of eight days and so in the double quadruple octuple and half of it—amount of increase by the end of such period in the standard note   farthings  d on any intermediate day the exact sum will be made up by adding             or   farthings halfpence twopences or halffarthings according to the distance of the day in question from the last tabular day i e day mentioned in the table in the higher notes the periods might be more numerous in the lower notes they would of course be less numerous since a period indicating an increase under a farthing would be of no use among the silver notes in the  s note the year could contain but four such periods in the  s note but two in the  s note but one and in the sixpenny note but a part to give a whole farthing will here require a whole year and part of another in this there will be no daily augmentation table and in the other silver notes the daily and yearly table will be combined into one in the four intermediate notes between the silver notes and the half of the standard note periods of    days will suffice  0  art   that the interest be in such sums as to be capable of being computed daily as in the case of exchequer bills that the daily interest allowed upon the standard note so termed with reference to any smaller or larger notes that may come eventually to be added to the circulation upon the same principle be a farthing —and that the principal or denominative value of such standard note be £      s and that the interest in order to afford a profit to government be inferior to the current rate borne by government annuities at the opening of the issue say £  per cent nearly —a small sum being added to the principal sum corresponding precisely to that rate for the sake of making the sums the more even especially at the bottom of the scale  art   that each note contain on the face or back of it a table whereby the value of it as increased by daily interest may be seen for every day in the year by inspection without calculation also a table whereby in case of forbearance  to receive the interest the value of a note of that magnitude as increased by daily interest added to yearly interest so forborne to be received may be seen for any number of years by a single addition together with an indication by means of which it may be seen also by simple inspection for what number of years if any the interest on the particular note in question continues unreceived art   that the interest on each note whenever issued commence on the first day of each year of our lord and that on notes issued on the several days after such first day the interest to the day of issue be added to the purchase money  art   that no such annuities be ever issued at a less price  i e so as to bear a   0 greater rate of interest than the first issue and accordingly that as often as any money comes to be raised at a higher rate of interest by perpetual annuities it shall be by the creation of stock annuities c as at present and that a clause to this effect be a fundamental article in the contract made with the purchasers on the part of government and be inserted accordingly in the tenor of the note art   that at that price the issue be kept open so long as any of the redeemable stock annuities existing at the commencement of the issue continue unredeemed and no longer and that this be another such fundamental article see art  0 art   that no such note annuity be paid off till the whole mass of stock annuities existing at the commencement of the issue or created subsequently shall have been paid off  and that this be another such article art   that for every £  ayear annuity thus created an equal portion of stock annuities be forthwith bought in and extinguished within a time to be limited and that this be another such article art   that the profit resulting from the difference between the price at which each such annuity shall have been sold and the price at which an equal mass of annuity shall have been bought in be carried to the sinking fund subject to such other dispositions if any as from time to time may be thought fit to be made by parliament with respect to a predetermined portion or portions of it art  0 that at the outset no other note be issued than the standard note £      s with the half or with the half and quarter of it art    that by degrees the series of notes be extended downwards each successive note being the half of the one immediately preceding it with or without the omission of any term or terms in such descending series until it has descended to the lowest piece of silver coin in common currency viz a sixpence and that it be then considered whether to give it a further extension downwards viz to the level of the copper coinage 0 art    that the notes having for their respective values sums not exceeding the largest silver coin in use viz  s be distinguished by the appellation of silver notes all above being for the same purpose termed gold notes and that to facilitate the discrimination a corresponding peculiarity of colour be given to the gold notes art    that moreover as convenience may suggest the series be extended to a correspondent length or otherwise upwards       in which case the series will if complete consist of nine terms below the standard note and as many above it—total nineteen having two for their common difference values as by the annexed table art    that when the credit of this paper has been established or even from the first notes already taken out by individuals be received as banknotes are at present at the several government offices   in the country as well as in the town and reissued from thence in the way of circulation as they would be between individual and individual charged with the intervening interest to as many as may think proper to receive them at that value art    that the offices from whence the proposed paper is issued to the purchasers be in the first instance the several local postoffices   in town and country with the     eventual addition of any of the other local government offices such as the stamp and excise offices or in case of need other offices to be established for the purpose in such situations and numbers as may be found necessary art    that to save trouble in the issue of the smaller notes especially the silver notes government reserves to itself the power of fixing the least quantity   of annuitynote money which an individual shall be allowed to take out at once as also to prescribe the composition of that quantity taking care to leave to the customer the choice of the composition as far as it may be a matter of indifference to government art    that powers be given to the king in council or to the treasury from time to time to declare whether any and what fee not exceeding a certain amount shall be paid by the purchaser on the emission of each note or parcel of notes constitutive of such or such a sum as also on the exchange of an old note for a fresh note at the instance of the holder—regard being had in both cases to the magnitude of the sum constituting the value of the note or mass of notes as also to call in at any time any such note or notes so it be without expense to the holder for the purpose of their being examined or exchanged and by suspension of interest or other penalties to enforce obedience to such calls as also to declare whether any and what fee shall be paid by the holder on the receipt of the interest due on each note or parcel of notes       art    that periodical accounts be published of the progress of the issue   as regularly and circulated as extensively as the prices of stocks are at present under heads expressive of the day the place the number of notes of each magnitude and the total amount issued on each day at each place together with the increase or decrease of the amount as compared with former periods and any such other particulars as may be of use §   eventual extension art    that if by this and other means three per cent stock annuities should ever have risen to par the produce of the issue of note annuities be thereupon applied to the paying off instead of buying in stock annuities and so toties quoties buying in whenever they are under par paying off whenever they are at or above par art  0 that inasmuch as the paying off stock annuities the greatest part thereof carrying three per cent will lead to a rapid and almost simultaneous conversion   of     the whole amount thereof into note annuities bearing nearly the same rate of interest—and inasmuch as upon the redemption of the last parcel of redeemable stock annuities the     emission of note annuities at this rate of interest must according to article   immediately cease—and inasmuch as the mass of government annuities will in the meantime     have already been much reduced and by the continued operation of the continually increasing powers of the existing sinking funds the scarcity will be growing greater and greater every day notwithstanding that being continually exposed to be paid off at par they will be incapable of bearing any considerable premium the offices be opened thereupon for the emission of a second issue at a reduced rate of interest say £       —i e  ⅜ per cent nearly—viz by raising the price of the standard note from £      s to £  —the produce of such second issue to be applied to the paying off the notes of the first issue and the second issue to close as soon as the redemption of the notes of the first issue shall have been completed art    that the amount of all interest saved as well by the redemption of stock annuities redeemed by the produce of the existing or other future funds and therefore without the preparatory emission of a mass of annuitynote paper to the corresponding value as by the progress made in the reduction of the rate of interest in the way just mentioned viz by the preparatory emission of a mass of annuitynote paper at a lower rate of interest followed by the redemption of a correspondent mass of stock annuities or note annuities at the higher rate be carried immediately to the sinking funds—on the principle of the provision made in the like behalf in and by the existing act viz the new sinking fund act    geo iii c    §   art    that immediately upon the redemption of the last parcel of note annuities of the first issue the offices he again opened for the emission of a third issue at the next lowest rate of interest suitable to the nature of note annuities on which interest is computed daily say £       —i e  ½ per cent nearly  —viz by raising the price of the standard note from £   to £     s—the produce of such third issue to be appropriated to the redemption of the note annuities of the second issue as above with like provision as above in favour of the sinking funds and so toties quoties in so far as any such farther reduction may be deemed eligible art    that inasmuch as so long as any portion of the redeemable annuities remain unextinguished there may remain two parcels of annuitynote paper bearing two different rates of interest—the higher closed the other open—provision be made that in case of the creation of any portion of capital in stock annuities at any time thereafter by reason of money borrowed for the support of a war or otherwise powers be given for extending the issue of note annuities to the extent of the capital so created and at the rate of interest the then last or open issue of note annuities shall receive chapter ii form of an annuity note see table ii chapter iii comparison of the proposed with

bank and bankers paper are incapable of rise but in several instances the one has experienced a partial and the other a total loss of value     chapter iv grounds of expectation in regard to the proposed measure what is expected of the proposed currency is—   that it will be taken out in the way of issue     at the fixed price put upon it     be received in circulation     at the same price     with the addition of the interest     and without undergoing any subsequent depreciation     and will thus continue to circulate among individuals of all classes that it will be taken out in the way of issue and pass in the way of circulation at   per cent nearly the rate of interest put upon it notwithstanding the higher interest yielded by stock annuities irish debentures exchequer bills and india bonds is proved by the example of bankers paper the interest on which runs from   to a nominal   per cent but really not so much by reason of divers conditions which reduce the value of it besides that in these instances the engagement is not perpetual nor the security so good that the interest due will be allowed for in circulation is put out of doubt by the usage in the course of exchequer bills navy bills and india bonds though none of these papers are provided with the tables which do away the trouble of computation altogether however small the sum and however short the time the following may serve as a view of the masses of money cash or bank paper capable of being employed in the purchase of this paper whether in the way of issue or in the course of the circulation—the time when the paper is capable of being taken in hand being the time when the several masses of money respectively come in hand and the time for parting with the paper being the time when the money must or would have been parted with i monies capable of being employed in the purchase of the proposed paper for the purpose of perpetual or permanent income without any view to circulation and that would thereby afford to the noteholder so long as the paper were kept in hand a mass of perpetual annuities on a small scale   money actually kept up in the form of a petty hoard or hoard upon a small scale with or without accumulation to serve as a fund for demands more or less remote and certain but determinate such as marriage apprenticing out or portioning children—provision for widowhood or superannuation—purchase of articles of stock in agriculture or manufactures building or furniture of such a price as to require a persevering course of frugality to raise the amount   money the amount of which would be kept up in the shape of the proposed interestbearing paper if the proposed encouragement were to be held out   money actually kept in reserve for contingent and indeterminate expenses   money that would be kept in reserve for such purposes ii monies that could not or would not have been employed in the purchase of the proposed paper but with a view to circulation the

expectation thus entertained on behalf of the proposed currency will appear the stronger the more closely the advantages conferred by the possession of it are compared with the advantages afforded by the several other sorts of securities or modes of placing out money considered as coming in competition with it—viz stock annuities exchequer bills and the market constituted by the demands of individual borrowers country bankinghouses included as well as those afforded by cash itself and by bank of england notes i compared with the market afforded by stock annuities we shall find it possessed of the following advantages— i in regard to purchase—   no trouble or expense on the score of journeys to london or attendance there   no expense on the score of agency   brokerage   stamp duties   fees for powers of attorney or   postage   no danger of loss by buying to a disadvantage ii during custody—   interest daily—not so much as a days interest need ever be lost   interest receivable without trouble   compound interest capable of being made with certainty and facility   settlements of money in trust may be made by this means without trouble or expense iii in regard to transfer—   no expense or trouble on the score of journeys or attendances   no expense on the score of agency   brokerage   stamp duties   fees for powers of attorney or   postage   no danger of loss by selling to a disadvantage   the capitals of the mass of notes employable in the shape of circulating capital in whatever portions may from time to time be requisite—just like so much cash—without trouble or expense†   0 ii to money circumstanced as in the case last supposed—viz to be laid out either in small parcels or parcels of any magnitude for a short time—the purchase of exchequer bills is in some measure free from the objections to which the purchase of stock annuities is exposed but it is open to others—   the period for which they are issued is limited in general to a time of war besides which their existence is at all times precarious   the quantity of them is continually liable to increase as well as the time of payment to retardation and thence their marketable value to depreciation to an unknown amount   exchequer bills are never issued for sums less than £ 00 by which circumstance every mass of money less than that considerable amount is excluded from this branch of the market iii circumstances of comparative disadvantage attending the private market may be reckoned as follows viz—   trouble and expense and loss of time attending the inquiry necessary in many cases to the meeting with a fit opportunity of placing out money at interest—nb in the case of the proposed market this circumstance of disadvantage is altogether wanting   want of coincidence between the quantum of the sum wanted to be borrowed and that of the sum ready to be lent—wanting altogether   want of coincidence between the time for which money is wanted to be borrowed and the time for which it can conveniently be lent—wanting altogether   difficulty of obtaining sufficient assurance respecting the competency of the security in its several points of view—wanting altogether   trouble expense loss of time and interest attendant on the adjustment of the pecuniary part of the security—wanting altogether   trouble sometimes expense loss of time and interest attendant on the process of demanding and obtaining payment of the interest alone or of principle and interest together as the case may be—trouble and loss of time—reduced to next to nothing expense and loss of interest—wanting altogether   danger of loss and particular incidental inconvenience by unexpected delay in regard to payment—wanting altogether   danger and fear of the necessity of litigation—wanting altogether   unwillingness to deal with a stranger     in consideration of the uncertainty respecting his trustworthiness in respect of moral character and pecuniary sufficiency—wanting altogether  0 unwillingness to deal with the individual if a stranger in respect of the risk of being eventually obliged either to distress him by pressing for payment or to submit to loss for want of such importunity in many cases in the instance of a friend in case of any apprehension of solvency still more if on that of moral trustworthiness unwillingness still greater—wanting altogether    unwillingness to accept of interest from a friend especially if it be on a small sum or for a short time—wanting altogether    unwillingness through shame to accept and much more to demand interest for sums and times separately trifling how considerable soever in their collective amount—wanting altogether    embarrassment disputes and loss of time in the computation of interest on small or fractional sums or for short and fractional periods—wanting altogether    danger of loss by death marriage or other change of condition on the part of the borrower whereby as far as mere personal security is concerned a security originally sufficient may become bad or precarious—wanting altogether that it should continue to circulate without any depreciation is not essential to the existence of a paper currency—witness the case of exchequer bills and other government paper but though the property of circulating without depreciation may not be essential to the circulation of this annuitynote paper it will at any rate be highly conducive to it depreciation proof it must be confessed it cannot be any further than the government of whose promises it is the vehicle is destruction proof by any cause therefore that threatens immediate danger to the government—such as invasion for example or civil war—its value will be liable to be diminished these cases can never be urged as an objection specially applicable to the proposed measure the measure would not impair but rather add to the solvency of the government by the profit it would afford additional means would be afforded for the reduction of the debt of government to the security of government it would add by the multitude of hands it would engage by the tie of interest in the support of government to create and maintain an interest of this sort is a most happy property common to all government securities but all the government securities yet known in this country are confined in their circulation to the superior and least numerous classes it is among the characteristic properties of the proposed new government security to spread itself among the poorer and most numerous classes and thus to engage them to give their support to government against depreciation from any sudden demand for payment the proposed paper is not only as secure as the existing government papers but more so those other papers engage to pay the principal and interest the proposed paper the interest only in the one case the fund drawn upon is the revenue of a single year or some small number of years in the other case the fund drawn upon is the revenue of thirtyfive successive years setting aside the extreme cases here in question there is but one cause of depreciation to which government paper stands exposed and that is the forcing of the market the proposed paper alone is not exposed to this cause of depreciation it will be issued only in proportion to the demand and is rendered for ever incapable of exceeding it the produce also will be employed in strengthening the security and lightening the load of the same commodity at market it may however be urged that though the proposed paper can never be sold under the par price it may in consequence of the demand for its correlative hard cash cease to bear that price that such would be the effect in the event of a civil war or serious invasion will scarcely admit of doubt and that an effect of the same nature though to a less amount should be liable to be produced by other causes can hardly be regarded as improbable to this it may be answered—   that admitting for arguments sake that such a result would occasionally take place to a certain degree still this would not operate as an argument against the institution of the proposed plan unless such a result were to appear more likely to take place or likely to take place in a greater degree with regard to it than with regard to any other circulating government securities   that though such a state of things as the objection supposes be conceivable yet no ground can be stated either in point of reason or experience for regarding it as likely ever to be realized to whatever extent the amount of the proposed paper may have arrived at the time of the supposed extra demand for cash it cannot have attained to it but in consequence of a proportionable preference given to it in comparison with hard cash and the cause of that preference is a circumstance not exposed to change it consists in this viz that principal with interest amounts to more than principal alone £ 0  is more than £ 00 and the ratio is not less at one time than another for the purposes of expenditure within     the limits of the british empire the proposed paper could never lose its superiority and as to so extraordinary a demand for the precious metals for exportation to foreign countries no such case appears ever yet to have been realized—the scarcity of bullion in      in the opinion of the most competent judges being referable not to the extent of the foreign demands but to the constitution of the existing private paper payable on demand to the experienced brittleness of some of the country paper to the occasional scantiness of the paper of the great chartered company coupled with its preceding copiousness and the excess of the advances made by the company to government—causes which after all would not have been adequate to the production of the effect had it not been for those alarms of invasion which were prevalent at the time   that no such extra demand for cash supposing it to exist could produce any depreciation in the price of the proposed paper till after it had put an entire stop to the purchase of it in the way of issue since the progress of the issue being matter of universal notoriety it could never in virtue of art    happen that in any one part of the country the expense of postage being out of the question a man should give £ 00 for such a quantity of this paper as might in any other part of the country be had for £     s but in the nature of things setting aside the influence of the supposed extraordinary and temporary causes the amount of the demand for this paper cannot but be regularly receiving a regular and very rapid increase   but if in a case thus void of probability it were worth while to look out for a remedy a remedy and that of the preservative kind might easily be provided for it i mean that of a cash fund not to exceed suppose a million formed by a reserve made of a part of the profits of the operation as per art   to be employed in case of need in the support of the price of the proposed paper by either buying it in with cash or taking it in pawn for cash from the time that the discount upon it had risen to an amount worth regarding in consideration of this steadiness of price the proposed paper would become everybodys paper all persons possessing any of the masses of money above enumerated—that is all classes of the community—are likely to be included among the holders of the proposed paper either as customers for permanent or temporary annuities upon large or small scales and as it would possess a value in use superior to that of gold and silver inasmuch as it would yield a profit whilst it was retained and inasmuch as it would possess a solidity of value far exceeding the paper of any private banker or even the paper of the bank of england—a solidity only to be destroyed by destroying the power of the government to pay the interest promised to be paid—a solidity increasing with the amount issued—it would be secure of constant circulation from hand to hand being the holder of an annuity note there is not a person living on whom i have any right to call upon to give me value for it—but had it not been for the advantage accruing from the holding of the note i should not have become the holder of it and as the advantage thus accruing to me from the holding of this note is no greater to me than it will be to thousands of other people—in a word to every man without exception to whom it can be in my way to offer it—in the event of his becoming the holder of it in my stead the certainty of my obtaining value for it at any time wants nothing of being entire no one living is bound to give me silver for the guinea i have in my pocket yet who is there that ever hesitated to receive a guinea under the apprehension of not being able to get change for it not only the selfregarding advantage of making profit by goods sold for part of the value engages my neighbour the shopkeeper to change it for me on my laying out to the value of a few halfpence with him but the social consideration of amity and neighbourhood is sufficient to procure for me the same accommodation at his hands without any such personal advantage in the case of the annuity note the social consideration not only operates with equal force but has the personal consideration of the advantage to be gained by the holding of the note to back and strengthen it the material question is—will it be received this being answered and answered satisfactorily the other question—why will it be received how comes it that it will be received—is matter only of curiosity and speculation it may further be observed that no man will ever have obtained any such note in the way of issue i mean at the office who would not have preferred obtaining it in the course of circulation and in that way would have obtained it if he could have got it because the trouble and expense of taking it out in the way of issue reduced as it is to the lowest term will always be something and in the way of circulation he obtains it without either that trouble or expense the necessary consequence is that in the ordinary state of the market there must exist at all times a disposition to receive a greater quantity of this article than is ever found in it the practice of taking out annuity notes can never have become general without the practice of receiving them in the course of circulation having become universal and the disposition so to receive them have grown     into a confirmed habit—a habit as determinate as that which engages a man without reflection without thought or deliberation to receive bank paper as he would gold the value of these notes would be depreciated or destroyed if the taxable powers of the nation were to such a degree exhausted as not to suffice for the payment of the whole of the annuities with which it stands chargeable and consequently not for the whole of this proposed branch of annuities if the whole island became a province of france or were swallowed up by the sea—if the globe of which it forms a part were carried off by a comet were frozen drowned or burnt—but we have no need on the present occasion to take any account of any of these calamities and that not so much on account of their improbability for there is not one of them that can be pronounced impossible as because bank paper being the assumed standard of comparison any one of them would be equally fatal to the credit of such paper chapter v financial advantages the advantages of a financial kind that may be expected from the proposed measure will require to be distinguished according to the periods or stages above marked out in regard to the progress of it §   period first from the opening of the first issue of annuity notes to the arrival of the   per cent stock annuities at par the branches of profit or advantage that may be looked for in the course or at the conclusion of this first period may be stated as follows—   profit on sale by the difference between the price for which a   per cent annuity as secured by an annuity note is sold and the price at which an annuity to the same amount as secured by an entry in the books of the stock annuities is bought in with cash raised by the above sale in a word profit by difference between the selling price of note annuities and the buying price of stock—nb this branch of profit ceases altogether on the termination of period i   profit by interest forborne to be received on annuity notes   profit by notes in hand—profit by interest on annuity notes received by government in the course of circulation while kept in the hands of government   profit by notes lost under circumstances which either do not admit of or do not call for compensation   profit by reduction of the rate of interest paid by government for such money as it is in the habit of borrowing by annual anticipation by the issue of exchequer bills profits peculiar to periods ii and iii   profit by saving upon the expense of management   profit by fractional interest i e by the  d per £ 00 the difference between the £  per cent yielded by stock annuities and the £         yielded by £ 00 worth of note annuities   profit by the redemption of all stock annuities yielding more than   per cent and thereupon by extinction of the masses of extra interest profit peculiar to period iii   profit by reduction of the rate and quantum of interest upon the mass of the national debt  0 profit peculiar to a state of war i e to those years in which money is to be raised by the creation of fresh masses of government annuities—profit on loans profit or saving by lessening the loss by those transactions by raising the price of government annuities as compared with money and thereby lessening the loss by the difference between money on the creation and sale of government annuities and money paid on redemption of the same    profit by yearly interest instead of halfyearly—a profit mentioned as being obvious and capable of being realized but not it is supposed to advantage if to prove the proposed measure to be an advantageous one and advantageous to a sufficient degree to give it a claim to be carried into practice it were necessary to prove the quantum of the advantage or even to give a calculation that had pretension to exactness its chance for adoption would be weak indeed happily for the plan no such proof can reasonably be required—whether the profit be £ 0000000 or no more than £ 0000 still although that advantage stood alone yet supposing it to stand clear and not to be attended with any degree of disadvantage capable     of counterbalancing it the conduct indicated would be just the same it would be worth adopting though the advantage were worth no more than £ 0000 and it could but be adopted though the advantage were equal to  00 millions profit i profit by the difference between the selling price of a £  ayear annuity note and the buying price of a do stock annuity this profit will depend upon the average price of   per cent stock taken out of the market upon the buyingin plan before the commencement of the period during which these annuities being at or above par the payingoff plan will have taken place of the buyingin plan and the quantum of annuitynote paper issued and thence the quantity of stock bought in with the produce of such annuitynote paper profit ii the expectation of profit by interest forborne to be received is grounded on the following proposition viz—that in general a man will not bestow either trouble or expense much less both how inconsiderable soever the quantity in compassing an end which he has it in his power to compass to equal perfection without any such trouble or expense the trouble not to speak of the expense attendant on the receipt of the interest on these annuities has been reduced to the smallest amount possible because the greater it is the greater the danger lest by the contemplation of it individuals should at the outset be repelled from the purchase of these annuities but be the reduction ever so great still the remainder will be something and this remainder it may reasonably be expected would in the ordinary state of things be sufficient to turn the scale on the other hand suppose the circulation of the paper to be once established upon the terms on which government paper is in the habit of being received—i speak of exchequer bills navy victualling transport and ordnance debentures not to mention india bonds—viz the allowing for it in addition to the amount of the principal the amount of the interest that has become due upon it a man by simply paying away an annuity note upon that footing will receive from the individual who takes it of him the amount of such interest without the trouble of applying for it elsewhere the smaller the amount of interest or other money to be received the greater the ratio which the trouble of receiving whatever it be will bear to it accordingly if there be any difference it is in the instance of the smaller notes and the more certainly the smaller the note may the dependence on this forbearance be assured but the disposition to forbearance will be the more steady the more perfect and unbroken the facility of receiving the money in the event of its being thought fit to receive it appears to be it is on the strength of the persuasion entertained by a man that the amount of a bankers note which he has taken in payment would if demanded be paid at any time that his forbearance to demand it is grounded it is on this account that whether or no the payment of the interest upon a fresh note be deferred till after the end of the year or be divided into two payments the first of them to take place at the end of the first halfyear—at the end of the year it seems most advantageous upon the whole that the even amount of the years interest should be made demandable at any time   in regard to the proportion of interest that would be likely to be forborne thus much may be to be observed—in regard to whatever portion continued to be employed as currency the forbearance would probably be general and continual   in regard to whatever part was hoarded for the purpose of furnishing compound interest it could not take place to obtain an interest upon a years interest due on any note it would be necessary for a man to receive that interest and with the money take out a fresh note or assemblage of notes a second years interest is a years interest and no more in addition to its own amount it does not give him the interest he might have made on the amount of the same years interest by receiving it in the shape of money and employing that money in the purchase of a fresh note carrying its interest or what would come to the same thing by receiving it at once from the office if upon his application the office were to furnish him with it in that shape   in the case of a mass of annuitynote paper kept in hand for the purpose of income but without any determinate plan of accumulation in the way of compound interest it seems difficult to say whether receipt or forbearance would be most apt to take place the purpose of receipt might be equally answered by forbearance viz by paying away at each period a mass of paper of an amount equal to what the whole mass had gained in value on the score of interest by that time but this would require provision to be made accordingly in the composition of the sums constituted by the notes and which of the two masses of trouble would be the greater—that of making the provision in question or that of receiving the interest at an office—would depend upon circumstances in the meantime this consideration operates as a reason for rendering the composition of the series of notes as favourable as possible to the purpose of affording interest in the way of simple circulation as above described     without the necessity of coming upon government for the payment of it that is to render the gradation of the series more regular and the terms or degrees in it more numerous than might otherwise be necessary or desireable the more complete the series of notes the greater the chance it has of meeting the demand of each individual with reference to this purpose as to the quantum of this branch of profit the principal part—that which may be regarded as certain—will depend upon the quantity of the paper thus employed and upon the time during which each parcel of that quantity remains in circulation it will depend consequently on the duration of this first period should this period prove a short one the probable length of it according to a supposition that will be stated a little further on not exceeding two or three years the branch of profit will be proportionably inconsiderable but whenever it vanishes it vanishes as will be seen only to make way for a branch of much superior importance so long as stock annuities are to be purchased under par none of those persons whose circumstances it suits to become customers for stock annuities will in respect of that portion of their money become customers for note annuities which will not be to be had but at par price but no sooner are stock annuities arrived at par price than these note annuities will be at least as well suited to the circumstances of the customers for stock annuities and inasmuch as the mass of stock annuities will be lessened every day by the operation of the sinking fund while the mass of note annuities cannot be increased without diminishing by at least an equal amount the mass of stock annuities the owners of the continually increasing mass of money seeking to be employed in the purchase of government annuities to serve as a source of permanent income will have no other resource than to lie in wait for annuity notes as they pass from hand to hand and so impound them and take them out of the circulation profit iii the third head of advantage consists in the saving or profit that may be made to accrue on the score of interest upon annuity notes which after being received by government from individuals on the score of taxes or otherwise in the way of circulation remain at the command of government till wanted to be reissued this head of profit will again require to be distinguished into three branches—   profit by annuitynote paper lying in the exchequer   profit by do lying in the hands of receivers of all classes in its way to the exchequer   do by do lying in the way of imprest in the several offices of expenditure waiting till reissued   as to the first of these three branches of profit what the probable annual amount of it may be is completely out of the knowledge of the writer of these papers but as completely within the knowledge of those to whom they are addressed i mean in so far as the past is capable of serving as a guide to the future add together the     sums respectively existing in the exchequer on the     days of the year and divide the sum by     the quotient will be the principal the interest of which will thus in the course of the year be gained or saved to government supposing the whole of the money to be in the shape of annuity notes from this gross amount of principal will require to be deducted the amount of that proportion of money which is upon an average in the shape of cash   as to the second of the above three branches of profit it will rest with government whether to take it into its own hands or to leave it in the hands of the receiver   in regard to the last of the above three branches little need be said the money being already in the shape of annuitynote paper yielding an interest to government—so long as it is in the hands of government all difficulty in regard to the conversion of it into that shape is out of the question here under the existing plan much anxiety has every now and then been entertained to prevent this or that subordinate officer of expenditure from getting inordinate sums by way of imprest into his hands under the proposed plan the money being in the shape of paper that paper yielding its interest to government—so long as it is in the hands of any office or officer keeping it on the account of government though the quantity issued from the exchequer to this or that office upon this or that occasion should happen to be more than sufficient—in other words to be excessive—it would be no matter since not only the temptation to produce the excess but even the mischief of the excess if produced would in the proposed state of things be done away profit iv profit by notes lost under circumstances which either do not admit of or do not call for compensation as this source of profit will go on increasing as the quantity of annuitynote paper increases and will consequently be inconsiderable in this first period even at the close of it in comparison with what it will be at the close of the second period at which time the conversion of the whole mass of stock annuities into annuities secured by annuity notes will have been completed—it is to the second period     that what there may be to say in regard to this source of profit may with most propriety be referred profit v profit by reduction of the rate of interest paid on other government paper with the fall in the rate of interest yielded by stock annuities the fall in the rate of interest paid by government on exchequer bills will at least keep pace as to the absolute quantum of profit on this head that will of course depend on the amount of exchequerbill paper issued within the time a quantity in regard to which any calculations or conjectures that could be given would be of little use profit vi profit if taken by difference between yearly and halfyearly interest this branch of profit would not attain its maximum until the close of the second period but i have already stated that my leaning is not to assume this head of profit and for what reasons it may however be observed that it would yield a rateable profit of £    per million whilst the interest upon the national debt remained at three per cent §   period second from the arrival of stock annuities at par to the redemption of the last portion of stock annuities whereupon follows immediately the opening of the second issue of annuity notes at the reduced rate of  ⅜ per cent   profit in the shape of principalmoney by sale of notes ceases but in the event of the creation of a fresh parcel of stock annuities revives and continues till the redemption of such stock annuities   profit by interest undemanded will continue and with increase the profit above mentioned as produced by the notes in circulating hands will increase as the quantity of paper taken out with a view to circulation increases to this will now be added the profit produced by the notes in hoarding hands viz the expelled stockholders who take this paper with a view to permanent income as they held their stock this branch may be termed the casual branch it will arise out of such casual forbearances only as take place at present in the case of dividends on stock the probable rate of it might be estimated from the course of the payments on this score made at present at the bank the quantity of government annuities stock and note annuities taken together will it is true be growing less and less every day while the quantity of money capable of being employed in the purchase of them will be growing greater and greater so that the scarcity will be growing at both ends but inasmuch as the issue being open all the while everybody will be at liberty to supply himself with whatever quantity of this paper he chooses whether for the purpose of hoarding or with a view to circulation the diminution will fall exclusively upon the stock annuities the quantity in circulation will not be absorbed in any degree by the demand for the purpose of hoarding and the only effect of the increasing scarcity even when the issue is at the point of closing will be to make the demand and consequent emission the more rapid to the last   profit by notes in hand this inconsiderable source of profit seems likely to continue from the first period without any variation worth inquiring into it admits of no increase from the increased amount of annuitynote paper produced by the conversion that part only which is circulation being capable of finding its way into government hands   profit by notes lost during the whole of this second period this source of profit will be on the increase a quantity of annuitynote paper equal to the whole amount of stock annuities being in the course of it added to the mass   profit by reduction of interest on exchequer bills this source of profit will probably have begun to manifest itself in the course of the former period but it is not till now that the amount could easily be submitted to calculation during the whole of this second period the rate of interest will be that reduced rate towards which it will have been moving on during the first period this head of profit will be an enduring one no plenitude on the part of the exchequer will warrant the disuse of exchequer bills it would be bad economy to make and keep on foot a perpetual loan to a certain amount in order to save occasional loans to the same amount at the same or nearly the same rate of interest and to keep in hand a sum in cash to the same amount would come to the same thing the maximum of advantage under this head is therefore what results from keeping the rate of interest on such loans from rising more than one step above the level of the rate paid on perpetual loans upon the adoption of the proposed measure it would be requisite to examine whether the plan of the present exchequer bills would be the most advantageous plan for borrowing money on such temporary loans   profit by saving in the expense of management—transfer and allowance of interest as between individual and individual being performed without expense—and the expense attached to the issue and to the payment of interest on government account being defrayed in part or in the whole by fees see ch i plan art    this profit being a rateable profit on the amount of debt will of course     diminish in amount as the amount of the debt diminishes   profit by reduction of interest from £  to £    s this profit results from the conversion of stock annuities into note annuities at the par price of both which will be the price throughout this second period it amounts to exactly   0th part of the interest at   per cent it comes in a manner without design the difference being the unavoidable result of the defalcation of a few fractions which it was necessary to get rid of in order to leave even and commensurable sums the amount of annual profit on this score on each million of capital in stock annuities converted—i e on each £ 0000 of interest on the said capital—is £ 00†   profit by reduction of interest on stock annuities at higher rates than   per cent the amount of this profit might easily be made the subject of calculation §   period third from the opening of the second issue at  ⅜ths nearly viz £        per cent to the redemption of the paper of that second issue—whereupon follows immediately the opening of the third issue at £        being a trifle less than  ½ per cent i profit by reduction from £     s per cent to £        per cent rate of interest on the closed issue during this period £     0 rate of the open issue       difference constituting the rate of profit by the operation £ 0      this result constitutes the characteristic profit of this third period the proportionable amount of it is nearly the fifth part of the interest on the mass of annuities remaining at the commencement of this third period viz £            per annum for each million of capital of annuity notes ii profit on sale i e by difference between selling price of annuitynote paper and buying price of stock annuities remains as in period ii extinct by the extinction of stock annuities—subject to revival in the event of a fresh creation as before iii  iv profits by interest undemanded and by notes in hand continue as in period ii with little change‡ v  vi profits by notes lost and by saving in respect of the expense of management being rateable profits their amount per millions worth of paper continues unchanged but their total amount diminishes of course in some degree as the amount of annuity notes which from the commencement of this third period are the only redeemable government annuities remaining is diminished by the operation of the sinking fund for some time at least the paper of this second issue carrying but £        ayear interest the demand for it with a view to circulation will be more certain than the demand for the purpose of permanent income on the footing of stock annuities because to the former set of customers the whole amount of interest reduced as it is will be as so much gain being a profit which but for this species of paper they would not have made—perhaps at all—certainly not in this commodious way and by government annuities—whereas the reduction will sit heavy on the customers for permanent income who if they continue their money upon government security must submit to see their incomes reduced to this amount and whose capitals to a considerable amount will accordingly for the purpose of escaping such reduction be withdrawn from this employment and either laid out upon other securities or embarked along with the owners in some branch of trade the progress of the operation may notwithstanding not be diminished upon the whole for to the amount of the demand with a view to circulation no assignable limits can be found profit vii profit in respect of exchequer bills during this third period in compariison with the second the rate of profit will receive an increase for the money wanted for occasional purposes during the second period it will as has been seen have been necessary to give a rate of interest one step higher than that which by the continual emission of annuity     notes at that rate to all customers it was in the power of everybody to make but the first issue being now closed it is no longer in the power of everybody or anybody to obtain government annuities at that rate since though paper of the first issue will still be to be had of individuals it will not be to be had but at an advanced price the profit by the saving of this advanced price will be sufficient to engage customers to take exchequer bills at the par price of the closed issue to an amount adequate to any money that can be wanted on the footing of a temporary loan §   period fourth from the opening of the third issue at  ½ per cent nearly viz £    per cent to the redemption of the last portion of paper of that issue—whereupon follows immediately the opening of the fourth issue at £       ½ per cent being a trifle more than  ⅙ per cent rate of the closed issue during this period £      rate of the open issue       difference constituting the profit of the operation £0       the annual amount of this head of profit for this fourth period is for each million of capital remaining in the hands of individuals i e for each £ 0000 of interest at the original rate of   per cent £          —the total amount of profit by reductions of interest up to this period inclusive on each million of capital £      profits by notes lost and by expense of management saved will continue as before with little change in regard to the rate but in respect of the total amount reduced in course as the quantity of the annuities in question is reduced so in regard to profit by interest undemanded and profit by notes in hand profit in respect of exchequer bills will at this period if not before be so far fixed as that the rate of interest upon these temporary loans will never be higher but more likely lower than that of the closed issue for although the reduced rate of the open issue should not be accepted of by the expelled annuitants of the closed issue nor even by any more of the customers for note paper with a view to circulation yet for the reasons given with reference to period iii the premium given for the paper of the closed issue will notwithstanding be considerable the more so as the drop from the rate given by the closed issue the second issue to the rate given by the third issue being the issue that remains open till the very close of this fourth period is so great between the two amounts in question a profit sufficient to draw purchasers for exchequer bills cannot but find room to place itself and the interest on exchequer bills during this period may be expected to be considerably less than £        §   concluding period the precise number of reductions which the rate of interest upon this paper might be destined to experience is what it would be too much to attempt to fix but a picture of the last moments of the expiring debt at whatever stage the reduction of interest may then be may be not without its use it will present the profit by interest undemanded in an enlarged and interesting point of view it will strike off in effect the last  0 or  0 or  0 millions of the debt and strike off perhaps the value of a year or two or more from the duration of that load after the exoneration thus effected in the course of the fourth period by the reduction of the rate of interest to the £        which is the rate given by the paper of the third issue—is it or is it not likely that the reduction of interest should have descended lower before the redemption of the last portion of the principal of the debt the reduction of the rate of interest on the money that had been thus lent to government will stop short of this mark or stop at it or go beyond it according to the influence which the rate thus allowed by government turns out to exercise over the rate of interest in general that the influence which the government rate of interest has in its rising state maintained over the general rate of interest has been considerable is matter of known experience—though the operation of the restrictive laws which stop the rise at the point of five per cent even on the slenderest security has rendered the amount of this influence scarcely capable of being measured the influence of the rate of interest paid on the debt cannot but increase with the magnitude of the debt to which the magnitude of the mass of capital poured into the market as will be seen by the redemption of that debt will be proportioned the effect of  00 millions thus poured in cannot but be double it should seem to that of  00 millions at least if poured in within the same compass of time the influence of the capital poured in by the redemption of the national debt at the time the reduction of the interest on that debt is going on will it is true not depend solely on the quantum of capital thus poured in but also on the magnitude of the growing mass of national capital into which it flows but the general mass of national capital is also of itself in a rapid state of increase and to such a degree on the increase as to be of itself in a way to effect a reduction in the     rate of interest in general without any aid from this or any other factitious source accordingly the factitious cause of reduction—the factitiously accumulated capital which is thus poured in by government so far from finding any obstruction in the magnitude and vis inertiæ of the mass into which it flows finds a powerful assistance in the operation of that mass acting as it is already in a direction tending to the same end if then while the two forces the natural and the factitious are thus acting in this direction the influence of the factitious should be strong enough to bring the other to the same pace things will continue on in the same state as already depicted in the account of the fourth period paper of a closed issue in a quantity which cannot be increased—paper of an open issue in a quantity which will be continually and rapidly on the increase till by the produce of it the paper of the closed issue has been paid off when a fresh issue will be opened at a still lower rate and the now open issue closed and so on always paper of two issues at two rates of interest till the last applied portion of redemption money comes and sweeps them both out of the market at once if then the reduction of the rate of interest go on to the last year of the debt without stopping the state of the paper during that last year in respect of its being divided into paper of two issues viz a closed issue and an open one will be the same at that supposed last period of the existence of this paper and of the redeemable part of the national debt as is exhibited in speaking of the advantages belonging to the fourth period of its existence the paper swept off by the last mass of redemptionmoney will be paper of two different issues on the other hand if the emission and consequent reduction have stopped anywhere there will at that last stage be but one rate of interest paid by government on the redeemable part of the debt the annuitynote paper remaining at the time will be all of it of the same issue—viz the then closed issue—there being at that time another issue opened but no paper of that proffered issue in existence—nobody having purchased any at that price for illustrations sake let the last issue which meets with customers be the abovementioned third issue—the issue at £        with the opening of which the fourth period commences let thirty millions at this time be the amount of the whole remainder of the debt of which let ten millions be the amount of the paper of the second issue now closed bearing interest at £        per cent and let the other twenty millions be paper of the third or open issue bearing interest at £        per cent and let the ten millions at £        per cent be all of it in the hands of persons who keep it in hand as a source of permanent income while the  0 millions at £        is all of it in a state of circulation more or less rapid being all of it in hands that took it out or received it with that view the sinking funds taken altogether—the sinking funds present and future—being now in a condition to pay off suppose ten millions in the course of a year let such payment be made accordingly this extinction falling of course upon those ten millions strikes off the whole of the hoarded paper and leaves only that part which being in circulation constitutes so much of the circulating capital of the country upon the redemption of the last parcel of these ten millions the opening of the fourth issue follows of course by article    if any purchasers presented themselves at the rate of this fourth issue £       ½ per cent the reduction of the rate of interest would go on but by the supposition no such purchaser does present himself the persons who had been keeping their capitals in the shape of annuitynote paper of the second issue at £        are by the redemption of the remaining paper of that issue put to their option—either to cease letting their capital lie on that sort of security or to accept of £       ½ per cent by the supposition they all reject the paper bearing this new and lowest rate they will not meddle with it not even for a time and with a view of putting it into circulation by employing it in the ways in which they determine to employ the capital thus thrown upon their hands when the two masses of paper that had till now been in the market are thus reduced to one that one will all of it be in the hands of noteholders who take it with a view to circulation for whatever rate of interest is accepted on the footing of permanent income there will be always persons in abundance to whom it will be worth while to accept of the next lowest rate with a view to circulation if by the growth of national opulence a rate so low as £        appears now is raised to such a pitch of relative value as to be worth acceptance in the character of a source of permanent income the next lowest rate though so low as £        will be raised along with it in the scale of importance and will become not less worth acceptance in the character of a source of such temporary profit as could not with equal security and convenience be made by any other means and if the £        itself come to be thought worth acceptance in the character of a permanent provision and sole dependence the next lowest rate though now reduced to £       ½ will no more be regarded with contempt in the character of a   0 source of temporary profit than the £        was before if then the demand for annuitynote paper should stop altogether at any period prior to that of the complete extinction of the debt it is with the customers for permanent income that it will stop and not with the customers for temporary income with a view to circulation compared with cash the interest afforded by the annuitynote paper to those who take it or keep it with a view to circulation will be it ever so small be so much profit compared with the preceding higher rate of interest the reduced rate afforded by the annuitynote paper will to those who take it and who to the extent of their respective capitals so invested have nothing else to depend upon for their respective incomes present itself as a loss to the amount of the difference under these circumstances though for illustrations sake the supposition has been that the fresh issue would at some period remain open without customers it seems not very easy to abide by it at the time the sinking fund came with its ten millions and swept off all the paper of the second issue—all the paper that was in the hands of customers for permanent income—the demand on the part of the customers for temporary income with a view to circulation had got no farther than the remaining  0 millions but under the accumulation of wealth inseparable from the state of things thus supposed it is scarcely possible that the demand from that class of customers should for any length of time be altogether at a stand if in a twelvemonth but a single £ 00 worth more than could be met with without giving such a premium as would make it dearer than the paper of the open issue were wanted by any person for a few weeks or months he would betake himself to the open issue even in the case of the last group of now expelled noteholders by whom this paper had been held as a source of permanent income the supposition of their rejecting the paper of the fresh issue altogether appears scarcely tenable they would still to a certain degree be customers for annuitynote paper though with different views before their expulsion for the purpose of permanent income—after their expulsion for the purpose of temporary income till a better income or better prospects could be obtained from some other source true it is that by the paper taken out of their hands they made £        ayear while by the paper of the fresh issue they would make not half the money—£       ½ but £       ½ which they might begin making from the very instant of their expulsion would be £       ½ better than nothing—which is what the interest of a considerable part of their  0 millions of capital would be reduced to for a time more or less considerable if it rejected this accommodation and though no more than a single £ 00 of the expelled  0 millions were to betake itself to this employment though it were but for a day from thence would be to be dated the birth of the paper of the fourth issue if however at the period in question there remain no paper but of one issue it is all of it as we have seen in the hands of the customers for temporary income with a view to circulation who would generally speaking betake themselves to the circulation for the interest of it—upon which the demand for interest at the office would nearly cease but the same cessation might take place although there were to be paper of two issues—and would take place if the paper of both issues were to be in the hands of the customers for temporary income with a view to circulation nor is this any more than what might well enough take place since the paper of the closed issue would bear a premium corresponding to the superior rate of interest it afforded and it would be seen by government to be the case if the interest upon the paper of the closed issue were seen to remain undemanded in this state of things many millions of government paper still in circulation and little or no interest demanded on it there seems nothing to be gained and something to be lost by carrying the redemption any further as to so much interest as continues to be undemanded the debt ceases to be a burthen—the taxes from which the redemption money would have to come would be a burthen and the paper taken out of the circulation by the redemption would be so much taken from the mass of circulating capital—as much so as if gold to that amount after having been received by government on the score of taxes were to be thrown into the sea a defalcation made to any such amount as the supposed  0 millions in the course of two years might by its suddenness be productive of inconveniences such as it would not be easy to estimate†—similar in a word to those which have been attributed to the diminution in the quantity of bank of england paper in circulation were the redemption thus to cease it might be of use to declare at the time that such cessation were declared that from thenceforward     as often as a note were sent in for payment of interest interest and principal should be paid together as is the practice at present in the case of exchequer bills and at the same time to declare a respite of the redemption for a certain time the advantages would be—   the continuance of the source of profit in question profit by interest undemanded would be more steady and assured for in proportion to the length of the respite declared the paper thus respited would come to bear in circulation a premium the amount of which premium though limited by the rate of interest yielded by the open issue resorted to or not resorted to would not be prevented by it from taking place this premium a man would lose by sending in his paper to be paid off at par in general then paper would not be sent in for that purpose nor consequently any interest be paid by government   no payment could thenceforward be made upon the proposed paper but that a payment to a far greater amount would go in redemption of principal whereas without such regulation no part of the money paid could take that profitable course the undemanded interest it might be thought might in this way come to accumulate to such a mass as might be productive of inconvenience if by a sudden turn of affairs it were to become a matter of advantage to the whole body of annuitants to claim payment of it at once but on a second glance the inconvenience would be seen to vanish altogether supposing as before the amount of the paper twenty millions—rate of interest £       —the whole amount of a years interest would thus be short of £ 00000 being simple interest not compound the whole amount of it in twenty years would be short of six millions supposing the whole of it to remain undemanded and the principal undiminished all that time no issue can carry more than its own interest because as the open issue fills the paper of the closed issue is paid off interest and principal together respite is indeed proposed but the term of respite need not be so long as to preclude government from providing such a course of redemption as should ward off any inconvenience that might ensue from a too sudden diminution of this part of the currency and at the same time prevent the interest from swelling to any such amount as to become formidable at the worst at such a period interest so low money so abundant £ 000000 would be but a trifle to raise by an immediate and temporary loan as now by exchequer bills §   war loans by so many per cent as the market price of old annuities is raised by any cause by so many per cent it is well known is the price of new annuities raised to those who give money for them to government i e the terms of the loan bettered by that same cause—since as between old and new the value is just the same it would be in vain for any man or set of men to insist upon any considerably greater price in annuities for their money allowance made for depreciation by increase of quantity and for dealers profit than people in general are disposed to take for theirs whatever takes stock out of the market without taking out or keeping back the equivalent in money adds in proportion to the price of stocks the proposed measure takes stock out of the market without taking out or keeping back money it therefore adds in proportion to the price of stocks true it is that even previously to the absorption of stock annuities which it takes out of the market it has created other annuities to a considerable part of the amount for it is only with the money received for those new annuities that the old are taken out but of the money thus received for the new annuities there is not any part that would have gone to market for old annuities because while stocks are under par no money that can be employed with advantage in the purchase of stocks can be employed otherwise than to a manifest disadvantage in the purchase of the inferior rate of interest afforded by the proposed note annuities any melioration thus produced in the price of stocks and thence in the terms of the loan for any given year will operate it should be remembered not only on the loan of that year but on all succeeding loans during the existence of the existing debt since whatever additions the debt may come to experience in the course of any number of succeeding years it will always be the less by the amount of all the defalcations that have been ever made from it† were it not for the operation of the sinking fund the profit on this account would be so much clearer but inasmuch as to the extent of the stock purchased in the year by that fund government loses exactly as much as it gains on the stock sold in that same year in and by the loan the amount of the loss by     the purchase will be always to be deducted from that of the profit by the sale to calculate the probable amount of profit on this score for one two or more years would require two sets of data—viz   amount of the several other causes of elevation together with those of depression in each year—  the amount of annuitynote paper sold in each year the former would scarcely yield to calculation the latter bids defiance to it altogether chapter vi advantage by addition to national capital among the advantages promised by the proposed measure may be reckoned the addition it promises to make to the mass of national productive capital and thence to the mass of national wealth viz by the acceleration it will give to the operation of the existing funds in respect of the redemption of the national debt that an addition to the mass of national capital—an addition to the value of £ 00—is the result of every £ 00 paid in discharge of the national debt is a proposition which though hitherto it seems to have engaged but little if any attention will be assented to almost as soon as mentioned that the putting of money into mens hands on this occasion in lieu of the income they are obliged to part with has no tendency to increase the ratio of the amount of money expended in the way of prodigality to that of the money expended and employed in the way of thrift is evident enough but if employing the money put into his hands in lieu of a source of income of which he is deprived a man employ it otherwise than in the view of making it productive of a mass of income to equal amount he employs it in the way of prodigality and if he employ it with the view of making it productive of income it must be either by expending it himself in the production or improvement of such articles as constitute a mass of capital to the amount of such expenditure or by lending it directly or ultimately to somebody else by whom it will be applied to that same purpose if the money thus put into the hands of the expelled annuitant in lieu of his annuity were taken from the mass employed in the shape of capital there would be neither loss nor gain by the operation on the score of addition to the mass of national wealth but the money thus employed by the existing sinking fund is not taken from any such mass it is the produce of taxes—of taxes levied on income either directly or through the medium of expenditure and is taken out of that fund the whole of which after a small deduction on account of savings would otherwise have been expended within the year in the way of current expenditure that is in the purchase partly of unproductive labour such as that of servants coaches horses players musicians and the like—partly in the purchase of articles consumed mostly within the year or some other such short periods of time without having produced any equivalent increase of the money thus put in the shape of capital into the hands of the public creditors on the redemption of their respective portions of the public debt that part which is received by british subjects will in general be employed in adding to the mass of capital contained within the limits of the british empire on the other hand that part which is received by foreigners will as naturally be employed in adding to the mass of capital contained within the dominion of the states to which they respectively belong—in adding to the quantity of foreign not of british capital deducting then from the whole amount of the money payable on the redemption of the redeemable but unredeemed portion of the funded debt that part of it which is in the hands of foreigners the remainder will be the sum that in the year in which the last portion of the debt comes to be redeemed will have been added to the mass of national capital from this source independently of any effect produced by the proposed measure whatever amount of profit the proposed measure may be attended with this profit being also applied in aid of the other sinking funds to the redemption of the debt will act in acceleration of that effect it will therefore in proportion to the acceleration be productive of a distinguishable addition to the mass of national capital in proportion to the acceleration thus produced by it in a rough way the amount of this addition may be     stated as equal to the interest at compound interest at the rate at which the national capital is accumulating upon the amount of the debt redeemed for the term of years struck off by the acceleration from the amount of restitution thus made to capital in any accurate computation would come to be subtracted that proportion of the national income which had it not been taken by taxes and thence in the shape of redemption money added to capital as it were by force would have been saved up and without changing hands have gone to capital of its own accord and from the amount of profit by acceleration of the redemption of the debt a similar proportion of the amount of such profit to the account of the addition thus promised to the mass of national capital in respect of freed capital and such other parts of the mass as are of an intrinsically productive nature it may naturally enough be expected that i should add the augmentation promised in the shape of circulating capital—viz to that branch of it which consists of money that in certain circumstances an augmentation of this sort would be among the natural consequences and even unless prevented by special care among the necessary consequences of the measure is a proposition the truth of which will i think appear with sufficient evidence but far from taking credit for any such result in the account of advantages probity requires that i should give warning of it as a source of danger to point out the means of obviating this danger will be the business of an ensuing chapter chapter vii advantage by addition to commercial security another advantage expected from the proposed paper is—the addition it promises to make to commercial security—the support it holds out to commercial solvency it presents itself not only as being itself exempt from those shocks to which the ordinary species of paper money are essentially exposed but as affording to the community a remedy and that of the preventive kind against the disorders to which it stands at present exposed by the constitutional weaknesses of those papers for a property thus valuable it is indebted to two features belonging to it one is—the making no addition by its quantity to the quantity of cash engaged for it is by this that it is itself preserved from that brittleness which is of the essence of those other papers the other is—the faculty of being employed in either of two capacities at pleasure—  as a permanent source of income—like so much stock—so long as it is kept in the same hand   as a circulating medium—a species of money as often as it is passed on from one hand to another it is by this latter feature that it is enabled to fill up whatever gaps may come to be made in the quantity of money in circulation by a deficiency in the quantity of those other papers that in point of security commercial wealth is liable to suffer from an excess in the comparative quantity of paper money is a truth but too often felt and sufficiently understood that in point of quantity it is liable to suffer a kind of negative loss from a deficiency in the quantity of paper money is a truth rather understood than felt but equally out of doubt because inasmuch as every fresh £ 00 worth of paper money is so much added to the mass of circulating capital to the amount of the value at which it passes the national capital is of course so much the less for every accession of this kind which it might have received consistently with commercial security and fails to receive that by a deficiency in the quantity of paper money commercial wealth is liable to suffer—not in point of quantity only but even in point of security is a sort of discovery in political economy seemingly of very recent date† till the pressure upon the     bank of england in      it seems to have been generally understood that in the article of paper money deficiency was the safe side—but on that occasion it became apparent that in regard to paper money of the kind in view there is no safe side while there is stock to sell and in such abundance how it may be asked can commercial wealth be liable to suffer in point of security by a defalcation which can never be a very large one from the quantity of paper money when by selling stock a man who has either stock enough or credit to borrow stock may at any time raise as much money as he pleases he will be a loser it is true by the interest of the stock sold out from the time when sold to the time when replaced and so far wealth suffers in point of quantity but there ends the damage security remains entire yes doubtless—so a man may—but on what terms on the terms of taking the precise amount from some one else the deficiency is shifted only not lessened stock may be sold for money and in that figurative sense it may be converted into money—but in the literal sense it cannot be converted into money and it is in the literal sense that an article must be capable of being converted into money to answer the purpose in question here stock convertible into money yes in the same figurative sense in which lands and houses and goods are convertible into money—and no other annuitynote paper is convertible into money papermoney in the literal sense stock is one thing—paper money the sort at present in use is another—annuitynote paper and that alone is both in one it has two natures and is at all times either the one thing or the other whichever is most wanted the defalcation made from commercial security by the defalcation of a given mass of money cash or paper makes to this purpose no difference would upon examination be found greater than might have been supposed the annual receipts of the country on the score of income and capital taken together may without any error capable of affecting the argument be stated as not much over or under three times the amount of the money of the country cash and paper taken together† call then the quantity of bank of england paper habitually issued and kept in circulation £ 0000000 and of that habitual  0 millions suppose at a particular time one million cancelled or kept back—for instance by a defalcation to that amount from the usual discounts here then is produced already by the defalcation of this single million from the quantity of money in circulation a defalcation to the amount of three millions from the mass of money that should have been received     in the course of the year—and this without any allowance made for the proportion of the money of both sorts cash and paper that will always be hoarded and kept out of the circulation in the shape of capital waiting for employment or the cash that must always be kept up in the same way as a fund of reserve for answering the engagements contracted by that part of the currency which is in paper call the amount of money kept up on both these accounts in the shape of capital onefourth part of the whole—then will a defalcation as above from the mass of money by a defalcation to that amount from the quantity of bank paper issued and kept out produce instead of the above supposed defalcation of three millions a defalcation of four millions from the mass of money receipts suppose again that by reason of the alarm excited by this defalcation from bank paper whatever was the cause of such defalcation another million cash and paper together is hoarded up and kept out of circulation out of the portion which otherwise would have continued in the circulation—on this supposition the defalcation from the mass of the years money receipts swells from the four millions above spoken of to eight millions but it is on the quantity of money ready to be transferred to those to whom it is due or by whom it is otherwise expected whether out of the portion which is kept in general circulation in small masses and which serves as a vehicle for income or out of the portion kept up in large masses in the shape of capital that the body of commercial men in their capacity of debtors depend for their ability to fulfil the aggregate mass of their engagements if then the influx of money in the course of the year into commercial hands be thus diminished by the amount of eight millions on the score of income and capital taken together eight millions or some such large sum will be the amount of engagements broken in the course of that year by reason of the defalcation of a single millions worth of bank paper unless in as far as the deficiency may have been made up from other sources—and to this amount will the commercial wealth of the country have suffered not only in point of quantity but in point of security i speak of security in contradistinction to quantity i e to actual wealth to a liquidated amount for if to the above liquidated loss be added the loss by failure following failure in consequence of the shock given to security the ultimate loss may rise above the supposed eight millions to an indefinite amount the want of a circulating medium as such that deficiency of which so much was said in      may recur at any time by the united wisdom of all parties interested it received a cure at that time from a number of concurrent measures all of them well adapted to the production of the effect from true wisdom it received for the time a perfect cure but by any other means than the sort of remedy here proposed to prevent the evil from recurring again and again at any time is not within the reach of the most perfect wisdom† and prevention is still better than the most perfect cure to be liable at any time to become the instrument of mischief and that in either of the two opposite ways by being in too great quantity or in too little is of the essence of all such promissory paper for its not being in too small a quantity it depends upon the wisdom and even humour of a few individuals for its not being in too great quantity it depends not only upon the wisdom and humour of individuals but upon contingencies of the day and the humours and prejudices of the uninformed and illinformed and hasty and impetuous multitude upon the former as to their not exceeding in their issues the amount warranted by the rules of     prudence—upon the latter as to their not frustrating and setting at default all the rules of prudence by crowding in to demand for their paper without need such a quantity of cash as is not in existence the sort of promise given by bank and bankers paper is that sort of promise the fulfilment of which taken in the aggregate is physically and constantly impossible the promise given by the proposed annuitynote paper is that sort of promise the fulfilment of which whether taken in the aggregate or in parcels has never yet been found to fail—which possesses all the certainty that is to be found anywhere in human affairs and which becomes less and less liable to fail the greater the quantity of money of which it conveys the promise were the proposed paper the only paper money national wealth would not be liable to suffer either in point of quantity or in point of security—either from excess or from deficiency in the quantity of paper money in any degree since even without the exercise of human reason on the part of anybody except on the part of each noteholder in so far as his own particular interest and that the interest of the moment were concerned it would adjust itself as it were of itself as to what concerns the demand for circulating money to the exact quantum of the demand it would be stock one moment and cash the next whichsoever were most wanted in the other case were it but one ingredient amongst others in the composition of the currency of the country it would as far as it went and to the extent of the quantity kept in hand principally with a view to income act as an occasional supplement to other paper money and as a remedy of the preventive kind to whatever inconveniences might otherwise have arisen from a deficiency of that article against an excess in the quantity of other paper money its operation would not be quite so efficient or so manifest but by presenting to every eye a species of paper money unsusceptible either of excess or depreciation it would at once and at all times take the pretence of necessity from the rashness that might otherwise be disposed to hazard an excessive issue and it would render the public in general the less disposed to accept in an excessive quantity a paper essentially hazardous seeing that a paper essentially exempt from hazard was at their command to any amount at any time chapter viii particular interests concerned of the four distinguishable effects looked for from the proposed measure that which will probably be regarded as the principal is the degree of acceleration and assurance promised by it to the redemption of the national debt to the accomplishment of so desirable an object in a way consistent with existing engagements no damage accruing to particular interests has ever been considered as opposing any bar that ought to be regarded as insurmountable that a reduction say from £  to £  per cent is a tax and that a proportional one to the amount of    per cent upon the income of a particular class of men is a proposition too obvious to be overlooked yet the design of effecting a reduction of the same sort and that to an undefined amount is a design rooted in the mind of the legislature evidenced by the practice of preceding parliaments† and by the express declarations of others‡ the nation at large and the stockholder are borrower and lender when the money is to be raised it is the lenders harvest and he takes advantage of the borrower and his necessities to the utmost of his power when debt comes to be paid off it is the debtors turn and it is neither unnatural nor unjust nor illaudable nor ought it to be unexpected that he by his agents should take the like advantage the stockholder of the payingoff season is not it is true in every instance the same individual as the stockholder of the borrowing season he is however either the very same or one who with his eyes open and for valuable consideration has put himself in the others place—succeeding to all his rights it would be in vain to repine at the thoughts of having succeeded to any of his obligations from a creditor in some cases and on the score of humanity mercy may with more or less reason be expected—but from a debtor what mercy was ever looked for the words merciless and debtor are words scarcely to be coupled with a grave face expressions however and the momentary effect they may have on the imagination are not the proper standards of right and wrong in this case any more than in any other human feelings and the effect of measures upon those feelings do constitute that standard in so far as they can be ascertained a stockholder is as much a member of the community—as     great a part of the community—as any other man such as his expectations have been such will his feelings be when the event takes place but what have been his expectations it is from his situation and that only—from the terms of the contract by which his situation in that respect is constituted—that any judgment can be formed thus stands it with regard to the public creditor—the stockholder who on the comparative return or increase of general prosperity and opulence has in former instances seen that part of his income reduced by one half and who within a period already in prospect may be doomed by the like cause to a reduction to the like amount but in comparison with the interests of this vast branch of the community what can be the amount of all the other particular interests put together and in comparison with the degree of sufferance in this case how trifling will be the degree of sufferance in any of those other cases the destiny of the stockholders is not hypothetical it originates not in the proposed measure it has been fixed and made known by the legislature and built upon for years and years by determinations several times repeated and brought to view without a doubt from that or any other quarter on the head of perseverance it is for want of means and not of determination that the redemption with all its consequences has not long ago been accomplished in comparison of such interests whatever lighter interests may be found to stand in the way might therefore appear as scarcely worth a glance but though all particular interests put together will not prevail for the rejection of a measure beneficial in a superior degree to the whole yet a view of the particular ways and degrees in which they may respectively come to be affected by it will not be without its use were it only by way of warning of the probable sources and grounds of opposition and of the nature of the obstacles which may be to be combated in the course of the exertions necessary to bring the measure into effect during period i while no part of the mass of government annuities is taken but on terms on which the holder is desirous to part with it benefit to particular interests will run along with and probably preponderate over the damage from the commencement of the period when the species of property in question is taken from unwilling hands the damage as far as particular interests are concerned will be apt to outweigh the benefit the only interests that belong in strictness to the present inquiry are those which are affected by the particular mode of operation employed by the proposed measure the consideration of any such interests as would equally be affected whatever other mode were employed is foreign to the present case the particular interests on which it bears are of course the several interests concerned in the species of paper money already in circulation the parties in question are therefore—  the bank of england—  the country bankinghouses to which will be to be added although not concerned in the emission of paper money but on another account—  the bankinghouses of the metropolis   if the paper of the bank of england should be accepted by government in payment for annuitynote paper issued at the annuitynote offices on the footing of cash as it is at present at the other existing government offices the circulation of banknotes would not it should seem experience any diminution from the proposed measure it might even receive assistance since in virtue of the same properties by which bank paper is rendered preferable to cash for all other purposes it will be no less so for this purpose should the public in general testify the expected preference for annuitynote paper as compared with cash the bank by keeping that paper as the stock in reserve to answer calls for change for their own notes might keep so much the less cash and derive £    s interest from a portion of their stock which at present yields them none but the profit from the present state of things is simple and certain the result of the proposed measure as touching its effects upon the affairs of the company would appear wrapped in clouds the bank according to their intelligent censor mr allardyce have not been forward to step out of the beaten track where the step has been ever so obvious and increased emolument ever so certain a fruit of it the probability therefore seems to be that the plan of the proposed rival paper would not be viewed from that superb edifice but with a rivals eye should damage eventually accrue to the corporation and should the case be regarded as calling for compensation the profit would afford an ample fund and the situation of the party damnified is such as would render it easy to reserve compensation in a variety of shapes but to put the public to any expense in rendering any such compensation would be a departure from former practice when by threats of forced redemption government has compelled the bank to accept of a reduced rate of interest and made a defalcation to the amount of    per cent upon the greatest part of its income compensation has     neither been granted by one party nor demanded by the other to government whose own manufactory of paper money† is of no less standing than that of the bank it will be difficult to say why it should be forbidden to follow the example of the bank and cut down its paper into as many smaller sizes as it found convenient to government which for the benefit of the community at large has made no scruple of restricting the dealings of other manufacturers of paper money it would be strange if in the same view it were not allowable to take its own course in the manufacture of its own paper in the management of its own affairs but the resource afforded by loans from the bank it may be asked shall government deprive itself of such a resource the answer is short and simple the resource cannot be taken away by the measure till profits have been produced to a greater amount than the feesimple of it bank paper need not—would not begin to be withdrawn out of the circulation till the paper of the country banks had been driven out of it altogether but before this would have happened a profit would have been made by the sale of annuitynote paper more than equal to the usual advances made by the bank it is only in time of war that the resource is of any value the quantity of money in the country will not be lessened at any rate by the proposed measure the great and only danger is lest it be increased too much upon any emergency the same quantity of money would therefore be to be had and always to be had only through a channel perhaps different and at a rate of interest possibly though not certainly a little higher at the worst to set against the gain of the twenty thirty or forty millions two or three times in the course of ten or twenty years an extra expense to the amount of £ 0000 or £ 00000 might be incurred upon these occasions a quantity of money might come to be raised upon bills in the nature of exchequer bills under powers previously and regularly obtained from parliament instead of being raised by treasury bills without powers from parliament the resource such as it is might or might not be reduced but at the worst would be but reduced even now profit by paper issued is but a part of the profit of the bank   as to the country bankers the effect of the measure upon their interests appears by no means clear on the one hand if the quantity of cash in the country be not lessened by the proposed government paper the demand for bankers service in keeping that cash will not be lessened should the proposed government paper come to be universally received in preference to cash the supply of cash kept by these banks for answering draughts may be made to assume that form yielding £     s per cent while kept at home while an equal amount in cash is sent abroad in the way of discount in exchange for bills on the other hand the money which is now attracted to a country bank by the nominal   per cent or whatever interest it is that is paid for it at present will no longer find its way thither being turned aside by the full £     s ayear with so many other advantages that attend the proposed paper in comparison with the paper of country bankers the loss if there be any to which this species of trader would be thus exposed is at any rate among the slightest and least to be regretted of any to which man is exposed by the vicissitudes of trade it is a mere cessation of gain or rather of gain in this particular shape a bankers capital is all in money it is not with a banker as with a manufacturer no loss by removal of stock or by forced sale in the lump and thereby to a disadvantage to avoid another greater loss a banker steps into his trade without trouble and goes out of it without loss in november      according to mr chalmers‡ the number of country banks was upwards of  00 before the month of march      according to the evidence given on the  st april      to the committee of the house of lords∥ they had decreased to about   0 on that same  st of april      according to the same evidence they did not exceed   0 if in consequence of the proposed measure the numbers of these banks should experience a further reduction or were to be swept away altogether the change is of a sort that threatens not to be either preceded or followed by distress failure cannot be among the consequences the banks will have had ample warning time for getting in their debts and contracting their issues of the issue of the proposed paper the progress from the very opening of it will be known day by day the whole island over to a penny§ months at any rate not to speak of years will have intervened between the first authentic mention of the measure and the establishment of it from withdrawing without failure—from withdrawing should it take place in consequence of the advancement of the proposed annuitynote paper—little damage would ensue to the few individuals particularly concerned and none to anybody else from failure     as often as it happens ruin ensues to the individuals concerned and much mischief to the community at large an entire substitution of the proposed government paper to the paper of country bankers would prevent the recurrence of this mischief and that ruin it is no light matter—out of the four hundred and odd country banks above spoken of according to an account taken by mr chalmers a full fourth had failed of more recent failures i say nothing having nobody to quote by expulsion from this branch of trade the whole body of the trade would thus be secured from failure by the failure of a part though it were but a tenth part more distress would at any time be produced reckoning that of the trade alone than by the expulsion of the whole   for the bankinghouses of the metropolis there seems less cause of apprehension than for the country banks they have no paper for the government paper to annihilate true it is that on the one hand many persons who now keep their money at a bankers because by keeping it themselves they could make no interest would not keep their annuitynote paper at the bankers if by keeping it there they could make no interest on it while by keeping it at home they could make £     s per cent of it but the inducement to keep money at the bankers does not consist solely in the consideration of safe custody but in that and other advantages put together in the saving in point of time and trouble in regard to the counting of money and doubts and disputes about the goodness of money offered together with the convenience of a mans having the account of his expenditure kept by other hands for these remaining conveniences some might be willing to waive their claims to the small and unusual gain of  d per £ 00 per day upon expenditure others though unwilling to give up the whole may be willing to give up some part of it and in this way a man might keep his annuitynote paper at his bankers as he does his cash but upon terms and the profit by interest on the paper might thus come to be shared between the owner of the paper and the keeper of it capital sums however which now are in so many instances suffered through indolence and while waiting for a distant and undetermined employment to lie dead to the owner at a bankers would not be quite so apt to lie there when in the shape of annuity notes they might be productive of interest to the owner without prejudice to such their destination and without any increase of trouble here then we see two new sources of profit opened by the measure to the bankinghouses of the metropolis—  profit by interest of annuitynote paper kept in reserve instead of cash to answer drafts and   profit by annuitynote paper kept for customers upon terms suppose the quantity of cash in the metropolis to be undiminished by the measure the amount of the above profits will even be neat will it remain undiminished the affirmative seems highly probable among the effects of the measure is one that to a certain degree cannot fail to increase that quantity the cash which now remains and would otherwise have remained in the hands of the frugal poor—in unproductive hands being now poured into the hands of the commissioners for the redemption of the national debt in return for annuitynote paper will be restored to the circulation and add to the quantity put into the hands of bankers chapter ix rise of prices—how to obviate i have already stated an extra rise of prices as among the conceivable results of the proposed measure taken by itself it is evidently an undesirable result it is a tax on income to the amount—a tax which comes out of everybodys pocket and goes into nobodys being with reference to the proposed measure an unfavourable result i may be believed with the less difficulty when stating it as a probable one supposing the influx of the proposed paper not to be followed or rather kept pace with by an efflux of other money to an equal amount and supposing it too sudden to be productive of an influx of vendible commodities to an amount worth regarding in this view within the assumed space of time the result presents itself as a demonstrable one for the price of the whole mass of vendible articles taken together sold within the year is in other words the same thing as the quantity of money given or undertaken for in exchange for them within that time so that the quantity of those articles remaining the same the greater the quantity of the money is that has been given for them the higher has been the price it has already been observed that it seems impossible to say with any precision to how small or how great a length the emission of the proposed paper may eventually be found to extend previously to the arrival of stock   per cents at par that at some part or other of that interval a small quantity at least can however scarcely fail to find acceptance and that a small quantity a very few millions for example issued previously to the conclusion of it would be sufficient to operate the conversion indicated and thereby give the form of the proposed paper to the whole of the remaining mass of annuities composing the national debt that although the quantity of that species of property will be continually   0 and rapidly on the decrease while the demand for it will be as continually and rapidly on the increase it will nevertheless be difficult if not impossible to prescribe any determinate limit to that portion of it which in this way may come to have introduced itself into the circulation on the footing of current money for the open issue will remain equally open to the customers for temporary income who when they have kept it as long as they can afford will throw it into the circulation as to the customers for permanent income and it seems impossible to say in what proportions at any given time the quantity of annuitynote paper remaining at that time will find itself distributed between the two classes on these considerations it will be matter of prudence to be prepared for the several possible cases and degrees in which it may happen to constitute a clear addition to the mass of money in circulation to any such amount as to be in a sensible degree productive of the apprehended inconvenience of such preparation the practical result will be to take such measures as shall be effectual for the prevention—not of the rise of prices which is impossible—but of any addition to that degree of rise or rate of increase which would have taken place in the natural course of things independently of the proposed measure if after having expelled of itself the whole amount of paper money of other sorts it were to keep on increasing without expelling metallic money to an amount equal to its own it would thence forward if not restrained make a proportionable addition to the quantity of money of all sorts in circulation and thence to the prices of vendible commodities in this case it would be necessary to apply the check to the proposed paper itself by limiting the quantity that should be suffered to enter into the composition of the mass of money in circulation for example by stopping the issue of all annuity notes below a certain magnitude say for instance the £ 0    s notes by an expedient thus simple the requisite powers being given to the executive government ab initio the end might be accomplished in the possible event supposed without any fresh interference on the part of the legislature that the means thus proposed would be adequate to the end will appear clear enough it is supposed from what has been said on this subject in a former chapter that in proportion as the proposed paper advanced in circulation country bankers paper and bank of england paper would quietly withdraw themselves is a result that appears more probable than the contrary according to what has already been observed† should it fail of taking place in the requisite degree of itself it would require to be produced by means directed expressly to that end the first of the two species of paper attacked would naturally be the paper of the country banks collectively modern individually changeable they have no such claims on government as those which plead in favour of the great incorporated bank express prohibition would not be necessary by taxation the same effect precisely might be produced—by a simple extension of a tax already imposed for other purposes by this means if necessary about half the utmost possible amount of the supposed redundant mass of paper would be chased away† secondly and lastly would come the paper of the bank of england in this case as in the other the same means would be sufficient to the same end perhaps however in this case they would not be necessary a simple refusal on the part of government to receive at its own offices any other than its own paper might be adequate to the effect‡ it may be asked—to what end throw the whole burthen of the measure upon the two particular classes in question instead of letting it spread over the community at large in the shape of a rise of prices my answer is—to reduce the amount and pressure of it to its minimum at an estimate greater than any possible one the former loss would not be to the latter in so high a proportion as that of interest to principal to the banking class it is not clear as hath already been shown that the loss would in fact amount to anything but put an extreme case and take it in the instance of each individual at the utmost possible amount it could rise to in the instance of any one call the total amount of bank and bankers paper    millions∥ and upon the whole of this paper suppose a real profit of   per cent annually made upon a supposition in a variety of points thus excessive the total loss is but £   0000 ayear call on the other hand the total quantity of money of all kinds taken together    millions§—and suppose according to the position brought to view at     the commencement of this chapter that the addition made to the prices of vendible commodities taken together is in the exact proportion of the supposed sudden addition to the mass of money viz as    to   —as   to   on this supposition the rise of prices being supposed equable and therefore universal every income which did not receive a rateable increase from the supposed sudden influx of    millions would in effect be diminished by a fourth—the whole income of a man so circumstanced producing him no more than threefourths of the quantity of vendible commodities it produced to him before call with dr becke the annual income of the country including income from day labour without stock £   000000—or for round numbers £  0000000 then will the annual burthen on the country by rise of prices on the nonexpulsion of the paper money in question be £ 0000000 per contra the utmost possible annual loss to the bankers and bank proprietors by the expulsion not so much as £   0000 the probable loss scarcely so much as the odd £  0000 the amount of the loss would it is true be made good in money in a certain degree to every person whose circumstances enabled him to make in money an addition to his income equal to the degradation thus sustained by it—for although the real value of the total mass of money—its value in respect of the quantity of vendible commodities it purchases and conveys—is not greater after the supposed addition to the mass of money yet on the other hand neither is it less the misfortune is that although the pressure from the defalcation would be felt in all its force—and felt by all parties indemnified as well as unindemnified—the indemnity would in comparison be scarcely perceived the loss by the rise of prices would be felt as so much loss—the gain by the share in that extra influx of money by which the loss had been produced—this gain not being coupled and set down per contra in the mind of the party and confronted with the loss would present itself in the shape of an independent gain unconnected with any such effect—and by an indisputable law of the sensible faculties of man sums and circumstances equal the enjoyment produced by gain is never equal to the suffering produced by loss if it were the main reason for affording protection to property would cease that an increase in the quantity of real wealth i e of vendible commodities has been produced by an increase in the quantity of nominal wealth—viz current money cash and paper together—seems by no means clear of doubt but what seems not exposed to doubt is that the quantum of such addition if real accruing in the compass of a year cannot amount to more than the produce of the fresh quantity of unemployed capacity for labour brought into employment by the application of a proportionable quantity of the supposed fresh influx of money over and above that which would have been brought into employment—so that if at the commencement of the year all hands capable of employment were full of employment and so would have continued during the whole course of it no addition could in the course of that time be made to the quantity of real wealth or vendible commodities by the influx of the money in question howsoever copious but whatever quantity of money being introduced into the circulation has not the effect of producing a correspondent quantity of vendible commodities cannot but have the effect of producing a correspondent degradation in the value of the existing mass of money into which it flows thereby producing what is in truth no more than the same effect expressed in other words a correspondent rise of prices† chapter x reduction of interest—proposed mode compared with mr pelhams reduction of interest is a declared object with parliament—the only question is as to the mode to exhibit the comparative eligibility as between the two plans—the one here proposed     for the future and the one pursued in time past by mr pelham—i shall consider them together under the several heads of expense—celerity of operation—previous assurance of success—and gentleness of operation—not forgetting with respect to mr pelhams the possibility of applying it at the present time to the immensely increased mass of debt i as to expense—viz as compared with profit—in mr pelhams time the profit consisted in reducing to   per cents the whole amount of the then existing quantity of   per cents that is reducing the quantum of interest paid on the nominal capital of £   0     from about £  0     to about £     0  when the operation was first mentioned by him in parliament it was a sign that then at least the state of the money market was ripe for it otherwise he could not have obtained the requisite assurance of the money for paying off in case of refractoriness—how much longer it might have already been ripe it would be in vain to attempt to calculate this being assumed whatever respite he allowed—whether as to the whole or as to a part of the interest proposed to be struck off—is to be considered as a price or bonus which under the plan proposed it was looked upon as advisable in point of prudence to allow to the stockholders in order to purchase their acquiescence and insure the plan against the hazard of failure i say to prudence for as to sympathy for the sufferings of the individuals damnified the professedly vindictive measures pursued afterwards against the repugnants are a sufficient proof that no such motive was consulted in the arrangements of the terms   a years interest was allowed in the first plan without reduction—i e the amount of the one per cent that was to be afterwards struck off by the reduction £   0   was allowed for the first year   half of the one per cent ultimately struck off was allowed for seven years more this for one year was £      —for the seven years £ 0      adding the one per cent for the first year makes the total price paid for consent £       —deducting £     0 discount for the several years to come leaves the amount of the money paid for the £   0   ayear thus saved £        this £        thus paid for consent to the reduction amounts to a little more than    th of the amount of the capital of £   0     upon which the reduction of the   per cent to   per cent was thus effected a little less than £  0     which would be the exact amount of four years purchase of the perpetual annuity thus struck off such then was the price that on mr pelhams plan was given for a consent which upon the proposed plan would be obtained gratis on the proposed plan the quantum of interest that would be struck off by the first reduction meaning the reduction effected in the course of the two first periods by conversion of   and   and   per cents into capitals bearing £     s per cent by means of the paper of the first issue would be £     0  that upon any proposed reduction to be effected at this time of day the same terms precisely should be offered as were offered at that time of day would under the vast difference of circumstances be a supposition altogether untenable but as it would be a fruitless attempt to determine what would be the terms now offered the only terms on which any argument can be grounded are the above† on that supposition the price to be paid for a consent to the striking off a mass of permanent annuities to the above amount of £     0  ayear would be a little less than four times that sum it would be £        exactly four times would be £   0   ‡   a sacrifice which may be added to the expense attending the reduction of interest as above is—that of going on with the redemption of the principal of the debt by mr pelhams plan this latter mode of liberation was given up even in point of right for eight years—and in intention perhaps for ever since the establishment of the existing sinking funds it could not now be given up upon any terms and supposing it possible and deemed eligible to adopt the principle of mr pelhams reduction plan to a certain extent it could not be adopted without such modifications as would be necessary to render it compatible with the institution of those redemption funds on the proposed plan reduction of interest and redemption of principal afford assistance     to each other reduction to redemption by the supplies it pours into the fund—redemption to reduction by the sums which by expelling them out of the old annuities it drives into the new   another sacrifice that would be to be made upon mr pelhams plan was—of the eventual advantage of ulterior reductions—the very right given up for eight years as before—and for any subsequent period no foundation laid nor prospect opened for anything that appears on the proposed plan issue follows issue—reduction reduction—as wave follows wave—execution treading without respite upon the heels of possibility what space of time each reduction would occupy is scarcely open to conjecture—thus much is certain that there is not a moments interval between the completion of one reduction and the commencement of the next ii celerity of operation constitutes a head of comparison different in name but in effect carried to account already under the head of expense a given sum is worth the less as the time for receiving it is more distant acceleration is profit—retardation loss iii previous assurance of success that mr pelhams plan was practicable was proved by the event but for a long time it was likely to have failed and had it failed it would have failed in toto since if the reduction had not been submitted to in respect of nearly the whole mass it could not have taken place as to any part had not the quantity of uninscribed stock about  ¼ millions been small enough to admit of its being paid off the submission testified in respect of the subscribed stock could hardly have been accepted nor could the plan have taken place in any degree without a joint and simultaneous operation on the part of one or other of two numerous sets of parties—viz the stock holders who were called upon to submit to the reduction—or the monied men from whom as far as the expected submission failed of taking place the money was to come for paying off the repugnants but though practicable then in respect of the    or    millions in question then it does not follow that it would be practicable now in regard to the amount of debt now in question not even although stocks should arrive at par in regard to reduction on the proposed plan success is as we have seen independent of contingencies in each year—month—day the process will go on to the utmost extent consistent with the state of the money market at that time by the proposed subscription plan—by the consequent competition for respite from further deductions—the first reduction might be rendered in a manner instantaneous and a very short space of time would be sufficient for the accomplishment of it even without any such aid the   or   millions which would by that time be the amount of a years produce of the sinking fund call it   millions—this vibrating without ceasing between the stock market and the annuitynote market would be sufficient to dispatch the reduction and with prodigious rapidity although the subscription plan were untried or tried without effect in the machinery thus put in motion no part is liable to stop of itself for want of the assistance of any other—and as it is at the beginning so is it at the end during the first issue every note then issued pays off by the money it produces and thus converts into note annuities a corresponding portion of stock annuities during the second issue every note then issued converts in the same way into paper bearing the reduced rate of interest of that second issue a correspondent portion of the paper of the first issue—and a single note thus taken out in the way of issue would bring about the reduction upon that portion of capital and in a determinable time even upon the whole capital although not another note were ever to be issued on the same terms once put in motion the machine keeps going of itself without any fresh winding up so long as there remains a particle of the debt for it to act upon and cut down—nothing is left to depend on circumstances of the moment—nothing on the humours of individuals—no interval between reduction and reduction—no pausing deliberating negotiating debating fumbling—nor yet is the process exposed to the charge of precipitation or excess—government having it in its power to stop or retard the operation at any time by stopping or retarding the influx of the primum mobile from the sinking fund iv lastly as to gentleness of operation of mr pelhams plan it is upon record that it experienced much opposition and created much dissatisfaction it was in the nature of it so to do it brought forward the minister in an obnoxious attitude calling upon men to     submit to a loss to the amount of a perpetual tax of    per cent upon income subject only to an abatement to the amount of about four years purchase on the condition of their lending their hands to a sacrifice of which they were the sole victims accordingly though on the ground of justice nothing could be more unimpeachable illhumour on one side appears to have begot illhumour on the other—on the part of the authors of the suffering as well as on the part of the sufferers themselves on those who stood out at first harder terms were afterwards imposed and to judge from the debates the professed motive was not merely economy but vengeance by the proposed plan no such invidious task is put into the hands of any one before anything of hardship shows itself at least to the great class of individuals here in question—the stockholders the measure will have been known—known for years as a measure of universal accommodation every mans money will have been breeding money in his pocket—every man who has sold out will have sold to an advantage when hardship comes at last it will be at the end of a long chain of causes and effects the first link of which has been removed by time almost out of the reach of observation the immediate cause being everybodys act is nobodys no new act—none at least that carries anything of compulsion on the face of it is required at this or indeed at any time on the part of government on mr pelhams plan everything turning upon subscription a man knew not but that he was subscribing to his own loss on the proposed plan the loss takes place at any rate and the effect of a subscription is all gain to him the quantity of this gain depends upon his own exertions and the bustle of competition serves to call off his mind from the suffering which is to come chapter xi moral advantages to the head of moral advantages may be referred two very distinct results—prevention of improbity and promotion of frugality prevention of improbity by furnishing as we shall see a new means or instrument of prevention promotion of frugality by the offer of a new species of property which by annexing an unprecedented remuneration to the exercise of that virtue operates at once as an incentive and as a means i as to prevention of improbity the class of persons in whose instance it may operate to this effect consists of trustees of every description to whom it belongs to receive money on account of their principals—executors and administrators guardians stewards and receivers assignees of bankrupts prizeagents factors and the like to cause trustmonies as often as a suitable case presents itself to be laid out in the purchase of government annuities for the benefit of the principals is in the court of chancery matter of longestablished practice—a practice which by an act of very recent date has received express support from parliament the credit of the proposed new government annuities having been previously established by sufficient experience let a similar investment of all trustmonies as they come in be rendered a matter of general obligation by an act of the legislature a trustreceipt book to be kept with a trusttill in the book an entry to be made of each sum received with the day on which it was received the statement of the day to be indispensable the money if not received in the shape of annuity notes to be sent to the office on that day or the next to be changed into annuity notes the notes received to be entered by their numbers if the day be not entered the first day of the year to be presumed for the purpose of charging the trustee with the interest the trustpaper as received to be deposited in the trusttill to save it from being confounded with money of his own this not to prevent the disposal of the amount to superior advantage i e at a higher rate of interest than what is afforded by annuity notes in as far as the nature of the trust admits of it† what is thus proposed to be rendered obligatory for the benefit of the principal is no more than what a careful trustee would do spontaneously either for the benefit of the principal or for his own according to the texture of his conscience should a precaution thus simple and unexceptionable be neglected the institution of annuity notes will be but too apt to operate as a premium for vice as well as virtue—a premium for improbity in the one situation as well as for frugality in the other     ii lastly as to promotion of frugality we have seen the peculiar advantages which the proposed new species of property holds out to the acquirer within a trifling and unavoidable fraction  d aday £  for every £ 00 by the year—not for risk of lending but for mere selfdenial in not spending income receivable without expense and without stirring from his home no attendance no agency fees no brokerage fees no stampduty either on purchase or on sale no loss on either occasion by fluctuation of price not a day without its profit—profit by keeping for the minutest as well as for the largest portions of time conveyance obtainable for it by the post in the minutest portions as well as to the most distant parts of the island security afforded by division against misadventures of all sorts—against accidents and against crimes—in the house or on the road—by fire water or forgetfulness—from theft robbery burglary or breach of trust compound interest brought within the reach of individuals for the first time in proportion to the degree in which it presents these several accommodations in that same proportion does it act as an incentive to frugality—in all classes in a certain degree and in as far as current expenditure is concerned but in a more especial degree in those humble and at the same time most numerous walks of life in which it is of most importance to prudence probity and happiness in the existing state of the moneymarket the hoards of the opulent are prolific and accumulating the hoards of the poor alone are dead and unproductive by the proposed measure the condition of the poor in this respect would be raised to a level—in the first instance not much below and in process of time as the price of stock annuities rose and the rate of interest obtainable by the purchase of them diminished altogether upon a par with the condition of the rich a result not to be viewed without regret is that in every period after the second and in proportion as the rate of interest afforded by government annuities comes to be reduced the encouragement thus given to frugality will thus be reduced likewise for though after the reduction the remainder will be gain as compared with the present period yet the difference will be loss in comparison of the period then last in experience but in the meantime the condition of the poor in this respect will at any rate have been raised to a level with that of the rich and will so continue the habit of frugality will have taken root and having so done may derive strength rather than weakness from the increased exertions it will be called upon to make chapter xii constitutional advantages among the effects resulting from the national debt in the early stages of its existence was the security it afforded to the old established constitution by engaging the purses and affections of the monied interest in the service and support of the newestablished government that was the greatmonied interest in other points of view the institution of that debt has found many disapprovers in this it has found none—among those at least by whom the existing constitution is regarded as fit to be preserved the advantage resulting from the transmutation of that debt into the proposed form would be—the security to the constitution and government now grown into one arising from its engaging the support of what may be called the littlemonied interest by the same powerful tie     the body politic not less than the body natural is subject to its constitutional diseases tyranny was the grand disease in prospect then anarchy now the danger then was from a single person in respect of the sentiments of submission pointed to that person and carried to excess the danger now is from the great multitude—in respect of the disposition to unruliness which has been and continues to be propagated with but too much success among the lower orders—among those let it never be out of mind of whom is composed the vast majority of the people if the name of greatmonied interest employed above for distinctions sake be well applied it is with reference to money and by reason of the greatness of the shares but with reference to men meaning multitude of men—and even with reference to money if the magnitude of the total be the object of consideration—it is the littlemonied interest that should be termed great as the disease changes its form so should the remedy stock in its large doses served for the disorder of that time paper in its small doses is the specific for the present admirable are the remedies that have already been applied admirable not more for their efficiency than for their gentleness there remains this one—and perhaps another that might be named—remedies not less efficient and still more gentle turning to ireland the demand for the remedy will be found the same in kind but much more urgent in degree the proportion of petty to great moneyholders much greater the bias to turbulence and anarchy not to speak of idleness and drunkenness beyond comparison more prone† turn lastly to british india—what a sheetanchor to british dominion—to the mildest the most upright the steadiest of all governments—if by insensible and voluntary steps the population of that remote most expanded and most expansive branch of the british empire should be led to repose the bulk of their fortunes and their hopes on a paper bearing the image and superscription of a british governor what a reduction in the rate of interest paid there by government—what a remedy to the risks and embarrassments attendant on the interchange of so many debaseable and incommensurable modifications of metallic currency—what an augmentation to the general mass of currency capital and wealth but all these are trifles in comparison with the additional pledge of popular attachment and the increased assurance of internal peace from the zemindar to the ryot every hindoo every mussulman who possessed this money—every individual in a word who possessed money—might thus by his own money and to a great part of the amount of his own money—might thus and without impeachment of probity—be converted into a pensioner of the british government‡ for a premium equal to the interest the paper yields he would be underwriting—perpetually underwriting his allegiance to the amount of the principal chapter xiii recapitulation and conclusion upon the whole the proposed measure it is believed will be found to promise with some degree of assurance the following connected but perfectly distinct advantages—   advantage of financial profit by contributing     in so many various and to such considerable amounts to the redemption of the principal of the national debt as well as to the reduction of the rate of interest—and by affording an instrument more advantageous than any other for the application to that end of such means as are or may be provided from other sources   moral advantages by the encouragement of frugality and thence of temperance among the inferior and most numerous ranks of the community   constitutional advantages by constituting an additional bond of connexion with the government and thence affording an additional safeguard to internal tranquillity   politicoeconomical advantage by addition made to the mass of national productive capital and thence to the mass of growing wealth each of the above four masses of advantage appears sufficient to warrant an experiment even should it be attended with some risk shall they not all of them together be deemed sufficient to give birth to an experiment altogether free from risk few measures have ever been brought to view pregnant with such high advantages—none in which in case of success the degree of success has been beforehand so precisely ascertainable—none in which the deviation from the path of safety as marked out by experience is so slight and imperceptible were the proposal expressed in these words—make your exchequer bills for small sums—this though not completely nor correctly expressive of the measure would express all the innovation of it     the only feature in the proposed plan which separately taken can be called new is the bringing into the market portions of government currency less than heretofore—portions less than have been issued by government in this country but not less than than what have been issued by governments in other countries and in this country by individuals the other leading features are collected altogether from established institutions the annuity engaged for is perpetual but redeemable—the paper containing the evidence of its sale by government light and transferable—the produce of the sale appropriated to the extinction of the national debt if the experiment be tried the earlier the success the greater—but sooner or later and to a certain extent success is infallible and even failure would be unattended with loss appendix a government ought to have the monopoly of paper money as well as of metallic money bank notes though bearing no interest circulate at par even private notes—the notes of country bankers do the same—government paper not without interest and even when carrying interest not at a corresponding premium to what causes are we to attribute a contrast thus striking and so much to the disadvantage of government is the disadvantage remediable or irremediable if remediable are there any efficient reasons against employing a remedy if a remedy can be found is it not an event to be wished for upon the whole instead of bearing a share comparatively so minute as that which government bears in the business of issuing paper currency and that upon terms comparatively so disadvantageous ought it not rather to possess the whole—is it not to be wished that it did possess the whole how stand these questions with reference to general constitutional principles—how stand they upon the footing of particular expediency—of expediency with reference to the circumstances of the particular case in question independently of the general expediency of adhering to constitutional principles if obtainable and desirable by what means can such an extension of the government currency be attempted with the greatest prospect of advantage and success of what nature are the advantages to be derived from it and to what length are they capable of being carried the advantage is the first object in the order of importance whatever may be the present amount of paper circulating without interest—upon the supposition that government possessed the monopoly of the issue of such paper the saving of the interest upon such amount whatever be the current rate of interest would be the advantage accruing from such monopoly if then the whole of this advantage or any part of it could be gained would there be any harm in gaining it let us open in the first place the great book of the constitution to be the same in principle at all times constitutional laws must vary as the times and adapt themselves to the times among the most unquestioned innocent and unobjectionable prerogatives of the crown acting in this as in all other instances under the controul of parliament is the monopoly of the coinage when there was no currency     but metal the crown had the sole issuing of that currency to metal currency is now added paper currency the crown therefore to preserve the prerogative in statu quo ought to have the sole issuing of that currency at any rate unless the extension of the monopoly to this modern branch be attended with greater inconveniences than what accompany its application to the old one nor let it be thought that the expediency of this extension rests upon the mere general ground of adherence to established principles sanctioned by general acquiescence—upon the propriety of keeping matters in respect of government as they are—in a word of keeping up the vis inertue of government if the prerogative had utility for its support in its original shape it is recommended by equal utility in the proposed supplemental one the use of the prerogative in respect of metal money was to guard the people against loss by the suppression of counterfeits in the instance of paper currency the use and reed of it are the same the loss to which the subject was exposes by metal money coined by individuals was that of the difference between genuine metal and of full weight and the coin of light weight and base alloy which it might be apprehended would be issued by individuals the loss to which the subject is exposed from bad paper currency is of the same kind but much heavier in degree loss by bad metal currency distributes itself in small parcels and by the minuteness of the portions to which it adheres falls with a gentle and almost imperceptible stroke loss by bad paper falls in much larger masses loss by bad copper is as nothing—loss by bad silver is no great matter—even loss by bad gold is light in comparison of the average rate of loss upon bad bills the justification of the monopoly in the new case is stronger than in the old one in every point of view by the monopoly of the metal coinage the government succeeds but very imperfectly in saving the subject from loss coiners were punished as traitors and yet the country swarmed with coiners a few years ago and the copper was threefourths bad—the pretended silver a great deal of it base and scarcely a piece of genuine silver that was not either counterfeit or light by the monopoly of the paper currency government might most perfectly protect the subject from bad paper let it but supply the market with its own paper and a simple prohibition will keep all other paper out of the market most effectually against the fabrication of bad coin capital punishment has been expended in vain against the fabrication of paper which under the danger of its turning out so much worse than bad coin it seems expedient to prohibit a pecuniary penalty would be perfectly sufficient if then in the whole scheme of government there be an instance in which it is expedient to bring back institutions to the standard of first principles the present will i believe be found among the number compare the advantage resulting to the community from the monopoly in the respective instances of the two species of currencies we shall find it in every point of view greatly superior in the instance of the paper currency of fictitious value to what it is in the instance of the currency of natural value the metallic currency will the prerogative be abused no more when extended to paper than it is now that it confines itself to coin good faith as towards subjects is a jewel so deeply set in the british crown that it can as little be expected to shake in any one part as to drop out altogether appendix b paper money—causes why not circulated by government without interest as well as by individuals the contrast between the terms on which bank paper is received and those on which government paper is received has been already brought to view the inferiority of the latter cannot however be owing to any inferiority in point of credit the credit of the bank of england can never be greater than that of the government of great britain yet a man who would trust government with his whole fortune to the amount of hundreds of thousands of pounds will not give a premium of more than a few shillings per £ 00 for an exchequer bill bearing interest though he will give £ 00 for a bank note to that amount for which he will receive no interest the same man too will not only take a promissory note from the great company of whose opulence the opinion is so universal and so high for its nominal value but perhaps even the note of some country banker of whom except from such his note he has no knowledge the cause of this inferiority can never therefore consist in any inferiority in point of credit it must be looked for therefore in some other circumstance there are several circumstances which cooperate towards giving to the bank paper the aptitude it possesses with respect to circulation the want of any of these properties   0 or the possession of it in an inferior degree will account pro tanto for the inferiority of the terms upon which the government paper obtains the degree of circulation it has obtained these properties are—  the being payable to the bearer on demand   the being transferable like coin from hand to hand without indorsement or any other formality   the being issued for such small sums as £ 0 £ 0 and £    the being impressed on paper which in point of size is neither so large as to take up much room nor so small as to be liable by its minuteness to escape observation and be lost and in point of texture is thin enough to bear folding without cracking and yet not so thin but that it will bear to be written upon by which means any proprietor may put his mark upon it to enable him to vindicate his right to it in case of loss   the having been so long in possession of the national confidence and that to such a degree as to be the only paper which individuals all over the kingdom are universally in the habit of accepting upon the same terms as the current coin an exchequer bill bears a daily interest and is made payable to bearer upon hearing this one should suppose that it should bear a premium to the amount of the interest—since a bank note for that sum payable to bearer and carrying no interest bears no discount but is received at par an exchequer bill does indeed bear a premium but that premium is very far short of being equal to the interest the difference we have seen does not arise from difference in point of security and credit but may perhaps be traced to the combined influence of several causes viz—  the want of bills for small sums of a size adapted to the general run of the demand   the not being made payable to the bearer at any time but only after the interval of about half a year after its issue   the want of that simplicity in respect of the terms and mode of payment which is observable in the paper of the bank of england—to which may perhaps be added something of which presently in the sensible properties of the instrument itself by which the engagement is conveyed that the want of sufficient division has a very considerable share in the production of the effect can scarcely be a matter of doubt exchequer bills are not for a less amount than £ 00 they are never issued for a less sum bank notes are for various amounts less than £ 00 viz £ 0 £ 0 £ 0 £ 0 £   £ 0 and £  in the instance of exchequer bills the magnitude of the sum is itself sufficient to render this species of paper unfit for the ordinary course of circulation—it is of itself sufficient to throw it out of the ordinary current of private dealings it is a commodity for which comparatively so few are qualified to bid that those few cannot but enjoy considerable advantage in their biddings it is the money of so few men that that circumstance is of itself sufficient to prevent it from being generally known accordingly the circulation of exchequer bills is confined in great measure for aught i know to the metropolis—it is confined to the neighbourhood of the alley—to bankers stockbrokers and the other classes of money dealers a man may have enjoyed a large income—a man may have had very extensive dealings in the way of trade and yet go out of the world without having ever set eyes on an exchequer bill the bank it may be said issues notes for sums as large as £ 00—indeed for sums to a prodigious degree larger and yet there is no more discount upon these large notes or the bank than upon the very smallest ones true but then along with these larger notes the bank issues and that in great plenty the smaller notes above mentioned—and that in such plenty as to be in readiness for change of the larger notes wherever and by whomsoever such change is wanted nor are such larger notes ever issued to any one who chooses rather to have the smaller notes the small notes of the bank it may be observed in reply afford no facility to the circulation of the large notes of the same company that the exchequer bills of government do not equally possess for admitting that the value of an exchequer bill of £ 00 would not be quite so great setting aside the article of interest as that of a bank note to the same nominal amount still the exchequer bill has a known value in the market as experience shows not much less than that of the bank note it ought therefore to be as easy were this all to find change for a £ 00 exchequer bill in bank notes as for a £ 00 bank note to this it may be rejoined that the facility in the two cases is not in truth alike everybody being equally acquainted with bank notes anybody who has £ 00 to keep for a little while before he will have to change it will as readily take it in a single bank note for £ 00 as in ten notes for £ 0 for though he may never have seen such a thing as a bank note for £ 00 before in his life yet the perfect resemblance it bears in every respect but the quantity of paper engraving and writing to the ten £ 0 notes makes it so long as he does not want to change it exactly the same thing to him—the security is the same—the conditions and time of payment are the same—and what is no small matter the     appearance of the instrument is exactly the same the variation in respect of the sum excepted—a sort of variation which he is already accustomed to by the smaller notes a man who has a £ 00 bank note need not fear therefore the getting smaller bank notes to the same amount from any one who has them and is in no immediate want of such lesser notes in the way of change—whereas a man who has only a £ 00 exchequer bill may see good grounds for doubting whether he shall be able with equal facility to get such change for such exchequer bill since among twenty people to whom he may offer it every one may perhaps be altogether unacquainted with it and if not absolutely decided in regarding it as a species of paper of less value may still be unwilling to give himself the trouble of satisfying himself whether it be of equal value or not the want of efficient assurance of putting off this species of paper with as much facility as a bank note to the same amount gives this species of paper a disadvantage or at least it may be reckoned among the causes which contribute to give this paper a disadvantage in point of prompt circulation in comparison with bank notes but since accordingly the exchequer bill is not like the bank note everybodys money the consequence is that in order to find out a person whose money it is it must be sent to the great market for money in different shapes—the alley it must go into the hands of a broker and the expense but much more the time for the expense is but   000 per cent places it thus on a ground of considerable disadvantage in comparison with a bank note so far as this disadvantage goes instead of operating as current cash it has the effect only of so much capital in the funds operating in the shape of principal money as carrying interest and serving as a source of income in this quality the price it bears will approach to that of stock—to that of a government annuity given in exchange for so much money rather than to the price of so much money receivable at any time it will however have the advantage in point of price of such an annuity and that on several accounts it is transferable with so much less trouble and expense—the value of it rises by keeping according to a visible and certain law in a visible and certain proportion day by day—whereas the price of so much stock though it may rise in much the same degree upon the whole as the period of payment approaches yet as it can rise by no interval less than ⅛ per cent amounting in three per cents to     editor of the whole it can rise by no shorter steps than one step of at least fifteen days and even then the rise is so liable to be disturbed by fluctuations as to be in the character of a rise proportioned to lapse of time and the consequent accrual of interest in a manner imperceptible it might be thought that though the £ 00 exchequer bill is for the reasons above pointed out not everybodys money—not the money of so many people as the £ 00 bank note still it might be worth so many peoples money as to bear the same price or nearly the same price it would for example be the money of bankers and moneydealers in general it certainly is the money of bankers to a degree yet still not in the same degree as the bank note it is their money upon a footing more nearly approaching to that in which so much stock is their money than that in which the bank note is their money a banker may lay out his money in this way for the purpose of making it produce an interest and thence he may lay out in this way such part of his receipts as be allows himself to lay out for his own benefit but he cannot lay out in this way as he may in bank notes any part or at least any considerable part of the money which he deems it necessary to keep by him in readiness to answer drafts because as has already been observed he cannot be equally sure of the exchequer notes being accepted of by a person who comes with a draft as he can of the bank notes being so accepted of he can keep it therefore upon no other footing than that of an evidence of his being entitled to a principal sum bearing interest—in a word as a source of interest but in the capacity of a source of interest it must bear the interest it purports to give or at least a very considerable part of it if it did not it would not answer the purpose it therefore cannot bear in this quality a premium eating out that interest or any considerable part of it it may indeed be worth his while to take somewhat less interest upon such a security than he could make of the same money in the funds because it will cost him rather less time and at at any rate less money to convert it into cash at any time than to convert into cash so much stock and this accordingly is the case—a man makes almost one per cent less in this way than by buying into the funds as to the circumstance of the exchequer bill not being payable on demand till half a year after the time of its being issued this circumstance is not sufficient of itself to account for the depreciation taken by itself it seems in fact to have but little or no influence if this were the sole cause of depreciation this cause being removed the effect would cease before the time when principal and interest became payable or at least at the time of issuing an exchequer bill would indeed bear no premium but no sooner were that period arrived than it would bear a premium and that equal to the interest this however is so far from being true that as     far as i can learn the arrival of this period makes in this respect no perceptible change at the time of issuing the exchequer bill bears a small premium thereby reducing the rate of interest that can be made of it at the arrival of the time of payment it continues to bear that premium but does not bear any more the truth is that the inconvenience of its not being payable for half a year is foreseen and so far as it is reckoned for anything allowed for from the first and the exchequer bill takes its station among the commodities of the alley as a paper better adapted for a source of income than for general circulation and this station the change in its nature operated by the arrival of the time for payment is not able to raise it from the comparative want of simplicity in respect of the terms and mode of payment in comparison with a bank note cannot but have some share in the comparative depreciation of an exchequer bill to be adapted to general circulation an engagement of this sort as to the contents of it ought to be so simple that if possible everybody of a condition high enough to have property to such an amount pass through his hands may be able without effort to apprehend them the engagement taken by the bank—a promise on the part of an individual to pay the sum in question on demand and that to the bearer by whom the instrument of engagement shall be produced—possesses this property in the highest degree of perfection that can be conceived in the instance of the exchequer bill several circumstances concur in keeping down the terms of the engagement considerably below this point of perfection it is to be paid indeed to the bearer—that is if it be paid at all but will it be paid at all this appears to depend upon a variety of contingencies—viz l if aids happen to be granted for the service of the next year then out of the first of such aids but will any such aids be granted this is expressly stated to be a matter of uncertainty—it is stated that perhaps no such aids may be granted before a certain date in the next year—and provision is made accordingly for that contingency that if no such aids be granted that the money is to be paid out of the consolidated fund but if paid out of this consolidated fund when is it to be paid—and by whom these are questions it leaves in utter darkness is it too in other respects a good bill grounds of suspicion and those of the strongest kind present themselves upon the face of it a period is expressed during which it will not be accepted of as such by the very government that issues it it is not to be current or pass in any of the public revenues aids taxes or supplies whatsoever or at the receipt of the exchequer before a certain day in the next year—that is for half a year and upwards before that period then it will not be treated as a good bill—this it expressly says will it afterwards and when of this nothing is said it is left entirely to conjecture nor is this all—another ground of uncertainty and suspicion it does not state how soon it is to be paid but it does state that it is not to be paid till another sum amounting perhaps to several millions has been paid registered and payable after      00 says a bill no       i have before me when is it then that this £     00 will be paid this again is all in darkness to a person acquainted with the mechanism of government all these points are in a state of perfect clearness he knows that with all these apparent difficulties and uncertainties the bill that presents them is at least as good as a bank note but among persons who are not unaccustomed to the simple language of a bank note not one out of a hundred or perhaps a thousand has any such acquaintance with the mechanism of government even the introductory words inserted with the view of indicating the authority on which the bill is issued are of a nature more likely to excite doubt and difficulty in an unlearned mind that is in the mind of the bulk of readers than to command confidence by an act of parliament tricesimo quarto geo iii regis for raising a certain sum of money by loans or exchequer bills for the service of the year      in this formidable mixture of english and latin interlarded with terms of art and the language of finance a man is sent to an act of parliament to know whether the bill will be paid or no and if paid when and how and by whom—the rather as in the bill itself no answer to any of these questions is to be found—and upon his putting a right construction upon a revenue act of parliament—he who perhaps never read an act of parliament in his life and almost certainly if not a lawyer is not in the habit of trusting himself to find out the sense of an act of parliament—depends his knowing whether the bill will or will not be paid and so forth it is a case for him to consult his lawyer upon as he would think it necessary to do upon other acts of parliament where property to much less amount than £ 00 the amount of an exchequer bill was at stake but the occasion does not allow time for consulting a lawyer—and if it did the expense of consulting him would eat a good way into the profit to be made by the interest of which the bill holds out the prospect in addition to the principal that would be promised by a bank note to the same amount the fourth and last of the causes that have been mentioned as appearing to concur in the production of the depreciation in question is the character of the instrument in respect of     its sensible qualities—the size and texture of the paper a bank note is perhaps in respect of these properties as convenient for circulation as can be imagined in point of size and thickness neither so large as to take up an inconvenient quantity of room in the pocket or pocketbook not even when a considerable number are taken together—nor yet on the other hand so small as to be liable to escape notice and be lost while by reason of its extraordinary thinness besides being so much the better guarded against fraudulent alteration which is the principal object it is better adapted to bear folding to reduce it to a size fit for the pocket and pocketbook without cracking at the edges and so coming to pieces in these particulars the difference between the bank note and the exchequer bill is not great—though as far as it goes it is rather to the disadvantage of the exchequer bill in point of size the exchequer bill is much upon a par with the banknote—not quite so long—a little broader these differences are not at all material but the paper is a great deal thicker—rather of a thick and brittle sort than otherwise—so much so as to be in appearance more exposed to crack than any of the papers commonly used as writing papers in the bank note too there is something in the meatness of the engraving and the conspicuous and emphatic display of the sum that cannot but be particularly attractive and fascinating to an ordinary eye in the exchequer bill there is no such display of the sum and the style of the impression of the longwinded explanation of the conditions of payment has nothing particular to recommend it upon these combined causes then it appears most probable that the depreciation of government paper depends and not till they are removed can it be expected that this comparative depreciation will disappear         general view of a complete code of laws by jeremy bentham         general view c chapter i general division a code of laws is like a vast forest the more it is divided the better it is known to render a code of laws complete it is necessary to know all the parts which should be comprised in it it is necessary to know what they are in themselves and what they are in relation to one another this is accomplished when taking the body of the laws in their entirety they may be divided into two parts in such manner that everything which belongs to the integral body may be found comprised in the one or the other part and yet nothing shall at the same time be found in both parts this is the only case in which the division is complete §   customary divisions the customary divisions are— first division   internal law   law of nations—the first is national law which takes its name from the country to which it refers as english law french law c c a detached part of this law which only concerns the inhabitants of a town of a district or of a parish forms a subdivision which is called municipal law the second is that which regulates the mutual transactions between sovereigns and nations this might be called exclusively international law this division is complete but its parts are unequal and slightly distinguished second division   penal law   civil law—when this division is given as complete international law has at least been forgotten third division   penal law   civil law   political law—to distinguish this latter from international law it would be better to call it constitutional law if the second division is complete what must be thought of this its third part must in some shape or other have been comprised in the other two fourth division   civil or temporal law   ecclesiastical or spiritual law—a complete division but unequal and one of which the parts are much intermixed fifth division   civil law   military law—another division apparently limited to internal law this unfortunate epithet civil opposed alternately to the words penal ecclesiastical political military has four different meanings which are incessantly confounded with each other it is one of the most unmeaning protean terms in all jurisprudence sixth division   written law   unwritten or customary law laws may exist in the form of statutes or in the form of customs the statute law is called written positive law custom is a conjectural law which is drawn by induction from the former decisions given by the judges in similar cases seventh division   natural laws   economical laws   political laws to which correspond—the duties devolving upon an individual family duties and the duties of man in society but where does man exist without society—and if there be any such place whence are its laws derived what are these natural laws which nobody has made and which everybody supposes at his fancy what are these economic laws which are not political the making of such divisions may be parodied by distributing zoology into the science of chimeras of horses and of animals such nevertheless is the nomenclature of legislation according to the noblest spirits of the age the dalemberts the diderots and the principal of the economists what then must be the condition of the science they also withdraw from the body of the law considerable portions which do not give rise to the idea of division because the words which respectively express them have no correlative terms to express the residue of the mass of the laws maritime law—law relating to police finance political economy procedure c these portions being extracted what relation have they with the more formal divisions—in which ought they to be placed criminal law is a portion altogether undetermined of penal law it is a law directed against an offence which has been called a crime this distinction is the result of many     indeterminate circumstances odious procedure—enormous evil or reputation of enormity—evil intention—severe punishment canon law this is a sufficiently determinate portion of ecclesiastical law—that portion of this law which is derived from a certain source §   new divisions the divisions which follow are either altogether new—have only received a semidenomination—or have been but little considered at present i announce them in this place because of the light they shed upon the theory of the laws and because of their practical utility eighth division   substantive laws   adjective laws—this last is the name which i give to the laws of procedure for the purpose of designating them by a word correlative to the principal laws from which it will be so often necessary to distinguish them the laws of procedure could neither exist nor even be conceived of without these other laws which they cause to be observed whoever understands the meaning of these two words as applied to grammar will understand the meaning which i would attach to them when applied to jurisprudence ninth division   coercive and punishing laws   attractive or remuneratory laws—the former employ punishments—the second employ rewards as their sanctions tenth division   direct laws   indirect laws—i call those direct which reach their end in the most direct manner by directing or prohibiting the act to which they would give birth or which they would prevent i call those indirect which for accomplishing a purpose employ distant means attaching themselves to other acts which have a more or less immediate connexion with the first prohibition of murder under pain of death is a direct method of preventing assassinations prohibition against carrying offensive weapons an indirect method of preventing them eleventh division   general laws   particular laws—in the first are included those in which everybody is interested—in the second those which are directly interesting only to certain classes this division is of great practical utility in facilitating a knowledge of the laws twelfth division   permanent laws   laws necessarily transitory—there are some laws which die of themselves when the circumstance which gave birth to them has ceased a law which refers to the conduct of a certain individual must die with him among transitory laws the greater number are called regulations such are particular orders laws which must and which ought to be changed and which only correspond with a certain state of things thirteenth division   code of the laws   code of formularies—a formula constitutes a part of the laws when it is directed by the legislature a patent of creation a record a certificate a deed a form of petition may all become part of the law of all these divisions the third into penal law civil law constitutional law is the most complete the most usual and the most convenient it is therefore the centre from which i shall cause all the parts to diverge as to writers on matters of jurisprudence they may be ranged into two classes some treat of the laws of one country explaining commenting upon and reconciling them as heineccius on the roman laws and blackstone with reference to the laws of england the others treat of the art of legislation itself either by explaining its preliminary notions the terms of universal jurisprudence such as powers rights titles contracts obligations crimes c or seeking out the general principles upon which they ought to be founded or examining the legislation of a certain country to show whether it be feeble or strong few works of law are of a unique and distinct character grotius puffendorf burlamaqui assume successively and sometimes at one time all these characters montesquieu in his esprit des lois at first proposed to make a treatise upon the art but in his last books the legislator assumes the antiquarian and the historian and he can only be compared to the river which after having traversed and fertilized noble countries never reaches the sea but is lost in the sand hobbes and harrington who have treated only of the principles of constitutional law have so done in a general manner but with a view to local application beccaria in his treatise on crimes and punishments has attended exclusively to them as a branch of philosophy chapter ii relations between the laws concerning offences rights obligations and services in a code of laws everything turns upon offences rights obligations services clear ideas of the meaning of these abstract terms are therefore desirable and on this account it is necessary to know how these different notions are formed and what are their reciprocal     relations to show their mode of generation is to show their nature a period may be easily imagined when men existed without laws without obligations without crimes without rights what would they then possess persons things actions persons and things the only real beings actions which exist only for a fleeting moment which perish the instant that they are born but which still leave a numerous posterity among these actions some will produce great evils and the experience of these evils will give birth to the first moral and legislative ideas the strongest will desire to stop the course of these mischievous actions—they will call them crimes this declaration of will when clothed with an exterior sign will receive the title of law hence to declare by a law that a certain act is prohibited is to erect such act into a crime to assure to individuals the possession of a certain good is to confer a right upon them to direct men to abstain from all acts which may disturb the enjoyment of certain others is to impose an obligation on them to make them liable to contribute by a certain act to the enjoyment of their fellows is to subject them to a service the ideas of law offence right obligation service are therefore ideas which are born together which exist together and which are inseparably connected these objects are so simultaneous that each of these words may be substituted the one for the other the law directs me to support you—it imposes upon me the obligation of supporting you—it grants you the right of being supported by me—it converts into an offence the negative act by which i omit to support you—it obliges me to render you the service of supporting you the law prohibits me from killing you—it imposes upon me the obligation not to kill you—it grants you the right not to be killed by me—it converts into an offence the positive act of killing you—it requires of me the negative service of abstaining from killing you it is only by creating offences that is to say by erecting certain actions into offences that the law confers rights if it confer a right it is by giving the quality of offences to the different actions by which the enjoyment of this right might be interrupted or opposed the division of rights ought therefore to correspond with the division of offences offences inasmuch as they concern a determinate individual may be distributed into four classes according to the four points in which he may be injured—offences against the person—offences against honour—offences against property—offences against condition in the same manner rights may be distributed into four classes—rights of security for the person—rights of security for honour—rights of security for property—rights of security for condition the distinction between rights and offences is therefore strictly verbal—there is no difference in the ideas it is not possible to form the idea of a right without forming the idea of an offence i imagine to myself the legislator contemplating human actions according to the best of his judgment he prohibits some he directs others there are others which he equally abstains from commanding or prohibiting by the prohibition of the first he creates positive offences by the injunction of the second he creates negative offences but to create a positive offence is to create an obligation not to act—to create a negative offence is to create an obligation to act to create a positive offence is to create a negative service the service which consists in abstaining from a hurtful action to create a negative offence is to create a positive service the service which consists in the performance of a useful action to create offences is therefore to create obligations or forced services to create obligations or forced services is therefore to confer rights with reference to actions with respect to which the legislator neither pronounces a prohibition nor an injunction he neither creates an offence an obligation nor a forced service still he creates a certain right or leaves you a power you already possessed that of acting or not acting as you like if with respect to these same actions there had previously existed an injunction or a prohibition and this injunction or prohibition had been revoked it might be said without difficulty that the right which was restored to you the law conferred or restored it the only difference is that in the one case you hold the right through the activity of the law in the other case you hold it through its inactivity in the actual state it appears as if you owed it to the law alone whilst beforehand you appeared to be indebted partly to the law and partly to nature you owe it to nature inasmuch as it is the exercise of a natural faculty—you owe it to the law inasmuch as it might extend the same prohibition to this as well as to other actions with respect to those actions which the law refrains from directing or prohibiting it bestows a positive right—the right of performing or not performing them without molestation from any one in the use of your liberty i may stand or sit down—i may go in or go out—i may eat or not eat c the law says nothing upon the matter still the right which i exercise in this respect i derive from the law because it is the law which erects into an offence every species of violence by   0 which any one may seek to prevent me from doing what i like this then is the connexion between these legal entities they are only the law considered under different aspects they exist as long as it exists they are born and they die with it there is nothing more simple and mathematical propositions are not more certain this is all that is necessary for obtaining clear ideas of the laws and yet nothing of this is found in any book of jurisprudence the contrary is however everywhere found there have been so many errors of this kind that it may be hoped that the sources of error are exhausted the words rights and obligations have raised those thick vapours which have intercepted the light their origin has been unknown they have been lost in abstractions these words have been the foundations of reasoning as if they had been eternal entities which did not derive their birth from the law but which on the contrary had given birth to it they have never been considered as productions of the will of the legislator but as the productions of a chimerical law—a law of nations—a law of nature i shall only add another word upon the importance of clear ideas respecting the origin of rights and obligations they are the children of the law they ought never therefore to be set in opposition to one another they are the children of the law they should like the law itself be subordinate to general utility the fundamental idea the idea which serves to explain all the others is that of an offence it possesses clearness by itself it presents an image it addresses itself to the senses it is intelligible to the most limited mind an offence is an act from which evil results to do a positive act is to put ones self in motion to do a negative act is to remain still now a body in motion or a body at rest presents an image an individual wounded an individual suffering in consequence of any action presents an equally familiar image it is not the same with the fictitious entities called rights and obligations they cannot be depicted under any form they may however be connected with sensible images but they then cease to be abstractions they are united to real things as in the expressions the right to do a certain act—the obligation to perform it or not to perform it the more nearly such expressions convey the idea of an offence the more easily are they understood chapter iii relation between the penal and civil code if the distinction between the civil and penal code be inquired for the greater number of jurisconsults reply that the civil code contains the descriptions of rights and obligations and the penal code those of crimes and punishments if the meaning of the preceding chapter be clearly understood it will be perceived that there is no foundation for this distinction to create rights and obligations is to create offences to create an offence is to create the right which corresponds therewith it is one and the same law one and the same operation if you say that the right which you have to be supported by me belongs to a certain class of laws which ought to be called civil and that the offence which i commit by neglecting to support you belongs to a different class of laws which ought to be called penal the distinction would be clear and intelligible there exists between these two branches of jurisprudence a most intimate connexion they penetrate each other at all points all these words—rights obligations services offences—which necessarily enter into the civil laws are equally to be found in the penal laws but from considering the same objects in two points of view they have come to be spoken of by two different sets of terms—obligations rights services such are the terms employed in the civil code injunction prohibition offence such are the terms of the penal code to understand the relation between these codes is to be able to translate the one set of terms into the other such being the intimate connexion between these two codes it seems extremely difficult to draw a distinction between them i shall however attempt it a civil law is that which establishes a right a penal law is that which in consequence of the establishment of a right by the civil law directs the punishment in a certain manner of him who violates it thus a law which should confine itself to the interdiction of murder would be a civil law the law which should direct the punishment of death against the murderer would be a penal law the law which converts an act into an offence and the law which directs the punishment of that offence are properly speaking neither the same law nor parts of the same law thou shalt not steal there is the law creating an offence the judge is directed to imprison those that steal there is the law which creates the punishment these laws are so distinct that they refer to different actions—they are addressed to different persons the first does not include the second but the second implicitly includes the first say to the judges you shall punish thieves and a prohibition of stealing is clearly intimated in this point of view the penal code would be sufficient for all purposes but the greater number of laws include     complex terms which can only be understood after many explanations and definitions it is not only necessary to prohibit theft in general it is necessary to define what is property and what is theft it is proper that the legislator should form two catalogues the one containing the events which confer a right to the possession of each thing—the other containing the events which destroy this right these matters of explanation belong principally to the civil code the commanding part contained in penal laws properly constitutes the penal code all laws which have no penal clauses or which only prescribe the obligation of restitution when any one has become possessed of the property of another without evil intention may be placed in the civil code all laws which direct a punishment over and above simple restitution—for example imprisonment forced labour fine c—may be reserved for the penal code in the civil code the attention is chiefly demanded by the description of the offence or of the right in the penal code the prominent point is the punishment each civil law forms a particular head which ought to rest upon a penal law each penal law is the consequence the continuation the termination of a civil law in the two codes there should be general heads they should have for their object the explanation of everything which belongs to the particular titles—definitions amplifications restrictions enumeration of sorts and individuals—in short expositions of all sorts it ought however never to be forgotten that these two codes are one as to their nature and their object that they are divided only for the convenience of distribution and that we might have arranged all the laws upon one plan upon one map if a legislator have given a complete description of all the acts which he is desirous should be regarded as offences he will have formed a complete collection of the laws he has referred everything to the penal code if he have established all the obligations of the citizens all the rights created by those obligations and the circumstances which shall cause those rights to begin and end he will again have formed an entire code but here he will have referred everything to the civil code a code of laws under this point of view ceases to be a bugbear by its immensity we see that there are means of ascertaining its dimensions—of surveying the whole and referring every part to a common centre chapter iv of method in what order should the different parts which compose a complete code of legislation be arranged there are some persons who have occasion to know the whole system of the laws viz those who are charged with their maintenance and application others have occasion only to know the part which concerns them and of which it would be dangerous for them to be ignorant these are the individuals who are bound to obey the laws in the arrangement of the laws that which is best adapted for the generality of the people ought to be regarded the multitude have not leisure for profoundly studying the laws they do not possess the capacity for connecting together distant regulations—they do not understand the technical terms of arbitrary and artificial methods the matter of a code ought therefore to be disposed in the order which will be most easily understood by the least skilful—in the order which is most interesting from the importance of the subjects—in a word in the most natural order but what is the most natural order it is the order according to which the law would be most easily consulted—in which the text which applies to a given case would be most easily found and its true meaning understood the best method is that which gives the greatest facility in finding what is sought rules concerning method   that portion of the laws which most clearly bears the impression of the will of the legislator ought to precede those portions in which his will is shown only indirectly for this reason the penal code ought to precede the civil code and the constitutional code c in the first the legislator exhibits himself to every individual he permits he commands he prohibits he traces for every one the rules of his conduct he uses the language of a father and a master in the other codes he has less to do with commandments than with regulations and explanations which do not so clearly address themselves to everybody and which are not equally interesting to those concerned at every period of their lives   those laws which most directly promote the chief ends of society ought to precede those the utility of which how great soever is not so clearly evident in obedience to this rule the penal code ought still to precede the civil code and the civil to precede the constitutional code there is nothing that tends more directly to promote the great ends of society than the laws which     prescribe the manner in which the citizens should behave towards each other and which prevent them from doing mischief besides since the idea of an offence is fundamental in legislation and everything emanates from it it is the first upon which the public attention should be fixed   the subjects which are most easily understood should precede those of which the conception is less easy in the penal part the laws which protect the person as the clearest of all ought to precede those which protect property after these may successively be placed those which concern reputation those which relate to the legal condition of individuals those which embrace a double object as the person and property the person and reputation c in the civil code those titles which relate to things objects material and palpable should be placed before those which relate to rights objects immaterial and abstract the titles which relate to the rights of property before those which relate to the condition of individuals c in the code of procedure in virtue of this rule the most summary courts would stand first   if in speaking of two objects the first may be spoken of without referring to the second—and on the contrary the knowledge of the second supposes a knowledge of the first—it is right on this account to give priority to the first thus in the penal code offences against individuals should be placed before offences against the public—and offences against the person before offences against the reputation in the civil code notwithstanding another principle of arrangement more apparent but less useful it will be proper to place the condition of master and servant—the condition of guardian and ward before that of father and child—husband and wife because a father and husband are in certain respects the master and in others the guardian of the children and wife in virtue of this rule the penal and civil code ought to precede the code of judicial organization and procedure to institute a process is to demand satisfaction for an offence or to require a service in consequence of a right but the catalogue of offences of services of rights will be found in the penal and civil codes with these therefore we ought to begin procedure is a means for attaining an end it is the method of employing the instrument which is called law to describe the means of using the instrument before describing the instrument itself is an almost inconceivable reversal of order to establish a new system of procedure and allow misshapen laws to subsist is to build upon foundations which are crumbling it is to rebuild a falling house by beginning at the top everything should be consistent and harmonious between the different parts of the code it is impossible to establish a good system of procedure without good laws   those laws the organization of which is complete—that is to say which possess everything necessary to give them effect to put them in execution—ought to precede those of which the organization is necessarily defective a certain part of the political code is necessarily in this latter condition there must be a stop somewhere in the establishment of laws quis custodiet ipsos custodes—the laws which govern the subjects ought to precede those by which it is attempted to restrain the sovereign power the first—the laws for the people in populum—form a complete whole they are accompanied by penalties and a procedure which insures their execution but the laws in imperium respecting the governors unless they change their nature cannot have for their assistance either the one or the other of these auxiliary laws a punishment cannot be assigned for the offences of the sovereign or of the body which exercises the sovereignty no tribunal and no forms can be prepared for their trial—all that human wisdom has been able to devise is reduced to a system of precautions and indirect means rather than a system of legislation the power of removal for example is employed to obviate the corruption of a representative body the nature of the case does not admit of any judicial methods any regular procedure international law is in the same condition a treaty between two nations is an obligation which cannot possess the same force as a contract between two individuals the customs which constitute what is called the law of nations can only be called laws by extending the meaning of the term and by metaphor these are laws the organization of which is still more defective and incomplete than that of political law the happiness of the human race would be fixed if it were possible to raise these two classes of laws to the rank of complete and organized laws the only point which is common to every existing body of laws is that they are all equally strangers to all these rules justinian in the pandects and institutes has followed two independent and incommensurable plans which have determined the plans of all posterior jurists those who have been desirous of correcting justinian have only ventured to correct him by himself heineccius the most sensible of the romanists has sought to refer everything to the order of the pandects and beger has sought to bind up everything to that of the institutes both methods are equally vicious     does not the idea of an offence govern everything in matters of law who would believe it in the vast system of roman law there is not a single entire chapter which treats of offences the whole has been distributed under the three divisions—rights of persons rights of things suits at law offences are incidentally mingled here and there those which are most connected by their nature are often the farthest removed from one another whilst those that are the greatest strangers touch each other modern codes are not more methodical the danish code begins with civil procedure—the swedish code begins with that part of the civil code which regards the condition of persons the code of frederic which bears the pompous title of universal begins with the civil part to which it confines itself and leaves it incomplete the sardinian code presents at first certain penal regulations but the first offences of which it treats refer to religion parts of the civil and constitutional codes follow mingled with each other in continual disorder the code of theresa is purely penal but where does it commence—first blasphemy afterwards apostacy afterwards magic in the first part it treats of procedure blackstone who confined himself to making a picture of the laws of england has only sought commodiously to arrange the technical terms most frequently used in english jurisprudence his plan is arbitrary but it is preferable to all those which have preceded him it is a work of light in comparison with the darkness which previously covered the whole face of the law chapter v plan of the penal code penal laws as we have already seen are those alone which follow in a regular train and form a complete whole what are called civil laws are only detached fragments belonging in common also to the penal laws laws deprived of all factitious sanction exercise so feeble an influence that they ought not to be relied upon if it be possible to do otherwise remuneratory laws beside their weakness are too costly so that it is not possible ever to trust them with the rough work of legislation there remains penal law the only matter of which it is possible to construct the principal portion of the edifice of the laws it is proper therefore to take the penal law which alone embraces all as the foundation of all the other divisions of the law to make a penal law is to create an offence the distribution of the penal laws will therefore be the same as that of offences by determining naming arranging numbering offences we shall have determined named arranged and numbered the penal laws if this arrangement be well made all the other kinds of laws will have been well arranged at the same time order will have been fixed upon a manifest and unalterable foundation the reign of chaos will be at an end i shall begin with the arrangement itself i shall afterwards show the considerations which suggested it and the advantages to be derived from it in order to understand the commentary it is necessary to have seen the text chapter vi of the division of offences upon the principle of utility such acts alone ought to be made offences as may be detrimental to the community an act cannot be detrimental to a community but by being detrimental to some one or more of the individuals that compose it these individuals may either be assignable or unassignable when there is any assignable individual to whom an offence is detrimental that person may be either the delinquent himself or some other person when there are persons to whom the act in question may be detrimental but such persons cannot be individually assigned the circle within which they may be found is either of less extent than the whole state or not if of less the persons comprised within this lesser circle may be considered for this purpose as composing a body of themselves comprised within but distinguishable from the greater body of the whole community from a consideration of these circumstances offences may be divided into four classes—   acts detrimental in the first instance to assignable individuals other than the delinquent himself these are private offences   acts detrimental in the first instance to the delinquent and not to others except in consequence of the evil he has done to himself these may be called for the purpose of contrasting them with the other classes personal offences or selfregarding offences   acts which may be detrimental to certain unassignable individuals comprised within a particular circle less than that of the state—as a trading company a corporation a religious sect these offences against a portion of the community may for the purpose of     contrasting them with the other classes be called semipublic offences   acts which may be detrimental or which threaten a danger more or less remote to an indeterminate number of unassignable individuals without it being apparent that any one is more exposed than another these may be called offences against the state or public offences the four classes of offences are—     private offences     selfregarding offences     semipublic offences     public offences subdivision of offences   subdivision of private offences in the present period of his existence the happiness of a man and his security—in a word his pleasures and his immunity from pains—depend primarily upon the condition of his person and secondly upon the exterior objects which surround him if therefore a man suffer in consequence of an offence it must be either in an immediate manner in his person or in a relative manner by reason of his relation with exterior objects but these exterior objects are things or persons things which he employs for his own advantage in virtue of what is called property persons from whom he derives advantages in virtue of services which they are disposed to render to him this disposition to render those services may be founded simply upon the general connexion which binds all men together or upon a connexion which unites certain individuals more particularly with others these more close connexions form a kind of fictitious and incorporeal object of property which is called condition domestic condition connexion between a parent and child a husband and wife political condition connexion between the citizens of the same place c when the general connexion among all men is alone considered their disposition to render services to one another is called goodwill this goodwill is a favour and the chance of obtaining this favour is a fictitious property which is called honour or reputation reputation is therefore a species of wealth a security for the obtaining those free and gratuitous services which depend upon goodwill it appears therefore that if by any offence an individual becomes a sufferer it must be in one or other of these four points—person reputation property or condition hence simple private offences may be subdivided into— offences against the person offences against the reputation offences against the property offences against the condition offences are called simple when the individual is affected only in one of these points complex when he is affected in more than one at one time as— offences against the person and property offences against the person and reputation order i offences against the person as a man is composed of two different parts—his body and his mind acts which exert a pernicious influence upon him may operate upon him either immediately without affecting his will or mediately through the intervention of that faculty the constraint which may be produced by such acts may be either positive compelling him to do what is disagreeable to him—or negative preventing him from doing what is agreeable to him—the evil resulting from them mortal or not if it be not mortal it will either be reparable or temporary or irreparable or perpetual—again the pain which a man experiences in his mind will either be a pain of actual sufferance or a pain of apprehension hence we have nine genera or kinds of personal injuries which when ranged in the order most commodious for examination will stand as follows—   simple corporal injuries producing uneasiness or temporary suffering   irreparable corporal injuries—species disfiguration mutilation deterioration of an organ as to its essential functions   simple mental injuries that is directly affecting the mind without affecting the body—or vexation   wrongful restraint or hindrance   wrongful constraint   wrongful banishment   wrongful confinement   wrongful imprisonment   wrongful homicide order ii offences against reputation or honour in point of reputation there is but one way of suffering which is by losing a portion of the goodwill of others an individual may be a loser in this respect in either of two ways—  by the manner in which he behaves himself and   by the manner in which     others behave or are thought to behave towards him to cause people to think that a man has been guilty of those acts which cause a man to possess less than he did before of the goodwill of the community is what may be styled defamation when this is done by words or by such actions as have no other effect than inasmuch as they stand in the place of words the offence may be styled vilification but this is not all as a man may be made to lose the goodwill of others he may also be prevented from acquiring it either by the interception of the honour which was his due or by depriving him of the means of obtaining it hence we have four species of offences viz—   defamation   insulting language or insulting gestures   usurpation of the reputation of another   prevention of the acquisition of deserved reputation order iii offences against the person and reputation attacks upon the person and reputation may spring from different motives and may have for their object either the immediate pleasure to be derived from sensual gratification or that sort of reflected pleasure which in certain circumstances may be reaped from the suffering of another if the pleasure to be derived from sensual gratification be obtained by consent freely given if not fairly obtained the offence may be called seduction if not freely it may be called forcible seduction if consent be altogether wanting it is called rape if neither of these offences have been consummated the offence may be included under the denomination of simple lascivious injury when the person and reputation are attacked for the sake of that sort of pleasure which will sometimes result from the contemplation of anothers pain the offence may consist either of actual corporal injury and may be styled corporal insult or it may come under the name of insulting menacement hence we have six generator kinds of offences under this head—   corporal insults   insulting menacement   seduction   forcible seduction   rape   simple lascivious injuries order iv offences against property offences against property are so various that it is extremely difficult to make an analytical table of them which shall not itself form a large work besides these offences have received in common use denominations which are so little determinate and uniform that any definition given of them by a private individual can never be exact it requires the aid of the legislature to fix their meaning offences of this kind may affect either the right to property or the enjoyment or exercise of that right offences which affect the possession of property may relate either to an actual possession or to a future possession a contingent or future possession may be taken away by two kind of offences—  by the omission of an act necessary to be done before the party enters upon his right this may be called noninvestment or noncollation of property   by the commission of some act for the interception of your right—for taking it away for example in its transition from the actual possessor to you the intended possessor this may be called interception of property if the possession of an object of which the party is actually in possession be disturbed by the offence the object of the offence may be his exclusion from the enjoyment of his property without substituting any other person in this case it is simply wrongful divestment or spoliation of property it may be that the object of the offence is that the delinquent may obtain possession of the property himself it is then usurpation of property it may be that he intends that it should pass to a third party it is then wrongful attribution or collation of property with respect to offences against property which only affect the enjoyment of the object in question this object must be either a service or a set of services which should have been rendered by some person or else an article belonging to the class of things in the former case the offence may be styled wrongful withholdment of services in the latter case when any object of which any individual has had the enjoyment ceases so to be enjoyed it may be either from a change in the intrinsic condition of the thing itself or in its exterior situation with respect to such individual which has removed it out of his reach if the change in the nature of the object be such that no further use can be made of it it is destroyed if the change have only diminished its value it is damaged if it be simply removed beyond his reach without alteration it is wrongfully detained the object detained may have been obtained from the proprietor with or without his consent in the first case its detention is the nonpayment of a debt in the second case if the detaining party knowing that he has no right intend to detain it always and at the same time not to be amenable to the law such detention is commonly called theft if he have employed force or threats against the proprietor or other persons who would have prevented his wrongful occupation of the property in this case the offence takes the name of robbery if the consent of the proprietor have been obtained but if he have been deceived by false appearances it is     an act of sharping or fraud if such consent be obtained by the fear of evil resulting from an abuse of power it is what is commonly called extortion the foregoing analysis though imperfect will suffice to explain the principal genera of offences contained in the fourth and fifth order   offences affecting the right of property      wrongful noninvestment of property     wrongful interception of property     wrongful divestment of property     usurpation     wrongful investment of property     wrongful withholding of services   offences affecting the use of property      wrongful destruction or endamagement     wrongful occupation     wrongful detention    0 wrongful imposition of expense      wrongful hindrance of occupation      theft      fraudulent acquisition under false pretences sharping      embezzlement      extortion      nonpayment of debts order v offences against the person and property if constraint be applied to the person of the proprietor in the commission of one of the foregoing offences against property there results from it the following complex offences—     forcible interception of property     forcible divestment of property     forcible usurpation     forcible investment     forcible destruction or endamagement     forcible occupation of moveables     forcible entry     forcible detainment of moveables     forcible detainment of immoveables    0 robbery order vi offences against condition a mans condition in life is constituted by the legal relation he bears to the persons who are about him that is by duties which by being imposed on the one side give birth to rights or powers on the other these relations it is evident may be almost infinitely diversified some means however may be found of circumscribing the field within which the varieties of them are displayed in the first place they must either be such as are capable of displaying themselves within the circle of a private family or such as require a larger space the conditions constituted by the former sort of relations may be styled domestic those constituted by the latter civil domestic conditions are founded upon natural relations or upon relations purely legal in the institution of purely legal conditions the party favoured may be styled a superior and as both parties are members of the same family a domestic superior with reference to the party obliged who in the same case may be styled a domestic inferior with reference to the party favoured these domestic conditions have generally been constituted by powers rather than rights if the power thus vested in the superior be a beneficial one and for his own advantage such superior is called a master and the inferior is called a servant if it be for the sake of the inferior the superior is termed a guardian and the inferior his ward the natural relations founded upon the cohabitation of men and women and upon the fruits of their union have served for a basis upon which to fix their legal relations that is to say the rights and obligations of the husband and wife of the parent and child these rights and obligations are the same as in the preceding cases the husband is in certain respects the guardian and in other respects the master of his wife the parent is in some respects the guardian and in others the master of his children we come now to civil conditions these it may well be imagined may be infinitely various to make a complete enumeration of them would be to enumerate every possible mode by which powers and rights may be established for to be subject to a certain power or to possess a certain right is what constitutes a civil condition this variety or rather this infinity of conditions may however be reduced to three classes—  fiduciary charge   rank   profession a fiduciary charge takes place between two or more interested parties when one of the parties being invested with a power or a right is bound in the exercise of this power and this right by certain rules for the advantage of the other party this relation constitutes two conditions—the trustee and the trustor called in lawyers language cestui que trust rank is often combined with the circumstance of a fiducial trust but there are certain cases in which it can be considered as altogether distinct the rank of knighthood is constituted—how by prohibiting all other persons from performing certain acts the performance of which is the symbol of the order at the same time that the knight in question and his companions are permitted to perform them—for instance to wear a ribbon of a certain colour or in a certain manner—to call himself by a certain title—to use an armorial seal with a certain mark upon it the law creates a benefit for these individuals by subjecting all others to the negative duty of abstaining from these acts the condition of a professional man stands     upon a narrower footing to constitute this condition there needs nothing more than a permission given him on the part of the legislator to perform those acts in the performance of which consists the exercise of his profession to give or sell his advice or assistance in matters of law or of physic—to give or sell his services as employed in the executing or overseeing of a manufacture or piece of work of such or such a sort the permission in the greater number of cases is not even expressly granted—the law merely does not prohibit c but there are cases in which the law whilst it permits certain persons to follow certain trades prohibits those who have not received the same permission this is called in certain circumstances monopoly—in others privileged profession by forbearing to subject you to certain disadvantages to which it subjects an alien the law confers upon you the condition of natural subject—by subjecting him to them it imposes upon him the condition of an alien by conferring on you certain privileges or rights which it denies to a roturier the law confers on you the condition of a gentilhomme—by forbearing to confer on him these privileges it imposes on him the condition of a roturier this analysis which is only a sketch of the subject may serve to explain what is a condition and what offences may be committed against a condition in order fully to analyze all these offences it would be necessary to take each condition separately to enumerate all its benefits or all the charges of which it is composed and to show every method by which it is possible to avoid those charges or to be deprived of those benefits but this process would lead to a great number of repetitions for the avoidance of which it will be more advisable to exhibit the different kinds of offences which are common to all conditions and afterwards the incidental offences peculiar to certain conditions species of offences against condition   wrongful noninvestment of condition   wrongful interception of condition   wrongful usurpation of condition   wrongful investment of condition   wrongful divestment of condition   wrongful abdication of condition   wrongful refusal of condition   wrongful imposition of condition   wrongful disturbance of rights   offences incident to conditions which imply powers     0 abuse of powers      nonrendering of due service      misbehaviour      passive corruption      active corruption      peculation   offences incident to conditions which imply subordination       flight      disobedience      nonrendering of required services   offences incident to the married condition       adultery    0 polygamy second class subdivision of selfregarding offences selfregarding offences are properly speaking errors or acts of imprudence we have already seen in examining the limits which separate morals and legislation that there are strong reasons for not treating these offences in the same manner as offences of the other classes to subject them to punishment would be for the laws themselves to cause a greater evil than those which they would pretend to prevent it is however useful to class these offences—  to show in general what are the offences which ought not to be subject to the severity of the laws   that those offences may be discovered with respect to which exception should be made for particular reasons the subdivision of these offences is exactly the same with that of private offences the evil which we may experience from others we may produce for ourselves genera of personal or selfregarding offences order i offences against the person   simple corporal injuries—ex fasting extreme continence selfmortification intemperance   irreparable corporal injuries—ex mutilations loss of members by negligence or temerity or in consequence of excess   simple mental injuries—ex religious fears arising from other causes than acts hurtful to society ennui from indolence weakness of the intellectual faculties from excess or inaction   restriction  ex privations or ascetic practices in consequence of religious vows   constraint    banishment  ex constrained abode in a religious house in consequence of monastic vows—forced pilgrimage in consequence of religious vows   imprisonment    confinement    suicide—death in consequence of a challenge given or accepted     order ii offences against reputation   indiscreet imprudent confessions   invectives against ones self   neglect of reputation order iii offences against reputation and person   loss of virginity before marriage   indecent practices in sight of another order iv offences against property   waste of his own property   neglect of the means of acquisition   prodigality ex gaming   burthensome acquisition   imprudent agreement order v offences against person and property   mutilation which prevents the exercise of a profitable trade   diseases brought on by intemperance or excess and which are productive of expense and loss order vi offences against condition   investment with a condition injurious to ones self—improvident marriage   divestment of a condition beneficial to ones self—rash divorce third class subdivision of semipublic offences it is neither an evil which is past nor one which is present which can constitute a semipublic offence if the evil were present or past the individuals who had suffered or were suffering from it would be assignable it would become a private offence what then is the evil which constitutes a semipublic offence it is a future evil that is to say an evil not yet realized but which is probable and takes the name of danger this danger may threaten all the points in which an individual can suffer hence the subdivision of offences of this class must be the same with that of private offences order i semipublic offences against the person   simple corporal injuries  ex   manufactures injurious to the health   sale of unwholesome food   artificial famine   irreparable corporal injuries    simple mental injuries—ex exposure of ulcers or disgusting diseases obscene exhibitions false reports of disasters in time of war or other public misfortunes publication of frightful tales of sorceries ghosts vampires c   menaces—placards writings letters containing threats against a certain class profession party sect c c   restriction  ex speeches handbills placards designed to constrain or restrict individuals with regard to actions in themselves left free as illuminations processions assemblies c   constraint    banishment  ex communication interrupted by the destruction of roads bridges inns c   confinement    imprisonment—there is no offence corresponding with this in the third class  0 homicide—ex murder committed in a party quarrel a private offence with regard to the individual a semipublic offence with regard to the party order ii offences against reputation     defamation—ex criminal or dishonest proceedings attributed to certain classes as protestants catholics monks c     invectives—ex speeches writings prints tending to express hatred or contempt against a certain class of individuals without real and clearly ascertained cause order iii offences against person and reputation there are no offences corresponding with this order in this class order iv offences against property the same denominations as for private offences an offence is semipublic—  when the thing or the service which it affects belongs in common to societies of individuals or to the officers of an entire class   when the number of persons hurt or exposed so to be is too great for the individual to be held liable to render a separate account to each one as in the case of a fraudulent lottery false reports affecting the public funds c order v offences against person and property list of physical calamities—   collapsion or fall of large masses of solid matter such as decayed buildings rocks masses of snow and mines   inundation   drought   tempest   conflagration   explosion   earthquake   pestilential winds   contagious maladies  0 famine and other species of dearth    evils produced by destructive animals beasts of prey locusts ants insects c        evils produced by children maniacs idiots c an individual may be guilty of an offence of this kind—  in as far as any imprudent act of his may contribute to give birth to any of these calamities as by breaking quarantine by importing merchandise from infected places c   in as far as he may fail to do what he ought to do towards preventing them such failure may be an offence nb these calamities do not always fall upon the person and property so that these offences do not exactly correspond with those of the fifth order but this is most frequently the case order vi offences against condition offences against the matrimonial condition ex attacking the validity of marriage among persons of a certain class or religious sect as protestants c offences against the parental or filial condition ex attacking the legitimacy of children born in a certain class as protestants c offences against civil conditions are all in one sense semipublic inasmuch as the possession of a certain condition belongs to a certain class fourth class subdivision of public offences the offences by which the public interest may be affected are of very various and complex kinds the following subdivision is incomplete but an attempt to make it complete by following out the exhaustive method would have been too wearisome upon the present occasion one of the great difficulties presented by the subject arises from the fact that many offences of this class have not yet received names and that a recurrence to long and obscure periphrases would therefore be rendered necessary the science of legislation being extremely imperfect the nomenclature cannot be good and with a bad nomenclature it is not possible to make a good distribution order i offences against external security such offences as have a tendency to expose the nation to the attacks of a foreign enemy   treason either negative or positive in favour of foreign enemies   espionage in favour of foreign rivals not yet enemies   injuries to foreigners at large including piracy   injuries to privileged foreigners such as ambassadors order ii offences against justice the direct object of the tribunals ought to be to maintain the laws that is to say to punish those offences which violate them offences against justice are of two sorts— i those which may be committed by the officers of justice in opposition to their duties ii those which may be committed by other persons in opposition to or to mislead the tribunals   improper exercise of judicial office   abuse of judicial power   usurpation of judicial power   collusion syn corruption on the part of judicial officers   peculation by judicial officers   exaction syn extortion on the part of judicial officers   nonrendering of services due to judicial officers   nondenouncing of offences to judicial officers   disobedience to judicial orders  0 contumacy    breach of banishment    prison breach    false oaths syn perjury    rebellion against justice    disturbance of judicial powers    judicial vexation order iii offences against police police is in general a system of precaution either for the prevention of crimes or of calamities it is destined to prevent evils and provide benefits the acts which oppose the police or which oppose the precautions which it institutes form as many offences as there are kinds of precautions but as their nature is varied according to times and circumstances so must the particular enumeration of them be the business of police may be distributed into eight distinct branches—   police for the prevention of offences   police for the prevention of calamities   police for the prevention of endemic diseases   police of charity   police of interior communications   police of public amusements   police for recent intelligence and information   police for registration for preserving the memory of different facts interesting to the public such as births marriages deaths population number of houses situation and qualities of different properties contracts offences procedure c order iv offences against the public force such offences as have a tendency to oppose or mislead the operations of the military force destined for the protection of the state either against its enemies from without or from within which the government could not overcome without an armed force   offences affecting the titles and functions of military officers   0   desertion   offences affecting the several sorts of things appropriated to the purposes of war such as arsenals ammunition military magazines fortifications dockyards ships of war and so forth order v offences against the national wealth the national wealth is the total of the wealth of all the nation those acts which tend to diminish the wealth of individuals tend to diminish the national wealth but what are the specific offences—what are the actions of this kind which ought to be prohibited the science of political economy leads to the conclusion that government ought only to interfere for the protection of individuals in the acquisition and enjoyment of property and seldom to direct as to the manner of acquiring and enjoying the greatest obstacles to the increase of national wealth having almost always been found in those laws which have sought to increase it the most conspicuous offences of this order are—   idleness   prodigality order vi offences against the public treasure such acts as have a tendency to diminish the public revenue by opposing its collection or misdirecting the employment of the funds destined to the service of the state—   nonrendering of services   nonpayment of taxes—smuggling   destruction of the goods of the community roads public buildings c the state considered collectively may have possessions and consequently suffer in these possessions in the same manner as an individual order vii offences against population such offences as tend to diminish the number of members in the community—   emigration   suicide   prevention of births the influence of these things upon population has at all times been nearly imperceptible the amount of population having in nearly all circumstances been found to correspond with the means of subsistence order viii offences against the sovereignty it is hardly possible to describe these offences unless the constitution to which they refer have been previously laid down there are many constitutions in which it is difficult to resolve the question where does sovereign power reside the following is the simplest idea which can be formed of it the collective name of the government is commonly given to the total assemblage of persons charged with the different political functions there is commonly in the state one person or a body of persons which assigns and distributes to the members of the government their departments their functions and their prerogatives—which exercises the legislative power—which directs and superintends the administrative power the person or the body which exercises this supreme power is called the sovereign offences against the sovereignty are those which tend to oppose or mislead the operations of the sovereign those things which cannot be done without opposing or misleading the operations of the different parts of the government   rebellion offensive or defensive   political defamation—political libels   conspiracy against the person of the sovereign or the form of government order ix offences against religion for combating every species of crime which can be committed by man the state has only two great instruments—rewards and punishments—punishments applicable everywhere and on all ordinary occasions—rewards necessarily reserved to a small number of extraordinary occasions the distribution of rewards and punishments is often opposed or misdirected or rendered useless because the state has neither eyes which can see everything nor hands which can attend to everything religion is calculated to supply this deficiency of human power by inculcating upon the minds of men the belief that there is a power engaged in supporting the same ends which is not subject to the same imperfections it represents the supreme invisible being as disposed to maintain the laws of society and to reward and punish according to infallible rules those actions which man has not the means of rewarding and punishing everything which serves to preserve and strengthen in the minds of men this fear of the supreme judge may be comprehended under the general name of religion and for the purpose of clearness of discourse we may often speak of religion as if it were a distinct being an allegorical personage to whom certain functions are attributed hence to diminish or pervert the influence of religion is to diminish or pervert in the same proportion the services which the state might derive from it for the repression of crime or the encouragement of virtue everything which tends to weaken or mislead the operations of this power is an offence against religion     offences which tend to weaken the force of the religious sanction are—   atheism   blasphemy   profanations—syn actions directed against any object of religious worship offences which tend to pervert the employment of the religious sanction may be comprehended under the name of cacotheism and are divisible into three branches—   pernicious dogmas dogmas attributing to the divinity dispositions opposed to the public welfare for example that he has created sources of suffering in greater abundance than sources of pleasure dogmas imposing misseated excessive or useless punishments suborning dogmas which grant pardon where punishment has been deserved and which offer rewards for actions which deserve none c   frivolous dogmas dogmas which respect belief alone and from which no moral good is derivable and from which many ill effects result between those who admit and those who reject them   absurd dogmas another means of attributing malevolence to the divinity making him the author of an obscure and unintelligible system of religion cacotheism has been productive of atrocious crimes it has degraded the populace persecuted the wise and filled the minds of men with vain terrors has forbidden the most innocent pleasures and is the most dangerous enemy of correct morals and legislation punishments directed against the propagators of these errors would be well deserved for the evil which results from these errors is real but such punishments would be inefficacious superfluous and illadapted there is but one antidote to these poisons—that is truth these dogmas once exposed as false cease to be pernicious and are only ridiculous the opinion which supports them ought to be attacked like every other opinion it is not the sword which destroys errors but the liberty of examining them persecution for opinions sake exhibits the monstrous union of folly and tyranny the same things must be admitted with respect to atheism though atheism may be an evil in comparison with a system of religion conformable to the principle of utility consoling the unhappy and propitious to virtue yet it is not necessary to punish atheism the moral sanction is sufficient for its condemnation an opinion only is here stated but the proofs of that opinion will be produced elsewhere chapter vii advantages of this classification omitting others of minor importance the following appear to be the principal advantages of this classification—   it is the most natural that is to say the most easy to be understood and remembered in what does a natural classification consist in reference to a given individual it is that which first presents itself to his mind and which he comprehends with the greatest facility hence when an individual invents a classification for himself it appears and is in respect to himself the most natural one but with reference to men in general the most natural classification is that which presents objects to them according to their most striking and interesting qualities now there is nothing more interesting or striking to a sensible being than human actions considered in reference to the mischief which may result from them to himself or others   this classification is simple and uniform notwithstanding the multiplicity of its parts because they are all analogous one following the other allowing the bonds which connect them and their points of contact and resemblance to be perceived at the first glance to know the first class is to know the second and the third the fourth rests upon the same foundation though the points of connexion are less apparent than in the others if the offences of the first three classes were not mischievous those of the last would not be so either   this classification is best adapted for discourse best adapted for announcing the truths connected with the subject in every species of knowledge disorder in language is at once the effect and the cause of ignorance and error nomenclature can only be perfected in proportion as truth is discovered it is impossible to speak correctly unless we think correctly and it is impossible to think correctly whilst words are employed for registering our ideas which words are so constituted that it is not possible to form them into propositions which shall not be false       this classification is complete there is no imaginable law to which it is not possible by its means to assign its proper place if this law be directed against an action mischievous in any kind of manner whatsoever if it be a capricious law—a mischievous law it will also have its place but it will be among acts which are mischievous—it will be itself classed among offences   it displays intention it is so contrived that the very place which any offence is made to occupy suggests the reason of its being put there it serves to indicate not only that such and such acts are made offences but why they ought to be so by this means while it addresses itself to the understanding it recommends itself in some measure to the affections by the intimation it gives of the nature and tendency of each obnoxious act it accounts for and in some measure vindicates the treatment which it may be thought proper to bestow upon that act in a way of punishment to the subject then it is a kind of perpetual apology showing the necessity of every defalcation which for the security and prosperity of each individual it is requisite to make from the liberty of every other to the legislator it is a kind of perpetual lesson serving at once as a corrective of his prejudices and as a check upon his passions is there a mischief which has escaped him—in a natural arrangement if at the sametime an exhaustive one he cannot fail to find it is he ever tempted to force innocence within the pale of guilt—the difficulty of finding a place for it advertises him of his error an imaginary crime cannot escape among a crowd—it cannot be classed under such a methodical arrangement such are the uses of a map of universal delinquency laid down upon the principle of utility—such the advantages which the legislator as well as the subject may derive from it abide by it and everything which is arbitrary in legislation vanishes an evilintentioned or prejudiced legislator durst not look it in the face he would proscribe it and with reason it would be a satire upon his laws   this classification is universal governed as it is by a principle which is recognised by all men it will serve alike for the jurisprudence of all nations in a system of law framed in pursuance of such a method the language would serve as a glossary by which all systems of positive law might be explained while the matter would serve as a standard by which they might be tried thus illustrated the practice of every nation might be a lesson to every other and mankind might carry on a mutual intercourse of experiences and improvements as easily in this as in every other walk of science it might thus possess a utility independent of the use which might be made of it by the governments of the world if the different penal laws in the world were arranged according to this method all their imperfections would become visible without argument respecting them they would be discovered by inspection here would be offences omitted there imaginary offences here redundant laws containing numerous descriptions of different kinds of theft or personal offences c instead of one general law this classification would therefore prove in legislative science what instruments of comparison such as the barometer and thermometer have been found in physical science i must however recur to the principal advantage of this classification under it all offences of the same class are ranged under the same head in virtue of some common quality which unites and characterizes them offences which compose one class have therefore among them like properties and they have at the same time properties differing from those of offences of a different class it hence results that it is possible to apply general propositions to each of such classes which may serve as the characteristics of such classes a collection of these characters it may here be proper to exhibit the greater number of them we can bring together the more clearly and fully will the nature of the several classes and of the offences of which they are composed be understood characters of class  —composed of private offences or offences against assignable individuals—   when arrived at their last stage the stage of consummation they produce all of them a mischief of the first as well as of the second order   the individuals whom they affect in the first instance are constantly assignable this extends to all—to attempts and preparations as well as to such offences as have arrived at the stage of consummation   they will admit of compensation   they admit† also of retaliation       there is always some person who has a natural and peculiar interest to prosecute them   the mischief they produce is obvious   they are everywhere and must ever be obnoxious to the censure of the world   they are less apt than semipublic and public offences to require different descriptions in different states and countries   by certain circumstances of aggravation they are liable to be transformed into semipublic and by certain others into public offences  0 in slight cases compensation given to the individual affected by them may be a sufficient ground for remitting punishment for if the primary mischief has not been sufficient to produce any alarm the whole of the mischief may be cured by compensation characters of class  —consisting of selfregarding offences—offences against ones self—   in individual instances it will often be questionable whether they are productive of any primary mischief at all secondary they produce none   they do not affect any other individuals assignable or not assignable except in as far as they affect the offender himself unless by possibility in particular cases and in a very slight and distant manner they affect the whole state   they admit not therefore of compensation   nor of retaliation   no person has naturally any peculiar interest to prosecute them except in as far as in virtue of some connexion he may have with the offender either in point of sympathy or interest a mischief of the derivative kind may happen to devolve upon him   the mischief they produce is apt to be unobvious and in general more questionable than that of any of the other classes   they are however apt many of them to be more obnoxious to the censure of the world than public offences owing to the influence of the two false principles of ascetism and antipathy   they are less apt than offences of any other class to require different descriptions in different states and countries   among the inducements to punish them antipathy against the offender is apt to have a greater share than sympathy for the public  0 the best plea for punishing them is founded on a faint probability there may be of their being productive of a mischief which if real will place them in the class of public offences chiefly in those divisions which are composed of offences against population and offences against the national wealth characters of class  —composed of semipublic offences or offences affecting a whole subordinate class of persons—   as such they produce no primary mischief the mischief they produce consists of one or other or both branches of the secondary mischief produced by offences against individuals without the primary   the persons whom they affect in the first instance are not individually assignable   offences of this class are apt however to involve or terminate in some primary mischief of the first order which when they do they advance into the first class and become private offences   they admit not of compensation   nor of retaliation   there is never any one particular individual whose exclusive interest it is to prosecute them a circle of persons may however always be marked out within which may be found some who have greater interest to prosecute than any who are out of that circle have   the mischief they produce is in general pretty obvious but less so than that of private offences   they are rather less obnoxious to the censure of the world than private offences   they are more apt than private and selfregarding offences to require different descriptions in different countries but less so than public ones  0 there may be ground for punishing them before they have been proved to have occasioned or to be about to occasion mischief to any particular individual the extent of the evil makes up for the uncertainty of it    in no cases can satisfaction given to any particular individual affected by them be a sufficient ground for remitting punishment for by such satisfaction it is but a part of the mischief of them that is cured characters of class  —consisting of public offences or offences against the state in general—   as such they produce not any primary mischief and the secondary mischief they produce which consists frequently of danger without alarm though great in value is in specie very indeterminate   the individuals whom they affect in the first instance are constantly unassignable except in so far as by accident they happen to involve or terminate in offences against individuals   they admit not of compensation   nor of retaliation       nor is there any person who has naturally any particular interest to prosecute them except in as far as they appear to affect the power or in some other manner the private interest of some person in authority   the mischief they produce is comparatively unobvious   they are comparatively little obnoxious to the censure of the world   they are more apt than any of the other classes to admit of different descriptions in different states and countries   they are constituted in many cases by some circumstances of aggravation superadded to a private offence they are however even in such cases properly ranked as public offences inasmuch as the mischief they produce in virtue of the properties which aggregate them to that class eclipses and swallows up those which they produce in virtue of those properties which aggregate them to the first class  0 and    these characters are the same as in the case of semipublic offences chapter viii titles of the penal code these may be distinguished into particular and general titles each head of offence constitutes a particular title those are called general titles under which matters which belong in common to a great part of the particular titles are contained the first advantage is—repetitions avoided the second advantage—views extended and confirmed the following is the catalogue of the general titles which ought to be treated of in the penal code—   of persons subject to the law   of negative and positive offences   of principal and accessory offences   of codelinquents—that is associates in committing crimes   of grounds of justification   of grounds of aggravation   of grounds of extenuation   of grounds of exemption   of punishments  0 of indemnification and other satisfactions to the party injured with respect to the particular titles they are all formed upon the same model if the first is known all the others are known also here follows an example— title i of simple corporal injuries section i principal text there is simple corporal injury when without lawful causea an individual has causedb or contributed to cause to anotherc suffering or corporal uneasinessd which is not followed by any ulteriore corporal evil section ii means of putting an end to the offence it is here that the following matters should     be placed that reference may be made to them—   right or power of resistance against an unjust attack   right or power and obligation to lend assistance to another against an unjust attack   right power and obligation to the officers of police to lend assistance   right and obligation for individuals to call for the assistance of the officers of police to cause an unjust attack to cease punishments—  fine h at option i and discretion k which shall not exceed the—th l part m of the property of the delinquent   imprisonment n at option and discretion which shall not exceed the term for example of one year o   security for good conduct p at option and discretion   in serious cases q banishment from the presence r of the injured party for a time or for ever   costs of suit at option and discretion as many letters so many references to different sections of the general title of punishments there for example would be explained the expressions at option and discretion at option is a concise phrase for expressing that it is lawful for the judge to employ or not to employ this punishment at discretion signifies that the judge ought to employ a certain quantity of this punishment but that he may employ so much or so little as he may judge proper provided that he keep within the limits prescribed by the general rules under the title of punishments indemnifications—as to what regards indemnifications reference may be made to the general title which treats of them reserving the details of those particular dispositions which may be judged convenient for this place it is here that reference may be made to procedure procedure ad compescendum which consists in putting an end to an offence can have no place here unless the crime be complicated with one of those which attack the liberty of the person procedure ad puniendum et ad satisfaciendum are the two branches of which the application is the most universal especially the first whilst as to procedure ad præveniendum reference should be made to the general title of punishments which treats of security to be required for good conduct reference to the title grounds of exemption reference to the title grounds of aggravation i place—  the grounds of aggravation which do not cause the offence to be referred to another name   those which add to it the qualities designated by some appellation of the same class   those which transfer it to the class of semipublic offences   those which transfer it to the class of public offences reference to the grounds of extenuation if there be in an offence any circumstance of aggravation the quantity of the ordinary punishment may be in consequence increased or an ulterior punishment of a different kind may be permitted this new punishment may be called by the technical name of extra punishment in the same manner in the case of extenuation there might be established an infra punishment another example—in order to continue to give an idea of the plan let us take an example from among offences which relate to property here a new order of things presents itself that which has been considered appeared only to relate to what is penal—the following article will recal the idea of the civil code we must not however forget that an offence is still under consideration i choose waste as presenting the most simple case principal text there is injurious waste when without lawful causea an individual destroys or contributesc to destroy or injured a thinge of some valuef in order to simplify the case i leave out that part which concerns evil intention—hence in the supposition the hurtful act only draws the quality which renders it punishable from some inadvertency or some error in what respects the right     it is of no consequence whether the value be constant or occasional provided at the time of its destruction it possessed an actual value or would have had it in future as if it were a fence which preserved a plantation or a bank of earth raised for a momentary service in following out the plan the meaning of the word value would be explained in such manner that it will not be doubtful whether it extends to a value which does not exist except by reference to a certain place as a boundary to that which arises only from agreement as a paper which contains a contract to that which is only representative that is to say which is nothing except as a means of procuring a thing whose value is intrinsic to that which is nothing except in relation to the public—as a writing proving that a certain individual is subjected for the public good to a certain obligation of some value the value of a thing may be reputed as nothing when it is such that it may be presumed that a person of any humanity or politeness would voluntarily give it up to whosoever would take the trouble to ask for it and to take it for example the gleaning after the harvest the wild fruits the hedge nuts c but to destroy this presumption any act on the part of the proprietor which shows that he intends to refuse this permission either to the public at large or to any individual in particular is sufficient such is the plan the other sections should correspond with these chapter ix first general title of the civil code of things we begin with things robinson crusoe is represented as living many years without exercising his power over persons he could not have been so long without exercising his power over things the species into which things may be divided are innumerable and there is not one of them which may not fall under the cognizance of the law since all the productions of art all the objects in nature are comprised within its domain if it were necessary to mention each separately the encyclopædia itself would only form one chapter of legislation but in this immensity we have occasion only to notice those things respecting which the law has established differences in the manner of acting with regard to them—those things which have served it as a foundation upon which to build obligations and rights by means of certain general divisions we shall be able easily to govern this vast subject we shall arrange them according to their source their employment and their nature division i things are either natural or artificial—to the first head may be referred those things to which their respective names may be applied when in the condition in which they come from the hands of nature before they have been modified by the labour of man that is to say the earth its different parts and the productions to which it gives birth under the name of artificial or factitious those may be comprehended which only acquire their respective names in virtue of qualities given them by human labour hence a field though cultivated—a vine though planted—even a live hedge would be natural things a house a winepress a dead hedge would be artificial things these two classes will meet in an infinity of points and there is no fixed line of demarcation by which to separate them still a line of demarcation will be absolutely necessary in a code of laws it is necessary to have one among those objects with which the law intermeddles for the sake of peace without it disputes would be interminable the line will be more or less arbitrary but this is of no consequence provided that it exist division ii things moveable and things immoveable—another positive line of demarcation houses are generally immoveable but they have been made of wood and of iron and have traversed along the roads† like the scythians of old the tartars of our days are only lodged in this manner ships are houses some ships are little floating towns mountains and hills sometimes slip down large tracts of land have changed their sites such events are common in volcanic countries to these ravages of nature the scourge of chicanery too often succeeds and sits down among the ruins to dispute their possession division iii things employable and things consumable—the first may be used without changing their form—the second cannot be used without being destroyed to the first head may be referred houses vessels c—to the second eatables and drinkables c the latter are the things fungible of the roman law take another step and we shall find ourselves stopt short for want of a line of demarcation this wood which may serve either for building a house or warming an     oven this ox which may draw a plough or which may be driven to the butchers are these things or are they not things fungible all nature is one continual round of revolutions everything which she employs she consumes everything which she destroys under one form she reproduces under another the distinction between these two conditions though sufficiently clear in certain objects is too slight in the general system of things to be of great utility division iv things which are individually valuable and things which are valuable in mass—to the first head may without difficulty be referred houses furniture clothes to the latter metal in the rough state seeds c this distinction is still very uncertain and does not proceed far before it produces confusion useful in some cases it would be useless in a multitude of others many things may be valued indifferently in both manners the legislator in tracing these divisions would require a logician at his side but surveyors are required for land the surveying of ideas is an operation not less necessary and more difficult division v this is one which the roman lawyers have not dreamed of and which is worth all the others since they have classed animals among things they ought to have distinguished things into two classes—sensible and insensible the brazen cow of myron was in their eyes of the same class as the living cow which he employed as his model but how should they have distinguished the inferior animals from things—they among whom man himself when he had the misfortune to fall into a state of slavery was no more than a thing and who shall say how much the condition of animals and slaves was aggravated by this cold and cruel classification the law which ought to have protected them began by giving an idea of them which degraded them it spoke of them as if it would extinguish in every heart every feeling of tenderness for them—as if it would make us forget that there was any point of community between us error for error—i would rather love the folly which adored the brutes than the cruelty which ill treated them yes i would rather pardon the hideous caprices which fable paints of pasiphae than those frightful bull fights of which the art consists in carrying the suffering and the rage of the expiring animal to the highest point for the amusement of the barbarous spectators division vi simple things or individuals—complex things or collections of things—among complex things those should be distinguished which are naturally complex from those which are so from institution a complex thing may either be a collection of simple things equally principals or a thing which is regarded as principal united to others which are regarded as accessaries a heap of corn is a collection of things equally principal a field with certain plants and buildings is a collection of things where some are principals and some accessaries the bond which unites them is natural but an inheritance of which the objects are scattered—a stock in trade—the respective fortunes of two persons who intermarry—these are examples of complex things which are connected only by a bond of institution such as the identity of the proprietor and the disposition of the law questions to be decided—in case of dispute which is the principal thing—which are the accessaries in what cases ought the disposition made with respect to the one to comprehend the others this depends upon contracts it would therefore require a reference to this title what shall we say of the famous division among the romanists of things corporeal and things incorporeal that is to say of things which do not exist which are not things it is a fiction which only serves to hide and to augment the confusion of ideas all these incorporeal things are only rights either to the services of men or of real things this will be shown in treating of rights if a thing interest sufficiently to become the object of a law it is only as it possesses a certain value now this value is susceptible of many modifications which require to be marked out ought these modifications to be treated of under a general title or should they be reserved for the particular titles of the offences which affect them—as for example for that of waste this is a question which can scarcely be resolved until all parts of the code have been considered everything which exists exists in a certain quantity and the quality being given the value of the thing will be in proportion to that quantity to express these quantities measures are required these measures express either the quantity of the matter or the space which it occupies they are weights or measures of extent hence we see that definitions of the measures of every kind and the regulation of their proportions ought to form a general title and is necessary to complete a code of laws there is difficulty not only in distinguishing species there is sometimes much difficulty in distinguishing individuals individuation—if we may coin this term this is one of the first cases which should occupy a legislator under each particular title which demands it a house is let but what ought to be comprehended under this term does it comprehend the tapestry the locks the brewing tubs the cisterns what is to be understood by a square acre does it extend     without limits into the interior of the earth and above the surface c the roman lawyers who have talked so much about things have never arrived at clear ideas upon this subject things says justinian are either out of the patrimony of individuals or belonging to this patrimony they are either by divine law or by human law things by divine law are also either sacred or religious or holy things by human law are either belonging to individuals separately or belonging to all the community indistinctly that is to say private or common here there are distinctions in form but there is a great show and little accomplished it might be imagined that the legislator was about to give specific names to all the things which composed these classes but we should be deceived he has carefully avoided this labour he has abandoned it to the disputes of the lawyers—i the legislator know not how to explain my will to you it is your duty who must obey me to divine my meaning what would be said to a master who should explain his orders in so confused and vague a manner to his inferiors who should speak to them of things in general without speaking to them of things specific and individual and who should punish them for not having known how to comprehend what he has not known how to express the history of nebuchadnezzar is a noble apologue for legislators he ordered the wise men to be slain because they did not divine his dreams how many makers of laws have done the same without like him being turned out among the beasts chapter x second general title of the civil code of places both men and things only exist in a certain place the circumstance of place will therefore be often necessary in the law for determining both men and things—sometimes for fixing the species and sometimes the individual there is no method more exact or more universal for determining an individual for defining him than saying that at a certain time he occupied a certain portion of space what is the situation what the extent of the territory which the law comprises within its empire—what are its physical divisions by what points do the lines pass which separate the land and the sea the same questions with regard to mountains lakes forests canals what limits do the atmospheric and subterranean regions oppose to the power of the sovereign and the right of the proprietor what are the political divisions and subdivisions it would be proper to place under this title the map and the catalogue of all these divisions according to all the sources from which they are derived if there are differences as establishments judicial military fiscal religious c as many particular catalogues would be required for marking all the privileged places as markettowns fairs seats of justice colleges universities c in conclusion it is under this title that the system of divisions which the law adopts for the large geographical measures should be arranged—leagues miles c chapter xi third general title of the civil code of times to the fixation of place it is necessary to add the fixation of times in the last resort it is only by the combined consideration of place and time—of the place in which he is found at a certain time—that one individual can be distinguished from every other under this general title the law ought to expound what it intends should be understood by the names which express the different portions of time—second minute hour day month year c the months after a certain number of which reckoned from the death or absence of the presumptive father a child shall not be deemed to be legitimate—are they those of the sun or the moon or the fantastical months of the calendar which are neither the one nor the other the particular cases would be found under the particular titles of bastards or of fathers but it would be requisite that the explanation of the times should be found under a general title to which reference might be made when necessary in cases in which months might cause doubts it would be better to employ days feasts—fasts—lent—inasmuch as these things were the subjects of legislation would find a place under this title thus the calendar was inserted in an act of parliament when the new style was adopted in england these two titles designed to establish fixed points to which individuals might be moored in the two oceans of time and space ought to be found in every code and will most probably be found in none hence the multitude of disputes of uncertainties of opportunities for chicane arising from the fluctuations     of usage among the different systems which different customs have introduced uniformity in the measurement of time as well as in the measures of weight and quantity is still the wish of philosophy but it has not yet been accomplished chapter xii fourth general title of the civil code of services from things we pass to man considered as the subject of property he may be regarded under two aspects as capable of receiving the favours of the law—and as capable of being subjected to its obligations the idea of services is anterior to that of obligations services may be rendered without being obligatory they existed before the establishment of laws—they were the only bond of society among men before they had any form of government parents nourished their children before the laws had made it their duty there are still many services of benevolence politeness and mutual interest which are rendered freely the law may extend its domain further and create new obligations but there will also be a multitude of cases beyond the reach of the law which voluntary services alone can supply—and happily the principle of sociality which preceded the law continues to supply its deficiencies   the first division of services may be referred to that of the faculties which give birth to them so many faculties so many classes of services we may distinguish in man two sorts of faculties—active and passive it is in virtue of the former that he can act or not act—that he can perform a certain act or abstain from performing it the passive faculty may be distinguished into two branches—the one purely physical the other sensible as however man may be sensible either of good or evil—may experience agreeable or painful sensations—the sensible faculty may be again subdivided into the sensible faculties of suffering and enjoyment from hence arise four classes of services—   services agendi positive services of the active faculty for example—to succour a man who is drowning—to bear arms for ones country—to arrest a criminal c as many negative offences so many examples of this class to create a negative offence is to impose the obligation of rendering the positive service which corresponds with it   services nonagendi negative services of the active faculty for example not to commit theft not to commit assassination c as many positive offences so many examples of this species of service to create a positive offence is to impose the obligation of rendering the negative service which corresponds with it   services patiendi physicè services of the purely passive faculty in this respect the inert human body is not worth much as an example of this might be mentioned conjugal condescendence on the part of the wife and cases might be cited in which dead soldiers have served to fill up ditches that their comrades wished to cross dead bodies made use of for the purposes of anatomy form a more important example the english law makes this service an addition to the punishment of murderers† their bodies were delivered to the surgeons to be dissected this service might be termed medical experience derived from the bodies of men condemned to death   services patiendi sensibiliter services of the passive but sensible faculty whether for good or evil legal punishments are services imposed upon those who undergo them for the good of society thus the punishment of a criminal is spoken of as a debt which he has paid legal rewards are services granted to those who receive them for their own advantage—and for that of society when there results from them a general satisfaction and an encouragement to useful actions as man possesses a sensibility in common with those whom he loves he may receive in their persons either good or evil services the good which is done to him is a service done to his friends also the evil which is done to him is a service done to his enemies has he injured any one to punish him is to serve the party injured ii another source of division according to the object to which the service applies—persons or things—   services respecting the person   services respecting the reputation   services respecting the property   services respecting the condition one branch of service in personam is service in animam for example the service of the protestant priest who teaches me to avoid damnation—of the catholic priest who would draw me out of purgatory by his masses whatever may be their power in the other world they serve to tranquillize my mind in this this is a service of which an athiest himself cannot deny the reality if i am troubled with an imaginary malady which torments me the physician who should calm its agonies would render me a service iii another source of division according   0 to the acting part in the person who renders the service— corporal services the man who labours in my field mental services the man who instructs me in the abstract sciences c it may be said that this distinction was not familiar to our ancestors who saw only the same person in the barber who shaved them and the surgeon who delivered them from the stone iv another source of division the party employed—another individual—ones self—a limited class of persons—the whole state this division corresponds with that of private selfregarding semipublic and public offences as many classes of offences so many classes of services v another division services which arise out of established rights we have said that services must have existed before the establishment of rights but rights once established give rise to new services consisting in the exercise in favour of some one of these same rights i transfer to a farmer the right to occupy my land for his profit he pays me what he owes me for the rent of my land here are two kinds of services which could only exist subsequent to the birth of rights this theory of services is new the idea of it is familiar to all the world but it is such a stranger to jurisprudence that jurists have no nomenclature for it they have considered it as a consequence of obligation instead of which it is anterior to obligation itself it is true that for the purpose of acquiring all the force and all the extent which it ought to have the service must rest upon obligation it is too feeble a plant to support itself to produce its fruits it must be supported it is like the vine which clings around the elm but i have thought proper so much the rather to adopt this title of service into the law as it has so to speak a more natural and apparent affinity with the principle of utility than the others from whatever side service is regarded its end is at once seen it seems to say respice finem this word by itself is a continual lesson to the legislator it is logic wearing the livery of morality—it is law by its language recalling the idea that every obligation ought to bear the character of a benefit table of the division of services first division—according to the faculties which give birth to them—   services agendi consisting in doing   services nonagendi consisting in abstaining from doing   services patiendi physicè passive and not sensible   services patiendi sensibiliter passive and sensible second division—according to the object to which the service applies— services relative to the person for the body for the mind the reputation  the property  the condition  third division—according to the part which acts in the person who serves— services ex corpore rendered by the body ex mente rendered by the mind fourth division—according to the party served— services private selfregarding semipublic public fifth division—according to the period of their birth— services anterior to rights—free and gratuitous service posterior to rights—obligatory service collative in addition to rights that is to say consisting in establishing an individual in his rights chapter xiii fifth general title of the civil code of obligations in the textual systems of legislation and the treatises of jurisprudence the idea of obligation is too often independent of the idea of service jurists in general have not known what foundation to give to obligation if you inquire what is its principle you will find the clouds thicken around you they will talk to you of the divine will—of the law of nature of conscience of quasi contract they will talk of everything except service—the only clear the only reasonable notion—the only notion which can serve as a limit and a guide in the establishment of obligations the most correct definition which can be given of a bad law is this a bad law is that which imposes an obligation without rendering any service examine all religious and civil codes by this rule and you will at once detect all those laws which according to the principle of utility ought to be placed in the index expurgatorius in all bad religions—in those which have done more evil as bugbears than they have done good as restraints—to what purpose have their sacrifices their privations their penances their restraints served has there resulted from them happiness to god or to man in a good system of religion it is always     on account of the service which results that obligation is established there will always be an innumerable multitude of free and gratuitous services but there ought never to exist any obligation which is not founded upon a service received or to be received as many faculties as man possesses so many species of service may he render—so many species of obligation may therefore be established as to what regards the active faculty where service is spoken of say serviceable acts to render a service is to exercise a serviceable act the idea of an obligation then supposes such an act obligation of rendering such a service is the obligation of exercising such a serviceable act it is therefore clear that the notion of obligations is posterior to the notion of services to be subject to a certain obligation is to be the individual or one of those whom the law directs to perform a certain act there is no longer any mystery the word obligation may be employed in an abstract sense it may for the convenience of discourse be spoken of as a fictitious entity but it ought to be possible to decipher such language into the language of pure and simple truth—into that of fact to understand abstract terms is to know how to translate figurative language into language without figure for whom ought an obligation to be profitable it may either be for the person obliged or for another but in every case the principle of utility requires that the evil of the obligation whatever it be should be compensated by the good of the service the evil of an obligation seems carried to its highest point in the case of an individual condemned to an ignominious painful death in virtue of a penal law i do not examine here if this terrible obligation be indispensable but in supposing it so for example when directed against atrocious murderers it is evident that society believes that it purchases by the loss of a dangerous individual the security of many innocent persons chapter xiv sixth general title of the civil code of rights it is by imposing obligations or by abstaining from imposing them that rights are established or granted obligations may be imposed from which no rights shall result—for example ascetic obligations which are useful neither to the party bound nor to others—but it is not possible to create rights which are not founded upon obligations how can a right of property in land be conferred on me it is by imposing upon everybody else the obligation of not touching its productions c c how can i possess the right of going into all the streets of a city it is because there exists no obligation which hinders me and because everybody is bound by an obligation not to hinder me when we have examined all rights separately some will be found to owe their existence to the existence of obligations—the others to the nonexistence of the same obligations all rights rest therefore upon the idea of obligation as their necessary foundation in order to speak clearly of rights it is necessary in the first place to distinguish them according to their kinds the following are the principal divisions—first division drawn from the diversity of their source—  rights existing from the absence of obligation   rights established by obligation this is a fundamental distinction rights resulting from obligations imposed by the laws have for their base coercive laws rights resulting from the absence of obligation have for their base permissive laws second division drawn from the diversity of their objects rights may be established—  for the maintenance of property   for general safety   for personal liberty   for general tranquillity the union of safety with security so many distinct ends so many classes of rights third division drawn from the subjects upon which they are exercised—  rights over things   rights over persons—over the services of persons rights over persons may either refer solely to the person or to things and persons under this last head would be found the right of interdiction with respect to things—the right of interdicting to one or all the occupation of anything or a certain use of it this is a right to a negative service—it constitutes exclusive property right solely referring to the person has two branches—  immediate right over the person in corpus as conjugal right—the right of parental correction—the right of an officer of justice to seize an individual to execute a legal sentence c   immediate right over the person in animam consisting of the means of influencing the will as the right of locating in an advantageous place—the right of dislocation—right of rewarding—right of making a will—right of directing public or private instruction c c†     fourth division drawn from the extent of the right that is to say of the number of persons who are subject to it—  private rights   political rights fifth division drawn from the persons in favour of whom the right is established—  personal rights—those which are exercised for the benefit of him who possesses them   fiduciary rights—those which are possessed to be exercised for the advantage of another only such as those of factor attorney guardian father or husband in quality of guardian all political power is fiduciary fiduciary rights are the same in nature as personal rights combined with certain obligations sixth division drawn from the divisibility of rights—  integral rights   fractional rights   concatenated rights what i call integral right is the most unlimited—the entire right of property it includes four particulars—   right of occupation   right of excluding others   right of disposition or the right of transferring the integral right to other persons   right of transmission in virtue of which the integral right is often transmitted after the death of the proprietor without any disposition on his part to those in whose possession he would have wished to place it there is not one of these rights which in a system founded upon the principle of utility ought not to have its limits the first would be limited by the obligation of using without injury to another the second by the obligation of permitting its use upon urgent occasion for the benefit of another all these rights may also receive different restrictions for special reasons of utility hence the proprietor of a distillery may be subject to regulations which shall have for their object the collection of the revenue c these exceptions deducted what remains is the quantity of integral right rights of less extent than the integral right may be considered as fractions and called fractional when the whole right is possessed one is said to have the property of the thing is less than this possessed one is said to have a right—a right to be exercised over the material thing for example a right of chase a right of way a right to services concatenated rights are those which are not founded on absolute but on conditional laws the law which prohibits permits or commands may add conditions in such manner that the accomplishment of the one shall be necessary to the accomplishment of the other the legislature by itself does all that is possible for the establishment of the right with the exception only of the act by which the individual puts his seal to it at that period the obligation arises conditional laws are in an intermediate condition between existence and nonexistence they wait for the operation of some individual to give them the breath of life fractional and concatenated rights may in certain cases be called common rights let us now return to the second division—rights concerning things the only right which purely relates to things is that of occupation in order to know the kinds the modifications of this right it is necessary to know the modifications of which it is susceptible so many limitations as may exist so many distinct rights may there exist each of which may have a separate proprietor under a legislation but little advanced the right of occupation could not exist in an unlimited form no person could possess in this manner—scarcely anything could be thus possessed the right of occupation may be limited in seven respects—   with regard to the substance of the thing thus from the general right of occupation which i possess over the land which is considered mine there may be detached in your favour the right of carrying an aqueduct above it or a sewer underneath it—the right of making a roof project over it the right to allow a tree to project the right of exploring mines c the right of occupation with respect to a house may either comprehend the whole house or be limited to a certain chamber and so of the rest it will be seen that this measure of limitation supposes that each thing may be distinguished from every other and that each part     of a thing may be distinguished from every other part it supposes a complete system of individuation for things   the right of occupation may be limited as to the use that is to say as to the manner of occupying i may gather the fruits of my land but i may not surround it with a hedge still less close all entrance against you i may perform divine service in the church of which i am the clergyman but i may not keep shop there the right of collecting a product which renews itself such as water fish wood turf—does this respect the substance or the use again another species of individuation—again other lines of positive demarcation   the right of occupation may be limited as to time if it be not perpetual it may be present or future in the last case it may be certain or contingent present or future its end may be dated from a determinate or indeterminate period we may remark here that when we suppose rights to be certain which are not present it is only in conformity with custom for in strictness there is no certainty with respect to anything which is future in order to possess a certain right it is necessary that one shall be certain to be alive with this restriction a right which ought to commence after the lapse of ten years for example is a certain right a right which ought to vest in me after your decease—is this certain or contingent it is certain that you will die but it is not certain when you will die nor even that you will die before me here there are still required lines of demarcation   the right of occupation may be limited by place such a swarm of bees is yours whilst it remains upon your ground it is mine when it has quitted your land for mine or it belongs to nobody under the ordinary law men are in relation to different sovereigns what bees are to different proprietors it will be perceived that this distinction only respects moveable things also that this species of limitation brings us back to that which has reference to time since to have a right to a certain thing whilst it continues in a certain place is to have such right during a certain time the place serves as an index to the time   the right of occupation may be also limited by a right of interdiction possessed by another that is to say when another has the right of interdicting your occupation of the thing it might seem at first that these two rights would destroy one another but if the right of interdiction only exist at intervals—if it only exist in connexion with certain customs the one and the other right may exist and the one serve to limit the other it is thus that the poor have the right of gleaning in the fields of the rich provided that they have not been interdicted it may happen that this right of occupation is of no value it may be that it may be annihilated by the right of interdiction which limits it has therefore the right of gleaning any force when i have collected corn worth many shillings if you have not previously forbidden me you could not have me condemned to make even simple restitution but had i clandestinely taken only a single farthing of your money from your room you could have had me punished for theft   the right of occupation may be limited by the addition of other persons whose concurrence is necessary for the lawful exercise of the right three coheirs have between them a strong box no one of them has the right to open it except in the presence and with the consent of the other two the right of each is limited by that of his two associates a right the exercise of which in order to be lawful requires the concurrence of many wills may be called fractional this kind of limitation may also be connected with the right of interdiction one of the coheirs refuses his consent to the opening of the strong box he forbids this act to the others   the right of occupation may further be limited by another right of occupation granted to another proprietor i have a right to dwell in a certain room if you have also a right to dwell in the same room it is evident that i cannot use my right exactly in the same manner as if you had no such right it will be seen that this kind of limitation may also be connected with the first and second when many persons find themselves possessed of these rights of occupation limited the one by the others they are commonly called coproprietors and it may be said of the thing that is possessed by these persons in common the right of alienation has also its limitations—its modifications they correspond with those of the right of occupation he who is acquainted with these will not be ignorant of the others i must observe that the right of alienation includes a particular kind of right respecting services for what do i do when i alienate anything in your favour among other acts it is necessary that i dispose of certain services on the part of the officers of the government whose assistance would be necessary to guarantee to you the occupation of this thing the rights which you acquire over such services form part of the numerous band of rights which are transferred upon every alienation of property—with respect to the principal right they may be called corrobarative rights     the acts to which it extends form the measure of a right—it is to these acts that the view must be directed in order to obtain those clear ideas which can only be obtained by the contemplation of material objects the measure of a right of occupation which i possess is the physical acts which i may exercise towards the thing to be occupied the measure of the right of exclusion which i have is the acts that you cannot exercise upon the same thing the measure of the right of disposition is the acts which have reference to the two kinds of rights of which i can dispose but when we have arrived at the idea of a physical act we have under our eyes a definite image we have reached the source we have reached the highest degree of clearness he who at the name of a right can picture to himself a sensible image understands the nature of this right he who is not able thus to represent it does not yet understand it every right agendi has then an act to which it has reference this act may either be transitive or intransitive intransitive if the act only affect the agent himself—transitive when the act affects a thing or person other than the agent even when the act appears only to affect things it affects persons—that is to say the persons to whom the things might be useful—inasmuch as there is nothing to be considered in things but the services which persons may draw from them hence when the right appears nominally to be conferred on a thing it is really conferred on a person inasmuch as it is always a person who enjoys the advantage resulting from such right this is what the compilers of the roman code never comprehended according to them all rights are divided into two masses—of which the one regards persons the other things they have set out with a false unintelligible division into two parts which are not exclusive with regard to each other jura personarum—jura rerum it may be said that they were led to take this division by a species of correspondence or grammatical symmetry for there is no correspondence between the two appellations except as to the form—there is none as to the sense rights of persons—what does it mean rights belonging to persons—rights conferred by the law on persons—rights which persons may enjoy—everything is clear transfer this explanation to rights of things what is the result things which have rights belonging to them—things on which the law has conferred rights—things which the law has wished to favour—things for whose happiness the law has provided—it is the height of absurdity instead of rights of things it is proper to say rights over things the change appears very slight it however overthrows this nomenclature this division of rights all this pretended arrangement of the romanists—since adopted by blackstone and according to which he has so badly classed the objects of the law if we err in the first step the further we proceed in the same direction the further we shall be from the end how shall he who employs for the explanation of everything an expression which has no meaning—how shall he communicate a knowledge of all the parts this unfortunate double signification has thrown the romanists into a perpetual confusion under the heads of rights of persons there are nearly as many questions concerning rights over things as concerning rights over persons for example right of the husband over the goods of the wife acquired by his marriage—right of the father over the property acquired by his son—right of the members of a political society over the things belonging to that society and so of the rest what a system is that in which the fundamental terms change their signification every moment for expressing in an expeditious manner these rights over things would it be possible to employ the word so frequently used by the romanists—servitude i fear it would be put out of employ by the abusive use they have made of it it has taken a false acceptance it is difficult to regenerate it if it could be employed this is the use i would make of it the partial right of occupation whether as to the substance of a thing or as to its use i would call positive servitude the right of exclusion with respect to such or such a part of the substance or such or such a use on the part of the original proprietor i would call negative servitude the right over the positive services of the principal proprietor to be exercised on his part for the improvement of the thing for the profit of the other subordinate proprietors i should call compulsory servitude other errors of the romanists upon this matter—if they are to be believed there are cases in which rights only subsist by means of the laws and other cases in which they have subsisted or still subsist independent of the laws those rights which they represent to us as only subsisting by the law of nature or the law of nations or some such other phrase have no existence at all or only exist in consequence of civil laws and by them alone exactly as those whose existence they attribute to these same laws they have ill understood legal organization they have fallen into strange mistakes respecting the manner in which the functions of this vast body are performed these errors have been anything but matters of indifference     i should never have done if i were to cite all the false reasonings resting upon these false ideas certain rights it has been said are not founded upon the civil law they therefore ought not to be altered by the civil law certain laws have only been made at the expense of natural liberty therefore they are violations of natural liberty they are therefore unjust to say that a law is contrary to natural liberty is simply to say that it is a law for every law is established at the expense of liberty—the liberty of peter at the expense of the liberty of paul when a law is reproached as hurtful to liberty the inconvenience is not a particular ground of complaint against that law—it is shared by all laws the evil which it causes in this manner—is it greater than the good which it does in other ways this is the only question to be examined it is unfortunate that individual and political liberty have received the same name by means of this double signification a syllogism may be formed in favour of perpetual revolt an established law is a restraint upon liberty a restraint upon liberty is tyranny tyranny is a legitimate reason for revolt this digression is not foreign to the present subject it shows the importance of just ideas of the origin and nature of rights the preparation of a table of rights is a sufficiently dry and ungrateful task but such labours are required of those who would be of use to the science it is necessary to distinguish one part of a subject from another in order to be in a condition to establish true propositions respecting them nothing can be asserted nothing can be denied respecting them whilst objects are mixed pell mell and form only heterogeneous masses in order to make it understood that one plant is food and another poison the characters which distinguish them must be pointed out and proper names must be assigned to them so long as there are no names for expressing many rights or that there is only one and the same name for expressing many dissimilar ones so long as generic names are employed without distinguishing the species included under them it is impossible to avoid confusion—it is impossible to form general propositions which will be true this observation has already been made but it often presents itself in a science in which the greatest difficulties arise from a vicious nomenclature table of the divisions of rights i sources—rights existing from the absence of obligation rights established by obligations ii ends—connexion of the right with the interest of the party

political powers or the rights exercised by government is not given here chapter xv seventh general title of the civil code of collative and ablative events all the rights which i possess have had a commencement—all will have an end to give to a certain event the quality of epoch from which to date the commencement of a right is to render that event collative with respect to that right to give to a certain event the quality of epoch from which to date the cessation of a right is to render this event ablative with respect to this right has the sovereign established a code of laws he has then given to certain events the quality of collative events and to others the quality of ablative events these are two important catalogues do you at the present moment possess a certain right it is because with reference to this right there has happened in your favour an event which belongs to the first catalogue and none has happened which belongs to the second how many assertions are comprised in that assertion apparently so simple—you possess a certain right to establish what events shall belong to these catalogues is to establish the laws to have formed complete catalogues of them is to have completed the code of laws to distinguish all these events—to give them their specific denominations is a labour of the first necessity and yet it is altogether a new task i shall here confine myself to a sketch of an analytical table of the principal events in order to show what they resemble and from what they are distinguished these events are very nearly the same as the usual catalogue of titles for common wants have given a certain uniformity a certain correspondence to the laws of all people at least in their essential features   a right begins to belong to me—this right previously belonged to some other person or it belonged to no person have i found a desert island have i gathered fruits cut down wood collected minerals caught animals upon this land if the laws of my country permit it i shall have become a proprietor without any person having ceased to be so original discovery—first collative event with regard to things newly subjected to the dominion of man in this manner everything was originally acquired but in our days such acquisitions are more rare in proportion as the world is peopled fortunes of this kind as well as of every other are obtained with greater difficulty   the seeds which i have gathered and sown have produced others the birds the animals that i have taken have multiplied here is new wealth second collative event—possession of productive things   uprooted trees large fishes driven out of their course have been thrown upon my island third collative event—possession of a receiving thing or thing serving as a receptacle   have i employed my labour upon my own things—have i cut the wood or the stone—have i polished the metal or spun the flax—have i improved the inert matter by my industry these are new sources of enjoyment fourth collative event—amelioration of ones own things let us go on to things which are already under the hands of a master before a new possessor can be invested with them it is necessary that an ablative event in relation to the ancient possessor should take place this event may be either physical or moral physical if it happen without human intervention moral if it take place through the will of an individual or the legislature first physical ablative event death of the proprietor second fortuitous obliteration of the distinctive character of the thing as in the cases spoken of by the romanists under the heads confusion commixtion c† in these two cases the loss is of necessity the individual can no longer possess the thing or the thing can no longer be possessed by him without his possessing at the same time other things to which he has no right   and   these two ablative events may be both expressed by a collative event instead of speaking of the death of the proprietor we may say succession in consequence of death instead of saying fortuitous obliteration of the distinctive character of the thing we may say as above possession of the receiving thing does the intervention of man enter into the ablative act—it is then the law alone which operates to give this effect to the event or it is some individual who acts in concert with it this individual can only be     the original proprietor or the new proprietor or a third party acting for them   sixth collative event—private disposition   seventh—disposition on the part of the magistrate or adjudication   other collative events—occupation by way of seizure made at the charge of a delinquent or judicial seizure—occupation by way of capture by a foreign enemy or hostile seizure booty in war in governments as civilized as are those of europe the quality of collative events has not been accorded to these two acts without the concurrence of adjudication   occupation of a thing abandoned—to abandon anything is one method of disposing of it it is to divest ones self of it without investing any particular person with it this amounts to giving it to the first comer  0 is the disposition so regulated as only to take effect when the disposer is dead and upon condition that he has not made any contrary disposition there is here on the one part donation by testament—on the other testamentary succession    has the disposition had for its object the fictitious thing called charge office right of office it is called nomination or election the last word is most commonly used when the right of disposition is found divided between many proprietors the collation by which i assume an office of my own accord for my own profit may be called assumption of office the act by which i am divested by another dismission the act by which i divest myself demission    has the disposition for its object a right over services to be rendered by the dispositor himself it is what is sometimes understood by the words convention treaty contract c i wish that we could exclusively employ to this effect some new appellation such as obligatory promise adjudication an act of the magistrate naturally leads to the search for some other event which has served as a motive for this act to what purpose does the law intend that the judge shall exercise his rights it is not for his own advantage it is only to accomplish other legal dispositions—to give effect to other events collative and ablative to make a disposition is to apply to such an effect the power of the laws—is to command the services of the sovereign or the magistrates is the disposition a lawful one it possesses the qualities of those to which the sovereign is ready to lend his assistance is it unlawful it is of the number of those to which he refuses it thus explained a disposition may be considered under two aspects either as serving to modify a general law or as making by itself under the authority of the sovereign a particular law in the first point of view the sovereign is represented as making a general law and leaving certain words blank that they may be supplied by the individual to whom he grants the right so to do in the second point of view the individual makes the law and causes it to be sanctioned by the public force the prince becomes literally the servant of the humblest of his subjects to make a contract is not to implore the services of the magistrate it is to command these same services for marking the commencement of a right i have hitherto only assigned a single event but many may concur in it it is therefore necessary to distinguish dispositive events into simple and complex among the elements of a complex event we may distinguish some by the title of principals the others by that of accessaries with regard to a testamentary succession for example to give it effect at least two different events must happen   the death of the first proprietor   the birth of the new proprietor add to these the steps that the heir must take in order to furnish proofs of his character as such and those which are necessary on the part of the magistrate to put him into possession you may in this complex event give to the two first the name of principal events and to the acts required from the heir and the magistrate that of accessory events if any of those acts to which the quality of collative or accessory events has been given are omitted there are so many grounds of nullity to grant to an act a certain collative quality is to prescribe a formality to be attended to under the penalty of making void the disposition to which it refers if it be omitted analyze the kind of disposition called election with regard to a place either in the house of commons in england or in the council of state at venice where aristocratic jealousy has exhausted all the art of combination how many accessory collative events—how many grounds of nullity to be avoided—how many formalities to be regarded—what a series of steps to be passed over before arriving at the last term the establishment of the right    adjudication as we have seen is a collative event which supposes others without which this would not take place it is the same with regard to possession an event which serves to prove the anterior existence of these other collative events and to render them useless     possession may be actual or ancient that possession may be called simply actual when the party has only provisional security so long as no collative event is found which operates in favour of his adversary or what amounts to the same thing so long as no ablative event is found which operates to his prejudice that may be called ancient possession which in consideration of its duration it is determined shall have not only the effect of provisional investment but also the effect of destroying every collative event which might operate to the prejudice of the party and in favour of his adversary such is the case which has been characterized by the word prescription but what is it to possess this appears a very simple question—there is none more difficult of resolution and it is in vain that its solution is sought for in books of law the difficulty has not even been perceived it is not however a vain speculation of metaphysics everything which is most precious to a man may depend upon this question—his property his liberty his honour and even his life indeed in defence of my possession i may lawfully strike wound and even kill if necessary but was the thing in my possession if the law trace no line of demarcation if it decide not what is possession and what is not i may whilst acting with the best intentions find myself guilty of the greatest crime and what i thought was legitimate defence may in the opinion of the judge be robbery and murder this then is a matter which ought to be investigated in every code but it has not been done in any to prevent perpetual equivocation it is necessary carefully to distinguish between physical and legal possession we here refer to the former it does not suppose any law it existed before there were laws it is the possession of the subject itself whether a thing or the service of man legal possession is altogether the work of the law it is the possession of the right over a thing or over the services of man to have physical possession of a thing is to have a certain relation with that thing of which if it please the legislator the existence may hold the place of an investive event for the purpose of giving commencement to certain rights over that thing to have legal possession of a thing is already to have certain rights over that thing whether by reason of physical possession or otherwise i have said that to have physical possession of a thing is to have a certain relation with that thing this was all that i have said—this is all that i could say at first what is that relation it is here that the difficulty begins to define possession is to recall the image which presents itself to the mind when it is necessary to decide between two parties which is in possession of a thing and which is not but if this image be different with different men—if many do not form any such image or if they form a different one on different occasions how shall a definition be found to fix an image so uncertain and variable the idea of possession will be different according to the nature of the subject—according as it respects things or the services of man or fictitious entities—as parentage privilege exemption from services c the idea will be different according as it refers to things moveable or immoveable how many questions are necessary for determining what constitutes a building a lodging must it be factitious but a natural cavern may serve for a dwelling—must it be immoveable but a coach in which one dwells in journeying a ship are not immoveables but this land this building—what is to be done that it may be possessed is it actual occupation—is it the habit of possessing it—is it facility of possessing without opposition and in spite of opposition itself other difficulties in reference to exclusive possession or possession in common—in reference to possession by an individual or by everybody ulterior difficulties in reference to possession by ones self or possession by another you are in the habit of occupying this manufactory you alone occupy it at this hour i say you are only my manager—you pretend to be my lessee a creditor contends that you are my partner this being the case are you or i or are both in possession of the manufactory a street porter enters an inn puts down his bundle upon the table and goes out one person puts his hand upon the bundle to examine it another puts his to carry it away saying it is mine the innkeeper runs to claim it in opposition to them both the porter returns or does not return of these four men which is in possession of the bundle in the house in which i dwell with my family is an escritoire usually occupied by my clerk and by what belongs to him in this escritoire there is placed a locked box belonging to my son in this box he has deposited a purse entrusted to him by a friend in whose possession is the bag—in mine in my clerks in my sons or his friends it is possible to double or triple the number of these degrees the question may be complicated at pleasure how shall these difficulties be resolved consult first primitive utility and if it be found neuter indifferent then follow the popular ideas collect them when they have decided—fix them when they are wavering—supply them when they are wanting but by one method or another resolve these subtilties     or what is better prevent the necessity of recurring to them instead of the thorny question of possession substitute that of honest intention which is more simple in the last case which i have supposed the roman lawyers would have recognised only one of the four as being in possession yet all may be honest and the possessor may have been dishonest as well as any one of the others in this last case make the decision depend upon possession—you would have a culpable person unpunished and three persons punished unjustly—make it depend upon honest intention—there will neither be impunity nor unjust punishment observations upon nomenclature what i call a dispositive event is what is called in the writings of jurisprudence title i have been fully sensible that the terms collative and ablative events have the double inconvenience of length and novelty and i have tried to make use of the word title i have found it equivocal obscure defective—spreading a mist over the whole field of jurisprudence whilst the two other terms are clear sufficient and yielding instruction in themselves in order to exhibit every point in which the word title is defective it would be necessary to examine a great number of phrases in which it very imperfectly expresses the idea which the term collative or ablative expresses clearly to say to a man you have a title is to assert with sufficient clearness that a collative event has happened in his favour but if i say to him you have no longer a title this method of speaking is very little satisfactory it does not express why or how this title no longer exists it is necessary to understand that after a collative event had occurred it has been succeeded by another of an opposite nature the word title is especially defective when obligations are spoken of using this word how shall it be made to appear that a collative event has happened which has subjected you to a certain obligation or that a certain ablative event has happened which has freed you from it the result is that in these four cases in which it would be necessary to use the word title it would only express the meaning in one in the three other cases it is improper or inapplicable it is only necessary to try it in order to discover its insufficiency by employing the proper word event it is possible to form a regular class of appellations in reference to the individual on whom it confers a right an event may be called collative in reference to him upon whom it imposes an obligation it may be called onerative an ablative event with respect to him from whom it takes away a right may be called destitutive with reference to him from whom it takes away an obligation it may be called exonerative is it wished to give to the two epithets ablative and collative a generic name they may be called dispositive there is here a series of names which have a reference to each other here is a generic name and subordinate specific names take the word title the logical ramification is stopped at the first step there are no species of titles it is an absolutely barren trunk the radical objection against the word title is that it is obscure—it does not exhibit things as they are to say that an event has happened is to speak the language of simple truth—is to announce a fact which presents an image to the mind—it is to present a picture which could be painted to say you have a title is to speak the language of fiction it is to utter sounds which do not present any image unless they are translated into other words as we shall shortly see to possess to have in a physical sense—here there is a real fact announced in a real manner for it is to occupy the thing or to be able to occupy it posse potes to have power over it to possess a thing in the legal sense to possess rights over a thing—there is an equally real fact but announced in a fictitious manner to have a title to possess a title in relation to these rights—there is still a real fact but announced in a manner still more fictitious—still more removed from presenting a real image i would not therefore employ the word title as a fundamental term but once translated from the language of fiction into the language of reality i hesitate not to employ it it is not luminous in itself but when it has received light if it be properly placed it may serve either to reflect or to transmit it in making a catalogue of dispositive events care should be taken of three things—  to give every one of them names formed upon the same plan   to give them only such names as are species formed from the genus designated by the word event   not to place without notice specific names in the same rank with the generic names of which they express the species the names of titles ought only to be names of events such are occupatio accessio traditio but prescription is not so any more than the species into which it has pleased the lawyers to divide prescription the same disorder may be seen amongst contracts a contract is an assemblage of acts the making of a contract is therefore an event thus certain contracts have the names of acts—stipulatio fidejussio but the names to the four real contracts are not the names of events mutuum commodatum depositum pignus they have quitted the act to fix upon the thing   0 which has been its subject it would have been as easy to have said mutuatio commodatio depositio pignoratio but the romanists have not even suspected the characters of a good nomenclature for the designation of the contracts which they call consensual as if the others were not so five of the terms employed are the names of acts—emptio venditio locatio conductio emphyteusis two are not—societas mandatum—they ought rather to have said societatis initio mandatio with a nomenclature which at every step confounds things which it is most necessary to distinguish how is it possible to be understood with the roman nomenclature the noblest minds have not been able to escape from chaos naturalists have never so far misunderstood the rules of logic linnæus has reformed the system of botany but he did not find it in such a state of confusion as is jurisprudence before him no botanist had been so unskilful as to arrange in the same line germination and the tulip—ramification and corn c i have no wish to enter into infinite details to show what has been among lawyers both the classification of titles and the principles upon which they have been founded the romanists coccejius blackstone only present us with the image of chaos those who do not know how much nonsense is found in the books of lawyers must often imagine that i insist too much upon these clear and common things i can fancy my readers saying to themselves but all this has been repeated a thousand times—oh my readers who thus reproach me you know but little of the profound works of jurisprudence which you esteem from their bulk as the depositories of the science of ages when i analyze the most simple ideas that which appears trivial to men of sense is a paradox to the lawyers truth utility novelty—hitherto these three objects travel together table of collative events   original discovery or right of the first occupant to whom one can refer liberty of fishing in great waters liberty of hunting in unappropriated lands   possession of productive thing   possession of receiving thing   possession of neighbouring lands   amelioration of the thing by ones own

  election  n b i have not found among the manuscripts a table corresponding with this of ablative events—dumont chapter xvi eighth general title of the civil code of contracts section   contracts are acts of collation or investment—conventions—laws more or less ephemeral proposed by individuals and adopted by the sovereign provided they are valid to what ought he to grant the seal of his authority i answer to all for no private contracts would be made except with a view to reciprocal advantage and they cannot be restrained without in the same proportion injuring the happiness of individuals entire liberty for contracts—such would be the general rule if there be any to which this sanction should be refused it will always be for some particular reason the reasons for declaring certain contracts invalid or unlawful ought to be drawn from the nature of the contracts themselves inasmuch as they are contrary to the public interest—or to the interest of a third party or to that of the contracting parties the exceptions should be indicated under a separate head it would be proper that a catalogue of the contracts to which the law either absolutely or conditionally refuses its sanction should be found in the code itself the law ought to act with openness when it grants its sanction to a contract it ought not to withdraw it secretly on account of conditions not avowed as such to enhance the cost of procedure is to violate the promise it has made to sanction contracts it is to render justice inaccessible to the poor that is to those who have most need of it this is a truth none can deny but which few have had the courage to avow i have employed the word contract or transaction to express indistinctly an act of investment—an agreement or a collection—a mixture of agreements founded upon a single occasion this being understood obligations may be distinguished into original and adjective i call those original of which express mention is made in the contract itself i call those adjective which the law thinks proper to add to the first the first turn upon events which     the contracting parties have foreseen the others upon events which they could not foresee it is thus that in every country the law has supplied the shortsightedness of individuals by doing for them what they would have done for themselves if their imagination had anticipated the march of nature the enlightened legislator recognising these factitious obligations as being the work of his hands will give them his support upon true and simple reasons drawn from the principle of utility lawyers have founded these obligations upon fictions that is to say upon facts which never existed where there has been no convention there they suppose that there have been one two a thousand they have the effrontery or the folly to ascribe wishes to you which they avow you never had and this what is called reasoning among them to decompose a certain contract—to show one by one all the pieces of which it is formed—to exhibit the collection of obligations included in this contract—this is a species of mechanism hitherto unknown it is not only upon the author of the fundamental convention that the law imposes these adjective obligations it imposes them also upon other persons in consequence of certain connexions which they have with the principal person it is thus that obligations pass to heirs and sometimes to creditors why because their respective rights only extend to the net value of the goods of their principal an article which is in my custody is lost ought i to be responsible it is a case which divides itself into an infinity of others it may have been of an abstract value a sum of money a wild animal ought it to be considered or not as in my custody did it possess the character of a loan a deposit or a pledge and so on of the rest observe that though in these cases mention is made of contract there are many cases in which i may have a thing without convention without promise without any act of will in reference to it the legislator has two shoals to avoid that of restraining services and that of favouring negligence if you give too great an extent to responsibility you incur the first of these dangers—if you give too little you incur the second i am not about to enter here into a critical examination of the roman contracts it would be a work of deadly ennui if we were to imagine all possible defects—in their division in their nomenclature—it would be difficult to exaggerate them the idea of reciprocal promises of mutual dispositions so familiar to all the world finds itself so obscured in this mischievous and absurd system of jurisprudence that the lawyers who have not ceased to explain it always feel the necessity of new explanations in vain they heap volumes upon volumes light never breaks in upon the chaos everything here must be done over again a language which pretends to be learned has to be forgotten—a simple and familiar language to be taught and those who know nothing possess more than half an advantage over those who have to forget what the lawyers call among themselves by the name of science section   division of contracts a contract subsists between two parties when there exists between them a disposition either of goods or services or a legal promise made by the one for the profit of the other a disposition or a transfer of goods is an act in virtue of which a change is made in the legal right of two or more persons with regard to a certain object contracts may be either momentary or permanent they may be divided into three classes—   promises   disposition or transfer of goods from one party to another   mixed contracts containing both dispositions and promises dispositions and promises may be either unilateral or bilateral according to whether there is reciprocity in the engagement or not i unilateral promises   bail   simple deed of donation c   unilateral promise of marriage ii unilateral disposition   gratuitous donation   legacy   gratuitous loan   deposit to be gratuitously kept   hypothecation in futurum iii bilateral promises   agreement for sale purchase   agreement for exchange   wager†       agreement carrying an obligation to enter into a certain contract   bilateral promises of marriage iv bilateral dispositions   exchange   sale and purchase   exchange of money   purchase of bills of exchange   purchase of rent without mortgage   purchase of rent with mortgage v mixed contracts containing dispositions and promises   loan of money gratuitous or at interest   assurance gratuitous or for a premium   renting a house c   letting a house c   pledging   marriage contract   contract of apprenticeship   hiring of a servant of a workman in a manufactory or in agriculture or other productive labours of a clerk of a shopman   voluntary enrolment  0 donation in trust    legacy in trust    articles of partnership in commerce    deposit under an order of court    articles of partnership in manufactures    deposit in respect to a price to be paid in futurum by the depositor    loan of goods for a price in futurum    adoption species of deposits these species are constituted by the different ends for which the contract is established   on account of the depositor—   simply to keep the thing—housekeeper innkeeper   simply to transfer from one place to another—carrier captain of a vessel for transport   to improve—farrier dyer miller tailor   to employ without amelioration but without consumption that is to say entire destruction—as tools fixed capital of a manufacture servants   to be consumed—as wood for firing drugs for dying ink for writing   on account of the depositary—   deposit of a thing gratuitously lent   deposit of a thing hired   on account of the depositor and depositary—   association with regard to things acquired by a coassociate for the profit of the society   on account of the one or the other according to the event—   the pledger and receiver in pledge chapter xvii ninth general title of the civil code of the domestic and civil states this general title is established that it may serve as a general depot for the laws which regard the different offences against these respective states here ought to be found the catalogue of the classes of persons who possess rights or duties due to them—masters servants guardians wards parents children proxies c whilst with respect to political conditions—that is those which are founded upon some political power or some duty subordinate to it—reference should be made to the constitutional code the domestic or civil state is only an ideal base about which are ranged rights and duties and sometimes incapacities it is proper in all conditions to distinguish the work of nature or of the free man from the work of the law the natural state is the foundation the base the legal state is formed by the rights the obligations which the law adds thereto to know a state is therefore to know separately the rights and the obligations which the law has added to it but what is the principle of union which binds them together to make the factitious thing which is called a state a condition it is the identity of the investive event with respect to the possession of that state under this head the most striking examples will be found of the variety and extent of adjective obligations a boy and a girl marry—they do not see at first in their union anything more than the accomplishment of the wish which had been the motive of it at the same moment the law interposes and imposes upon them a multitude of reciprocal obligations of which the idea had never been presented to their minds it is true that this distinction of fundamental and adjective obligations depends only upon the negligence of the legislator if he had taken pains to facilitate the knowledge of the laws the citizen would have     known all the obligations which attached to him upon assuming a certain condition and all whether principal or accessory would have been equally voluntary in the notice of civil conditions all trades should be comprehended all professions which have particular rights or duties or which are subjected to certain incapacities in the article appropriated to each condition the following should be the order of the matter—  methods of acquisition   methods of losing   rights   duties   incapacities if there be any rights ought to precede duties because in many cases they are the source of duties if there be a chronological order in the events from which rights and duties take their date such order should be followed the effects which result from each event ought to be distinct from those which result from any other chapter xviii tenth general title of the civil code of persons capable of acquiring and of contracting from the word person and others which are employed to represent it such an one he who c is derived a collection of titles which should have their common centre in this one to whom shall the law attribute the capacity of acquiring and of contracting to all says the general rule if there be persons to whom it is refused this ought to be in consequence of some particular reason thus without the exceptions there would be no necessity for the general rule it is only required that the exceptions may be placed under it thus the law will not allow the right of investiture to a benefice in the church to a jew lest he should abuse it to the prejudice of the church it does not allow a like right with regard to real property to a minor lest he should abuse it to his own prejudice it does not allow this right nor even that of its occupation to a madman lest he should abuse it either to his own prejudice or to that of another chapter xix of the particular titles of the civil code in the penal code the titles are easily arranged they correspond with the catalogue of offences it is not the same with the civil code the particular titles may equally be placed under any of the general titles as we shall soon see it is not possible to complete a penal code without having determined the plan of the civil code for to have a complete penal code it is necessary that the whole body of the law should be found included there—at least by reference thus true is it that the idea of a complete penal code includes in itself the complete idea of all the subjects of the other codes but when all the materials are collected it remains still to assign them their places what is the clue to guide us in this distribution it is still the principle of utility the laws being given why has the legislator prepared them the answer is simple as it is incontestable with the intention that each disposition should be present to the minds of all those who are interested in the knowledge of it at the moment in which this knowledge may furnish them with motives for regulating their conduct for this purpose it is necessary—  that the code be prepared altogether in a style intelligible to the commonest understanding   that every one may consult and find the law of which he stands in need in the least possible time   that for this purpose the subjects be detached from one another in such manner that each condition may find that which belongs to itself separated from that which belongs to another citizen says the legislator what is your condition are you a father open the chapter of fathers are you an agriculturist consult the chapter of agriculturists this rule is both simple and satisfying once announced it is comprehended it cannot be forgotten all legislators ought to follow so natural a method says philosophy—not one of them has ever dreamt of it replies the lawyer the catalogue of all these conditions may be found in the body of the laws under two different orders under the general title of states or conditions it may be placed in an analytical and systematic form for the instruction of lawyers in the index it ought to be found in alphabetical order for the convenience of the subjects there are many subjects which might be sought for indifferently under more than one title but in all cases in which either a concrete or an abstract name may be given to a title the concrete name ought uniformly to be employed in the text and the abstract name referred to the index thus in the text ought to be found the titles of husbands of wives and not that of marriage the title of heirs and not that of successions but all these titles rejected from the text ought to be carefully collected in the index for it is with respect to this appendix to the book altogether different from what it is with respect to the book itself—the more voluminous it is the more easily it is consulted after the titles drawn from persons come those drawn from material beings—from     things these are preferred to abstract titles for two reasons—  because they must naturally present themselves to the least instructed minds   because the catalogue is more ample and uniform at last we reach the titles drawn from the different kinds of contracts it is true that the names of contracts are abstract terms but contracts are the acts of persons and there is no kind of contract which does not give a particular name to the persons who engage in it it is not necessary therefore to employ concrete titles but reference may be made to the persons themselves thus instead of saying purchase sale borrowing lending we may say purchaser seller borrower lender this method will better preserve the uniformity of the plan and the great end of the arrangement which is to present to every one that which belongs to him separate from what does not belong to him besides all contracts have not two correlative names which correspond with those of the two contracting parties the greater number have but one—for example deposit assurance also with regard to each contract there may be others beside the mutual obligations—there may be particular obligations on particular parties instead therefore of heaping them all under the head of assurance or deposit it would be better to make two separate articles—assurer assured—depositor depositary under this point of view the titles of things contracted for would only be a consequence—a subdivision of the personal titles a question to be cleared up—there are few contracts which do not in some manner or other refer to things such a contract being supposed ought the text of the laws regarding it to be found under the title of contracts or under that of things if it refer to things in general and dispositions in general it should be placed under the title of contracts if it refer to a particular kind of thing and a disposition which only applies to this kind and not to another it should be placed under the title of things example sale of a horse—the seller bound to warrant it free from certain diseases unless he stipulates to the contrary—the warranty does not apply to other kinds of animals it would be better that this obligation should be found under the title of horses than under that of sellers since it does not attach to any other kind of seller beside the seller of horses the following is an idea of the subordinate titles which would find place under a real title i take for example that of horses— it is to be observed that regard is solely paid to the arrangement and not the matter the laws which are or have been cited are cited without deciding whether they are good or bad they are counters which i use in reckoning—it would be misapplied labour to examine their defects in this place   persons incapable of acquiring property in horses or to whom the acquisition is interdicted ex catholics in england with respect to horses of a certain value written law of england offence against the sovereignty   particular means of acquiring them capture of a highway robber on horseback and conviction of the delinquent written law of england—remuneratory law   limitations of the right of occupation cruelty prohibited prohibition as respects the using of them for riding by christians law in certain provinces of turkey prohibition of the exportation of war horses offence against the public force   acts commanded connected with their use marks to be imprinted upon hired horses that thieves who use them may be recognised or that the individuality of the animal may be proved for the purpose of levying a tax upon it reference to the personal titles of posthorse keepers carriers innkeepers c   limitations of exclusive property—rights granted to public officers to employ them on certain conditions—to seize them for the military service—to destroy them for the purpose of stopping an epidemic c   limitation of the right of disposal—example prohibition to export c   adjective obligations attached to the rights of occupation ex taxes to be paid periodically taxes to be paid occasionally at turnpikes obligations imposed in consequence of borrowing hiring pledging forced labour—as of feeding physicking c reference to the titles of contracts borrowers lenders hirers travellers c   adjective obligations attached to the right of disposal example presumed warranty against disease and other defects   adjective rights over services attached to the right of occupation right to cause the horses to be received and taken care of by innkeepers farriers c reference to the personal title of people in trade in which is exhibited the obligations under which they exercise their respective trades of serving whoever requires them offence nonreddition of service  0 adjective rights over services attached to the right of disposal example right of having a place assigned for ones horse in a horse market by the person employed in keeping the market offence nonreddition of service it may be remarked that the particular titles of the civil code are not constructed in the same manner as those of the penal code in the latter the point of reunion is the identity of the kind of act which is referred     to everything is referred for example to theft homicide adultery c in the titles of the civil code the point of reunion is the identity of the person or the condition—everything is referred to fathers husbands masters guardians c there is however a more distant point of view in which all distinctions disappear if the distinctive principle of the personal codes are completely followed out it will be found that the particular titles of the penal code belong to them for to commit an offence is to become a delinquent—a thief a seducer an assassin a forger c the agent might receive his denomination from the act doubt to be cleared up—in most cases the same law necessarily bears upon two persons at least at one time—he upon whom an obligation is imposed—he upon whom a right is in consequence conferred under each of these two titles the law ought to be mentioned but under which of them ought it to be stated at full length this depends upon circumstances and the choice is not of much consequence the most natural procedure appears to be this present the entire law to that one of the parties who has most need to be instructed which then is this party it is commonly him upon whom the duty is imposed because of the penalties which accompany the infraction of this duty—because the punishments which the law is forced to employ are generally stronger than the rewards or advantages which it confers there are also other reasons for preferring this arrangement—   there are many cases in which the favoured party is the whole public and not an individual for example taxes all that it is necessary to address to the public in the general penal code is the definition of the offence—nonpayment of taxes with suitable references those things which serve to indicate the different taxes imposed and the accessary obligations added for insuring the collection of these same taxes should be referred to the particular titles of the different classes taxed and of the persons charged with the collection of the taxes   the party upon whom it is wished to impose an obligation is necessarily easily pointed out and distinguished the legislator without doubt ought not to be ignorant what classes he intends to favour but there may be many classes favoured by the same right and it may be more difficult to particularize them   it may also happen that certain classes may find themselves favoured of whom the legislator did not think when a tax for example is laid upon a certain species of linen—the object of the tax as such may only have been the general good of the state in respect of its wants which have rendered contributions necessary the public in general will have been the party intended to be favoured without thinking of any other there may however be a class of men who will derive from it a more immediate advantage such would be found in persons engaged in a rival manufactory manufacturing a species of cloth more or less suitable for the same purposes this detail would have been unnecessary except for the light it throws upon the plan of distribution for otherwise it is of little consequence whether the law be placed under one title or another provided the references are sufficiently numerous and well chosen and that the mass be divided in such manner that each class be only charged with such matters as particularly interest it such is the plan of distribution which i would propose for matters of civil law it appears to me the clearest—that in which the atoms of the law would most easily arrange themselves around their centre by an attraction which appears natural in proportion as it is simple the sketch of this plan may not be in sufficient detail for those who have not attained a certain degree of legal knowledge but those who have studied what has been honoured with the name of system—those who have penetrated into the labyrinth of the civil laws will at once be sensible how new this plan of distribution is and that if it have any merit it is that of introducing a uniform principle which presides over the whole arrangement chapter xx of elementary political powers the constitutional code is principally employed in conferring powers on particular classes of society or on individuals and in prescribing their duties powers are constituted by exceptions to imperative laws let me explain myself every complete law is in its own nature coercive or discoercive the coercive law demands or prohibits it creates an offence or in other terms it converts an act into an offence—thou shalt not kill—thou shalt not steal the discoercive law creates an exception it takes away the offence it authorises a certain person to do a thing contrary to the first law the judge shall cause such an individual to be put to death—the collector of taxes shall exact such a sum duties are created by imperative laws addressed to those who possess powers the judge shall impose a certain punishment according to certain prescribed forms the constitutional code will include an     explanatory part serving to indicate those events by which certain individuals are invested with certain powers—succession nomination presentation concession institution election purchase of place c c and the events by which such individuals are divested of such powers—dismission amotion deposition abdication dereliction resignation c to analyze to enumerate all the possible political powers is a metaphysical labour of the highest difficulty but of the greatest importance in general these rights these powers will not much differ from domestic rights and powers if they were placed in a single hand they would only differ in extent that is to say in the multitude of persons and things over which they would be exercised but their importance has ordinarily led to their being divided among many hands in such manner that for the exercise of a single kind of power the concurrence of many wills is required hitherto the political powers of one government have been with regard to the political powers of another government objects which have had no common measure there has been no correspondency there are only local names for expressing them sometimes the names themselves differ—sometimes the same names are expressive of objects altogether different there is no courtguide which would serve for every court—there is no universal political grammar the titles of offices are mixtures dissimilar aggregates which cannot be compared together because no one has ever tried to decompose them—because no one has ever known their primordial elements these elements if any one shall ever discover them will be the hitherto unknown key of every given political system and the common measure of all actual and possible systems but how shall i frame a uniform plan for the distribution of the political powers in any state—from what language shall i borrow the vocabulary of offices if i employ the french it will only serve to express the distribution of powers in the french government what relation is there between the consuls of france and the consuls of rome or the consuls of commerce—between the king of england the king of sweden the king of prussia—between the emperor of germany and the emperor of russia—between the ancient french peer and duke—the english duke and peer—the grandduke of russia and the grandduke of tuscany—between the mayor of bordeaux and the mayor of london c c a volume would not suffice to point out all these disproportions such is the first difficulty it has been the torment of those who have had to give an account of a foreign constitution it is almost impossible to employ any denomination to which the readers shall not attach ideas different from those which it is intended to convey this confusion will cease if it be possible to employ a new nomenclature which shall not be composed of official names but which shall express the elementary political powers exercised by those different offices two methods may be employed for this decomposition—  by considering the end towards which they are directed—end of interior or exterior security—end of security against crimes or against calamities c—  by considering the different methods by which these ends may be attained the method of operating may have for its object persons or things this method of analyzing political powers presents the following results—   immediate power over persons—this is what is exercised over the passive faculties it is the power of doing with ones own hand acts whose effects terminate upon the person of another whether upon his body or his mind it is the power of doing acts which would be offences against the person on the part of an individual who was not authorized directed to a certain end it is the power of punishing directed towards another end it is the power of restraining and constraining this power is the foundation of all others   immediate power over the property of others—this is the power of making use for the public of things the principal property in which belongs to individuals for example the power of a minister of justice to break open the house of a person not accused that he may seek for an accused person there—the power of a public courier in case of need to make use of the horse of an individual   immediate power over public things—that is of those which have only government for their proprietor   power of command over persons taken individually—this operates upon the active qualities it has commonly for its foundation immediate power over the person without which he who commands would not be sure of finding motives for making himself obeyed in the beginning of political societies these two powers must have been united in the same hands as they still are in domestic society the habit of obedience being once established we have almost lost sight of the dependence in which the more elevated power is found in respect of that from which it springs the first is only exercised by kings and their ministers they have left the second to a baser sort of men ulysses chastised with his own hand the petulant thersites peter i was also the executor of his own decrees he proudly struck off with his imperial hands the head of the wretch whom he had condemned     the office of executioner does not degrade the emperors of morocco and their dexterity in these punishments is one of the pomps of their crown in civilized states the nobler power depends no less upon the ignoble power than in barbarous countries—but the disposition to obedience being once established everything operates without our thinking of the constraint which is its first foundation   power of command over persons taken collectively—a state must be very small in which individuals could be governed one by one this can only take place in a family a company of soldiers can only be manœuvred when a head is given to the whole together it is in the power of making men act by class that the strength of government consists   power of specification—i thus denominate the power of determining of what individuals particular classes shall be composed over whom command may be exercised this very extensive power is only in respect to persons the power of investment or divestment with regard to a certain class—class of nobles class of judges class of military class of sailors class of citizens class of foreigners class of offenders class of allies class of enemies the power of specification subdivides itself into two principal branches specification of persons—specification of things power over persons subdivides itself into the power of locating in a class and the power of dislocating power over things consists in setting them apart for a certain use and making it a crime to employ them for any other to specify a time a day as set apart for a religious festival on which it is unlawful to work to specify a place as consecrated for example a church an asylum to specify a metal as the legal coin of the country to specify a dress as appropriated to a certain condition c the right of specification over things embraces the totality of things it ought to be remembered that each of these powers may be indefinitely subdivided according to the number of hands in which it is placed and the number of wills which may be required for its legitimate exercise hence the right of initiation or right of proposing right of negation or right of rejecting the copossessors may form only a single body or many separate bodies the concurrence of many bodies may be necessary to the validity of an act of command as well as the concurrence of many individuals in a single body all these powers may be possessed in chief or in a rank more or less subordinate the subordination of a political power to another is established—  by the cassability of its acts or their liability to be abrogated   by its subjection to the orders it receives   attractive power—i thus call the power of rewarding or not rewarding—power of influence which is partly remuneratory and partly penal influence is one source of motives in government it is constituted—   by the power of locating in regard to desirable offices—reward   by the power of dislocating in regard to desirable offices—punishment   by the power of locating in regard to undesirable offices—punishment   by the power of dislocating in regard to undesirable offices—reward there are three other sources of influence less direct—   free employment of wealth   the power of rendering or not rendering all sorts of free services   influence founded upon the reputation of wisdom the attractive power which is exercised by means of reward is more dangerous than the coercive power because it is liable to be more arbitrary every rich man possesses a a portion of it in consequence of his wealth without possessing any political power by name it is only in a small number of cases that it has been possible to subject the exercise of this power to fixed rules the laws against bribery and corruption are examples and every one knows how difficult it is to execute the laws against the purchase of suffrages at an election or against the venality of persons in official stations success is most easily attained by indirect rather than direct means—by rendering the offence difficult of commission by diminishing temptation by taking away the means of its concealment by the cultivation of sentiments of honour c recapitulation—analysis of abstract elementary political powers   immediate power over persons   immediate power over the things of another   immediate power over public things   power of command over persons taken individually   power of command over persons taken collectively or over classes       power of specification or classification—     with regard to persons     with regard to things     with regard to places     with regard to times   attractive power power of granting or not granting rewards chapter xxi of elementary political powers— subject continued the foregoing enumeration of political powers presents a new nomenclature which requires justification and can only be justified by showing that the divisions most generally adopted at present leave all these powers in a state of confusion and disorder by some these elementary powers are divided into two classes   legislative power   executive power others add to these a third class—power of imposing taxes others again add a fourth class—judicial power when one of these plans has been adopted it has been chosen without much regard to their differences everything has been then considered as sufficiently defined and reasons have then been sought out to support it i shall endeavour to show how vague and obscure these terms are by each one of them sometimes one thing and sometimes another is understood of each power no one knows to which class to refer it—no two persons entertain the same ideas as to what is called legislative or executive power between the condition of a science and the condition of its nomenclature there is a natural connexion with the best arranged nomenclature we may still reason badly but with a badly arranged nomenclature it is not possible to reason correctly legislative power—everybody agrees to understand by this the power of commanding little scruple is made of employing this expression when this power is only exercised over classes especially when the extent of these classes is considerable this title is more willingly yielded to a power whose orders are capable of perpetual duration than to a power whose orders are in their own nature perishable it is agreed to consider that the exercise of this power is free from the restraints which characterize judicial power sometimes it is supposed that it is exercised in chief sometimes the same word is employed to express cases in which it has only a subordinate exercise we are much inclined to call that legislative power which is exercised by a political body executive power that which is exercised by a single individual judicial power—among the authors who have considered this power as distinct from legislative power i have not found one who has appeared to understand the difference the orders of the legislator bear at the same time upon a numerous class of citizens but do not those of the judge the same does he not judge communities provinces those of the legislator are capable of perpetual duration those of the judge are the same also those of the judge bear upon individuals but among the acts which emanate from the power called legislative are there none which do the same before a judge can issue his orders as a judge a concurrence of circumstances is requisite which is not requisite for legalizing the acts of the legislature—   it is necessary that an interested party should come and require the judge to issue the order in question here there is an individual to whom belongs the initiative the right of putting into activity the judicial power   it is necessary that the parties to whom the orders of the judge may prove prejudicial should have the power of opposing them here there are other individuals who have a species of negative power—power of stopping the acts of the judicial power   it is necessary that it should have proof produced of some particular fact upon which the complaint is founded and that the adverse party be permitted to furnish proof to the contrary here then is the person accused whose concurrence is required   where there is a written law it is necessary that the order of the judge should be conformable to what such law prescribes—order to the effect of punishing if it respects a penal case—order to the effect of investing the party with a certain right or of divesting him if it respect a civil case† executive power—at least twelve branches of this power may be distinguished—   subordinate power of legislation over particular districts—over certain classes of citizens—even over all when it refers to a particular function of government the smaller the district—the shorter the duration of the order—the more inconsiderable the object the more one is led to subtract this power from the legislative species in order to carry it to what is called the executive when the supreme power does not oppose these subordinate rules it is the same as if it adopted     them these particular orders are so to speak in execution of its general will but whatever it is it is the power of command   power granted to classes of men—to a fraternity—to a corporation powers of legislation the power of making byelaws it is still the power of command to say i will maintain the laws made by a certain body is the same as making them ones self   power of granting privileges to individuals titles of honour c it is the power of specification in individuos   power of pardoning if it be exercised after inquiry into the facts it is a negation of the judicial power if it be exercised arbitrarily it is the legislative power power of command exercised in opposition to judicial orders   power of locating or dislocating subordinate officers it is a branch of the power of specification   power of coining money of legalizing it of fixing its value—specification in res   military power that of enrolment and disbanding is a branch of the power of specification in personas that of employing is a branch of the power of command the circumstance which has caused it to be considered as a separate power is the use for which it is established   fiscal power this power in itself does not differ from that possessed by the cashier of an individual with regard to the money which is entrusted to him it is constituted a public power in consideration of the source from which the money is derived and the end for which it is designed   power of administration over the magazines munitions of war and other public things this is the same as the management of a house the object alone makes it a political power  0 power of police—specification—command we may observe that for the exercise of military power the power of police and even of management a certain quantity of immediate power is requisite both with regard to the persons and the goods of the citizens in general in order to make use of any power whatever it is necessary that the superior officer should possess immediate power over his inferiors either by being able to dislocate them or by some other means    power of declaring war and making peace this is a branch of the power of specification to declare war is to transfer a class of foreign friends into the class of foreign enemies    power of making treaties with foreign powers the obligation of treaties extends to the mass of the citizens the magistrate who makes a treaty exercises therefore a power of legislation when he promises to another sovereign that his subjects shall not navigate a certain part of the sea he prohibits his subjects from navigating there it is thus that conventions between nations become internal laws i do not know to what length this subdivision of the executive power may be carried the relation which each individual branch bears to each of the others is altogether undetermined they are always supposed to have determinate limits but these limits have never been assigned to them the term executive power presents only one clear idea it is that of one power subordinate to another which is designated by the correlative appellation of legislative power need we then be astonished that there is so much opposition among political writers when all their works have been composed of terms so vague so illdefined and to which each has attached the ideas to which he was accustomed it is not necessary absolutely to exclude these terms adopted into the vocabulary of all the nations of europe but it was necessary to show how far they were from representing the true elements of political powers the new analysis which has been attempted has many weak points it is a subject nearly the whole of which remains to be created the work has been begun but it will require much labour and patience to finish it chapter xxii plan of the political code if we detach from the code of laws a part which should be called the constitutional code the following subjects might be referred to it—   the methods of acquiring the different offices established in the state and also the methods of losing them the greater share the people have in the government the greater the space which this part will occupy   an exposition of the powers annexed to these offices this part would be assimilated in form to the civil code   an exposition of the duties attached to these same offices this part would be assimilated in form to the penal code   an exposition of the formalities which ought to accompany the exercise of the powers attached to these offices in those cases in which they are exercised by political bodies this part would sometimes appear under a penal sometimes a civil face under the first when punishments are pronounced against individuals under the second when there is  00 no other punishment than that of nullity as to the acts of the body   to this code would be consigned the laws which directly bear upon the office of the sovereign laws of this kind clearly exhibit certain acts as directed or prohibited from this quality they bear the aspect of penal laws on the other hand it is natural that they should not express any punishment to be inflicted in case of contravention who could inflict such punishment in this respect they would be contrasted with the penal law among these laws the following species may be distinguished—   privilege granted or reserved to the original mass of the nation—as liberty of worship—right of carrying arms—right of confederation   privileges granted to provinces acquired whether their union to the body of the state arise from succession or from voluntary union as that of not being taxed but by themselves   privileges granted to conquered districts at the time of capitulation and confirmed by treaties of peace   privileges granted to districts ceded by treaty without having been conquered although it may not be easy to apply positive punishment to a delinquent sovereign such laws ought not to be regarded as of no value they are of great importance though positive punishments would be of no force they are attended by the immediate punishment of dishonour to the sovereign and discontent on the part of his subjects—by ulterior punishment in revolt and loss of sovereignty hence we see in many european countries sovereigns scrupulously respecting the privileges of subjects and of provinces chapter xxiii plan of the international code the international code would be a collection of the duties and the rights existing between the sovereign and every other sovereign it may be divided into the universal code and particular codes the first would embrace all the duties that the sovereign was subject to—all the rights with which he was invested with regard to all other nations without distinction there would be a particular code for every nation with which either in virtue of express treaties or from reasons of reciprocal utility he had recognised duties and rights which did not exist with regard to other states the universal code would contain concessions on the one part demands on the other ordinarily reprocity would have place these rights and these duties between sovereigns are properly only the rights and duties of morality for it can scarcely be hoped that all the nations of the world will enter into universal treaties and establish tribunals of national justice division of the laws which compose a particular code—   laws executed—laws to be executed the first are those which regard the two sovereignties in their character of legislators—when in virtue of their treaties they make conformable engagements in their collections of internal law a certain sovereign engages to prevent his subjects from navigating a certain part of the sea he ought then to make a change in his internal laws prohibiting this navigation laws to be executed are—  those which are fulfilled simply by abstaining from the establishment of certain internal laws   those which are fulfilled by exercising or abstaining from the exercise of a certain branch of sovereign power by sending or abstaining from sending assistance by troops or money to another foreign power   those whose fulfilment only regards the personal conduct of the sovereign for example those by which he is obliged to employ or not to employ a certain formula in addressing a foreign sovereign second division—laws of peace—laws of war—those which regulate the conduct of the sovereign and his subjects in time of peace or war towards a foreign sovereign and his subjects the same distribution which has been followed with regard to internal laws whether civil or penal should guide the arrangement of the international laws in the civil code for example the demarcations of the rights of property with respect to immoveables may be the same there are some properties which belong in common to the subjects of a given sovereign there may be some which belong to a given sovereign and a certain foreign sovereign as seas rivers c thus in former times the republic of holland had acquired a species of negative service at the expense of austria in the port of antwerp thus by the treaty of utrecht the english had acquired another with regard to the port of dunkirk the right of marching troops across a foreign country is a species of positive servitude war may be considered as a species of procedure whereby it is sought on the one part or the other to obtain or keep possession of advantages to which each thinks himself entitled it is a writ by which execution is  0  made upon a whole people the attacking sovereign is the plaintiff the sovereign attacked is the defendant those who sustain an offensive and defensive war resemble an individual who has filed a crossbill and sustain two characters at the same time this parallel is of no assistance as to the form or arrangement of the laws but use may be made of it by the introduction of the principles of humanity which would soften the evils of war when two sovereigns are at war the condition of their subjects is respectively changed from foreign friends they become foreign enemies this part of international law brings us back to the plan of particular codes in which sovereigns might stipulate for clauses relative to these changes chapter xxiv plan of the maritime code the maritime code has many parts related to the penal code the civil the military and the international codes   penal—when robbery is committed upon the sea or by persons who come by sea to commit it in certain cases a particular name is given to it—it is piracy but what is the difference whether these offences have for their theatre the dry land or land covered with water and wherefore give them different names   civil—the changes which the sea experiences and which it occasions give rise to many methods of acquiring and losing lands are abandoned by it—islands are discovered in it—shipwrecked goods are thrown up by it from these result a great number of particular arrangements ships are at once houses and carriages large vessels are floating castles the sea if we may use an expression so contradictory in appearance is a species of immoveable always in motion whose value is in certain situations very considerable in others null here it is fruitful there barren here it becomes dry and there it again covers the dry land everywhere it is a highway and a highway that repairs itself in its furthest distances it is as a heath which leads to nothing and brings back nothing this is not all it is too often a field of battle and by this the maritime code has a part in common with the military code we see in an instant the subjects which it offers for the international code the right of chase—the right of harvest or as it is called when speaking of the sea the right of fishing—cannot belong everywhere to all the world it follows then that upon the sea as well as upon the dry land certain properties can be established but as to the right of passage it may be common to everybody without injury to any it remains to be examined how all these points may be regulated for the common utility the maritime code touches the political code in consequence of the powers granted to naval officers admirals captains c a ship is a little wandering province like the island of laputa some vessels of war contain more citizens than there are in the republic of saint martin hitherto the distinction between maritime and terrestrial law if we may use the term has not appeared to rest upon solid foundations still it is desirable because of the particular circumstances in which sailors are placed that they should have a separate code distinct laws for themselves it is a means of simplifying the general code vessels are liable to injure one another this is only a particular case of damage in which there may be as in every other evil intention a smaller or greater degree of fault or pure accident particular regulations may be made upon these points and placed in the maritime code or in treating of damage in the general penal code the most common events with reference to ships may be included there the police of ports would find its most natural place in this code chapter xxv plan of the military code the functions of the military are like those of justice and police sometimes they are employed in the prevention of evil—sometimes in punishing it sometimes the two objects are united in former times military law had greater connexion with the civil than it has at present it was thus under the feudal system landed property was given instead of salary engagements to perform military service were the principal means of acquiring land the nonrendering of these services was the principal means of losing it every baron exercised almost unlimited power over his unhappy vassals all rights floated in uncertainty in these times of anarchy what ought we to call each powerful chief was he a sovereign or a subject—a robber or a soldier—a magistrate or a tyrant as to the multitude their condition was too clearly decided it was a condition of the harshest slavery how free soever may be the constitution of a state powers over the people to be exercised upon certain occasions must necessarily be given to the defenders of such country that they may be able to protect it these powers always objects of suspicion are much more so when undefined the first object should be to shut them up into the narrowest limits the next to mark out  0  these limits with the greatest clearness and if on certain occasions they must necessarily be unlimited it is better to announce this in the law than to preserve a timid silence—the occasion itself which gives rise to this power may then serve as its limits if there be no other the dictatorship of the romans is an instance of this kind the same procedures which when authorised by the laws produce no sensation would appear the height of tyranny if they were arbitrary in the first case they would have a limit and the honour of the laws would remain untouched in the second no one would be able to see where they would end and the authority of the laws would be trampled under foot since in a complete system every power which was not derived from the laws would be an infraction of the laws those that are not with me are against me take an example—care has been taken to provide for the maintenance of the troops by general arrangements in such manner as not to hurt individuals but it may happen from a thousand unforeseen accidents that a certain body of troops large or small is in want of necessaries especially in time of war but what would the law say to them they would not allow themselves to die of hunger with arms in their hands if it were possible to procure food it is better courageously to provide for this emergency and to give to the lowest serjeant the right of making suitable requisitions than to be silent from fear and to leave everything to chance and to violence let there be no refined formalities freely concede a power that may be seized in despite of the laws reserving to yourself the power of ascertaining the facts for the purpose of punishing its abuse and indemnifying the parties injured act in the same manner with regard to the extraordinary powers which it may be necessary to grant to commanders for the defence either of towns or countries to carry off provisions—to break down bridges—to cut down trees—to burn houses—to inundate the country—all these extremities may become necessary and they will be neither more nor less so from having been authentically provided for if there be not a clear and precise permission—sometimes out of vexation the strict line of necessity will be surpassed to the detriment of individuals sometimes from fear only half measures will be taken to the peril of the public welfare such are the points by which the military code is connected with the penal and civil code it will be clearly perceived that it has a continual connexion with the international code it would be proper to place these relations in the clearest light by a train of reciprocal references with reference to military operations they may be considered as the execution of a law—as a species of process against the foreign disturbers of the state as ordinary procedure has its principal and accessory ends so military procedure has its own—the principal end is to overcome the enemy the accessory end is not to oppress the citizen in relation to the first to indicate the means to be employed would be to make a treatise upon the art of war a labour not required here still however if on the side of ideas it belongs to soldiers by profession on the side of method and style it belongs to the ordinary legislature whilst as to the means of attaining the accessory end the most efficacious are to grant a great latitude of powers upon verifying all the facts and rendering the chiefs responsible chapter xxvi plan of the ecclesiastical code the subjects of the ecclesiastical code may have reference partly to the penal and partly to the civil codes—partly to the constitutional and partly to the international codes we have seen in the catalogue of offences an order composed of those offences whose tendency is to abuse the motive of religion or to weaken its power in the cases in which it is employed in the service of the state—thus far it is penal in the greater number of religions there is established a class of men whose condition consists in cultivating and directing the influence of this motive in the minds of the other citizens the persons clothed with this condition sometimes hold instead of salaries certain lands which for the accomplishment of the designs of the donors are subjected to other rules than those affecting the lands of other citizens it is by such circumstances that the ecclesiastical code is connected with the civil code almost everywhere there is annexed to this condition certain political powers either over the body of the people or over the members of the same fraternity here is a connexion with constitutional law the principles which ought to regulate their salaries are the same as those which ought to regulate those of all other services in the state this belongs to remuneratory law in granting to this class certain rights and powers—in subjecting them to certain obligations they have also been subjected to certain incapacities these incapacities are sometimes civil as interdiction of marriage sometimes political as exclusion from certain military public or judicial employments it may happen that the ecclesiastical class in a country has a foreign head and that the  0  political sovereign allows this foreign chief to exercise his powers in matters of religion it may be that these powers exercised by foreigners may be in the hand of a pope or of an assembly as of councils c c here there is a connexion with the code of international law in this code the principles which ought to guide the legislator are few in number and are—as respects penal law toleration in respect of political rights—submission in regard to the sovereign—equality in regard to their fellowcitizens and if it be possible among themselves—as respects their salaries economy chapter xxvii plan of remuneratory laws the system of these laws could not have any plan which should belong to itself alone remuneratory laws will be found dispersed here and there throughout the penal code without having any regular correspondence with offences since it is not possible to apply a reward to every law as one applies a punishment pleasure in as far as it is at the disposal of the legislator is a motive whose force is too precarious and the quantity of it too small to allow of its being depended upon in reference to objects of the first necessity it is a useful auxiliary but the service of the laws requires a regular and permanent force such as can only be found in punishments reward can scarcely be employed except for the production of extraordinary services—works of supererogation sometimes a principal law has for its support two subsidiary laws of opposite natures the one penal in case of disobedience the other remuneratory in case of obedience thus a wise law by directing every individual who becomes acquainted with a crime to denounce it to the magistrate threatens a punishment against him who conceals it and proposes a reward for him who denounces it sometimes the reward is placed in front and the punishment is so to speak placed behind to support it thus when it is desired that certain burthensome offices should be discharged a salary is attached to them to induce persons to undertake them with good will but if this method fail it is necessary to use constraint in enlisting soldiers and sailors it is usual to begin by offering bounties and to finish by ballot and impressment the laws which adopt which guarantee contracts and dispositions of goods between individuals are a species of remuneratory laws in the cases in which these contracts these dispositions have for their objects services rendered or to be rendered remuneratory laws belong under this aspect to the civil code the most extended field for the remuneratory system is political economy—public instruction might also make great use of it those methods which elevate the soul and give to the mind the elasticity of pleasure are preferable in the treatment of youth to those which sudden it and accustom it only to act from fear rewards are sometimes distributed in virtue of general and permanent laws sometimes according to the good pleasure of those who direct the public funds a reward granted without having been promised exactly resembles in form the penal law which would be called ex post facto—i say as to the form for all the world sees at once that a penal law passed after the act is a revolting injustice a reward in the same case is precisely the opposite is it well applied it is so much rather an act of wisdom on the part of the government that it resembles a general invitation addressed to all persons to direct their services to all objects of utility without fear that in case of success they will lose their labour chapter xxviii of political economy the distinction marked by the word economy is applicable rather to a branch of the science of legislation than to a division in a code of laws it is much easier to say what branch of this science should be called political economy than to say what laws are economical the most powerful means of augmenting national wealth are those which maintain the security of properties and which gently favour their equalization such are the objects of civil and penal law those arrangements which tend to increase the national wealth by other means than security and equality if there be any such may be considered as belonging to the class of economical laws it may be said there is a science distinct from every other which is called political economy the mind can abstractly consider everything which concerns the wealth of nations and form a general theory concerning it but i do not see that there can exist a code of laws concerning political economy distinct and separate from all the other codes the collection of laws upon this subject would only be a mass of imperfect shreds drawn without distinction from the whole body of laws political economy for example has reference to the penal laws which create the species of offences which have been called offences against population and offences against the national wealth  0  political economy would be found connected with the international code by treaties of commerce and with the financial code by the taxes and their effects upon the public wealth chapter xxix plan of the financial code the matter of this code will coincide partly with the civil partly with the penal partly with the constitutional and partly with the international codes the regulations to which property and trade are subjected on account of taxes belong to the civil code in as far as regards the duties of the contributors the financial coincides with the penal code and with that species of offence which is called nonpayment of taxes in relation to the rights and duties of the officers set apart for this branch of administration the financial is connected with the constitutional code and sometimes with the international code the receipt of taxes bears the same relation to their assessment as procedure bears to substantive law the one answers to why—the other to how much finance has its indirect as well as its direct laws these consist in simply saying pay such a tax on such an occasion the indirect consist of those precautions which are taken to prevent individuals from withdrawing themselves from the payment of taxes if fiscal laws are generally very complicated it is because they are generally directed against accessory offences with respect to the principles which ought to regulate taxes they form part of the science of political economy a treatise upon finance ought to begin with two tables—a table of all the inconveniences which can possibly result from every kind of tax   a table of all the taxes arranged in the most convenient order for facilitating the comparison and showing the particular qualities of each one first object of finance—to find the money without constraint—without making any person experience the pain of loss and of privation second object—to take care that this pain of constraint and privation be reduced to the lowest term third object—to avoid giving rise to evils accessory to the obligation of paying the tax one essential object in a treatise of finance would be to simplify the language—to banish false metaphorical and obscure expressions—to restore everything to clearness and truth few persons know how much technical terms have contributed to conceal errors to mask quackery to confine the science to a small number of adepts who have made of it a species of monopoly the knowledge of this jargon has become a cabalistic sign by which the initiated recognise each other and the obscurities of the language have enabled financiers to deceive the simple up to a certain point with regard to transactions which would otherwise have been at once recognised as nefarious—a theft for example is called a retaining these artifices of style have their place in other matters it is thought better to say of a minister that he has been thanked than dismissed but in a treatise upon the principles of legislation the right word ought to be employed—the word which correctly expresses the real fact without concealment how numerous are the questions which appear difficult to be resolved and even insolvable because terms are employed which have no meaning or which only present incorrect ideas chapter xxx plan of procedure code in arranging matters of procedure it is necessary to regard four principles—  the order of the offences which it is intended to combat or of rights not enjoyed which it is intended to cause to be enjoyed   the order of the ends which can be proposed in combating the ill effects of each offence   the chronological order of the steps which may be taken on the one side or on the other in the pursuit of these ends   the power to be exercised provisionally for securing the justiciability of the accused we commence then by the system of procedure which is suitable to every offence to arrest to indemnify to prevent—these three objects of the legislator give rise to three distinct branches—procedure ad compescendum† ad compensandum ad præveniendum these three branches are not required with regard to every offence because they may all be secured by seeking them together with respect to precautions for submitting  0  the party to justice there are two things to be done—to secure the person of the accused or his goods—or to admit him to give bail the necessity of these precautions is determined by the intensity of the punishment the punishment attached to the offence of which an individual is accused may be such that he would choose rather to indemnify his sureties or to leave them to suffer in his stead than to expose himself to it in this case we can possess no other security than that of his person but if it can be presumed either from his property or from other motives determining his residence that he would submit to the judgment which may be pronounced against him rather than escape it by flight imprisonment would be a useless rigour it is not so much the nature of the offence as the responsibility of the accused which ought to determine these precautions a poor man and especially a stranger ought to be arrested when there would be no necessity for arresting a rich man or a housekeeper not that the stranger ought to be more ill treated than the resident inhabitant or the poor than the rich but because the circumstances of the one offer a guarantee which the circumstances of the other do not yield necessity alone can authorize the slightest degree of constraint the distinction between criminal procedure slightly criminal and civil may be preserved or they may be exchanged for other terms—procedure of rigour—procedure of less rigour—procedure without rigour the code of procedure will be much shortened by distributing it into general and particular titles all offences with regard to which the same procedure may be pursued ought to be placed together and designated by a common title penal suits have direct reference to offences suits of demand commonly called civil suits have direct reference to rights and indirect reference to offences care should also be taken to prepare formulas for all cases which are susceptible of them that is to say for everything which in the course of the trial may be done by a general rule chapter xxxi of the integrality of the code of laws it is not sufficient that a code of laws has been well digested withregard to its extent it ought also to be complete for the attainment of this object it is necessary at once to embrace the whole of legislation—and this principal object has never yet been attempted i have ventured to undertake it and i have so to speak projected the sphere of the laws that all its parts may be seen at one view the collection of the laws made upon this plan would be vast but this is no reason for omitting anything whether a law be written or unwritten it is not less necessary that it should be known to shut ones eyes to the mass of the burthen we are obliged to bear is not a means of lightening its weight besides what part ought to be excluded to what obligation ought the citizens to be subjected without their knowledge the laws are a snare for those who are ignorant of them this ignorance would be one of the greatest crimes of governments if it were not the effect of their incapacity and unfitness caligula suspended the table of his laws upon lofty columns that he might render the knowledge of them difficult how numerous are the countries in which these matters are still worse the laws are not even upon tables—they are not even written that is done from indolence which the roman emperor did from tyranny a complete digest such is the first rule whatever is not in the code of laws ought not to be law nothing ought to be referred either to custom or to foreign law or to pretended natural law or to pretended laws of nations does the legislator who adopts for example the roman law know what he does can he know it is it not a field of eternal disputes is it not in one word to render arbitrary everything which he pretends to take from it is not this amalgamation sufficient to corrupt the whole code when we add together two quantities the one finite and the other infinite that the sum will be infinite is a mathematical axiom i do not say that if among the states of a sovereign he find a province a town which has its customs its unwritten laws to the preservation of which he finds himself bound either by convention or custom he ought to abolish them no without doubt but taking the necessary precautions he may confirm them fix them by writing it was thus that charles v acted with regard to hainault it is objected to the forming a code of laws that it is not possible to foresee every case which can happen i acknowledge that it is not possible to foresee them individually but they may be foreseen in their species for example a person may be assured that every species of offence are comprised in the tables which this work includes although he may not be assured that every possible individual offence has been foreseen with a good method we go before events instead of following them we govern them instead of being their sport a narrowminded and timid legislature waits till particular evils have arisen before it prepares a remedy an enlightened legislature foresees and prevents them by general precautions civil and penal laws were necessarily at first  0  made by groping about according as circumstances required them in this manner the breaches were filled up with the body of their victims but this procedure of the ages of barbarism ought not to be followed in the age of civilization of all the codes which legislators have considered as complete there is not one which is so the danish is the most ancient code it is dated      the swedish code is dated      the code frédéric      the sardiman    0 in the preface to the danish code it is expressly stated to be complete however it contains nothing about taxes no regulations relating to professions nothing about the succession to the crown nothing about the powers of any subaltern officers except those of justice nothing respecting international law no formularies either for contracts or the disposal of goods or for different stages of procedure it is however the least incomplete of all the codes in the swedish code all those parts are wanting which are wanting in the danish code it also wants the section on political or constitutional law the code frédéric stated in its titlepage to be universal is absolutely limited to civil law it acknowledges that it is far from complete for it speaks of feudal law that it proposes afterwards to digest—of a part of the canon law on which it does not touch—of many statutes of towns and provinces which it reserves for examination c the sardinian code recognises the roman law as its foundation and frequently refers to it under the name of common law it could not more effectually have plunged everything into uncertainty i say nothing of the methods followed in these codes legislative science was too little advanced to furnish them with models of arrangement and distribution the object of these observations is not to depreciate the presents that these sovereigns made to their people he who has been least successful in the composition of a code has conferred an immense benefit in digesting the body of laws they have at least in a great measure caused the repetitions and contradictions of the laws to disappear they have delivered their people from unwritten law—law which is uncertain in its essence—law without beginning and without end—law by which animals are governed and which is disgraceful to men written law is alone deserving of the name of law unwritten law is properly speaking conjectural law written law has a certain manifest foundation there is a legislator—there is a will—there is an expression of that will a known period of its birth unwritten law possesses none of those qualities its origin is unknown it goes on continually increasing—it can never be finished it is continually altering without observation if there be a lawgiver it is the judge himself—a legislator each one of whose laws is only applicable to a particular case and always necessarily ex post facto—a legislator the promulgation of whose laws is only made by the ruin of the individuals to whom they refer the grand utility of the law is certainty unwritten law does not—it cannot—possess this quality the citizen can find no part of it cannot take it for his guide he is reduced to consultations—he assembles the lawyers—he collects as many opinions as his fortune will permit and all this ruinous procedure often serves only to create new doubts nothing but the greatest integrity in a tribunal can prevent the judges from making an unwritten law a continual instrument of favour and corruption but wherever it exists lawyers will be its defenders and perhaps innocently its admirers they love the source of their power of their reputation of their fortune they love unwritten law for the same reason that the egyptian priest loved hieroglyphics for the same reason that the priests of all religions have loved their peculiar dogmas and mysteries chapter xxxii of purity in the composition of a code of laws by purity in a composition of a code of laws i mean the absence of all heterogenous matter of all foreign mixture of everything which is not law—of everything which is not the pure and simple expression of the will of the legislator laws made for all times ought to be above all little passions they ought to command and instruct—they ought not to descend from their elevation to dispute with individuals leges non decet esse disputantes says bacon sed jubentes he ought to have added et docentes i see with regret the compiler of the code of a great nation incessantly occupied in triumphing over the lawyers the royal sceptre committed to his hands is used as an instrument of combat such formulas as the following are continually found—it has been questioned—some lawyers have pretended—some have denied—others have affirmed but we will and direct—we abolish by these presents these distinctions altogether destitute of foundation c c men things opinions ought all to be considered on the great scale conciliation should be the object of the legislator and not triumph he should rise above all ephemeral strife  0  another form not less vicious is that of enveloping the will of the legislator in a foreign will in the same code such expressions as these are frequently found—the civil laws declare—the laws exclude—the laws have granted what laws are referred to who made them besides is not this anterior law—this natural law to which we are referred and which is made the foundation of the law—is it not a source of obscurity—is it not a veil which intercepts the will of the real legislator the compilers of the justinian code have given examples of these faults instead of making the legislator say i will they make him every moment say it appears to me the emperor so completely forgets his dignity as to say it is thus that titius or sempronius think he forgets it still more when he remains in suspense between two opposite authorities it is thus that titius thinks but sempronius thinks otherwise historical disquisitions ought not to have place in the general collection of the laws it is not necessary to cite what the romans did if what they did was good do like them but do not talk of them the great utility of a code of laws is to cause both the debates of lawyers and the bad laws of former times to be forgotten chapter xxxiii of the style of the laws the perfections of which the style of the laws are capable may be distinguished into those which are essential and those which are secondary the first consist in avoiding the different faults of which this style is susceptible the second in employing those beauties which are suitable to the subject the desirable object of the laws in regard to style is that it may be such that at every moment in which they ought to influence the conduct of a citizen he may have presented to his mind an exact idea of the will of the legislator in this respect for the accomplishment of this object two things are requisite—  that at the moment in question the idea should already have been placed in his mind   that it shall not have escaped from it this idea will not have been correctly placed in the mind—  when the words employed do not convey any idea   when they present only part of the idea intended to be conveyed   when instead of this idea they present another altogether different   when they include other propositions in conjunction with that intended by the legislator hence we discover that clearness precision is one of the essential qualities of this style as it is also to be wished that the idea once correctly placed in the mind should remain there always ready for use and as men differ in regard to the strength of their memories and the more any one endeavours to load his memory the more he is likely to forget we have learned that another important quality in this style is brevity   quicquid præcipies esto brevis ut cito dicta   percipiant animi dociles teneantque fideles   de arte poet        such was the precept of horace eighteen centuries ago but hitherto in respect to england his precept has been delivered in vain defects of style may be referred to four heads—unintelligibility—equivocality—too great extent—too great limitation as an example i may employ a law cited by puffendorf promulgated in a country in which assassination had become common—whosoever draws blood in the streets shall be put to death a surgeon found a man faint and bled him in the street this circumstance showed the necessity of interpretation that is it displayed one of the defects of the law this enactment was defective by excess and by defect—by excess in that it admitted of no exception with regard to those cases in which the drawing of blood in the streets might be either useful or innocent by defect in that it did not extend to murder and other methods of wounding not less dangerous than those by which blood is spilled if it were the intention of the legislator to comprehend in his prohibition all kinds of grievous injuries which could be committed in public places he did not know how to express himself clearly a judge confining himself to the text of the law would punish with death slight accidents and even acts of mercy another judge equally faithful to the text would leave unpunished more hurtful acts of violence than those which shed blood the law which presents different significations to a judge cannot fail to be wanting in precision and clearness to individuals one will find a man struck by apoplexy and will prudently leave him to die another listening to the voice of humanity will violate the law and succour the sick man and thus expose himself to be condemned by the inflexible judge another trusting in the literal sense of the law will leave his adversary half dead with his blows in the manner of that archbishop who that he might not shed blood made use of a mace it is to be wished that those minds which consider it beneath the dignity of genius scrupulously to attend to the care of words would reflect upon this example as are the words such is the law laws can only be  0  made with words life liberty property honour—everything which is dear to us depends upon the choice of words in all cases of want of precision the fault arises either from the choice made of the words or from the manner in which they are put together that is to say either from the terminology or from the syntax in either case it is an affair of grammar and we may remark that besides being enlightened it behoves the legislator either to be or to employ a consummate grammarian with regard to brevity a distinction is necessary a code of laws prepared upon the best plan and reduced to the smallest dimensions will always be too large to be committed to the memory entire hence the necessity of separating into distinct codes those parts which are intended for the use of particular classes who have need to be more particularly acquainted with one part of the laws than another brevity of style may regard sentences and paragraphs as well as the whole body of the laws lengthiness is particularly vicious when it is found in connexion with the expression of the will of the legislator the faults opposed to brevity which may be found in a paragraph are—   repetition in terms   virtual repetition or tautology as for example when the king of france is made to say we will we direct and it pleases us   repetition of specific words instead of the generic term   repetition of the definition instead of the proper term which ought to be defined once for all   the development of phrases instead of employing the usual ellipses for example when mention is made of the two sexes in cases in which the masculine would have marked them both cases in which the singular and plural are both used when one of the two numbers would have been sufficient   useless details for example in regard to time when instead of confining ones self to the event which would serve for this effect it has been made dependent on some anterior event or train of events it is by the collection of all these defects that the english statutes have acquired their unbearable prolixity and that the english law is smothered amidst a redundancy of words it is not enough that the whole of a paragraph is concise in regard to the number of ideas that it presents the sentences in which they are presented should have this same quality this circumstance is equally of importance whether it concerns the understanding or the retaining the sense of a paragraph the shorter the distance between the beginning and the ending of each sentence the more numerous the points of repose for the mind in the english statutes sentences may be found which would make a small volume pitching blocks are erected in certain places in the streets of london for porters with their loads when will english legislators take equal care for the relief of the minds of those who study their labours it is not only desirable that the paragraphs be short they ought to be numbered some means is necessary for separating and distinguishing them that of numbering is the most simple the least liable to mistake the most easy for citation and reference the british acts of parliament are still defective in this respect the division into sections and the numbers which designate them in the current editions are not authentic in the original parliamentary roll the text of the law is one single piece without distinction of paragraph without punctuation without a figure by what means is the commencement and the termination of an article shown it is only by the repetition of the introductory clauses—and further be it enacted and it is further enacted by the authority aforesaid or some other phrase of the same kind these are so to speak a species of algebraic notation but of an opposite character in algebra one letter supplies the place of a multitude of words and figures here a line of words very imperfectly supplies the place of a single figure i say imperfectly for though these words may serve for the purpose of division they do not serve for the purpose of reference is it wished to amend or revoke one article in an act as it is impossible to designate this article by a numerical reference it is necessary to employ periphrasis and repetitions always long and always obscure hence english acts of parliament are compositions unintelligible to those who have not by long use acquired facility in consulting them this evil has arisen from a superstitious attachment to ancient customs the first acts of parliament were passed at a time when punctuation was not in use—when the arabic figures were unknown besides the statutes in their state of original simplicity and imperfection were so short and so few that the want of division did not produce sensible inconvenience things have remained upon the same footing from negligence from habit or from secret and interested opposition to all reform we have lived for ages without using stops and figures why adopt them today this argument is above all reply with regard to perfections of the second order they may be reduced to three—force harmony and nobleness force and harmony depend in part upon the mechanical qualities of the words employed—in part upon the manner in which they are arranged nobleness  0  depends principally upon the accessory ideas which they are calculated to excite or to avoid barren though the subjects of the laws may be they are susceptible of a species of eloquence which belongs to them and of which the utility ought not to be despised as it tends to conciliate the popular sanction with this view the legislator might sprinkle here and there moral sentences provided they were very short and in accordance with the subject and he would not do ill if he were to allow marks of his paternal tenderness to flow down upon his paper as proofs of the benevolence which guides his pen why should the legislator be ashamed to appear as a father why should he not show that even his severities themselves are benefits this species of beauty has been remarked with pleasure in the political code as well as in the instructions of catherine ii it was also exhibited in the preambles to certain edicts of louis xvi under the ministry of two men who did honour to france and to humanity having made these general observations the following rules may be given as practical directions—   it is proper as much as possible not to put into a code of laws any other legal terms than such as are familiar to the people   if it be necessary to employ technical terms care ought to be taken to define them in the body of the laws themselves   the terms of such definitions ought to be common and known words or at least the chain of definitions more or less known ought always to finish by a link formed of such words   the same ideas the same words never employ other than a single and the same word for expressing a single and the same idea it is in the first place a means of abridgment because the explanation of the term once given will serve for all times and the identity of the words contributes still more to clearness than to brevity for if they vary it is always a problem to be solved whether it have been intended to express the same ideas whereas when the same words are employed there can be no doubt but that the meaning is the same those who are iavish of their words know little of the danger of mistakes and that in matters of legislation they cannot be too scrupulous the words of the laws ought to be weighed like diamonds the composition of a code of laws will have required so much the more knowledge in proportion as it shall demand less knowledge to comprehend it in works of art the perfection of art consists in its concealment in a code of laws addressed to the people and to the least intelligent portion of the people the perfection of science will be attained when its efforts are not perceived and its results are characterized by noble simplicity if in the foregoing work science have been found and even theory and abstract science it ought to be remembered that it has been necessary to combat a multitude of errors created by false science—to establish principles so ancient and so new that to some eyes they will not appear to be discoveries whilst to others they will appear altogether paradoxical it has been necessary to introduce order into the chaos of nomenclature with respect to rights offences contracts obligations—to substitute in the place of an incoherent and confused jargon a language very imperfect but still more clear more correct and more conformable to analogy in a word as respects the scientific part of the law it has been necessary to unlearn and to reconstruct the whole no one can be more disgusted than myself at the abuse of science—no one can be more sensible of the ill effects it produces if i have not attained my object i believe that i have shown the way to it if comparison should be made between my labours and the books of actual law these will be found bristling with a certain science as repulsive as it is inexact and useless and which owes its obscurity to its own absurdity—whilst by how much the more this project has abounded in science by so much the less will it be necessary that any should appear in the text of the laws i have endeavoured to throw the burthen upon the legislator that the yoke may be lightened for the people i have given the labour to the strong that the repose of the weak may be better secured a code formed upon these principles would not require schools for its explanation would not require casuists to unravel its subtilties it would speak a language familiar to everybody each one might consult it at his need it would be distinguished from all other books by its greater simplicity and clearness the father of a family without assistance might take it in his hand and teach it to his children and give to the precepts of private morality the force and dignity of public morals chapter xxxiv of the interpretation conservation and improvement of a code the code of laws having been thus prepared it will be desirable to preserve it from the injuries to which it is liable both as to its matter and as to its form for this purpose it will be necessary to forbid the introduction of all unwritten law it will not be sufficient to cut off the head of the hydra the wound must be cauterized   0 that new heads may not be produced if a new case occur not provided for by the code the judge may point it out and indicate the remedy but no decision of any judge much less the opinion of any individual should be allowed to be cited as law until such decision or opinion have been embodied by the legislator in the code it should be directed that the text of the law should be the standard of the law in judging whether a given case fall within the law the text ought to be kept principally in view the examples which may be given being designed only to explain not to restrain the purport of the law if any commentary should be written on this code with a view of pointing out what is the sense thereof all men should be required to pay no regard to such comment neither should it be allowed to be cited in any court of justice in any manner whatsoever neither by express words nor by any circuitous designation but if any judge or advocate should in the course of his practice see occasion to remark anything in it that appears to him erroneous in point of matter or in point of style defective redundant or obscure let him certify such observation to the legislature with the reasons of his opinion and the correction he would propose if there should be any particular provision that appears at first sight to be repugnant to one more general they should if possible be reconciled if not let the particular provision prevail over the general for this reason—the particular provision is established upon a nearer and more exact view of the subject than the general of which it may be regarded as a correction but if such a case should ever happen it is a blemish in the law itself and ought to be corrected and when observed by a judge should be represented to the legislature whatsoever the legislator had in view and intended to express but failed to express either through haste or inaccuracy of language so much it belongs to the judges in the way of interpretation to supply when however a passage appears to be obscure let it be cleared up rather by alteration than by comment retrench add substitute as much as you will—but never explain by the latter certainty will generally—perspicuity and brevity will always suffer the more words there are the more words are there about which doubts may be entertained finally once in a hundred years let the laws be revised for the sake of changing such terms and expressions as by that time may have become obsolete—remembering that this will be more needful in regard to the language of the legal formularies in use than that of the text of the laws themselves     pannomial fragments chapter i general observations by a pannomion understand on this occasion an allcomprehensive collection of law—that is to say of rules expressive of the will or wills of some person or persons belonging to the community or say society in question with whose will in so far as known or guessed at all other members of that same community in question whether from habit or otherwise are regarded as disposed to act in compliance in the formation of such a work the sole proper allcomprehensive end should be the greatest happiness of the whole community governors and governed together—the greatesthappiness principle should be the fundamental principle the next specific principle is the happinessnumeration principle rule in case of collision and contest happiness of each party being equal prefer the happiness of the greater to that of the lesser number maximizing universal security—securing the existence of and sufficiency of the matter of subsistence for all the members of the community—maximizing the quantity of the matter of abundance in all its shapes—securing the nearest approximation to absolute equality in the distribution of the matter of abundance and the other modifications of the matter of property that is to say the nearest approximation consistent with universal security as above for subsistence and maximization of the matter of abundance—by these denominations or for shortness by the several words security subsistence abundance and equality may be characterized the several specific ends which in the character of means stand next in subordination to the all embracing end—the greatest happiness of the greatest number of the individuals belonging to the community in question the following are the branches of the pannomion to which the ends immediately subordinate to the greatesthappiness principle respectively correspond— to constitutional law the axioms and principles applying to equality to penal law the axioms and principles applying to security viz as to—  person   reputation   property   condition in life the principle presiding over that branch of the penal code which is employed in the endeavour to arrest or apply remedy to offences     considered as being and being intended to be productive of suffering to one party without producing enjoyment otherwise than from the contemplation of such suffering to the other is the positivepainpreventing principle rule let not any one produce pain on the part of any other for no other purpose than the pleasure derived from the contemplation of that same pain the persons for the regulation of whose conduct the positivepainpreventing principle applies are—   the subject citizens taken at large   the sovereign in respect of the quantity and thence the quality of the subsequentially preventive or say punitive remedy applied by him against any offence to civil law more particularly apply the axioms relating to security as to property sole principle—the disappointmentpreventing principle rule applying to the aggregate composed of the several sources of positive good or happiness elements of prosperity objects as they thus are of general desire among a number of persons competitors actually or eventually possible for the benefit or source of happiness in question exceptions excepted give it to that one in whose breast the greatest quantity of pain of disappointment will have place in the event of his not having the thing thenceforward in his possession or say at his command the exception is when by any different disposition happiness in greater quantity probability taken into account will be produced of any such exception the existence ought not to be assumed if it exist the proof of its existence lies upon him by whom its existence is asserted to political economy apply the axioms and principles relating to subsistence and abundance to political economy—that is to say to those portions of the penal and civil codes in the rationale of which considerations suggested by the art and science of political economy are applicable and have place considerations over and above and independent of the sensations produced by loss and gain by axioms of moral and political pathology understand so many general propositions by each of which statement is made of the pleasure or pain chiefly of the pain produced by the several sorts of evils which are the result of human agency on the part of the several individuals respectively affected by them to wit by means of the influence exercised by them on the quantity or degree in which the benefits expressed by the forementioned all important words are by the respective parties agents and patients enjoyed or the opposite burthens constituted by the absence of them endured of these propositions it will be observed that they divide themselves into groups—one group being relative to security another to subsistence a third to abundance the fourth and last to equality the first bringing to view the enjoyment derived from the undisturbed possession of security at large—security in the most comprehensive application made of the word contrasted with the enjoyment producible by the breach of it—the second group bringing to view the subject of subsistence—the third group bringing to view the subject of abundance—and the fourth group bringing to view the subject of equality and stating the evil consequence of any legislative arrangement by which a defalcation from the maximum of practicable equality is effected in each of the axioms the antagonizing or say competing interests of two parties are conjointly brought to view—in those which relate to security these parties are the maleficent agent or say wrongdoer and the patient wronged—in those which relate to subsistence abundance and equality they are the parties whose interests stand in competition no blame being supposed to have place on either side by the legislator preference should be given to that interest by preference to which the happiness of the greatest number will be most augmented to the first of the three stages of the progress made in society by the good or evil flowing from a human act belong the effects of which indication is given in and announced by these same four groups of axioms the principles which form the groundwork of the here proposed system correspond to the abovementioned specific ends immediately subordinate to the allcomprehensive end expressed for shortness by the greatesthappiness principle—and have their foundation in observations on the pathology of the human mind as expressed in the abovementioned propositions to which in consideration of their supposed incontrovertibility and extensive applicability have been given for distinction sake the name of axioms as to these principles the names by which expression is given to them have for their object and purpose conciseness—the conveying by means of these several compound substantives a conception of the several groups of pathological effects in a manner more concise and thence more commodious than by a repetition made each time of the several groups of axioms to which they correspond and which they are employed to recal to mind correspondent to the axioms having reference to security will be found the principles following—   principle correspondent to security and the axioms thereto belonging is the securityproviding principle     of the securityproviding principle the following modifications may be brought to view corresponding to the several objects respecting which security requires to be afforded— i the objects for or say in respect of which security is endeavoured are these—   person the person of individuals on the occasion of which body and mind require to be distinguished   reputation the reputation of individuals or classes or say the degree of estimation in which they are respectively held   property the masses of the matter of wealth respectively belonging to them and possessed by them in the shape of capital or in the shape of income   power the portions of power respectively belonging to them for whose sake soever or say to whose benefit soever exerciseable whether for the sake and benefit of the individual powerholder himself—or for the sake of other persons one or more in any number in which case the power is styled a trust and the powerholder a trustee and the person or persons for whose benefit it is exercised or designed to be exercised entitled benefitee and the person or persons by whom the trust was created a trustor   rank or say factitious reputation or estimation—the source of factitious reputation or estimation put into the possession of the individual by a series of delusions operating on the imagination   condition in life in so far as beneficial the aggregate benefits included in it will be found composed of the above objects two or more of them n b the four lastmentioned objects may for conciseness sake be spoken of as so many modifications of the matter of prosperity   miscellaneous rights including exemptions from burthensome obligations   the maleficent acts or say offences against which the endeavour is used to apply the appropriate punitive and other remedies   the contingently maleficent agents against whose maleficent acts the endeavour will be used to employ the several remedial applications these may be—   external or say foreign governments and subjects considered as liable to become adversaries code in which provision is made against evil from that source the constitutional ch c defensive force—subdepartments of the administration department those of the army and the navy ministers   internal viz fellowcitizens as distinguished into—  fellowcitizens at large or say nonfunctionaries   functionaries considered in respect of the evil producible by them in such their several capacities   the several classes of persons to whom by the several arrangements employed the security is endeavoured to be afforded these may be distinguished into—  citizens of the state in question distinguished into—  persons considered in their individual capacities correspondent offences—private offences   persons considered in classes correspondent offences—semipublic offences   functionaries as such considered in the aggregate correspondent offences—public offences such as are purely public in contradistinction to such as are privatepublic offences affecting their individual capacity but constituted public offences by the indefinable multitude of the individuals liable to be affected   foreigners with reference to the state in question—governments and subjects as above included a modification of the securityproviding principle applying to security in respect of all modifications of the matter of property is the disappointmentpreventing principle the use of it is to convey intimation of the reason for whatever arrangements come to be made for affording security in respect of property and the other modifications of the matter of prosperity considered with a view to the interest of the individual possessor in the aggregate of these are contained all the securityrequiring objects as above with the exception of person ii subsistencesecuring principle correspondent subordinate end in view—subsistence the use of it is to convey intimation of the reason for whatever arrangements come to be made for the purpose of securing for the use of the community in question a sufficient quantity of the matter of subsistence iii abundancemaximizing principle the use of it is to convey intimation of the reasons for whatever arrangements may come to be made in contemplation of their conduciveness to the accomplishment of that end iv equalitymaximizing or say more properly inequalityminimizing principle the use of it is to convey intimation of the reasons for whatever arrangements come to be made in contemplation of their conduciveness to this end chapter ii consideranda subjects of consideration on the present occasion are the following—pleasures and pains—happiness and unhappiness—good and evil—ends and means—rules and principles—axioms of pathology physical and mental—or say psychological—observation and experiment of these many are mutually correlative—all are intimately connected with and give and receive explanation to and from each other     happiness is a word employed to denote the sum of the pleasures experienced during that quantity of time which is under consideration deduction made or not made of the quantity of pain experienced during that same quantity of time unhappiness is a word employed to denote the sum of pains experienced during the quantity of time which is under consideration deduction made or not made of the quantity of pleasure experienced during that same quantity of time good is a word employed to denote either pleasure or exemption from pain—and the cause efficient and more or less effective of either evil is a word employed to denote either pain or loss of pleasure or a cause efficient and more or less effective of either in regard to good and evil consider— i their condition or import as to existence and nonexistence their existential character or say character or mode of designation in regard to existence or say logical character—this is either positive or negative positive good is that which assumes not the existence of evil and which accordingly might have place if there were no such thing as evil negative good is that which is constituted by the nonexistence of evil on the occasion in question positive evil is that which assumes not the existence of good and which accordingly might have place if there were no such thing as good ii in regard to each their quality by good understand either pleasure or the absence—or say on the occasion in question the nonexistence—of pain pleasure is positive good absence of pain—negative good by evil understand either pain or the absence—or say on the occasion in question the nonexistence—of pleasure pain is positive evil absence of pleasure—if arising from loss—negative evil iii their relation in respect of causality understand by good either actual pleasure or absence of pain or anything considered as the cause of pleasure or the absence of pain understand by evil either actual pain or absence of pleasure or anything considered as the cause of pain or of the absence of pleasure iv their quantity in respect of—  intensity   deration   extent v their productiveness—or say fecundity—  direct   inverse vi part taken by human action in the production of them   wish or say desire   direction to action in consequence—or say in pursuance of such wish end is a word employed to denote a good the prospect of eventually experiencing which operates as a motive tending to produce at the hands of any sensitive being some good which is an object of human desire and hope means is a word employed to denote any substance state of things or matter considered as contributing to the attainment of the good which on that same occasion is regarded as an end pleasures and exemptions from pains with their respective correlatives happiness and exemption from unhappiness are the ultimate ends of action as between good and evil good alone is an ultimate end of the action of a sensitive being good and evil both are means in their nature capable of being made conducive to the attainment of the ultimate end—the net maximum of happiness and accordingly by men in general and by men in the situation of legislators in particular are employed in that view and for that purpose of good or evil one and the same portion is capable of acting on one and the same occasion in the character of an end and in that of a means—of a means in relation to some antecedent end or state of things—of an end in relation to some eventually subsequent state of things remedy in all its shapes is an instrument having for its use the exclusion of wrong in all its several shapes—or say the exclusion of maleficence in all its several shapes of remedy in every shape the application made is attended with and productive of burthen the application of remedy instead of excluding wrong is productive of wrong if and in so far as it is productive of burthen outweighing the benefit in this way may effects and causes be seen linked together as it were in a chain composed of links in indefinite number and taken in the aggregate of correspondent length so much for the matter of good being that the production of which is or at least ought to be the object or say end in view of everything which passes under the denomination of law—or a law—and so much for good and evil—both of them employed as means and the only means employable for the attainment of that end but what is a law and what are laws themselves before this is explained must be brought to view that species of matter which on each occasion is occupied in passing judgment on the aptitude of the law in question considered as a means employed in and for the attainment of that end to this purpose comes the need of the ideas expression to which is given by the two mutually     and intimately connected words rule and principle correspondent to every rule you may have a principle correspondent to every principle you may have a rule of these two a rule is the object which requires first to be taken into consideration and presented to view why because it is only by means of a rule that any moving force can be applied to the active faculty or any guide to the intellectual—any mandate can be issued—any instruction given a rule is a proposition—an entire proposition a principle is but a term true it is that by a principle instruction may be conveyed conveyed yes but how no otherwise than through the medium of a proposition—the corresponding proposition—the proposition which it has the effect of presenting to the mind of presenting yes and we may add and of bringing back for only in so far as the rule has been at the time in question or some anterior time present to the mind can any instruction any clear idea be presented to the mind by a principle a principle therefore is as it were an abridgment of the corresponding rule—in the compass of a single term it serves to convey for some particular present use to a mind already in possession of the rule the essence of it it is to the rule what the essential oil is to the plant from which it is distilled so it does but answer this purpose its uses are great and indisputable   it saves words and thereby time   by consisting of nothing more than a single term and that term a nounsubstantive it presents an object which by an apt assortment of other words is upon occasion capable of being made up into another proposition so it is true may a rule—but only in a form comparatively embarrassing and inconvenient this will appear by taking in hand any sentence in which a principle has place and instead of the principle employing the corresponding rule upon occasion into any one sentence principles in any number may be inserted and the greater the number the stronger will be the impression of the embarrassment saved by the substitution of the principles to the rules a principle as above is no more than a single term but that term may as well be composite a compound of two or more words as single of these words one must be a nounsubstantive the other may be either a nounadjective or a participle including under the appellation of a nounadjective a nounsubstantive employed in that character in the mode which is so happily in use in the english language and which gives it in comparison with every language in which this mode is not in use a most eminently and incontestably useful advantage by an axiom is meant a sort of rule of which by certain properties the combination of which is peculiar to it the usefulness is preeminent in comparison with other rules these properties are—     incontestableness     comprehensiveness     clearness as to axioms the axioms that belong to this subject are axioms of mental pathology the facts they are enunciative of are facts enunciative of certain sensations as being produced by certain events or states of things operating as their efficient causes by a reason for any act is conveyed the idea of its supposed addition actual or probable to the greatest happiness this effect may be produced either—  immediately   through an intervening chain of any number of links a law is a word employed in three different senses which require to be distinguished but in each of them it imports that the will to which it gives expression either emanates from the supreme authority in the state or has that same authority for its support in one sense it denotes an entire command—the whole matter of a command call this the integral sense and the sort of law a complete law in the second sense it contains no more than a portion of a command and the matter of the command may be to an indefinite extent voluminous containing laws of the firstmentioned sort in any number in this sense it has for its synonym the word enactment call the law in this sense a fractional or incomplete law in the third sense it designates the aggregate body of the enactive paragraphs to which it happens to have received the token of their being expressive of the will of the person or persons invested with the supreme authority in the political state or of some person who acts in this behalf under and by virtue of that same authority by power of classification a species of legislative power is exercised thus when an enactment to any effect has been framed if by any proposition bearing the form of a command or a rule enlargement or retrenchment is applied to the genus or say class of objects which contribute to constitute the subjectmatter of the command—by this means in a sort of indirect way by and with the help of the other words which enter into the composition of the enactment is produced the effect of a different enactment one of the classes of which that same subjectmatter is composed receives thereby contraction or enlargement     and a fresh classification is made thereby note here—in the giving existence to an enactment three distinguishable parts are capable of being taken—or say functions are capable of being performed viz the institutive the constitutive and the consummative and this whether by one and the same authority or by so many different authorities by exercise given to the power of classification in any instance a different consummation as it were is given to the several enactments in the matter of which the generic words in question are any of them contained of this same function—of this same power exercise is made by any functionary or set of functionaries belonging to a department other than and thence inferior to the legislative for in no other way can classes be filled up by individuals and reality given to general ideas call this power power of location or say locative power but what difference there is between this case and the preceding consists in this in the former case by no other authority than the legislative can the power be exercised—the effect produced in the latter case it is produced in virtue of a general authorization given by the legislative authority and by that authority is never produced unless it be in consequence of some extraordinary occurrence so much for particular laws and small masses of particular laws now for the divisions of the allcomprehensive aggregate in which they are all of them at all times comprised the pannomion may be considered as composed of two branches—the effective and the constitutive in the effective branch may be considered as contained the portion of the matter which is more immediately occupied in giving direction to the conduct of the members of the community of all classes the constitutive is occupied in determining who those persons in particular are by whom the powers belonging to the effective branch shall be exercised considered with relation to its connexion with good and evil employed in the character of punishment and reward for the purpose of giving direction to human conduct the pannomion is distinguished and divided into two branches—the directive and the sanctionative by the directive part indication is given of the course which it is the desire of the lawgiver that upon the occasion in question the subjectcitizens should pursue by the sanctionative part information is given to them of the inducement which they will find for the pursuing of those same courses the matter of which this inducement is composed is either the matter of good as above or the matter of evil where and in so far as it is of the matter of good remunerative is the name that may be given to the law where and in so far as it is the matter of evil penal is the name commonly given to the law—punitive a name that may be given to it these two branches of a law are addressed to different descriptions of persons—the directive to persons at large—the sanctionative to the members of the official establishment by the sanctionative provision is made of the inducement to which the legislator trusts for the compliance he seeks and expects to find on the part of those to whom the directive branch of the law is addressed this inducement is the eventual expectation of either good or evil in the mind of those to whom the directive branch of the law is addressed—if it be good the law in that branch of it is syled a remunerative law if evil a penal law the persons to whom a remunerative law is addressed are those functionaries belonging to the administrative department by whom disposal is made of the money or whatever else the matter of good employed consists of directing them eventually to bestow the article in question on the person in question in the event of his having complied with the directive law in question and thereby rendered the service desired at his hands the persons to whom a penal law is addressed are the official persons belonging to the judiciary department presided over and directed by the judges of the matter to which it may be convenient to give insertion in the civil code and to which accordingly insertion is given in it there are two different sorts one of which may be styled the directive as above—the other the expositive to the directive belongs that sort of matter of which under that name mention has been already made—the directive without the addition of the sanctionative and in particular the punitive not that without the addition of the sanctionative the directive could in general without absurdity be trusted to of a correspondent eventual punishment including where applicable satisfaction to be administered in case of non compliance the existence must all along thereby be assumed but in relation to punishment this is the whole of that which naturally here finds its place—in the     penal code will be inserted all denunciation of extra punishment together with what belongs to the mode in which the application made of the matter of punishment is brought about—leaving to the civil code the direction of the mode in which satisfaction and in particular that branch of it which consists in the allotment of compensation for wrong shall be administered the expositive matter belongs in common to constitutes and forms part and parcel of the directive part of the matter of the civil code and the penal code among the words and locutions of which exposition is given in it may be seen this or that word in the exposition of which a prodigious quantity of matter is employed take for instance the word title or the word right when employed as synonymous with and equivalent to it exposition of it is alike necessary to the completion of any enactment belonging either to the civil or the penal code take in the first place the civil the principal part of it is occupied in the declaration of to what person or persons each subjectmatter of property each object of general desire shall belong in such sort as to be styled his or their own—who he is or they are to whom it belongs—or say who have title to it now then be the subjectmatter what it may—who is it that has title to it who but he in whose favour some one in the list of completely collative events or states of things has place no event or state of things having with relation to that same title an ablative effect having at the same time place in the disfavour of that same individual so much for the portion in question—the portion of the matter of the civil code but not less necessary is reference made in the penal code to that same matter take for instance in offences severally considered offences affecting property—the offence of theft to the conveying of an accurate conception of the nature of this offence mention of title is indispensable why answer because when it is under the persuasion of his having a title to the thing in question where it is under this persuasion that the man took it—by no one will he be regarded as having committed the offence thus denominated thence so it is that in any welladapted definition of this offence averment of the nonexistence of any such persuasion must be contained not that in the idea of the offence it is necessary that the idea of any portion of that same matter in particular—the idea for example of any one collative event more than another—should have place merely expositive and mixed of the one sort or the other will be found to be every particle of the matter which will with most convenience be aggregated to the matter of the civil code constitutive of the mixed matter will be—  matter of general concernment   matter of particular concernment chapter iii expositions only with reference to language can the attribute denoted by the word universal be with propriety attributed to the subject of law in each country at each point of time it is matter of accident whether a law to a given effect is in force though consideration had of the general effect and not of the particular tenor in no inconsiderable quantity masses of the matter of law might be found such as are not likely to be wanting in any country that has the use of letters a mass of the matter of language expressive of law might be found of which the equivalent cannot be wanting in any country among any assemblage of human beings in the presence of each other for any considerable length of time this may be styled the language of universal law follows the exposition of some of these terms the use of which exposition upon this occasion is not so much to teach as to fix their import—   obligation—obligations may exist without rights—rights cannot exist without obligations obligation—a fictitious entity is the product of a law—a real entity a law when entire is a command but a command supposes eventual punishment for without eventual punishment or the apprehension of it obedience would be an effect without a cause reward—eventual reward is not capable of securing obedience to will signified—is not capable of giving to will the effect of a command—apprehension of the abstraction of reward already in possession or expectancy may do it yes but though reward alone be the word employed in the description of the case the operation signified is of the nature of punishment—the effect of it not enjoyment but suffering obligation has place when the desire on the part of the superior the obliger being signified to the obligee he understands at the same time that in the event of his failing to comply with such desire evil will befal him and that to an amount greater than that of any evil which he could sustain in compliance with that desire   right—otherwise than from the idea of obligation no clear idea can be attached to the word right the efficient causes of right are two—       absence of correspondent obligation you have a right to perform whatever you are not under obligation to abstain from the performance of such is the right which every human being has in a state of nature   the second efficient cause of right is presence of correspondent obligation this obligation is the obligation imposed upon other persons at large to abstain from disturbing you in the exercise of the firstmentioned sort of right the firstmentioned right may be termed a naked kind of right—this secondmentioned right a vested or established right the word right is the name of a fictitious entity one of those objects the existence of which is feigned for the purpose of discourse by a fiction so necessary that without it human discourse could not be carried on a man is said to have it to hold it to possess it to acquire it to lose it it is thus spoken of as if it were a portion of matter such as a man may take into his hand keep it for a time and let it go again according to a phrase more common in law language than in ordinary language a man is even spoken of as being invested with it vestment is clothing invested with it makes it an article of clothing and is as much as to say is clothed with it to the substantive word are frequently prefixed as adjuncts and attributives not only the word political but the word natural and the word moral and thus rights are distinguished into natural moral and political from this mode of speech much confusion of ideas has been the result the only one of the three cases in which the word right has any determinate and intelligible meaning is that in which it has the adjunct political attached to it in this case when a man is said to have a right mentioning it the existence of a certain matter of fact is asserted namely of a disposition on the part of those by whom the powers of government are exercised to cause him to possess and so far as depends upon them to have the faculty of enjoying the benefit to which he has a right if then the fact thus asserted be true the case is that amongst them they are prepared on occasion to render him this service and to this service on the part of the subordinate functionaries to whose province the matter belongs he has if so it be a right the supreme functionaries being always prepared to do what depends upon them to cause this same service to be rendered by those same subordinate functionaries now in the case of alleged natural rights no such matter of fact has place—nor any matter of fact other than what would have place supposing no such natural right to have place in this case no functionaries have place—or if they have no such disposition on their part as above has place for if it have it is the case of a political right and not of a merely natural right a man is never the better for having such natural right admit that he has it his condition is not in any respect different from what it would be if he had it not if i say a man has a right to this coat or to this piece of land meaning a right in the political sense of the word—what i assert is a matter of fact namely the existence of the disposition in question as above if i say a man has a natural right to the coat or the land—all that it can mean if it mean any thing and mean true is that i am of opinion he ought to have a political right to it that by the appropriate services rendered upon occasion to him by the appropriate functionaries of government he ought to be protected and secured in the use of it he ought to be so—that is to say the idea of his being so is pleasing to me—the idea of the opposite result displeasing in the english language an imperfection perhaps peculiar to that language contributes to the keeping up of this confusion in english in speaking of a certain man and a certain coat or a certain piece of land i may say it is right he should have this coat or this piece of land but in this case beyond doubt nothing more do i express than my satisfaction at the idea of his having this same coat or land this imperfection does not extend itself to other languages take the french for instance a frenchman will not say il est droit que cet homme ait cet habit what he will say is il est juste que cet homme ait cet habit cet appartient de droit a cet homme if the coat i have on is mine i have a right by law to knock down if i can any man who by force should attempt to take it from me and this right is what in any case it can scarcely be but that a man looks to when he says i have a right to a constitution to such or such an effect—or a right to have the powers of government arranged in such manner as to place me in such or such a condition in respect of actual right actually established rights political rights to engage others to join with him in applying force for the purpose of putting things into a state in which he would actually be in possession of the right of which he thus pretends to be in possession is at bottom the real object and purpose of the confusion thus endeavoured to be introduced into mens ideas by employing a word in a sense different from what it had been wont to be employed     and from thus causing men to accede in words to positions from which they dissent in judgment this confusion has for its source the heat of argument in the case of a political right when the existence of it is admitted on all sides all dispute ceases but when so it is that a man has been contending for a political right which he either never has possessed or having in his possession is fearful of losing he will not quietly be beaten out of his claim but in default of the political right or as a support to the political right he asserts he has a natural right this imaginary natural right is a sort of thread he clings by—in the case in question his having any efficient political right is a supposed matter of fact the existence of the contrary of which is but too notorious and being so is but too capable of being proved beaten out of this ground he says he has a natural right—a right given him by that kind goddess and governess nature whose legitimacy who shall dispute and if he can manage so as to get you to admit the existence of this natural right he has under favour of this confusion the hope of getting you to acknowledge the existence of the correspondent political right and your assistance in enabling him to possess it it may however be said to deny the existence of these rights which you call imaginary is to give a carte blanche to the most outrageous tyranny the rights of man anterior to all government and superior as to their authority to every act of government these are the rampart and the only rampart against the tyrannical enterprises of government not at all—the shadow of a rampart is not a rampart—a fiction proves nothing—from that which is false you can only go on to that which is false when the governed have no right the government has no more the rights of the governed and the rights of the government spring up together—the same cause which creates the one creates the other it is not the rights of man which causes government to be established—on the contrary it is the nonexistence of those rights what is true is that from the beginning of things it has always been desirable that rights should exist—and that because they do not exist since so long as there are no rights there can only be misery upon the earth—no sources of political happiness no security for person for abundance for subsistence for equality—for where is the equality between the famished savage who has caught some game and the still more famishing savage who is dying because he has not caught any law supposes government to establish a law is to exercise an act of government a law is a declaration of will—of a will conceived and manifested by an individual or individuals to whom the other individuals in the society to which such will has respect are generally disposed to obey now government supposes the disposition to obedience—the faculty of governing on the one part has for its sole efficient cause and for its sole measure the disposition to obey on the other part this disposition may have had for its cause either habit or convention a convention announces the will of one moment which the will of any other moment may revoke—habit is the result of a system of conduct of which the commencement is lost in the abyss of time a convention whether it have ever yet been realized or not is at least a conceivable and possible cause of this disposition to obedience from which government and what is called political society and the only real laws result habit of obedience is the cause a little less sure—the foundation a little less solid of this useful social disposition and happily the most common the true rampart the only rampart against a tyrannical government has always been and still is the faculty of allowing this disposition to obedience—without which there is no government—either to subsist or to cease the existence of this faculty is as notorious as its power is efficacious shall this habit of obedience be continued unbroken or shall it be discontinued upon a certain occasion is there more to be gained than to be lost in point of happiness by its discontinuance of the two masses of evil—intensity duration certainty all included—which appears to be the greatest that to which one believes ones self exposed from continued obedience or that to which one believes ones self exposed by its discontinuance on which side is the greatest probability of success on the side of the satellites of the tyrant who will endeavour to punish me in case of disobedience or on the side of the friends of liberty who will rally around me to defend me against oppression it is an affair of calculation and this calculation each one must make for himself according to circumstances it is also a calculation that no one can fail to make either ill or well whatever may be the language he employs or whosoever he may be but this calculation is not sufficiently rapid for those who choose for their amusement the destruction and reconstruction of governments rights of men strongly asserted but illdefined never proved rights of men of which every violation is an act of oppression—rights ready to be violated at every moment—rights which the government violates every time it does anything which displeases   0 you—right of insurrection ready to be exercised the first moment that oppression occurs—this is the only remedy which suits those who would make equality to flourish at any rate by taking the power of governing for themselves and leaving obedience for all others it is the weakness of the understanding which has given birth to these pretended natural rights it is the force of the passions which has led to their adoption when desirous of leading men to pursue a certain line of conduct which general utility does not furnish sufficient motives to induce them to pursue or when having such motives a man knows not how to produce and develope them yet wishes that there were laws to constrain men to pursue this conduct or what comes to the same thing that they would believe that there were such laws—it has been found the shortest and easiest method to imagine laws to this effect behold the professors of natural law of which they have dreamed—the legislating grotii—the legislators of the human race that which the alexanders and the tamerlanes endeavoured to accomplish by traversing a part of the globe the grotii and the puffendorffs would accomplish each one sitting in his arm chair that which the conqueror would effect with violence by his sword the jurisconsult would effect without effort by his pen behold the goddess nature—the jurisconsult is her priest his idlest trash is an oracle and this oracle is a law the jurisconsult in his armchair is an individual sufficiently peaceable he lies—he fabricates false laws in the simplicity of his heart—desirous of doing something ignorant how to do better hoping to do well he would not willingly injure any one from his hands the instruments he employs have passed into hands of a far different temper the invention was fortunate it spared discussion—it saved research and reflection—it did not require even common sense—it spared all forbearance and toleration—what the oath is on the part of the footpad who demands your purse the rights of man have been in the mouth of the terrorist those who govern allege legal rights—the rights of the citizen—real rights those who wish to govern allege natural rights—the rights of man—counterfeit rights—rights which are sanctioned by the knife of the assassin as well as the gibbet and the guillotine those to whom the faculty of making these imaginary laws instead of real laws has been transferred have not much trouble in making them constitutions are made as easily as songs they succeed each other as rapidly and are as speedily forgotten for the making of real laws talent and knowledge are requisite for making real laws good or bad labour and patience are requisite but for the making of forgeries sources of the rights of man nothing more is required than ignorance hardihood and impudence rights of men when placed by the side of legal rights resemble assignats whether false or genuine placed by the side of guineas or louis dor two passions have laid claim to the giving birth to the declarations of rights—to the substitution of the declaration of particular rights to the preparation of real laws—vanity and tyranny vanity which believes it can lull the world asleep by being the first to do what all the world has always had before its eyes—tyranny glad of finding a pretext for punishing all opposition by directing against it the force of public hatred rights there you have them always before your eyes to deny their existence is either to exhibit the most notorious bad faith or the most stupid blindness the first a vice which renders you deserving of the indignation of all men—the other a weakness which consigns you to their contempt it is because without rights there can be no happiness that it is at any rate determined to have rights but rights cannot be created without creating obligations it is that we may have rights that we submit to obligations and in respect to obligations not to those alone which are strictly necessary for the establishment of the rights of which we feel the want but also obligations such as those which may result from all the acts of authority exercised by government which the general habit of obedience allows it to exercise the end of all these acts of authority should be to produce the greatest possible happiness to the community in question this is the true and the only true end of the laws still of the operations by which it is possible to conduct men towards this end the effect—the constant necessary and most extensive effect is to produce evil as well as good to produce evil that good may be produced since upon no other conditions can it be produced the mystic tree of good and evil already so interesting is not the only one of its kind life society the law resemble it and yield fruits equally mixed upon the same bough are two sorts of fruits of which the flavour is opposite—the one sweet and the other bitter the sweet fruits are benefits of all kinds—the bitter and thorny fruits are burthens the benefits are rights which under certain circumstances are called powers—the burthens are obligations—duties     these products so opposed in their nature are simultaneous in their production and inseparable in their existence the law cannot confer a benefit without at the same time imposing a burthen somewhere—it cannot create a right without at the same time creating an obligation—and if that right be of any value even a numerous train of obligations but if among these moral as well as among physical products the sweet cannot exist without the bitter—the bitter can exist—it exists too often—without the sweet such is the case with those obligations which may be called pure or barren which are not accompanied by rights those benefits those advantages which sweeten and conceal the bitterness—obligations which are fulfilled by useless efforts or sufferings the fruit of every law produced by tyranny neglecting or despising the counsels of utility and yieldto the suggestions of caprice—unless the gratification of this caprice can be considered as a benefit benefits being in themselves good the wellinstructed legislator i mean directed by utility would create and confer them freely with pleasure if it depended upon himself he would produce no other fruits if he could produce them in infinite quantity—he would accumulate them in the bosom of society but as the inexorable law of nature is opposed to this course and he cannot confer benefits without imposing burthens all that he can do is to take care that the advantage of the benefit exceed the disadvantage of the burthen and that this advantage be as great and the disadvantage as small as possible when in order that a burthen may produce its effect—that the advantage expected from it may be produced it is necessary that its weight be felt it is called punishment it is thus that the nonpenal branch of the law and the penal are both of them occupied in the establishing and securing every man in possession of his rights of all sorts these rights are so many instruments of felicity—they are the instruments of whatsoever felicity a man can derive from government a mans political rights are either his private rights or his constitutional rights under every form of government every man has his private rights—but there are forms of government in which no man but one or some other comparatively small number have any constitutional rights of private rights these five sorts have been distinguished—  rights as to person   rights as to property   rights as to power   rights as to reputation   rights as to condition in life all these rights have for their efficient cause certain services which by a general and standing disposition on the part of the functionaries of government in the supreme grade are understood to have been rendered to every man and which in consequence on each particular occasion the functionaries of judicature and upon occasion the functionaries belonging to the army hold themselves in readiness to render to him these services consist in the giving execution and effect to all such ordinances of the government as have been made in favour and for the benefit of every individual situated in the individual situation in which in all respects he is situated in virtue and by means of that same standing and allcomprehensive service the supreme rulers have given the name of wrong and the name quality and consequence of an offence to every act by which any such right is understood to have been broken infringed violated invaded in giving it the name of an offence they have made provision of pain under the name of punishment together with other means of repression for the purpose of preventing the doing of it or lessening as far as may be the number of instances in which it shall be done rights are then the fruits of the law and of the law alone there are no rights without law—no rights contrary to the law—no rights anterior to the law before the existence of laws there may be reasons for wishing that there were laws—and doubtless such reasons cannot be wanting and those of the strongest kind—but a reason for wishing that we possessed a right does not constitute a right to confound the existence of a reason for wishing that we possessed a right with the existence of the right itself is to confound the existence of a want with the means of relieving it it is the same as if one should say everybody is subject to hunger therefore everybody has something to eat there are no other than legal rights—no natural rights—no rights of man anterior or superior to those created by the laws the assertion of such rights absurd in logic is pernicious in morals a right without a law is an effect without a cause we may feign a law in order to speak of this fiction—in order to feign a right as having been created but fiction is not truth we may feign laws of nature—rights of nature in order to show the nullity of real laws as contrary to these imaginary rights and it is with this view that recourse is had to this fiction—but the effect of these nullities can only be null   possession—better says a maxim of the old roman called civil law—better meaning in comparison with that of any other person is the condition of the possessor—better his condition that is to say better the ground and reason which a person in his situation is able to make for the enjoyment of     the thing than any that can be made by any one else of the propriety and reasonableness of this notion scarcely by any one who hears of it how far soever from being learned can a sort of feeling fail of being entertained—by no one even of the most learned has expression it is believed been ever given to it this omission the greatesthappiness principle and that alone can supply in the case of loss of the possession he who has the possession would feel a pain of privation—or say regret more acute—than a man of the same turn of mind whose expectation of obtaining it was no stronger than the possessors expectation of keeping it would in the event of his failing to obtain possession of it of so many hundred millions of persons each of whom in case of his having had possession of the thing and then lost it would upon the losing of it have felt pain in a certain shape proportioned to the value of the thing not one feels pain in any shape at the thoughts of not having it not one of them but might in the shape in question feel pain in any quantity more or less considerable if after having the thing in possession he were without receiving or expecting any equivalent for it to cease to have it the horse you have bred and still keep in your stable is yours how is it constituted such—constituted by law answer the naked right—the right of making use of it the law has left you in possession of—to wit by the negative act of forbearing to inhibit you from using it the established right the law has conferred upon you by the order given to the judge to punish every person who shall disturb or have disturbed you in the use of it the horse which was yours but by the gift you have made of it is become the horse of a friend of yours—how has it been constituted such—constituted by law answer by a blank left as it were in the command to the judge—that blank being left to be filled up by you in favour of this friend of yours or any other person to whom it may happen to be your wish to transfer the horse either gratuitously or for a price so long as the law in question has this blank in it it is an incompleted an imperfect law—it waits an act on your part to render it a perfect one the law in its completed state is the result of two functions into which the legislative function in this case is divided—the initiative to it and the consummative by the legislator the initiative is exercised—by you the consumative in the same way in which according to this example rights and powers are given to individual persons they may be and are given to classes of persons on classes of persons the correspondent obligations not only may but must be imposed in short exceptions excepted they must be imposed on all persons of all classes—for supposing but a single person excepted from the obligation your right is not entire—it is shared by you with the person so excepted if for example in transferring the horse to your friend you kept yourself from being included in the obligation to abstain from the use of the horse—if in a word you kept yourself excepted from the obligation imposed on other persons in general the horse is not your friends alone any more than yours but in the language of english law you and he are joint tenants of the horse   power—in common speech the word power is used in two senses—to wit the above sense which may becalled the proper and legal sense—and another sense more ample which may be styled the popular sense in the strictly legal sense which is used in the penal and civil branches of law—in the popular sense which is used in the constitutional branch in both cases the fruit of the exercise of the power is looked to and that fruit is compliance on the part of the person subject to power compliance with the wishes expressed or presumed to be entertained by the person by whom the power is possessed for convenience of discourse say in one word the powerholder the force of the remunerative sanction it has above been observed is not sufficient to constitute an obligation it is however in a certain sense sufficient as everybody knows to constitute power the effect of power is produced in so far as by the will declared or presumed of him who in this sense is the powerholder compliance is produced power may be defined to be the faculty of giving determination either to the state of the passive faculties or to that of the active faculties of the subject in relation to and over which it is exercised—say the correlative subject power is either coercive or allocative coercive power is either restrictive or compulsive     of the correlative subject the passive faculties are either insensitive or sensitive if merely insensitive it belongs to the class of inanimate beings and is referred to the still more general denomination of things if sensitive to the class of animals if the animals of the class in question are considered as belonging to the class of reasonable beings the correlative subject is a person—including human beings of both sexes and all ages if considered as irrational it has hitherto by lawyers been confounded with inanimate beings and comprehended under the denomination of things in so far as the power is exercised with effect the possessor of the power—say the powerholder—may relation had to the correlative subject be termed the director—the correlative subject the directee   command—an instrument which as above has been mentioned as necessary to the generation of the fictitious entities called a right and a power is as has been seen a command but a command is a discourse expressive of the wish of a certain person who supposing his power independent of that of any other person and to a certain extent sufficiently ample in respect of the subjectmatters—to wit persons things moveable and immoveable and acts of persons and times—is a legislator—say a legislator in the singular for simplicity sake the case of a division of the legislative power among divers persons or classes of persons may on this occasion be put aside   quasi commands—now then comes a doubt and with it a question—in the state of things you have hitherto been supposing the law in question is of that sort called statute law and in the case of statute law the print of a command is sufficiently visible but obligations are created—rights established not only by statute law but by another species of law called common law where in this case is the command—where is the person by whom it has been issued—where in a word is the legislator the judge is not a legislator far from claiming so to be he would not so much as admit himself to be so he puts aside if not the function at any rate the name hitherto we have been in the region of realities we are now of necessity transported into the region of fictions in the domain of common law everything is fiction but the power exercised by the judge on each occasion the judge does it is true issue a command—this command is his decree but this decree he on every occasion confesses he would not on any occasion have the power of issuing with effect were it not for a command general in its extent and in such sort general as to include and give authority to this individual decree of his to be what it is a command general or individual must be the command of some person who in this case is this person answer not any legislator for if it were the law would be a statute law a person being necessary and no real one to be found hence comes the necessity of a fictitious one the fictitious one this fictitious person is called the common law—or more generally that he may be confounded with the real person in whose image he is made the law to warrant the individual decree which he is about to pronounce the judge comes out with some general proposition saying in words or in effect thus saith the law on the occasion of the issuing of this sham law the pretext always is that it is but a copy of a proposition equally general delivered on some former occasion by some other judge or train of successive judges in this proposition there may be or may not be a grain of truth but whether there be or be not the individual decree has in both cases alike the effect of a law—of a real law—issued by a legislator avowing himself such and acknowledged as such a command being the generic name of the really existing instrument of power called a law let a quasi command be the name of that counterfeit instrument feigned to answer the purpose of it to produce the effects of it for the purpose of enabling the judge to produce in the way of exacting compliance the effect of a law of this appellation the use and need will be seen in the procedure code on the occasion of the formula called the demand paper provided for the purpose of giving commencement to a suit in that same code supposing the connexion between a command in the mandatory form and a proposition in the assertive form made out and explained whatsoever proposition would if emanating from the legislator have constituted an apposite ground for the demand—to wit the demand made in the demand paper elsewhere spoken of—a proposition to that same effect might equally well serve if stated as being a proposition conformable to the doctrine of the common law in the one case the proposition would be a reality in the other case a fiction in the one case what were the proper words of it could not be a subjectmatter of dispute in the other case it might and would frequently be the subjectmatter of dispute still however in the character of a ground of inference it would in both cases be equally intelligible be this as it may—not to the plan here proposed would the imperfections of this part of the instrument of demand with propriety be ascribable the root of the imperfection is in the very nature of the common law to its supreme inaptitude by the proposed instrument     such remedy as the nature of the case admitted is applied and the use thus made of the common law is the result—not of choice but of unresistible necessity how sadly inadequate a portion of this fictitious law is in the character of a succedaneum to a correspondent and equivalent portion of real law would on each occasion be visible to every eye and as often as it came under the eye so often would the urgency of the demand for the substitution of real to sham law be forced upon the attention what would be in the power of the legislature to do at any time and in the compass of a day is to substitute this plain speaking form of demand to the existing absurd and deceptious one what it is not in his power to do in the compass of a day nor perhaps till at the end of some years is the complete substitution of real to sham and impostors law—substitute and audacious rival of the only genuine law chapter iv axioms §   axioms of mental pathology—a necessary ground for all legislative arrangements by an axiom of mental pathology considered as a ground for a legislative arrangement understand a proposition expressive of the consequences in respect of pleasure or pain or both found by experience to result from certain sorts of occurrences and in particular from such in which human agency bears a part in other words expressive of the connexion between such occurrences as are continually taking place or liable to take place and the pleasures and pains which are respectively the results of them practical uses of these observations two—  with regard to pleasures the learning how to leave them undisturbed and protected against disturbance—for as to the giving increase to them by the power of the legislator to anything beyond a very inconsiderable amount it is neither needful nor possible   with regard to pains the learning how on each occasion to minimize the amount of them in respect of magnitude and number—number of the individuals suffering under them—magnitude of the suffering in the case of each individual arithmetic and medicine—these are the branches of art and science to which in so far as the maximum of happiness is the object of his endeavours the legislator must look for his means of operation—the pains or losses of pleasure produced by a maleficent act correspond to the symptoms produced by a disease experience observation and experiment—these are the foundations of all wellgrounded medical practice experience observation and experiment—such are the foundations of all wellgrounded legislative practice in the case of both functionaries the subjectmatter of operation and the plan of operation is accordingly the same—the points of difference these—in the case of the medical curator the only individual who is the subjectmatter of the operations performed by him is the individual whose sufferings are in question to whom relief is to be administered in the case of the legislator there are no limits to the description of the persons to whom it may happen to be the subjectmatter of the operations performed by him by the medical curator no power is possessed other than that which is given either by the patient himself or in case of his inability by those to whose management it happens to him to be subject—by the legislatorial curator power is possessed applicable to all persons without exception within his field of service each person being considered in his opposite capacities—namely that of a person by whom pleasure or pain or both may be experienced and that of a person at whose hands pleasure or pain or both may be experienced axioms of corporal pathology may be styled those most extensively applicable positions or say propositions by which statement is made of the several sorts of occurrences by which pleasure or pain are or have place in the human body—as also the results observed to follow from the performance of such operations as have been performed and the application made of such subjectmatters as have been applied for the purpose of giving increase to the aggregate of pleasure or causing termination alleviation or prevention to have place in regard to pain axioms of mental pathology may be styled those most commonly applicable propositions by which statement is made of the several occurrences by which pleasure or pain is made to have place in the human mind—as also the results observed to follow from the performance of such operations as have been performed and the application of such subjectmatters as have been applied for the purpose of effecting the augmentation of the aggregate of the pleasures or the diminution of the aggregate of the pains by the termination alleviation or prevention of them respectively when individually considered security—subsistence—abundance—equality—i e minimization of inequality—by these appellatives denomination has been given to the particular ends which stand next in order to the universal and the greatest happiness of the greatest number this being admitted these are the objects which will be in view in the formation of the several axioms of pathology which present themselves     as suitable to the purpose of serving as guides to the practice of the legislatorial curator unfortunately on this occasion the imperfection of language has produced an embarrassment which it does not seem to be in the power of language altogether to remove all that can be done is to lessen and alleviate it subsistence—abundance—equality—these three immediately subordinate ends are conversant about the same matter to wit the matter of wealth but security besides a matter of its own is conversant with that same matter with which as above they are conversant to wit the matter of wealth security for the matter of wealth—or say to each individual security for that portion of the matter of wealth which at the time in question belongs to him and is called his security is accordingly security against all such maleficent acts by which any portion of the matter of wealth which ought to be at the disposal of the individual in question is prevented from being at his disposal at the time in question now the not having at his disposal at the time in question a certain portion of the matter of wealth is indeed one efficient cause of pain to the individual in question be he who he may but it is but one out of several in addition to the matter of wealth sources of pleasure and of exemption from pain are certain others which have been found reducible under the following denomitions to wit power reputation and condition in life—condition in life to wit in so far as reference had to the individual whose it is the effect is considered as beneficial—this complex subjectmatter including in it the three subjectmatters above mentioned—that is to say the matter of wealth or in two words power and reputation correspondent to these several subjectmatters of security are so many classes of offences—of maleficent acts by the performance of which such security is disturbed offences affecting property—offences affecting power—offences affecting reputation—offences affecting condition in life but all these subjectmatters are with reference to the individual in question distinct from him and exterior to him—and in a more immediate way—and otherwise than through the medium of any of these outworks he stands exposed to be made to suffer pain as well of mind as of body by the agency of every other individual in whose instance a motive adequate to the purpose of producing an act by which it will be inflicted has place thus then in addition to offences affecting property—offences affecting power—offences affecting reputation—offences affecting condition in life—we have offences affecting person considered with reference to its two distinguishable parts body and mind so many of these classes of maleficent acts so many branches of security in which list as being the most obviously and highly important and most simple in the conception presented by it security against maleficent acts affecting person—more shortly security for person presents itself as claiming to occupy the first place after which security for property and so forth as above §   axioms applicable to security for person axioms forming the grounds for such legislative arrangements as have for their object and their justification the affording security for person against such maleficent acts to which it stands exposed   the pleasure derivable by any person from the contemplation of pain suffered by another is in no instance so great as the pain so suffered   not even when the pain so suffered has been the result of an act done by the person in question for no other purpose than that of producing it hence one reason for endeavouring to give security against pain of body or mind resulting from human agency whether from design or inattention now suppose the pain to be the result of purely natural agency—no human agency having any part in the production of it—no human being deriving any satisfaction from the contemplation of it—the result is still the same hence one reason for endeavouring to give security against pain of body or mind resulting from casualty or as the word is when the evil is considered as having place upon a large scale—calamity axiom indicative of the reasons which form the grounds of the enactments prohibitive of maleficent acts productive of evil affecting persons—that is to say either in body or mind—in any mode not comprised in one or other of the modes of maleficence from which the acts constituted offences in and by the penal code receive their denomination viz offences produced by the irascible appetite— when by one person without gratification sought other than that derived from the contemplation of suffering in this or that shape as about to be produced on the part of that other gratification in a certain shape is accordingly produced in the breast of such evil doer—call the gratification the pleasure of antipathy satisfied—or of illwill satisfied if this antipathy has had its rise in the conception that by the party in question say the victim evil in any shape has been done to the evil doer—the pleasure of antipathy gratified takes the name of the pleasure of vengeance—or say revenge     axiom in no case is there any reason for believing that the pleasure of antipathy gratified is so great as the pain suffered by him at whose expense as above the pleasure is reaped offences to which the axiom applies are—  offences affecting body   offences affecting the mind other than those belonging to the other classes   offences affecting reputation—the reputation of the sufferer—other than those by which the reputation of the evil doer is increased   offences affecting the condition in life of the sufferer other than those by which the reputation of the evil doer is increased or expected to be increased for justification of the legislative arrangements necessary to afford security against maleficent acts affecting the person what it is necessary to show is that by them pain will not be produced in such quantity as will cause it to outweigh the pleasure that would have been produced by the maleficent acts so prevented for this purpose in order to complete the demonstration and render it objectionproof in certain cases it will be necessary to take into account not only the evil of the first order but the evil of the second order likewise first then considering the matter on the footing of the effects of the first order on both sides—axioms bearing reference to the effects of the first order on both sides are the following— axioms serving as grounds and reasons for the provision made by the legislator for general security—to wit against the evils respectively produced by the several classes and genera of offences case   an offence affecting person or say corporal vexation in any one of its several shapes—offenders motive illwill or spite—the enjoyment of the offender will not be so great as the evil of the first order consisting in the suffering experienced by the party vexed case   so if the offence be an offence productive of mental vexation—and the motive the same case   so if the offence be an offence affecting reputation case   so exceptions excepted in the case of every other class or genus of offences the motive being illwill or spite as above case   exceptions are among offences affecting person and reputation jointly the offences having for their motive sexual desire to wit—  sexual seduction allurative or say enticitive   sexual seduction compulsory   rape   vexatious lascivious contrectation in any of these cases what may happen is—that the enjoyment of the offender may be equal or more than equal to the suffering of the party wronged in either of which cases the evil of the first order has no place but to all other persons the suffering of the one part will present itself as being to an indefinite degree greater than the enjoyment of the offender and proportioned to the apparent excess will be the actual alarm on the part and on behalf of persons exposed to the like wrong from the same cause and thence so far as regards alarm will be the evil of the second order addendum to security axioms— be the modification of the matter of prosperity what it may by losing it without an equivalent a man suffers according to and in proportion to the value of it in his estimation—the value by him put upon it value may be distinguished into—  general or say value in the way of exchange and   special or say idiosyncratical—value in the way of use in his own individual instance note that the value of a thing in the way of exchange arises out of and depends altogether upon and is proportioned to its value in the way of use—for no man would give anything that had a value in the way of use in exchange for anything that had no such value but value in the way of use may be distinguished into general which has place so far as and no further than the thing is of use to persons in general—and special or idiosyncratical which has place in so far as in the case of this or that person in particular the thing has a value in the way of use over and above the value which it has in the case of persons in general of which use that of the pretium affectionis the value of affection is an example definition when from any cause—human agency or any other—a mass of the matter of wealth or of the matter of prosperity in any other shape is made to go out of an individuals possession or expectancy without his consent the pain produced in his breast by contemplation of its nonexistence or say by the loss of it call the pain of disappointment he being disappointed at the thought of the good which it having been in his possession or expectancy he has thus lost among the objects of law in every community is the affording security against this pain in this shape axiom the pleasure of antipathy or revenge produced in the breast of the evildoer by the contemplation of a pain of disappointment produced in the breast of the sufferer is not in any case so great in magnitude as that same pain to this axiom corresponds as being thereon grounded a fundamental principle entitled the disappointmentpreventing principle     operation necessary for the establishment and continuance of security—fixation of the text of the laws for leading expectation the law need only be exhibited provided that it be clear and not too vast for comprehension but that it may be exhibited it is necessary that it exist the greatest and most extensive cause of regret respecting english law is—that as respects a large portion it has no existence instead of laws it cannot even be said that we possess shadows of law—shadows imply substances by which they are formed—all that we possess is a phantom conjured up by each one at his pleasure to fill the place of the law it is of these phantoms that common law unwritten judgemade law is composed a discussion upon a point of unwritten or common law has been defined a competition of opposite analogies in giving this definition the most severe and welldeserved censure was passed both upon this species of law and upon the carelessness of the legislators who have tolerated its pernicious existence—who have allowed the security of their fellowcitizens to remain without foundation tossed about by the interminable and always shifting competition of opposite analogies—who have left it upon a quicksand when they might have placed it upon a rock §   axioms pathological applicable to subsistence axiom   though to each individual his own subsistence be by the nature of man rendered the chief object of his care and during his infancy an object of care to the author of his existence yet a considerable portion of the aggregate number of the members of the community there will always be in whose instance a subsistence cannot have place without the legislators care without provision made by the legislator to that effect   for the subsistence of all and accordingly of these provision will to a certain degree have been made by the provision for security in all its shapes and for security of property in particular as also for abundance for abundance because of the abundance possessed by some is composed a stock a fund out of which matter is capable of being taken applicable to the purpose of affording whether immediate or through exchange subsistence to others but for the subordinate end to the purpose here in question the utmost of what can be done for these two other subordinate ends taken together will not of itself be sufficient of the nonpossession of the matter of subsistence in such quantity as is necessary to the support of life death is the consequence and such natural death is preceded by a course of suffering much greater than what is attendant on the most afflictive violent deaths employed for the purpose of punishment rather than continue to labour under this affliction individuals who are experiencing it will naturally and necessarily in proportion as they find opportunity do what depends upon them towards obtaining at the charge of others the means of rescuing themselves from it and in proportion as endeavours to this purpose are employed or believed to be intended to be employed security for property is certainly diminished—security for person probably diminished on the part of all others by the coercive authority of the legislator provision cannot be made for the indigent otherwise than by defalcation from the mass of the matter of abundance possessed by the relatively opulent nor yet without a correspondent defalcation more or less considerable from security for property on their part in every habitable part of the earth people so soon as they behold themselves and their eventual offspring secured against death for want of the matter of subsistence which security cannot be afforded otherwise than by correspondent defalcation from the matter of abundance in the hands of the relatively opulent will continue to effect addition to the number of its inhabitants but this augmentation thus produced will proceed with much greater rapidity than any addition that can be made to the quantity of the matter of subsistence possessed as above by the indigent by defalcation made at the expense of security for property as well as from the matter of abundance by correspondent defalcation from the matter of abundance in the hands of the relatively opulent the consequence is that sooner or later on every habitable part of the earths surface the community will be composed of three classes of inhabitants—  those by whom with the addition of more or less of the matter of abundance the matter of subsistence is possessed in a quantity sufficient for the preservation of life and health—  those who being in a state in which they are perishing for want of the matter of subsistence are on their way to speedy death—  those who to save themselves from impending death are occupied in waging war upon the rest providing the means of subsistence for themselves at the expense of the security of all and the matter of subsistence and abundance in the possession of all so long as by arrangements taken for the purpose by government the thus redundant part of the population can be cleared off by being conveyed from the habitable part of the globe in question to some other part these two classes of quickly perishing individuals may be prevented from receiving formation     or if formed from receiving increase but in no one part of the habitable globe can this be done by government without expense nor the matter of expense be obtained without defalcation made from security and suffering from loss by forced contribution as above and sooner or later in proportion as property and security for property establishes itself the whole surface of the habitable globe cannot but be fully peopled in such sort that from no one spot to any other could human creatures be transplanted in a living and about to live state human benevolence can therefore hardly be better employed than in a quiet solution of these difficulties and in the reconciliation of a provision for the otherwise perishing indigent with this continual tendency to an increase in the demand for such provision §   axioms applying to abundance   included in the mass of the matter of abundance is the mass of the matter of subsistence the matter of wealth is at once the matter of subsistence and the matter of abundance the sole difference is the quantity—it is less in the case of subsistence—greater in the case of abundance   if of two persons one has the minimum of subsistence without addition—and the other that same minimum with an addition—the former has the matter of subsistence the latter the matter of abundance—understand in comparison with him who has nothing beyond the minimum of the matter of subsistence—the term abundance being a comparative a relative term   the matter of subsistence being in the instance of each individual necessary to existence and existence necessary to happiness—suppose a quantity of the matter of wealth sufficient for the subsistence of  0000 persons at the disposition of the legislator—more happiness will be producible by giving to each one of the  0000 a particle of the matter of subsistence than by giving to  000 of them a portion of the matter of abundance composed of two particles of the matter of subsistence and then giving none to the remaining  000 since on that supposition the  000 thus left destitute would soon die through a lingering death   but suppose that after giving existence to the  0000 and to each of them a particle of the matter of subsistence the legislator have at his disposal a quantity of the matter of wealth sufficient for the subsistence of other  0000 persons and that he have the option—of either giving existence to an additional number of persons to that same amount with a minimum of the matter of subsistence to each—or instead without making any addition to the first  0000 of giving an addition to the quantity of wealth possessed by them—a greater addition to the aggregate quantity of happiness would be made by dividing among the first  0000 the whole additional quantity of wealth than by making any addition to the number of persons brought into existence for supposing the whole  0000 having each of them the minimum of the matter of subsistence on any given day—the next day in consequence of some accident they might cease to have it and in consequence cease to have existence whereas if of this same  0000 some had in addition to his minimum of the matter of subsistence particles one or more of the matter of abundance here would be a correspondent mass of the matter of wealth capable of being by the legislator so disposed of as to be made to constitute the matter of subsistence to those who otherwise being without subsistence would soon be without existence   not that as between the matter of subsistence and the matter of abundance the identity is other than virtual—identity with reference to the purpose here in question to wit the effect on happiness—and this virtuality depends upon the facility of obtaining one of the sorts of matter necessary to subsistence in exchange for matter neither necessary nor so much as contributing to subsistence—potatoes for example in exchange for coin but so far as is necessary to the guidance of the legislators practice this virtual identity always has had and is likely always to have place   thus it is that the matter of abundance as contradistinguished from the matter of subsistence is contributory to happiness in three distinguishable ways or capacities—  as contributing in a direct way to enjoyment in a degree over and above what could be contributed by the mere matter of subsistence   as contributing in an indirect way to security to wit by its capacity of serving in the way of exchange for the obtainment of the efficient instruments of security in any of these shapes   as eventually contributing in the same indirect way to subsistence §   axioms applying to equality in respect of wealth i case or state of things the first—the quantities of wealth in question considered as being in a quiescent state actually in the hands of the two parties in question neither entering into nor going out of the hands of either   cæteris paribus—to every particle of the matter of wealth corresponds a particle of the matter of happiness accordingly thence   so far as depends upon wealth—of     two persons having unequal fortunes he who has most wealth must by a legislator be regarded as having most happiness   but the quantity of happiness will not go on increasing in anything near the same proportion as the quantity of wealth—ten thousand times the quantity of wealth will not bring with it ten thousand times the quantity of happiness it will even be matter of doubt whether ten thousand times the wealth will in general bring with it twice the happiness thus it is that   the effect of wealth in the production of happiness goes on diminishing as the quantity by which the wealth of one man exceeds that of another goes on increasing in other words the quantity of happiness produced by a particle of wealth each particle being of the same magnitude will be less and less at every particle the second will produce less than the first the third than the second and so on   minimum of wealth say £ 0 per year—greatest excess of happiness produced by excess in the quantity of wealth as   to  —magnitude of a particle of wealth £  a year on these data might be grounded a scale or table exhibiting the quantities of happiness produced by as many additions made to the quantity of wealth at the bottom of the scale as there are pounds between £ 0 and £ 0000 ii case or state of things the second—the particles of wealth about to enter into the hands of the parties in question   fortunes unequal—by a particle of wealth if added to the wealth of him who has least more happiness will be produced than if added to the wealth of him who has most   particles of wealth at the disposition of the legislator say  0000—happiness of the most wealthy to that of the least wealthy say as per no   as   to  —by giving to each one of  0000 a particle of wealth the legislator will produce  000 times the happiness he would produce by giving the  0000 particles to one person   on these data might be grounded a scale exhibiting the quantities of happiness produced by so many additions made as above to the minimum of wealth to the respective happiness of any number of persons whose respective quantities of wealth exceed one another by the amount of a particle in each instance iii case or state of things the third—the particles of wealth about to go out of the hands of the parties   by the subtraction of a particle of the matter of wealth a less subtraction from happiness will be produced if made from the wealth of him who has the matter of abundance than if from the wealth of him who has the matter of subsistence only   so if from the wealth of him who has a larger portion of the matter of abundance than if from the wealth of him who has not so large a portion of the matter of abundance   fortunes equal and the aggregate sum subtracted being given the greater the number of the persons from whose wealth the subtraction is made the less will be the subtraction thereby made from the aggregate of happiness   fortunes unequal still less will be the subtraction of happiness if it be in the ratio of their fortunes that the subtraction is made the greatest quantity being subtracted from those whose fortunes are greatest   a quantity of the matter of wealth may be assigned so small that if subtracted from the fortune of a person possessed of a certain quantity of the matter of abundance no sensible subtraction of happiness would be the result   the larger the fortune of the individual in question the greater the probability that by the subtraction of a given quantity of the matter of wealth no subtraction at all will be made from the quantity of his happiness   so likewise if the ratio of the sum to be subtracted to the aggregate mass from which it is to be subtracted be so great that by the subtraction of it subtraction of a quantity more or less considerable cannot but be made from the aggregate of happiness—still the larger in the case of each individual the aggregate of wealth is from which the subtraction is made the less will be the quantity of happiness so subtracted as above iv case or state of things the fourth—the particles of wealth about to go out of the hands of the one party into the hands of the other   fortunes equal—take from the one party a portion of the matter of wealth and give it to the other—the quantity of happiness gained to the gainer of the wealth will not be so great as the quantity of happiness lost to the loser of the wealth   fortunes unequal—the poorer the loser the richer the gainer greater in this case is the diminution produced in the mass of happiness by the transfer than in the last mentioned case   fortunes again unequal—the richer the loser the poorer the gainer the effect produced on happiness by the transfer may in in this case be either loss or gain whether it be the one or the other will depend partly upon the degree of the inequality partly upon the magnitude of the portion of wealth transferred if the inequality be very small and the wealth transferred also   0 small the effect produced on the sum of happiness may be loss but if either be—much more if both be other than very small the effect on happiness will be gain   income of the richer say £ 00000 ayear—income of the less rich say £      ayear wealth taken from the first and transferred to the less rich £  ayear—on the sum of happiness the effect will be on the side of loss—more happiness will be lost by the richer than gained by the less rich hence one cause of the preponderance produced on the side of evil by the practice called gaming   income of the richer loser £ 00000 ayear—income of the less rich gainer £ 0 ayear—wealth lost to the richer gained by the less rich £  ayear—on the sum of happiness the effect will be on the side of gain more happiness will be gained by the less rich gainer than lost by the more rich loser thus it is that if the effects of the first order were alone taken into account the consequence would be that on the supposition of a new constitution coming to be established with the greatest happiness of the greatest number for its end in view sufficient reason would have place for taking the matter of wealth from the richest and transferring it to the less rich till the fortunes of all were reduced to an equality or a system of inequality so little different from perfect equality that the difference would not be worth calculating but call in now the effects of the second and those of the third order and the effect is reversed to maximization of happiness would be substituted universal annihilation in the first place of happiness—in the next place of existence evil of the second order—annihilation of happiness by the universality of the alarm and the swelling of danger into certainty—evil of the third order—annihilation of existence by the certainty of the nonenjoyment of the fruit of labour and thence the extinction of all inducement to labour independently of the destruction which would thus be produced by carrying or even by the known intention of carrying to its utmost possible length the equalization or say levelling system as above diminution would be effected in the aggregate of happiness by the extinction of the fund afforded by the matter of abundance for keeping undiminished the stock of the matter of wealth necessary for subsistence on consideration of what is stated above it will be found that the plan of distribution applied to the matter of wealth which is most favourable to universality of subsistence and thence in other words to the maximization of happiness is that in which while the fortune of the richest—of him whose situation is at the top of the scale is greatest the degrees between the fortune of the least rich and that of the most rich are most numerous—in other words the gradation most regular and insensible the larger the fortunes of the richest are the smaller will be the number of those whose fortunes approach near to that high level the smaller therefore the number of those from whose masses of property the largest defalcation could by possibility be made—and moreover the larger those masses the greater would be the difficulty which the legislator would experience as to the obtaining at their charge such defalcation as the nature of the case would not exclude the possibility of making thus for example it would in case of over population be easier in england or even in ireland to ward off famine for a time than it would be in british india equality requires that though it be at the expense of all the other members of the community the income of those whose income is composed of the wages of labour be maximized reason of these are composed the vast majority of the whole number of the members of the community exceptions excepted equality requires that the profits of stock be minimized reason because the net profit of stock is composed of the mass or say portion remaining to the employer of the stock after deduction made of the wages of the labour applied to it exception will be—if this supposed case be really exemplified—where the possessors of the wages of labour are so many and the possessors of the profits of stock so few that by a small addition to the one no sensible defalcation will be made from the other §   axioms relating to power rank and reputation by axioms relating to power understand selfserving power exempt from the obligation by which it is converted into trust as between individual and individual the pleasure to the superior to the powerholder from the possession and exercise of the power is not so great as the pain experienced by the party subjected therefore only when converted into extrabenefiting by appropriate obligation can it be conducive to greatest happiness the same observations will equally apply to rank and factitious estimation produced by rank so also to extra reputation or say estimation unless when acquired by service rendered to others the principle corresponding to these axioms as to equality is the inequalityminimizing principle     nomography or the art of inditing laws now first published from the mss of jeremy bentham         of nomography chapter i the subject stated law being the denomination by which in the english language designation is made of a portion of discourse by which expression is given to an extensively applying and permanently enduring act or state of the will of a person or persons in relation to others—in relation to whom he is or they are in a state of superiority—and the greek word nomos being the word which corresponds to the english word law the appellation nomography might be given to that branch of discourse which is employed by a superior to the purpose of giving direction to the conduct of a corresponding inferior in the present work the term nomography will be employed to distinguish that part of the art of legislation which has relation to the form given or proper to be given to the matter of which the body of the law and its several parts are composed—the form in contradistinction to the matter and in so far as the one object is capable of being held in contemplation apart from the other we shall proceed to consider—  the relations which nomography bears to the government of a private family—to logic to a pannomion or universal code of laws to proposal and petition and to private deontology   the ends in view in the case of nomography   the imperfections to which it is exposed   the remedies for those imperfections   the subject of language   the perfections of which the legislative style is susceptible and lastly the forms which enactments may assume chapter ii relations §   relation of nomography to the government of a private family by nomography as has just been observed is understood the art and science by means of which to the matter of law expression may be given in such sort as to maximize its conduciveness to the ends whatsoever they may be which the legislator whoever he may be may have in view of nomography the subjectmatter is matter of law—the matter of the laws which have place and are in force or are destined to have place in the political community in question matter of law is the result of expression given to the will of a person or set of persons having power to produce pain on the part of the person or persons at whose hand compliance is thus called for with the will thus expressed on each occasion the matter of law which is uttered consists and is composed of either an entire law or a portion of such matter less or greater than an entire law for understanding the nature of any portion of matter which is less or greater than that of an entire law it will be necessary to understand what that portion of matter is which is neither more nor less than the matter of an entire law an entire law may be defined a command emaning immediately or through the intervention of some subordinate authority from the supreme authority of the state in the political community in question—the political community of which it is a law in the great and allcomprehensive family of a political state a law is—that which a command is in a private family—a command directed by the head of that same family to the members of it or any one or more of them but to be productive of any of the effects intended by it the law of the legislator requires an appendage which for the production of its effects is never needed by the head of a private family with reference to the law just mentioned this appendage may be styled the subsidiary law of this subsidiary law the business and object consist in the presenting to the party or parties subject inducement directed to the purpose of producing on their parts compliance with the principal law and here then we have existing on each occasion in necessary connexion with one another two distinct species of law namely   the principal or say the directiongiving   the subsidiary or say the inducementgiving law these distinct species of laws are addressed to two different classes of persons—the directiongiving law is addressed to the person or persons at whose hands compliance is constantly looked for in the first instance—addressed always to a person or set of persons     other than the above is the subsidiary or say inducementgiving law this person or set of persons is different according as the inducement employed by the lawgiver is of the nature of evil or of the nature of good if it be of the nature of evil the inducement is styled punishment and the sort of person to whom this subsidiary law is addressed is the judge and the act which he is calculated to perform in the event of noncompliance with the will expressed by the principal law is an act of punishment—an act to which exercise is given by producing evil or say pain on the part of him by whom compliance with the will expressed by the principal law has failed to be made for giving effect to a command emaning from the head of a family and addressed to the other members of it one or more of them—no subsidiary law no inducementgiving law is necessary why because in the bosom of a private family no such functionary as a judge—no functionary distinct from the lawgiver has place here in the head are necessarily connected the two in themselves mutually distinguishable functions of the lawgiver and of the judge of this difference another consequence is—that in a private family no portion of the matter of law no portion less than an entire law no such thing as a fragment of a law has place—peculiar to the great family of the state is the existence of this fragmentitious matter the conception of which will be seen to such a degree complex and in so high a degree productive of difficulty and complexity §   relation of nomography to logic the intellectual—the volitional—and the active—into these three branches the whole texture of the human mind has for some purposes on some occasions been considered as divided† the intellectual including perception knowledge and judgment—the volitional designated by the one word will—and the active by which execution and effect is given as far as depends on the individual to the choice formed or so to speak the laws enacted by the will for these two thousand years and more‡ the branch of art and science which undertakes to give direction to the operations of the understanding has been in existence and logic a name derived from the greek is the appellation by which it has been denominated in nomography as the branch of art and science is itself new the name of it cannot it is manifest be otherwise than new—new the thing signified new of course would be any and every oral sign employed for the signification of it in the field of art and science a vast space has been discovered and this of nomography is the branch of art and science which has been invented for the filling of it up if to the operations of the understanding by appropriate rules direction is capable of being given to advantage with no less advantage may it be given to the operations of the will and the expression and method given to these same operations by the light of analogy the instructions which have been given on the subject of the logic of the understanding may be found applicable with more or less fitness to the logic of the will in common to both branches of logic belongs that portion of matter which in a work on the logic of the understanding may be termed the tactical part peculiar to the logic of the will is that part of the logic of the understanding which may be termed the argumentative or say the polemic part §   relation of nomography to the pannomion matter and form matter and form—these two elements or say elementary ingredients enter into the composition of every law and of every particle of matter that enters into the composition of a law or of a portion of the matter of law under the head of matter are comprehended the ideas to which expression is designed to be given—the ideas or say the things that require to be signified—by the form understand the signs by means of which these same things are signified—the words and combinations of words by which expression is given to those same ideas by a pannomion understand the entire mass of the matter of law which in the country or say political state in question has the force of law—a mass by which when that extent is given to it which it is capable of having and ought to have the whole field of law and legislation is comprehended and the whole surface of it as it were covered to the head of nomography—a denomination by which title is given to the present work—belongs the consideration of what belongs to the form of a law or of any portion of the matter of law as above expression and method—under one or other or both together of these denominations may be ranked and included whatsoever     consideration belongs to the form in which a portion of the matter of law is capable of being clothed by expression understand the words and combinations of words by the aggregate of the signs of which the matter of the law is signified by the method understand the different groups or say assemblages in which these same signs are put together and the order in which these same groups and in each group the words of which it is composed follow one another §   relation of nomography to proposal and petition superiority—equality—inferiority—between man and man in the scale of power these three are the degrees which have place addressed to an inferior a discourse expressive of the will of his superior possesses the character and effect of a law addressed to a superior a discourse expressive of the will of an inferior presents itself in the character of a petition addressed to an equal a discourse expressive of the will of his equal presents itself in the character of a proposal a requisition agrees with a law in trusting to power for compliance with the will expressed by it—it differs from a law in that it emanes not immediately from the superior power in the state nor even necessarily from any one of the constituted authorities for compliance with the will expressed by it however it places its ultimate reliance on the supreme power in the state forasmuch as on this supreme power it is that all other power depends for its existence a request differs from a petition no otherwise than that in the case of the request the place of the superior in the scale of power is not so high—the place of the inferior not so low—as in the case of the petition altogether free from that complication which has place in the case of a law are a proposal and petition why answer—because in neither of these cases is there any place for that subsidiary law the need of which has been brought to view in the case of a law there is no punishment in the case—no reward in the case—no functionary by whom eventually to wit in the case of noncompliance the punishment—no functionary by whom eventually to wit in the case of compliance the reward is to be applied to proposals and petitions no small quantity of the machinery applied by nomography to the matter of law will however be found applicable—the matter of discourse being the matter employed in all three cases in pursuing our course in the field of nomography occasion will be seen for bringing to view the imperfections by which the matter of discourse when applied to the purpose of law and nomography is liable to be deteriorated—the imperfections by which the will of the supreme legislator is in a greater or less degree liable to be frustrated—and of the remedies which present themselves as applicable to these several imperfections of the same imperfections the matter of discourse when applied to the purpose of a proposal will be found susceptible and accordingly of the same remedies for these imperfections and so in case of a petition but as neither in the case of a proposal nor in the case of a petition either punishment or reward have any place accordingly in neither of these cases does any such importance attach either to the imperfections or to the remedies as in the case of a law §   relation of nomography to private deontology strictly speaking not nomology and deontology but the pannomion on the one hand and an allcomprehensive system of deontology on the other part are the objects between which the relation has place for in this respect the matter of a treatise on deontology stands upon the same footing as the matter of a proposal and the matter of a petition as above but the contents of the pannomion have their form as well as their matter—and so have those of a treatise on deontology and now after the relation of nomography to so many kindred objects has been brought to view this last presented itself as being necessary to conclude the list a portion of the matter of law gives existence to the inducements or say motives on which it depends for the obtaining compliance with the will signified and expressed by it a treatise on deontology gives not existence to any such inducements what it does—all that it does is in each case to give intimation of those inducements which actually have place in the nature of man and things for compliance with the will to which it gives expression chapter iii proper end in view §   general observations in the case of nomography that is to say in the case of an allcomprehensive treatise on nomography the proper end in view is the same as in the case of the pannomion—it being no other than the giving to the entire pannomion or to that part of it which is upon the carpet the execution and effect intended by it the form being in itself an object entirely subservient to the matter thus it is that this end in view belongs to them both in common—but always in subserviency to that common end to nomography belongs another     end which is peculiar to itself—this end is the contributing to the utmost to that prime and leading object whatever it be which the matter of the work in question—namely in the present instance the pannomion—has in view come now for consideration the means which in that character are conducive and subservient to that peculiar end a circumstance which gives no small increase to the usefulness of these means and correspondent strength to their claim to notice is the circumstance of their being in no small extent applicable to discourse in general—to discourse to what subject soever applicable—and more particularly to all discourse of an instructional or say didactic nature the immediate secondary end or say the immediately subservient means with relation to the primary end of nomography may be thus expressed—investing the pannomion throughout the whole matter of it in the highest degree possible with the several qualities or properties conducive to that end—or say properties desirable in instructional discourse thereby maximizing its appropriate aptitude positive or negative—in either of these two opposite forms may these desirable properties be presented to view the positive is the form in which at a first view they will be apt to present themselves but upon a closer examination they will be found internally of a negative character though clothed and disguised in a positive garb blemishes imperfections detrimental qualities or figuratively speaking vices—by one of these names in one word the several qualities opposite to the qualities desirable in this case may be designated—qualities these which in proportion as in any portion of discourse they have place obstruct and stand in the way of the attainment of that same end beneficial is the epithet by which denomination may be given to the qualities correspondent and opposite to those same detrimental qualities perfections is the name by which they might have been designated and would have been designated but that by this word intimation is given that in the case of the quality in question no degree which is beyond and above the degree in which the subject is thus spoken of as possessing it has place—and occasion will not be wanting for bringing to view certain expedients of rather a novel complexion by each of which more will be done towards investing the discourse with the qualities desirable than by the bare removal of the detrimental qualities correspondent and opposite to the beneficial ones above alluded to under the notion of form are included expression and method—but the things themselves are not so plainly distinct from one another as by these their appellatives they may be apt to appear to be method is the result partly of the choice made of the most general and comprehensive of the terms which the nature of the subject calls into use—of the choice made of those comprehensive terms and thence of the composition of the several bundles or packets of intellectual objects which they respectively present bound up together and of the order the numerical order in which they are so presented when the term expression is employed the subject in question consists of a particular portion of the matter of law which on the occasion in question is considered in itself only and without reference to any connexion it may have with the whole or with this or that portion of the vast aggregate mass of which it forms a part in proportion as the plan or scheme of nomography pursued in any body of law stands clear of or is sullied by the imperfections or vices incident to the form in which a quantity of legislative matter is capable of being presented it will be apt or inept but although the form be the source to which the several vices or imperfections of which a body of law is susceptible in respect of its form may be referred yet the matter also becomes the seat of them inasmuch as in proportion as considered in respect of its form the rule of action is seen to be characterized by these imperfections it is through their influence seen to be in respect of its matter less adapted to its ends than it would be if pure from them §   nomography its general end—relative notoriety legislation is a practical operation having on each occasion a practical object—viz the attainment of a practical end be that end what it may—whether matter or form be considered—the manner in which on any occasion the task is executed will be perfect in proportion as it is conducive—imperfect in proportion as it is unconducive or obstructive with relation to the attainment of that end considered in relation to the matter of the law itself the end of nomography admits of an infinity of diversifications and ramifications none of which belong to the present purpose considered in relation to form—in relation to the form given or to be given on each occasion to that portion of the matter of law which on that occasion is the subject of consideration—on each and every occasion one and the same object will be found to be that which on every occasion it will be incumbent on the legislator to set before him and apply his endeavours to the attainment of and that object—notoriety—relative notoriety whatsoever good effects the portion of law     in question may in virtue of its matter be intended or calculated to produce the production of those effects will depend in the instance of each individual on whom the law calls for his obedience on the hold which it has happened to it to take upon his mind viz in the first place upon the circumstance of the fact of his being apprized of the existence of the law of the general matter of fact viz that on the subject in question there exists such a thing as a portion of law in the next place upon the degree of correctness and completeness with which as often as any occasion comes for acting in obedience to or in any other way in pursuance or consequence of such portion of law the matter of it is present to his mind to the production of any bad effects no such notoriety is in the instance of any portion of law in any degree necessary for a man to be put to death in due course of law for noncompliance with this or that portion of law it is not by any means in any case necessary that either the matter of it or the fact of its existence should ever have reached his mind on the contrary whosoever they be to whom it is matter of satisfaction that men should be put to death in due course of law and these more especially among english judges and other english lawyers are many the greater the extent to which they can keep from each mans mind the knowledge of such portions of law to which on pain of being put to death for disobedience they are called upon to pay obedience the greater the extent to which they can administer this satisfaction to their minds and if the portions of legal matter to which this result is attached had for their object the administering of this satisfaction to those from whose pens they issued they could scarcely have been rendered in a more effectual degree subservient and conducive to that end than they have been rendered by the form into which the matter of that and all other parts of the english law have been cast true it is that before any man can be put to death or otherwise vexed for nonobedience to any portion of law what is necessary is that some person—nay that divers and sundry persons should be apprized not only of its existence but its contents forasmuch as a man of ordinary prudence such as are all those who are in the habit of taking each of them a part in an operation of this sort will not engage in any such operation except in the persuasion well or ill grounded of his being warranted in so doing if not by the tenor of any real law at any rate by the feigned tenor or purport of some imaginary law or rule of law which for his justification and protection will be attended with this same effect but when the bearing a part in the putting of men thus to death is of the number of those acts by the performance of which men are called upon to manifest their obedience the production of an effect of this sort is not among those results which generally openly and avowedly at least by the legislator are held up to view in the character of the objects or ends in view ultimately aimed at ultimately and absolutely good a result of this sort is not generally for even here there are some exceptions declared to be relative and that alone is the term employed in giving expression to the point of view in which any such appellative as good is spoken of as applicable to such a subject—that a should be put to death is good is maintained why that b and c may without being put to death abstain from the commission of acts of the sort of that for the performance of which a is thus ordered to be dealt with these things well considered it will be manifest that whatsoever bad effects are capable of being produced by a portion of law without its being known to those on whom in the first instance it calls upon for their obedience yet as to any effects which with relation to the community in general can upon the whole bear with propriety any such appellative as that of good effects its efficiency in relation to these good effects will depend upon the degree of efficiency and perfection with which on the occasion in question it has happened to it or to the purport and thence to the tenor of it to have presented and fixed itself in that persons mind §   nomography—its particular ends—correspondent to the avoidance of the obstructions to notoriety such being in the business of nomography the general end in view—such being the object proper to be aimed at upon all occasions and in all cases what are the means best adapted to the attainment of that end the answer is—the avoidance of the several modes of imperfection of which in point of expression and method the style of legislative penmanship is susceptible for the attainment of this end make your meaning known and understood by every person of whom you expect that he should act in consequence thus simple is the general rule that in and by it it should seem as if indication were given of everything applicable in the character of a means towards the attainment of this end on the sort of occasion here in question is it really your wish that what you give as the character of the expression of your will—the real character and purport of such your will—should on each occasion on which action is called for on the part of those you have to deal with be borne in mind if so—if such be really your wish—you will act     on this occasion as on every other occasion which presents itself in ordinary private life you are wont to act towards those with whom on those several occasions you have to deal in dealing with these your fellowsubjects whose concerns upon a larger scale are committed to your management—these fellowsubjects for whom as well as over whom in the character of their master and agent and trustee you act—you will in this particular at least deal with them with the same simplicity and sincerity as that with which when calling for obedience on the part of your own children or your own servants you address yourself to any of your own children or servants on each occasion when addressing yourself to those who are subject to your power for your own ends you call for obedience you speak intelligibly—you are understood accordingly and you obtain what you desire when for ends of a public nature for the use and benefit of the community in general you call for obedience—here too the language is equally open to you—the ordinary means of intercourse are equally open to you apply the language with the same simplicity and sincerity to its purpose—apply those means of intercourse in like manner—speak intelligibly to those to whom you speak—you will be understood accordingly convey into the hands of each person that which for his complying with your desire it is necessary should reach them and be found there—do this and here too for the like causes and with equal certainty you will have your desire such is the manner in which in all cases if he would compass the ends of language a man must act and speak—this is the manner in which as often as for his behoof a man seeks to obtain obedience he does act and speak—this is the manner in which if he be a man of law employed by government under the notion of his seeking to obtain obedience from this or that part of the community for the use and behoof of the whole community he never has yet spoken—he never does speak on the contrary all the imperfections into which on the occasion of the communication holden by him with any of those to whom for the purpose of obtaining obedience for his own use and behoof it can ever happen to his discourse in consequence of this or that instance of accidental oversight or involuntary weakness to exhibit here and there the marks of in any the slightest degree and at any the longest intervals—all these on every occasion on which it happens to him to hold communication with any of those to whom for the purpose or professed purpose of obtaining obedience for the use and behoof of the whole community to address himself are with anxious care study and undeviating regularity displayed and accumulated each of them in a degree of plenitude and consummation of which on any other occasion never would the utmost industry of man be able to discover any example hence it is that for the purpose of showing in what manner in respect of expression and method portions of the matter of law ought to be penned—in what manner the attainment of the universal end of language and verbal intercourse ought on this occasion to be aimed at—all that can be done is to look out for and collect together under heads as faults to be avoided the several vicious peculiarities—in a word the several imperfections of which examples are to be found in the language habitually employed and the course taken in other respects by the framers of english statute law—including in this catalogue as well those into the manifestation of which men are now and then seen on other occasions to be betrayed by casual oversight or involuntary weakness and those which on this occasion are the result of strenuous attention and anxious imitation and observance in a word to show in what manner aws and portions of laws ought to be penned nothing less is requisite nothing more is possible than to show in what manner they have hitherto been penned and this to the end that in future the manner in which they are penned may when compared with the manner in which they have hitherto been penned be seen to be as unlike as possible proceed we now to exhibit such a catalogue of these imperfections as a diligent research made for this purpose has succeeded in bringing to view so many different modes of imperfection as are to be found exemplified in the composition of english statute law so many particular objects which in the course of his travels over this field the legislative draughtsman ought to have constantly in view as so many stumbling blocks to the avoidance of which his anxiety and industry ought on every occasion to be kept directed §   imperfections adverse to the end of nomography classed method and expression taken together the imperfections of which a mass of law considered in respect of its form is susceptible may be distinguished into those of the first order and those of the second order to the first order may be referred such imperfections as are so in themselves or rather with reference to those objects which may be seen to be the immediate ends of all discourse—of discourse considered in a general point of view—and consequently of discourse considered with reference to the     particular objects or ends which are in view in the case of the particular sort of discourse—viz legislative discourse—which is here in question under the head of imperfections of the second order may be placed such as are so no otherwise than with reference—or at least such as are so with reference—to the imperfections of the first order—viz in as much and in as far as each one of these imperfections of the second order is conducive to some one or more of the imperfections of the first order—i e conducive to the investing the discourse into which they enter in a degree more or less considerable with some one or other of the vicious qualities designated by the denominations by which the imperfections of the first order stand respectively expressed §   imperfections of the first order enumerated the imperfections vicious qualities or vices of the first order of which a mass of law considered in respect of its form is susceptible seem reducible to three heads—viz   ambiguity   obscurity   overbulkiness   ambiguity is where the effect of the expression employed is to present in conjunction divers imports in such sort that though to the individual mind in question it appear clear enough that in one or other of them is to be found the import which by the legislator was intended to be conveyed yet which it is that was so intended to be conveyed is matter of doubt   obscurity is where of the expression employed the effect is for the present at least not to present any one import as that which by the author or authors of the portion or portions of law in question was on the occasion in question intended to be conveyed in the case of ambiguity the mind is left to float between two or some other determinate number of determinate imports—in the case of obscurity the mind is left to float amongst an indeterminate and it may be an infinite number of imports obscurity is ambiguity taken at its maximum   overbulkiness ambiguity and obscurity are imperfections capable each of them of finding its seat in any the minutest part of a mass of the matter of law overbulkiness is an imperfection not capable of being brought into existence but by the accumulation of a large number of such points supposing the bulk of the mass swollen to a certain pitch—notoriety the relative notoriety in question finds in this quality of the mass a bar of the physical kind absolutely insuperable the powers of no human mind being adequate to the sustentation of the whole of such a burthen portions of the mass more or less considerable must with relation to every individual without exception be to any influence which it is possible for them to exercise on his conduct as if they had no existence—be with reference to him completely nonnotorious whether this nonnotoriety shall be as at present an enormous evil or no evil at all depends upon a very plain distinction—a distinction so obvious that in the case of a man to whom the law had never presented itself in any other character than that of a source of opulence and power to men of the profession—some care attention and vigilance would one should think be necessary to enable a man to avoid seeing it overbulkiness may to this purpose be distinguished into absolute and relative absolutely speaking the imperfection of overbulkiness may be ascribed to a body of legal matter when taken in its totality the bulk of it is too great to admit of its being at all times effectually present to the minds of all persons who in point of interest are concerned in shaping their conduct in conformity to it relatively speaking the imperfection of overbulkiness cannot justly be ascribed to it any further than as it is so put together that in the instance of this or that individual such portions of it which he is concerned as above to bear in mind fail in the whole or in part of having been presented to his mind and lying within his reach in such manner as to be at all times completely within his grasp in this speculative distinction the imperfection here in question will be seen to possess a specific remedy the application of which will be exhibited in detail when after a fill given of these imperfections we come to consider of what remedies they may be susceptible so as each individual have but the advantage and comfort of beholding effectually within his reach—within the reach of his purse as well as of the mastery of his mind whatsoever parts he is in any way concerned in point of interest to be acquainted with the bulk of the whole how vast soever is with reference to him a matter of indifference overbulkiness is not with relation to him among the properties that belong to it   0 defectiveness is a species of imperfection under which a body of law is no less liable to labour than under that of overbulkiness or ambiguity or obscurity—accordingly of the whole field of english law all that part which having in the shape of real law nothing at all to cover it is by the allembracing imposture of the licensed manufacturers of falsehood and deceit construed and taken to be filled up by the imaginary matter of common alias unwritten law—by so much as is thus considered as covered with common alias unwritten law by so much is the whole mass of english law defective and the english code no less preeminently conspicuous in this imperfection than in respect of any of those others but defectiveness at least when thus fixed and explained is an imperfection which belongs not to the form but to the matter of law—and on that account belongs not to the present purpose §   imperfections of the second order enumerated the imperfections of the second order of which a mass of law considered in respect of its form is susceptible may be thus enumerated—   unsteadiness in respect of expression—when for the designation of the same import divers words or phrases are employed   unsteadiness in respect of import—when to the same word or phrase divers imports are attached in different places   redundancy—when of any number of words employed in connexion with each other the whole or any part might without prejudice to the sense—i e to correctness completeness and facility of intellection—be simply omitted or others in less number be inserted in the room of them redundancy is either curable by simple omission or not eurable but by substitution   longwindedness—when a portion of legislative matter the elements of which are in such sort connected with each other that to comprehend in a complete and correct manner any one part the mind finds itself under the necessity of retaining within its grasp the whole is drawn out to such length as to be liable to overpower the retentive faculty of the mind on which the obligation of taking cognizance of it is imposed   entanglement—when propositions distinct in themselves are forced together into one grammatical sentence and in this state carried on together throughout the course of it   nakedness in respect of helps to intellection—especially if in respect of such as are in general use—such as division into parts of moderate length—designation of those parts by concise titles and figures of arithmetic expressive of numbers for indication of such respective parts—and reference by titles and numbers as above instead of by general description of their contents   disorderliness—  in respect of the arrangement given to the several matters—whether by including under one and the same name and thence under the same treatment matters which in respect of the diversity of their nature require each a different treatment—  by placing at a distance from each other those which for facility and clearness and correctness of intellection ought to stand contiguous to each other or near at least to each other or contiguous or near those which ought to be at a distance—or   by giving to this or that article the precedence over this or that other which for clearness or facility of intellection ought to have been placed before it the seats of these imperfections will be found to be either—  words taken singly or   words taken in combination §   connexion between the imperfections of the first and of the second orders on the most cursory glance a general idea of the manner in which these imperfections of the second order are respectively conducive to the superinducing on the mass the imperfections of the first order is obtainable without difficulty   unsteadiness in respect of expression is conducive in the first place to obscurity—because by a change in expression for the moment a suspicion at least howsoever removeable of a difference in point of import cannot but be produced—difference of expression being the only means by which a difference of import could if intended be announced so likewise to overbulkiness—unless when it happens that the several different locutions employed to designate the same import are all of them of exactly the same length   unsteadiness in point of import of such unsteadiness ambiguity is the obvious and almost inseparable consequence   redundancy how necessarily productive this imperfection is of overbulkiness is selfevident and that it is even generally productive of obscurity and frequently of ambiguity will be little less so   longwindedness of this imperfection in proportion as it prevails obscurity it will readily be acknowledged is the necessary and ambiguity a natural and frequent consequence   entanglement of this imperfection obscurity is the obvious and to a certain degree the necessary—ambiguity again the not unfrequent though but accidental result   nakedness in respect of the helps particularly the customary helps to intellection ambiguity and obscurity are the imperfections of the first order to the production of     which this imperfection of the second order is most obviously subservient in the production of overbulkiness its efficiency is still more constant and powerful and little if at all less obvious that which with these ordinary helps might be expressed by a figure or two with or without a word or two requires when destitute of them always a multitude of words sometimes as many as would suffice to fill a moderate page by the figure or two with or without a word or two the object would be effected in perfection without of either ambiguity or obscurity any the slightest shade by the page if it be compassed at all the object is never compassed without considerable danger of ambiguity and of obscurity or constant and most troublesome abundance   disorderliness to a general conception it can scarcely be otherwise than sufficiently obvious that of all the several imperfections of the first order viz ambiguity obscurity and overbulkiness—disorderliness in all its various modifications will in proportion to its intensity be a perennial source but the most productive form in which it can exist is that which it assumes by confounding together into one immense chaos the several portions of the matter of law each of which would on examination of its nature be seen to be in respect of the demand it presents for cognition and notification confined to a few classes of persons of each of which the proportion would not amount to more than the two or three hundredth or thousandth per centage of the whole of the species of nakedness here in question the only example to be seen—the only example discoverable in the field of law—the only example to be found in the world of letters in the civilized part of the world is that which is afforded by english statute law it required the union of professional industry and ingenuity with supreme power to create and preserve in the country that claims in respect of psychological endowments of all sorts intellectual and moral the superiority over every other a mode and habit of literary intercourse between governors and governed so peculiarly and manifestly adverse to every honest purpose as to the other modes of imperfection—including the three of the first order and the seven of the second order—though in this same system of law these also are found signally prominent yet it is only in degree and not in specie that they are peculiar to it §   general depravity of the style of english statutes for bringing to view and summing up the imperfections of english statute law—the language employed for the purpose of legislation by english lawyers no more is requisite than to bring to view and sum up the points by which it is distinguished from the ordinary language of the multitude wheresoever it is seen to differ it will be seen to differ to its disadvantage—peculiar absurdity the immediate effect—peculiar mischief the result this distinction from the ordinary language of the multitude is peculiar to the language of english statute law foreign laws are clear from it it has been among the devices of lawyers to connect with everything that is justly dear to english hearts the absurdities and the vices in and by which they reap their profit fiction—the vice which they are not ashamed to avow and magnify under that name—fiction has never been either more or less than lying for the purpose of extortion and usurpation—yet men who ought to have known better have not been ashamed to stand up and speak of fiction as the foundation and efficient cause causa sine quâ non of everything that is most valuable in the fabric of the constitution and the texture of the common law lying the foundation—the causa sine quâ non of what is most excellent in law in what sink of folly and wickedness shall we look for the root of so mischievous a paradox as if wrong could be converted into right at pleasure by the mere telling of a lie without lies in their mouths lawyers would not have been suffered to do the mischief they have done—without lies in their mouths they would not concur in doing what little good their own particular interest suffered them to concur in doing but is it to the vice that the good which they were so forward in employing it about is to be ascribed when james was driven from his throne english lawyers refused to set their hands to the work unless parliament would join in the notorious lie that he was averse to sit on it any longer this lie—was it either necessary or of any the smallest use in scotland no such lie was told and james was not less effectually expelled from the scottish throne than from the english he had made a bargain with somebody—a bargain to govern well—he had made no such bargain he had made no bargain at all about the matter a bargain necessary to constitute a sufficient reason for good government a sufficient reason for seeking security against mischief and abuse what if he had made a bargain to govern badly would it then have been the duty of the king to afflict the people with bad government—would it have been the duty of the people to submit to it     as well when good as when mischief is to be done advantage is taken by them of the public weakness to cram into the work in as large a proportion as possible that mixture of vice and sort of absurdity of which they are the compounders and to this compound of mischief they ascribe the honour of whatever good is done with as much truth and as much reason and sincerity might a man slip in along with the memorials usually buried with the first stone of an edifice a bridge or a court of justice—a rotten egg and a rotten apple and then set up proclaiming the virtue of rotten eggs and rotten apples oh rare rotten eggs oh rare rotten apples no bridges without rotten eggs no justice without rotten apples a rotten egg or a rotten apple is quite as necessary and conducive to the stability of a bridge for the convenience of passengers or of the edifice in which justice or what is called by that name is to be administered as fiction legal fiction ever can have been or ever can be to any good work that may be attempted with it but though it is useless to expect that these imperfections will be acknowledged by the longrobed penners of the english statutes regard for his own intellectual reputation should suffice to prevent the man of law from professing himself not fully conscious of the repugnancy of his style and method to every useful and honest purpose and design of language the english lawyer more especially in his character of parliamentary composer would if he were not the most crafty be the most inept and unintelligent as well as unintelligible of scribblers yet no bellmans verses no metrical effusion of an advertising oilshop were ever so much below the level of genuine poetry as when taken for all in all are the productions of an official statutedrawer below the level of the plainest common sense §   effects of these imperfections on the faculties and operations of the legislator himself the mind of the subject is not the only mind on which these imperfections in the present established system of legislative penmanship exercise their baleful influence—another mind on which their influence is but too conspicuous is that of the legislator himself true it is that at the upshot it is on the subject that this branch of the mischief falls and with no less weight than does the other quidquid delirant reges plectuntur achivi —but when on its way to the passible faculties of the mind of which the station is in the lower place it impinges upon the agible faculties of the mind whose station is in the higher place the mischief assumes a different complexion and requires altogether a different description to bring it to view not that in thus changing its place the mischief meaning always the ultimate mischief undergoes any very considerable change either in its nature or thence in its proper name on the part of the law noncognoscibility or that which comes to the same thing unintelligibility on the part of the mind for the cognizance of which the law is destined or pretended to be destined—of these results the ultimate mischief is in both cases constituted in the one case the mind thus darkened is that of the individual the subjectcitizen—in the other case it is that of the legislator himself—the very author of the darkness by the same causes by which the mind of the individual is prevented from extracting anything like clear conception out of the confused mass of disorderly matter shot down before it the mind of the legislator is operated upon in the same way and with the same effect the legislator and not the individual is indeed the person by whose feet the dust is raised but when it is once raised and all the time it is raising his own eyes are not less effectually prevented from enabling him to see his way through it than the eyes of those upon whose back his commands and prohibitions burthens and restraints and punishments and all his snares and entanglements are rained down hence not only is the individual prevented from knowing and understanding what on this and that occasion the meaning of the legislator is or was when he wrote—but in a certain sense the legislator is himself prevented from understanding what he himself is doing while he writes what may or may not have happened to him is to know what his own meaning wish and intention is at the time—but that which is sure to happen to him is not to know what his own wish and intention would have been if throughout the whole field of action of which he has taken possession his conception of his subject had been at the same time correct and complete to the degree in which it ought to have been so—and might have been and perhaps would have been if the obstructions which the accustomed system of disorder raised up before him as he advanced had been removed and his intellectual faculties had received the comfort of those helps which on every other part of the field of mental action are framed communicated received and employed in such salutary abundance of the darkness and confusion of mind of which the effects are so generally conspicuous in the works of english legislators abundance of examples might be produced in the examination of one statute i have found a multitude of such gross palpable grammatical     errors as scarcely any schoolboy who had made his way to the upper form of any school in which no language was taught besides english would see himself convicted of without shame the penman whoever he was did he not know better no supposition could be more palpably untenable in the works of parliament and nowhere else are marks of ignorance thus inconsistent with the most ordinary education to be found on any other subject on any other occasion whatsoever it may be affirmed with confidence that not one of them would have been exhibited by this same hand scattering words and phrases blindfold through a wild wilderness of words scattered in the same track by preceding travellers no wonder that at every other step he should have been losing his way on no other ground would even these very feet have lost their way why because on no other ground has any such wild wilderness been raised up innumerable are the oversights that will be seen exhibited in this fertile field—innumerable the instances in which the legislator will be seen to have either fallen short of overshot the mark or gone beside it—innumerable the instances in which in case of noncompliance execution of the law upon the disobedient would be found impracticable numberless the blunders of all sorts and sizes—and by what cause produced by the system of discord which the legislative draughtsman found preestablished that confusion had first been established in his own mind which his effusions propagate and thicken and increase in other minds but the more troubled the waters the more productive the fishery—and since such is the effect of error and imperfection that all the loss goes to the account of others while all the profit and that a boundless one goes to his own account to expect that by an official lawyer or any one who hopes to become such any proposition for the amendment of the legislative style should be regarded with the marks of any more favourable sensation or any other reception than that of inward horror and outward contempt would be an expectation about as reasonable as that an individual who is paid by a per centage on the amount he expends should be sincerely and unaffectedly desirous of keeping down the amount of such expenses chapter iv imperfections primary §   uncognoscibility of all the several vices spoken of under the head of imperfections of the first order the cardinal vice is uncognoscibility dependent on and proportioned to the notoriety and hence to the cognoscibility of the rule of action are whatsoever good effects can have been expected from it—notoriety reference viz being had to the individual occasion on which in order to be productive of the good effects looked for it is necessary that an act of the sort of those which stand commanded by it should be performed—and the converse in the case of acts prohibited or permitted it is only in proportion as it is thus notorious that a law can be productive of any the smallest particle of good effect but of bad effect without any such notoriety it is capable of being productive in no inconsiderable degree such is the case with it when in a case of penal law nonobservance has for its effect punishment—and when in the case of law nonpenal nonobservance has for its effect burthen or inconvenience in some other shape on the part of the mass of law in question notoriety—on the part of him who in some way or other is concerned in point of interest to be apprized of it cognition—depends partly upon external circumstances such as the operations if any that are performed for the purpose of giving it notoriety—partly upon internal circumstances—circumstances constitutive of its internal or intrinsic aptitude for being notified uncognoscibility on the part of a mass of legal matter is a quality which may be referable either to a state of things extrinsic and foreign to the law itself or to the nature and constitution of the law itself in so far as it has its origin in a state of things extrinsic to the law itself it may be termed uncognoscibility ab extra—in so far as it has its origin in the nature and contexture the matter or the form of the law itself it may be termed uncognoscibility ab intra in so far as the imperfection comes under the denomination of uncognoscibility ab extra it is the result of want of promulgation—deficiency or inappositeness in respect of the operations necessary to convey it to and fix it in the minds of the several persons who on one account or another are in point of interest concerned to be acquainted with its existence and contents uncognoscibility ab intra may have its origin either in the form of the mass of law in question or in the matter in so far as it has its origin in the form of the law it has its origin in one or other of the imperfections of the first order—viz ambiguity obscurity or overbulkiness overbulkiness may to this purpose be distinguished into absolute and relative—relation being had to the persons concerned in point of interest in being acquainted with it overbulkiness on the part of a mass of law is absolute in so far as it cannot be reduced     by the mere process of distribution in which division is necessarily included when overbulkiness is relative only it is capable of being reduced more or less by the mere process of distribution as above—viz by taking the whole mass and distributing it among the different persons viz individuals or sorts of persons who are concerned in point of interest in different parts of it—breaking it down into so many distinct portions as there are sorts of persons each of whom is concerned with one part only whatsoever portion of legal matter has no existence but in the form of unwritten law has not properly speaking any existence for it is only in virtue of certain determinate words to which it has been consigned and of which the expression of it is composed that a portion of law can be said properly speaking to have any existence without such words without such text or tenor as the phrase is belonging to it whatsoever is given as and for a portion of legal matter exists only by fiction—is a mere figment of the imagination—and whatsoever has no existence is effectually and absolutely uncognoscible though on the subject in question there exist not any portion of the real matter of law a man may be punished as day by day men are punished as for disobedience to or noncompliance with such law—but it is not by any such act of power or punishment that a real law can be brought into existence punishment is the act of a judge or any other person who has power to do evil to the party said to be punished a law is the work of none but a legislator in so far as it is in respect of its matter that a mass of law is uncognoscible it is for want of visible reason—of reason either apparent on the face of it or made known along with it—or by apt expression annexed to the text or tenor of it in this case so far as regards the matter as above the intrinsic uncognoscibility on the part of the mass of law will not it is evident be absolute and entire—it is not to every man and at all times that an acquaintance with the nature of its contents and at the same time with the fact of its existence will be impossible but by indication of the reason if so it be that it have a reason such an instrument of fixation will be provided such an anchor for fastening it in the mind as cannot by possibility be given to it by any other means §   ambiguity and obscurity between ambiguity and obscurity the connexion is close and almost undistinguishably intimate a locution is ambiguous when two significations are presented to view in such manner that though it be clear to the reader that one of the two was meant by the author to be regarded as his—yet which of the two it is remains a matter of doubt its etymology considered by the word ambiguity if taken strictly an intimation is conveyed that of the rival significations in question the number is but two in the nature of the case however as certified by experience to the possible number of these candidates there are no certain limits but forasmuch as for the purpose of comparison these rival significations may be they ever so numerous be taken up and held in contemplation by pairs and as the etymology of the word comparison imports it is only when held up together in pairs and not in any greater number that of the points of agreement and difference amongst a number of objects—say accordingly between object and object—any such conception as shall be at once distinct correct and complete can generally if at all be formed—on these considerations be the number of these rival significations ever so extensive the terms ambiguous and ambiguity may still be employed in speaking of them obscurity may be resolved into ambiguity or at least the relation of the one imperfection to the other manifested by considering the mind as tossed about as it were in case of obscurity amongst a number of rival significations altogether indeterminate and even infinite for that in the mind of the author in question be he who he may he being in his right mind no meaning whatsoever was at the time of penning the discourse in question present cannot seriously be supposed some meaning or other then he cannot but be supposed to have had—and therefore till some determinate meanings in a limited number present themselves to the conception it will remain wandering in infinite intellectual space the field abode and station of an infinite host of meanings sometimes one single determinate meaning will have presented itself—and still whether that be the authors real meaning may remain matter of doubt this case will be apt to present itself as belonging to the head of obscurity—if considered as a case of ambiguity the doubt must be considered as having place between the determinate signification on the one hand and an infinite number of indeterminate ones on the other in a discourse of this sort when an instance of ambiguity presents itself the state of dubitation may be either merely temporary or ultimate and definitive and so in regard to the case of obscurity in the case when it is temporary a distinction may be made between the case where by a view of the context it is corrected without examination and the case where to the solution of it examination is necessary—in     the first case it may be distinguished by the appellation of momentary—in the other of permanent of any the slightest and most evanescent degree of ambiguity even though incapable of being productive of any permanent doubt the effect upon the mental feelings is unpleasant it produces upon the mind of the reader a sort of sensation attended with uneasiness to the mental faculty called taste—an uneasiness which seeks vent by stigmatizing the discourse with the imputation of clumsiness or inelegance this sort of inconvenience such as it is is one that accompanies the imperfection in question whatsoever be the species and character of the discourse which is the seat of it if though not definitive the ambiguity be permanent—to the slight and evanescent uneasiness produced by the inelegance of the discourse considered in a general point of view as a discourse is added the more serious uneasiness the anxiety which depends upon the nature and character of the particular species of discourse here in question—the anxiety produced by the consideration of the effects of which it may be productive—which in the character of a portion of law it may have upon the interest of the reader or of some individual or aggregate of individuals whose interest has been bound up with his own by the tie of sympathy if the imperfection be not only permanent but definitive the consequence is that he is thereby subjected not merely to the apprehension but to the danger of some operation more or less prejudicial to his interest as above explained at the hands of the law in penale to some punishment or else to some privation to which he considers himself as under a prudential obligation of submitting lest he should subject himself to such punishment and so in civile in nonpenale in regard to burthen an inconvenience in the shape of loss or any other shape when the ambiguity is but of the momentary or evanescent kind take any individual instance by itself—the utmost evil—the utmost uneasiness producible by it will in general be a quantity altogether impalpable too minute to have any claim to regard but when repeated and multiplied to the degree in which in the composition of an entire statute it is capable of being multiplied—of a statute of that figure and bulk which in the english statutebook is so frequently exemplified even this slight species of imperfection is not incapable of being swollen into a serious inconvenience lay upon a mans shoulders a burthen of a certain weight—it may be composed of an impalpable powder yet the pressure of it will not be the less grievous in regard to ambiguity distinctions productive of practical use may be derived from the consideration of the modifications of which the source or seat of the disease is susceptible   this seat may be in a single term in a single word—say in termino—in vocabulo   it may extend itself over a whole phrase or collection or series of words more or less numerous taken by itself—say in propositione or in contextu   its seat may be not in any single word or phrase but in any single word or phrase considered with reference to two others in which case the seat of the ambiguity is a compound seat—its elementary parts the three words or phrases taken together—in situ or ex malâ collocatione thus in the case of a phrase capable of producing the effect of a limitative clause placed between the other clauses it may—how clear soever in itself—and moreover how clear soever each of those two other clauses may be—be productive of ambiguity in respect of the doubt to which of the two it was intended to apply itself temporarily permanently or definitively at least such will be the effect of any such interposed clause if consistently with apparent common sense it be in its nature applicable as well to the one of them as to the other of the modes of ambiguity hitherto above brought to view every discourse whatsoever be the subject and object of it is susceptible to an ulterior mode of ambiguity discourse in so far as it possesses the force of law is liable this is that which is so apt to have place when it has happened to the same subject to have been taken in hand by laws of different dates the question in this case being this portion of law in the instrument of earlier date is it or is it not to be considered as superseded by this other portion of law contained in the instrument of more recent date to a doubt of this nature it is only by accident that any interpretation whatever can be afforded by the maxim leges priores posterioribus abroguntur the justness of the maxim is above dispute if on the part of the legislator of posterior time there existed any such desire as that of abrogating the provision made by the legislator of anterior time abrogated it is and must be deemed to be but any such desire—had it really any existence in his mind a desire to any such effect—was it really his desire in that part lies the difficulty the legislator of earlier time prescribes such or such a mode of doing the thing in question the legislator of later time prescribes another mode a little different the option between the two modes—is it to be considered as left or taken away and if left to whom left     §   overbulkiness as in the case of ambiguity and obscurity so in the case of overbulkiness the most serious part of the evil the intensely afflictive and at the same time allgrasping evil is resolvable into and coincides with that of uncognoscibility viz the chance which in the character of a cause the property in question has in the instance of this or that individual person of being productive of that effect with its disastrous consequences the condition in life of the individual in question is a circumstance by which the efficiency of this cause will it is evident be subjected to modification and that upon a longextended scale the man of law is the sort of person on whose faculties considering the case in the abstract the species of burthen ought to be found pressing with the severest pressure in the shape of law the burthen that presses upon him being the aggregate of all the several burthens that are to be seen or felt pressing upon any other shoulders but this being a sort of burthen which in that profession presses not upon any mans shoulders any further than in consideration of a more than equal retribution it has been his desire and his pleasure to submit them to it the consequence is that when the burthen is the most bulky the suffering produced by it is in mathematical language a negative quantity—in plain language real suffering there is none but more or less enjoyment in its place it is to this simple circumstance that the body of the law taken in its totality is obviously indebted for its present bulkiness such as it is it is the handiwork of the man of law while to every other class of men it is according to circumstances an instrument of pressure affliction ruin death—to him and in proportion as to other men it is productive of these evils it is an instrument of aggrandisement of opulence and power no wonder if in every country and in every age down to the present moment the whole force of his faculties have been bent not to the alleviation of this burthen but to the working it up to and keeping it up in a state of the most mountainous bulk and thence of the most consummate uncognoscibility that under the spur of mighty interest human ingenuity on the one part could devise human nature and stupidity on the other part submit to and endure it is not merely by its immediate operation and in the simple ratio of the magnitude of the mass that bulkiness on the part of a mass of law tends to produce and so unhappily does become productive of uncognoscibility the more there is of the mass be it what it may the more there is of that matter of which ambiguity and obscurity are capable of being found the attributes moreover by the same causes by which his exertions have been engaged in endowing this his work with the most enormous degree of bulkiness possible by the same causes have they been directed to the object of giving existence perpetuity and increase always in the utmost possible degree to those other vices though of two bodies of law each professing to be complete what may easily enough happen is that not the greater but the lesser should taken in its totality be more ambiguous and obscure yet nevertheless sure it is that the greater the bulk of any such mass the greater more perfect and exquisite is the degree of ambiguity and obscurity which it will be in mans power to plant in it accordingly not only in the article of bulkiness but under favour of it in the intimately connected articles of ambiguity and obscurity there will in the field of law be occasion to witness under favour of such causes as are not to be matched elsewhere such effects as are alike incapable of being matched elsewhere bulkiness on the part of the body of the laws may be distinguished into absolute and relative absolutely considered a body of laws may be said to be inconveniently bulky when taking the whole of it in the aggregate it is considered as pressing in an inconvenient degree upon the faculties of the whole body of the members of the community taken in the aggregate relatively considered this or that part of the body of the laws may be said to be bulky in an inconvenient degree with relation to this or that part of the whole body of the members of the community considered as loaded with it when although if to each one were presented the whole portion with which on one account or other he is concerned—and thence concerned to be acquainted with—and no more the case might be that the pressure of such portion might not be so great as to be inconvenient to him yet the case being that in addition to that portion with which he is concerned such person is burthened with a quantity of matter and that to a vast amount with which he is not concerned—hence it is that in a relative sense the whole aggregate of the body of the laws is with relation to the whole body composed of all the members of the community taken together in a highly inconvenient degree bulky and oppressive from this theoretical distinction between bulkiness in an absolute and bulkiness in a relative sense results a practical expedient such as in the character of a corrective remedy will be found of sufficient efficacy to reduce in the instance of each individual the     amount of the matter pressing upon his shoulders so as to make it no longer in the instance of any one individual a source of considerable sensible inconvenience the principle or rule of division or distribution is the name by which this practical expedient may from henceforward be distinguished and the method to be pursued in applying it throughout to the best advantage will be the subject of consideration in a succeeding chapter chapter v explanations relative to the imperfections of the second order §   unsteadiness in respect of expression this imperfection has place when and in the degree in which for the conveyance of one and the same idea or portion of an idea different locutions whether single or manyworded have been employed the imperfections of the first order to which this imperfection of the second order is indebted for its vicious quality are ambiguity or obscurity and bulkiness when so it really is that it is a mans meaning to express two or more different things difference in respect of the expression is the sole resource therefore so it is that for the moment at least when two different sets of words are observed to be employed the notion that not one and the same thing but two different sets of things are intended to be expressed in and by the use made of these different sets of words cannot but present itself to the production of the inconvenience of overbulkiness it is conducive rather by accident than of necessity when so it is that to the expression of one and the same idea a number of different expressions are successively employed they will naturally be of different lengths and the difference between the length of the longest that happens to be employed and that of the shortest of those by which the same sense would be expressed with equal aptitude multiplied into the number of the times that in the discourse in question this bulkiest expression recurs gives the maximum of the bulkiness which by means of this imperfection of the second order is produced by this same bulkiest of the several synonymous expressions thus suppose that for the designation of the idea in question a locution composed of two words would suffice instead of it in ten places a locution composed of four words is employed and in ten others a locution composed of eight words were the fourworded locution the only one employed in the twenty instances the quantity of redundant matter would be equal to the quantity of useful matter were the eightworded locution alone employed the quantity of redundant matter would be to the quantity of useful as four to one §   unsteadiness in respect of import opposite and correspondent to unsteadiness in respect of expression is unsteadiness in respect of import unsteadness in respect of expression is where for the expression of one and the same idea or part of an idea divers words or sets of words are employed unsteadiness in respect of import is where in the compass of the same discourse to the purpose of denoting divers ideas or portions of ideas one and the same word or set of words is employed ambiguity is the primary imperfection towards the production of which the tendency which this imperfection of the second order possesses is sufficiently manifest it is only by accident that the species of imperfection here in question has found its way into a mass of english statute law the soil has no particular attraction for it instances of it may however occasionally be found the following are examples of this unsteadiness in the use of terms—   common law employed to signify fictitious judgemade law as distinguished from real legislatormade law— common law as distinguished from equity as employed to distinguish the mode of procedure pursued in the original set of courts from the mode of procedure in the courts called equity courts   civil law employed as synonymous respectively to nonpenal roman noncanon nonmilitary admiralty nonecclesiastical noncommon law in the first case it denotes on the part of the enactments in question real in the case of statutemade law—fictitious in the case of judgemade law the absence of suffering appointed for the purpose and under the name of punishment in the case of roman law and canon law it is employed to designate the source from which the rule of action by the enactments real or fictitious as above of which it is composed were derived in the case of military and admiralty law the occasion on which and the purpose to which the rule of action constituted by it is applied thus it is that under the existing system on the part of the arrangements themselves and on the part of the language employed a correspondent inaptitude allpervading and most exemplary has place §   redundancy of matter i e of words the imperfection of the first order to which this imperfection of the second order     presents itself at first sight as conducive is bulkiness in the character of a cause of obscurity and thence to a greater or lesser extent of uncognoscibility bulkiness will even when most indispensably necessary be ever a matter of just regret in so far as it is necessary and has appropriate utility for its justification the inconveniences that result from it be they what they may find their proportionate compensation but where redundancy has place the redundant matter not having by the supposition any part of it any use it is by the whole of it a mass of mere mischief another imperfection of the first order to which on a nearer view this same imperfection of the second order will be seen to be naturally and frequently though not constantly conducive is obscurity be the subject what it may the more redundant the scheme or plan of phraseology which it happens to an author to take up and set out upon the greater the probability and danger is of deficiency—relation being had to the scale upon which he has undertaken thus to operate for the more ample the task which he has set himself to do the greater is the quantity by which in his endeavours to execute the whole of it he is likely to be deficient in the case of the english actofparliament style the plan and scale of operation being when compared with any ordinary discourse by far more copious and more redundantly copious the probable amount of deficiency receives a proportionable increase a little further on occasion will be taken to give a sort of analytical view of the principal forms in which in the contexture of an english act of parliament this imperfection may be seen to exhibit itself but it is from the words and from the words alone that their import can be collected and when as between locution and locution a difference—any the slightest difference—is observable in the words a correspondent difference in the intended import can scarcely ever for the moment at least fail to present itself to the readers view as a possible cause of such difference in respect of the words in a word in the character of an efficient cause of obscurity unsteadiness in expression has been already brought to view—and of unsteadiness in expression the alternation between redundancy and deficiency is one mode §   longwindedness be the nature of the mass of literary matter in question what it may—matter of legislation or any other portion of it—it may be said to be longwinded in proportion as the line of words is long and protracted through which the conception has to travel before it can find a resting place in the case of an english act of parliament for example the whole mass is to appearance cast into sections in each of which the elementary parts the words are in such sort connected that under pain of not comprehending any one part the reader finds himself under the continual obligation of gathering up the matter as he advances and retaining in his mind the whole at one grasp before he can make himself or feel as if he had made himself master of every part of it one imperfection of the first order to which this imperfection of the second order is conducive is again obscurity to the physical eye the deeper and more protracted any medium is through which it happens to any object to present itself to view the deeper the obscurity in which the object appears to be involved to the mental eye in like manner the longer the paragraph the greater the difficulty of perceiving its meaning and on all occasions penetrating to the end of it and all through it to shift the metaphor the greater the number of the words the greater the chance that sinking under the task of picking up the import of them one by one it may ere the task is over let idea after idea drop out of its grasp and in its anxiety not to lose any drop more and more till at last it have lost all possession and command over them and retain nothing but a dark and indistinct notion of the whole mass or any part of it if mere simple redundancy be of itself a cause of obscurity longwindedness is a much more powerful one as in the case of bodily so in the case of mental labour—what oppresses a man is not so much the absolute magnitude of the quantity of the work he has to go through as the shortness of the time he has to do it in—or rather the quantity which it is necessary for him to go through before it is in his power to take repose in an english act of parliament in each section the connexion given to the matter is commonly such that when once the mind has entered upon it no repose is to be had till it has reached the end of it no nor then neither unless such be the strength of its grasp as to give assurance of its retaining in a full and distinct point of view the whole mass of the matter which parcel after parcel it had in the course of its progress through the section been taking up so much worse than absolute redundancy is longwindedness that if in any instance under the oppression produced by longwindedness it were deemed necessary to seek relief—relief would in many and indeed in most instances scarcely be to be found on any     condition other than that of adding to the number of the words a bad and inconsiderate sort of economy is among the most productive of the causes by which longwindedness in masses of discourse in sections and paragraphs and sentences is produced one predicate it is conceived may be made to serve for two or more subjects and thus two or more substantives with their respective complements of attributes are forced under the governance of one verb but the masses which the pen thus conjoins the mind must sever before it can embrace and make itself master of any one of them nor of any one such fragment of a proposition can it acquire a steady view on any other condition than that of making it up into a complete one and accordingly making up within itself the complement of words necessary to that purpose thus it is that to dispel the obscurity produced by longwindedness an addition must be made to the absolute number of words—an addition by the amount of which if it did not find the original number defective it would render the mass of matter redundant in an ordinary discourse it may be not easy perhaps to find an instance of a sentence which labouring under the imperfection of longwindedness can be cured of it upon any other terms than that of making additions and those very considerable ones to the lengthiness of it take up a longwinded sentence in which matter for ten sentences is discernible—take it in hand and break it down into ten short ones—scarcely will it happen that for the composition of these short ones twice the number of words contained in the original longwinded sentence will suffice it is perhaps only in lawyers jargon—it is only in the language of an english act of parliament that instances are to be found in which upon the breaking down of a longwinded section into its component members the aggregate of the words contained in the newmoulded parts shall not exceed the aggregate number of the words contained in the original article the reason of this will be found in the circumstance that in such a variety of forms each section embraces so large a quantity of redundant and peccant matter that may be extirpated not only without prejudice but with signal benefit to the sense §   complexity or complicatedness—whence entanglement entanglement is a natural result when in one and the same grammatical sentence divers logical propositions are involved and drawn out together† one imperfection of the first order to which this imperfection of the second order is conducive is obscurity even when clear of entanglement longwindedness it has been seen‡ has obscurity for its proportionate result—but when to longwindedness entanglement is added the obscurity it is evident will be apt to be increased in a ratio greater than that of the longwindedness in the case even of simple longwindedness the task given to the apprehensive faculty may be greater than it can effectually comprehend and retain within its grasp the labour of thus holding the matter it embraces without letting drop any portion of it may be more than the intellectual faculty of the individual in question is able to sustain—and when to this labour is added that of unravelling and disentangling the interwoven threads the mind cannot but be the more in danger of letting go its hold under such a task another imperfection of the first order to which this imperfection of the second order will whether constantly or not be naturally and frequently conducive is bulkiness as the entanglement runs on the obscurity thickens—as   0 the obscurity thickens it attracts more and more the attention of the penman—fearing lest the mass should grow too involved and through much entanglement too obscure for use he sets himself to disentangle it—to point out this or that distinction in the provision meant to be made respecting the subjects thus involved but as by words it was that the matter was entangled so it is only by words that the disentanglement can be effected or so much as aimed at and thus it is that while increase is given to obscurity so is it to bulkiness §   nakedness in respect of helps to intellection the species of imperfection here meant to be brought to view is that sort of blemish of which no species of discourse is in its nature unsusceptible but which in england is in point of fact in a manner peculiar to the discourse of the legislator—to that species of discourse in the instance of which the consequences resulting from it are of the most inconvenient and pernicious cast to such a degree has been the success with which in this line of sinister industry the labour and ingenuity of the man of law has been attended that he has kept in a state of depression below the condition of barbarism not to say of savage life that part of the means of communication between mind and mind which has been unfortunate enough to fall into his hands of these helps the most prominent and obviously necessary examples consist of two connected operations—the one consisting in the making division of the whole mass of literary matter be it what it may into a number of parts of a moderate length—of a length suited to the conceptive and retentive powers of the description of persons for whose eye it is destined and the other in giving to each of such parts a name by which it may be called arithmetic—the humble but useful art and science of arithmetic—furnishes a set of names which possess the advantage of being with equal propriety and convenience applicable to any mass whatsoever physical or psychological into whatsoever parts it may be found convenient to divide it—and these denominations besides being so universally apt are at the sametime less bulky than any others that could be devised religion has availed itself of these helps to intellection and of the assemblage of works of which the sacred volume is composed each one of any length has been divided into numbered chapters and each chapter into numbered verses the interested and crafty bigotry of the man of law has refused to the people an accommodation which the scrupulous piety of the theologian could not refuse an act of parliament repels the dividing line of the arithmetician with no less horror than the accursed soil sown with salt rejects the plough of the husbandman and yields no fruit a mathematical point has no parts so neither has the chaos of an act of parliament many are the modern volumes in each of which the quantity of matter exceeds not the quantity in a single statute yet this statute is no less sacredly indivisible than if fine or præmunire had declared it one and undivided the licentiousness of the press has indeed divided it into parts called sections and to each of these sections this same licentiousness has gone so far as to affix a different number—but in the manuscript on which alone has been imprinted the touch of the legislative sceptre this conceit has no mark to give warrant or allowance to it number it has none—division it has none—what token of separation is afforded is afforded not by a black line—a blank instead of a whole line or instead of the latter part of a line—still less by any of those numbers by which in the authentic letterpress copy it is introduced a lot of surplusage and mostly a lot to the same effect such as—and be it further enacted—or and be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid gives commencement to a sentence—and it is on the reappearance of this useless string of words that the printer finds his only warrant for the arithmetical figure which to the several successive masses thus distinguished he has ventured to affix none are so deaf as those who will not hear—none so unintelligible as those whose aim and determination is not to be understood obscurity and bulkiness are the closelyconnected fruits of which this voluntary nakedness is productive and they may be seen growing upon the same stalk as often as a reference comes to be made the seat of the matter referred to is either in the act itself from which the reference is made or in some other act   if in the act itself to that mode of designation which never fails to be employed except when misdirection is an object either of study or indifference—viz designation by the arithmetical name—to that only rational and honest mode of designation is substituted an intimation that in some part or other of that same act or at best somewhere or other in the preceding part or somewhere or other in the succeeding part of that act that which is meant to be designated—that which the legislator has in contemplation—the matter which the legislator has in his mind will be to be found what is the consequence that in the one case you have to search through and examine into the whole number     of the sections one excepted contained in the act—in the other case half that number upon an average one hundred and twentythree is the number of sections in the act herein employed for an example—fifty the number of the folio pages in which these one hundred and twentythree sections are contained here then instead of a few arithmetical figures not occupying all of them together a space greater than that which is occupied by a word of ordinary length the reader has somewhat more than fifty pages to pore over and in the other case somewhat more than four and twenty containing each of them about half as many thousand words and this double and single labour is imposed several times in the course of this act but the passages in which this same subject be it what it may is touched upon are they one or many—and where is it or where are they—and in either case of each such passage how much is there to the purpose these are among the questions to which on any or each occasion a man may have to find an answer always at his peril to the magnitude of which peril no assignable limits can be set but those which are set by death   if it be in another such act that the matter in question is to be sought for then to the designation of the game to be hunted for is to be added the designation of the field in which the hunt is to be made figures and letters to the amount of the numbers of letters in a word—   geo iii c    for example—are the signs employed for this same purpose by each nonofficial hand the title of the act is the only sign which the united power of king lords and commons is ever suffered to employ for this same purpose the title of an act—and what is this same thing called the title of an act—meaning of an act of parliament it is a sentence varying in length not unfrequently containing in itself the matter of an ordinary page—and this whole page is no more than a sort of compound substantive forming no more than a part of a grammatical sentence in the texture of which not unfrequently substantives of this same sort in numbers are combined and what is this occasion on which all helps to intellection all supports to the weakness of the human mind are so studiously and perseveringly refused it is precisely that on which such helps to human weakness are at the same time of most importance and most needful—in which the magnitude of the mischief producible by a false step and that of the pressure against which the support is needed are both at the very highest pitch to facilitate the communication of knowledge in any inferior department—in the department of school grammar and common arithmetic—no exertions that can be made are thought too great while in the master science—the science upon which the fate of every other science and of all to whom it can happen either to teach them or to learn them depends—whatever exertions are made on the part of the headmaster at least have for their object not the causing it to be understood but the keeping it from being understood or causing it to be misunderstood and that to as high a degree of perfection in the arts of nonintellection and misintellection as possible so far then as concerns helps to intellection that which ought to be done by the legislator—and will be done by the legislator as soon as the interests of the whole community at large obtain in his eyes the preference over the separate and sinister interest of a small portion of it—is not only in the first place to give to the subjectmatter in question the benefit of all such helps to intellection as can be found applied to any other subject but in the next place to look out for all such additional helps if any as can be found applicable to the particular subject which stands so much in need of them†     §   unapt arrangement and disorderly collocation the importance of apt arrangement—its necessity in the character of an instrument of operation a support to the weakness of the intellectual part of the human frame is such as one should have supposed would have never found so much as a single human being to contest it if the pretence of being exempt from all need of this support had not found a stock of arrogance adequate to the advancement of it—with a correspondent disposition to regard as imbecile those by whom their need of it is felt and as trifling useless and thrown away the toils of those laborious men who employ themselves in the endeavour to improve it the more bulky and obscure the subjectmatter the more urgent the need which in its struggles with the difficulties of the subject the mind has of this instrument of support it is easier to be convinced of the utility of good order in every case than to give such a definition of good order such an account of what good order is as shall be applicable and be at once seen to be applicable to every case be the subjectmatter what it may its nature and properties will be the more correctly and completely and thence the more clearly understood the more correctly and completely the nature of the relation which it bears towards all such other objects as it can be seen to bear any assignable relation to is understood—and the more clearly the nature of it is understood the more clear and pure from the imputation of obscurity will naturally any regulation of which it constitutes the subjectmatter be reasonably expected to be what objects ought to be brought into conjunction with each other—what ought to be kept separate from each will depend upon the particular nature of the particular subject which is on the carpet but of bad order some general notion may be given by descriptions which shall apply to good order and thence to bad order whatsoever be the subject good order may be disturbed bad order produced either by joining together things that ought not to be joined or by separating from each other things that ought not to be separated and in the case of things that ought not to be separated the order is worse and worse the greater the mutual distance is to which they are cast nomenclature is classification—to denominate wherever the denomination is a general term—to denominate is to classify to methodize to put in order to arrange by denomination all individuals all species are brought together brought as it were into contact by being comprehended under the same name if in the case of a number of objects brought together by the same name the dissimilitude be such that no property belonging to each of them be found then so it is that of the thing distinguished by that name nothing can be said that is true the greater the number of propositions that can be found to belong to each one of them all without exception the greater the number of truths that can be predicated of them and the more serviceable the principle of arrangement of which they constitute the subject     bad order is either that which is such in respect of aggregation or disaggregation or that which is such in respect of precedence in the case of that which is said to be bad in respect of aggregation or disaggregation the order of precedence between object and object in the case of such objects as are cast into one group by being brought under the same name is not considered when the scheme of order in question is spoken of as being bad in respect of precedence the articles with reference to which the topic of precedence is brought to view are considered as being each of them distinguished and made known by a separate name—and thereupon it is that in relation to the several objects or articles upon the list the question arises which shall be placed or spoken of first which second and so on through the rest in this case bad order takes place when relation being had to the purpose or design whatever it be which is in view that object which ought to have stood first is placed second or in some lower rank and so in regard to the rest in the case of the english acts of parliament instances will be found in but too great abundance in which reference being had to the purpose or design which was or at any rate ought to have been in view disorder in both its shapes as above distinguished may be seen to manifest itself chapter vi of remedies §   of remedies for ambiguity   when the ambiguity is in terminis or in vocabulo the nature of the case admits not any remedy susceptible of universal application the term must either be changed or by such explanation as the nature of the individual case requires the import of it must be limited and fixed   so where the ambiguity is in propositione or in contextu   where the ambiguity is in situ i e ex prava collocatione the case admits of a remedy susceptible of a general description applicable to all cases a proposition capable of being understood for the moment at least as meant to be applied in the character of a limitative proposition to either of two other propositions but in reality meant to be applied to only one of them is inserted between the two in this situation lies the efficient cause of the ambiguity the remedy is simple and effectual insert it neither between them both nor after them both nor before them both but in the bosom of one of them viz of that one of them to which and to which alone it is in such its limitative character intended to be understood as applying thus it is when the object in view is to apply a limitative proposition to one single principal proposition and to that alone the operation is sure and easy but suppose the object to be to apply one clause in the character of a limitative clause to two or more say to two principal ones here the rule is prefix it to both   do not place it between both for to do so would be to render it doubtful whether it were meant to apply to both or to one only—and if to one only to which   do not place it at the end of both—to do so would be to give occasion to regard as the preferable supposition that it was meant to apply to the last alone not to the first insert it after the last of the two—the idea naturally suggested by this position will be that it was by that last and that alone that it was suggested—that it was the last that for want of this limitation was too general and accordingly but for the limitation so applied the phrase employed for giving expression to it would have been incomplete—that     in presenting in the first instance the proposition which by the supposition is too general too comprehensive a sort of false step was made and it was to correct this false step that in the way of afterthought the limitative clause was added on this occasion let the state of the authors mind have been what it may such is the state of the readers mind the first conception he imbibes is incomplete and incorrect—incorrect by reason of its excess in point of extension the result of the as yet unsupplied defect in the form of words employed for the expression of it—which defect consists in the absence of the limitative clause that was necessary to render the expression exactly commensurate with the import as it stood in the authors mind at the next step indeed the mind of the reader imbibes the conception by which he is enabled to correct the momentary error—to retrace the false step which he had made but as in the progress of the body so in that of the mind the sensation of a false step is however expeditiously and easily retrievable a sensation of an unpleasant kind such as by repetition is capable of being rendered seriously disagreeable and such as even in any single instance it would be better to a man to avoid than to experience take now the case where the clause meant for a limitative clause is placed before the first of the clauses which it is meant to limit by it here in the first place so far as regards the first of the two principal clauses all such error as hath just been brought to view is effectually prevented at the very outset notice is given that the proposition which is about to follow is not meant to be given as expressive of the authors meaning till after the portion of extent indicated by the antecedent the limitative clause which is thus employed to introduce it has been taken out of it thus it is that to the reader the unpleasant sensation the sort of false step in question is saved at the same time on the part of the author of that selfpossession that mastery of the subject that state of complete preparation for the task he has set himself that indication is given which has been above explained at the very commencement of the sentence the conception which it was his own endeavour to convey was it is manifest already formed had the powers of the language sufficed for the conveying the conception in its perfect state in one single clause—such single clause and no more would have been employed for it the language not being adequate to the purpose he found himself under the necessity of employing two clauses—one of them to prune down and correct the other but under and notwithstanding this imperfection in the language he took care that in the mind of the reader no erroneous conception should be formed for by giving notice in the first instance of the deduction that would come to be made he took care that the conception should be already pared down to its proper scantling before it presented itself for admission into the readers mind now as to its application to the second of the two clauses which it is designed to limit being placed before this second as well as before the first—and in placing it before the first these marks of attention and selfpossession which have just been mentioned being exhibited as above—the conception will naturally be that it was to this second that it was meant to apply as well as to the first either says the reader to himself it was the authors meaning that the one limitative clause should be applied to both the principal clauses that follow it—to the second as well as to the first—or if it had not been his meaning that it should apply to the second he would have found some means of giving timely notice of the difference or rather had such not been his meaning he would have by giving the proper turn to the whole group of clauses have taken sufficient care to prevent any such erroneous conception from being entertained rule—if you would avoid ambiguity arising from miscollocation or ex situ—if there be but one clause to be limited insert the limitative clause within it if there be more than one place it before them all in both these cases besides obviating a logical disorder the remedy exhibits a positive beauty it is in the former point of view that it applies to the species of composition here in question—viz to the work of a legislator in the other point of view it is susceptible of universal application—applicable to every discourse whatsoever be the subject—though in a more particular degree to such as has persuasion for its object in the case of the single principal clause ambiguity on the part of the discourse probability of doubt on the part of the reader uncertainty more or less durable being the constant result of the unapt collocation—and of the hesitation and uncertainty a sensation of an unpleasant kind being as constant a concomitant the not taking the requisite measure for saving him from this unpleasant sensation is a proof of a deficiency in that art—the art of pleasing—of which the very act of a mans taking upon himself the character of a writer shows it his wish to be a proficient in proportion to the constancy with which that symptom of weakness is avoided and observed to be so strength and selfpossession     qualities agreeable to be observed will on the part of the mind of the author be manifested—and on the part of the work the correspondent agreeable quality viz force in both cases the expedient employed is indicative of a mind which has the whole subject under command and by which it is embraced with a firm grasp with respect to ambiguity arising ex vocabulo the two following rules may be laid down for the avoidance of ambiguity— avoid the use of any locution exclusively legal expound all words of doubtful or varying signification §   of remedies for overbulkiness in bringing to view the imperfections incident to the language of legislation when in the character of an imperfection incident to any mass of legislative matter the vice of overbulkiness came to be placed upon the stage the distinction between absolute and relative was stated as a distinction which with a view to practical arrangement would in a proper place be shown to be an object of prime importance the time is now come for inquiring by what means it may be employed in that character to the best advantage on casting in this view a glance upon the whole mass of legislative matter existing in the political state in question whatsoever it may be two observations readily present themselves at first sight one is that there is scarcely an individual in the country at any rate the number of individuals cannot but be comparatively small by whom taken in its totality it is physically possible for so enormous a mass to be borne in mind the other is that taking for this purpose any individual at random there can be but a comparatively small part of that vast whole with which in respect of any private and personal interest of his own there can be any use in his being acquainted be the bulkiness of the whole ever so great if there be not any assignable individual with reference to whom it can with propriety be said to be overbulky it cannot with propriety be charged with overbulkiness hence in the character of a remedy and that the main remedy against overbulkiness we have a rule with a corresponding principle the rule is let the whole mass of legislative matter be broken down into parts carved out in such sort that in hand and thence in mind each man may receive that portion in which he has a personal and peculiar concern apart from all matter in which he has no concern rule—the rule of distribution—corresponding principle—the suum cuique principle—to which for this purpose and in concerns of the sort here in question reference may henceforward be made in the application of this rule and this principle two points will require to be attended to— the first and the only one of the two which is in a direct way conducive to the object here in question is to observe and take care that in the collection made for the use of each particular individual or class of individuals no portion of legislative matter in which such individual or class have not any such personal concern as above be admitted rule—the rule of purity—corresponding principle—the nil alienum principle the other point is in making up for the use of each individual or class of individuals having a separate mass of legislative matter appertaining to himself or themselves as above let care be taken not to omit any the least part of the aggregate mass of the legislative matter so appertaining to him or them rule—the rule of completeness—corresponding principle—the unicuique totum principle take any point of time—if at that point of time a portion of law to which at some future point of time it may happen to bear upon the interest of the individual in question does not as yet bear upon his interests such portion of law is as yet foreign to him at the time at which it does begin to bear upon his interest then it is and not before that it concerns him to have it in mind and to be subjected to the charge in whatsoever quarter it presses upon him in purse and in memory which will be found attached to it in this observation may be seen the ground for an ulterior rule of distribution—in the case of each individual or class separate from such part of the mass of law as is matter of immediate concernment to him such part as is but matter of eventual concernment rule—the rule of ulterior purity—corresponding principle—the nil prœmaturum principle to take an example in the general and allcomprehensive field of law—to him who takes upon him the condition of a husband and thereby becomes concerned in point of interest to be apprized of and bear in mind the provisions contained in the married mans code it may happen in the natural course of things to become a father if then of the assumption of the condition of a husband paternity were an immediate as well as a certain consequence the reason for his bearing in mind the provisions relative to the condition of a father would take place at the same moment with the reason for his bearing     in mind the provisions relative to the condition of a husband but there being no such necessary and immediate connexion in the case but so it is that of those who become husbands there are many to whom it never happens to become fathers—here we see a sufficient reason for keeping the fathers code separate from the husbands code so grievous is the charge imposed upon a mans faculties pecuniary and mental together—so grievous in many cases is it capable of being and indeed apt to be in some cases that the reducing of it to its minimum is a duty the proper discharge of which demands at the hands of the legislator his constant and unremitted care on the one hand the importance of the interest at stake upon the fulfilment or nonfulfilment of the law—on the other hand the absence or presence the comparative efficiency or nonefficiency of the forces whatsoever they may be which tend to plant and fix the conception of the purport of the law in the mind of him on whom the fulfilment of it depends upon these two circumstances depends on the part of the legislator the urgency of the demand which the nature of the case presents for the application of the legislators powers to the effectuation of this object let us now then take a view of the different aspects which one and the same law is capable of bearing towards different descriptions of persons—the different ways in which their interests are affected by it—the different accounts on which they are concerned to bear in mind the purport of it mention of the head or denomination of persons under which the portion of law in question will be to be found together with the number indicative of the subdivision—such as the chapter or section or article in which it will be to be found this together with a concise intimation of the nature of the contents—and a very concise one is all that will in any case be found needful—such is the mode that will be found to serve and to suffice for securing to each person adequate notice of every portion of law the contents of which are not inserted at large under the head taken for the denomination of the class of persons to which he belongs by means of this additament the matter of every such personal code will be distinguished into two parcels of matter of very different qualities—viz   matter of direction—this is the sort of matter which in the personal code in question is inserted at large—delivered in terminis   matter of information—this is the sort of matter by which information is given of the several other personal codes in which is to be found whatsoever other matter of direction in one way or other the person in question has concern with §   of the different ways in which the interests of different persons may be affected by one and the same portion of law a sort of law may be conceived by which no more than one person or class of persons is affected in point of interest—others are to be found in which by one and the same law divers persons in a number to which there are no determinate limits are in point of interest affected in different ways on the present occasion these variations will all of them require to be brought to view—these being the considerations by which with a view to the most effectual system of notification whatsoever course is taken with respect to the composition and promulgation of the portion of law in question will require to be regulated if in the case of an imperative or say obligatory law the wellbeing of the whole community or any part of it be the object aimed at two parties or at least one party may be assigned whose interests are affected by the portion of law in question one party there cannot but be—the law being of the imperative or obligatory cast—who being bound by the law may on that consideration be termed the party charged in this case if so it be as by the supposition it is that this law has for its object the wellbeing of the community or of some part of it there must also be in that case some party who in that respect may be termed the party favoured by the law a case not without example is that the party favoured by the law and the party charged by it shall be the same party—the same person or class of persons in domestic life this is the case with every command addressed by a guardian as such or by a parent in his quality of guardian to a child—by a preceptor as such to his pupil as such in public life this is the case with that whole class of laws which have for their object the enforcing of what is considered as a mans duty to himself—the prevention of those acts by the commission of which a man is considered as doing an injury to himself as in the case of drunkenness prodigality and so forth even taking the whole mass of law together on the one hand and the whole mass of the population together on the other hand—if the principle of utility as above described be the principle acted upon the same coincidence between the party or parties charged and the party or parties favoured will in this case likewise be observable—if all are charged by the law it is to this end alone that they are charged—viz that they may all be favoured by it suppose the whole population divided into two parts of which one part alone is favoured     the other charged without being favoured it is the case of complete and unrestricted slavery—such as in ancient sparta seems to have had existence as between the spartans and the helotes but in modern times does not seem to be exemplified in any country even in those in which domestic slavery is to be seen in its harshest forms—for in every slaveholding country protection more or less efficient is by law afforded to the slaves and in so far as it is afforded two parties may be seen whose interests are in opposite ways affected by such protecting laws—viz the slave who is the party favoured—and the master who is the party charged by it so again in the case of those laws which have for their object the prevention of those pernicious acts from which in so far as they are committed men in general have cause to fear at the same time that men in general are exposed to the temptation of committing them—such as in a large proportion are those laws by which security to person and those by which security to property is endeavoured to be afforded murder theft and robbery these for example are among the acts which all men are interdicted from performing why only that all men may be saved from suffering by them here then under laws of this description all men are parties charged at the same time that all men are and to the end that all men may be parties favoured by those laws but if particular laws or portions of law be taken each by itself a considerable class will be found and the most numerous and occupying in the pannomion the largest space in which the whole of the charge is laid upon one person or set of persons while the whole favour is shown and to the end that it may be shown to another nor in this sort of partiality as it may be called is there any just cause for condemnation or complaint laws of that description are it may be seen and that in vast abundance absolutely and indispensably necessary to the adaptation of the whole legal system to its general allcomprehensive and impartial end and for whatsoever momentary partiality is exhibited by any one such law taken by itself due and adequate compensation is or at least ought to be and may be made by others of the case last spoken of the simplest modification is where by one and the same disposition of law there are two parties concerned of whom that the one may be charged and another party be favoured the other is charged thus in the   th geo iii c    certain officers therein named are charged with the duty of keeping hung up in a certain place papers containing information to a certain effect to what end answer that certain persons to whom for the purpose of prosecuting certain pecuniary claims of theirs the information is useful and may be necessary—viz seamen c having claim to prize money—may have it at their command and know where to meet with it persons charged by the law those official persons—favoured by it—seamen—viz such individuals of that class to whom it has happened to possess a claim of the sort there spoken of a party who under the provision of law in question is in the case of a party favoured may be so either for his own sake or for the sake of some other or others if for his own sake and in so far as it is for his own sake that he is so—i e with a view to a benefit which it is intended he should reap—principal is the name given to the character in which he is thus favoured if it be for the sake of another or others—trustee or agent is the name given to the character in which he is thus favoured when for the sake of one set of persons his principals powers are given to a trustee to be exercised over another set of persons—at the same time that in the exercise of those powers a certain course of action is prescribed to him and made matter of duty—in such case then it is that in that one person the characters of party favoured and party charged are combined—it is that for the benefit of the party in question viz the principal he may be enabled to perform the service required at his hands that the right or the power by the possession of which he is favoured is conferred as above favoured as he is he is so to no other end than that he may be charged in so far as a party is placed in the situation of a party charged unless the faculties upon which the charge bears are his passive faculties merely the charge not being in any event liable to fall on his active faculties the charge cannot be imposed upon him without need of action on his part—if not of positive agency of negative at least—of purposed forbearance which when purposed is as truly the result of will as positive agency is and for its production stands altogether as much in need of appropriate information viz notice of the legal arrangements by which the motives for such forbearance are created in so far as a party is placed by the law in the situation of party favoured by it the favour thus afforded to him is afforded to him in some instances not without need of action on his part—in others without need of action on his part to enable him to reap the benefit of it thus in so far as for the preservation of mens dwellings from nocturnal invasion for the purpose of robbery pains of law are appointed applicable for the punishment of     persons guilty of such offences thus far the favour thus shown to a householder and his inmates is afforded to him without need of action on his part—and though the existence of the law were never to be known to him the favour the protection intended for him would not be the less received but suppose that for the rendering this protection the more effectual power be given to this householder to arrest and detain the person of any and every such nocturnal invader—or even rather than that he should escape to have recourse to such operations the result of which may be the depriving him of life—in such case the favour shown to him is not afforded to him without need of eventual action on his part—nor can the favour thus shown to him the protection thus afforded to him be of any use to him any further than he has recourse to either viz by affording to himself the sort of protection which it thus empowers him to afford a portion of law though to this effect cannot be in any other case of any use to him any further than either by effectual notification from without he has been apprized or by reasoning and inference has been led to believe in the existence of a portion of law to this effect of these speculative distinctions the practical use is altogether obvious whatsoever portion of law requires on the part of a person to whom the favour shown by it is afforded action to enable either himself or such other person for whom the benefit of it is intended to reap such benefit of this portion of law it is necessary that by whatsoever efficient measures are taken for planting and fixing the purport of it in his mind the intimation conveyed to him should be of the correctest and completest kind—and accordingly that in the code denominated from the class of persons to which he belongs the portion of the law here in question should be inserted in terminis on the other hand whatsoever portion of law does not for the purpose in question stand in need of any such action on his part—of the nature and existence of such portion of law an intimation conveyed in general terms together with reference to the head under which it may be found in terminis suffices for every necessary purpose to make known to him the care which the law in this particular has taken of his interests and his welfare is all the service which by the information thus given to him in this case will be rendered to him but surely were it only for the reputation of the law itself not to speak of the assurance and comfort thus afforded to the individuals the intimation is of the number of those which neither ought to be nor are much in danger of being despised §   case where a number of persons are in a company or in a string jointly affected by and concerned in one and the same portion of law numerous and various are the cases in which to the rendering of a single service to a single person in the character of principal the services of a multitude of persons in the character of agents or trustees is necessary if to the rendering of these intermediate services the case be such that in the instance of each of them action is called for at the same time they may be said to act in a group or circle—if the case be such that to the production of the ultimate beneficial effect it be necessary that they should act separately and at successive times they may be said to act in a string or file it is in a group or circle that men act in every case in which they act together in the manner of a political assembly or bodycorporate or a board it is in a file or string that they act when for the transmission of any article whatsoever such as a sum of money a letter or any article of commerce it is necessary that the operations they respectively perform in relation to it should be performed at several successive points or periods of time in so far as it is in groups that men act one single denomination serves commonly for the whole group—i e for all the several persons or sorts of persons of which it is composed in the case where it is in strings or files that they act there will always be two different denominations of persons concerned together—the one to deliver the thing in question the other to receive it—the deliverer and receiver of the thing in question in this case one code would serve for both and of that one code the denomination should be a compound one composed of the denomination of these two sorts of persons each having need of action on his part whether to render or to receive the service the favour in question—the intermediate service—which for the benefit of some person in the character of principal leads on to the final and ultimate service in which the whole string of services finds its termination—each has need each has the same need to have the law planted and fixed in his mind but what will in most instances be found to be the case is that to each of the two classes of persons whose duties are on this or that occasion rendered by both together acting in conjunction—other duties have been assigned—duties to be performed on different occasions by each of them in some instances singly in other instances in conjunction with some other associate but to every person in whose instance need     of action has place—in order that the intention of the law may be fulfilled and the service which it has undertaken to perform be rendered it is necessary that the law be planted and fixed in his mind it is therefore necessary that in the code which receives its denomination from the class of persons to which he appertains this portion of law should be inserted in terminis but—that in this case the burthen imposed by the law on the mind of him to whom on whatsoever account it is necessary to be apprized of the duties imposed upon both these classes and to whose cognizance it is therefore necessary that both these codes be presented may be reduced to its smallest dimension—when the portion of law inserted in the code denominated from one of these persons is also inserted in terminis and in the same terms in the code denominated from the other notice of this identity should in each of these codes be given in a note §   modes of notification in the case of any given individual or class of individuals two different modes or degrees of notification must here be brought to view and distinguished one is exposition at large—or say exposition in terminis viz where under the head taken from the denomination of the individual or class in question the portion of law in question it being a portion in which in one of the abovementioned modes of concernment he is concerned is exhibited at length the other is by simple indication or reference viz when another head under which the portion of law in question this being also a portion of law in which in some way or other he is concerned is set forth at length is referred to under the head taken from the denomination of the class in question notification in this mode presupposes it is evident exposition at length under the head taken from the denomination of some other individual or class be the portion of law what it may under some head or other it is necessary that it should be delivered at length—delivered in terminis but that it should be thus delivered under more such heads than one—that it should anywhere be repeated in terminis—is not necessary §   necessity of attending to these distinctions in legislative practice the distinctive characters suggested by the suum cuique principle are such as no man who acts in the character of a legislative draughtsman can be warranted in treating with neglect   the question what in the provision or clause in question is the individual or class of persons concerned in the character of party served to whose interests it would do service—viz on his own account—is a question which he can never be warranted in omitting to look at and bear in mind why because in point of expediency in this supposed service consists the indispensable warrant for the portion of law in question including whatsoever charges of an obligatory nature it may whether in a direct or an indirect way have the effect of subjecting him to if no such individual or class can be found the portion of law in question be it what it may is purely mischievous and completely indefensible in the service rendered to some party favoured on his own account consists on each occasion the legislators indispensable warrant—which warrant will be sufficient or insufficient according as the portion of law in question is upon the whole beneficial or otherwise—according as a balance on the side of good or a balance on the side of evil is the effect of it   the question what is the individual or class of persons concerned in the character of party charged—viz in respect of his active faculties—is another question which he can never be warranted in not looking to and bearing in mind why because on the fact of the laws being actually taken up and borne in mind by each one of the individuals who in that character are concerned in it depends whatsoever chance such law can have of proving efficient and productive of the service of the good in whatsoever shape good can be looked for as being about to be the fruit and consequence of it be the command what it may it is only in proportion to the degree of correctness with which at the point of time which on each occasion calls for action on the part of him in whose instance obedience is looked for and meant to be produced that obedience can be the fruit of it true it is that without his having had it on that or any other occasion in mind it may have the effect of causing him to suffer in this or that way pain in any shape and degree up to the pain of death and such is the effect intended or not intended heeded or unheeded which to a vast extent the mass of law with which in mind and in pocket british subjects are actually burthened to so vast an extent is actually productive without his having had it on that or any other occasion in mind it may have the effect of pouring money into the pockets of the retainers of the law in one or all their different forms and sizes and such is the effect intended or not intended   0 §   plea in favour of redundancies—necessary to certainty denied—and rules for securing steadiness and certainty for this redundancy—for the accummulation of excrementitious matter in all its various shapes in all that variety of forms that have been passing under review—for all the pestilential effects that cannot but be produced by this so enormous a load of literary garbage—the plea commonly pleaded—at any rate the only plea that would or could be pleaded if men who are above law could be put upon their defence by any pressure from beneath is that it is necessary to precision—or to use the word which on similar occasions they themselves are in the habit of using certainty but a more absolutely sham plea never was countenanced or so much as pleaded in either kings bench or common pleas that this redundancy is altogether without use—that it never is in any the smallest degree the effect—that it is too palpably not the effect or so much as the object—are propositions that have received not merely a full but a double proof one proof is that there is another and a very different mode by which such certainty is really attainable—and that such other mode so far from being employed is as it were carefully avoided but of this presently the other proof is afforded by that unsteadiness which is a no less congenial attribute than is the redundancy of this established style say that for the subjectmatter in question some established denomination which is not only the most proper but the only proper one such for example as the name given to a company in its charter of corporation here would be a reason which how far soever from being conclusive would at any rate be a plausible one for the exclusive use of that denomination how longwinded so ever as often as the occasion occurred for making mention of it in the statute well then this strictness in employing for the designation of the thing in question the only proper designation is it really observed—so far from it that from this only proper standard the departures may be seen to be frequent in a degree of wantonness by no schoolboy amidst the distress produced by the obligation of hammering verses out of a refractory subject is any such profusion of synonyms and equivalent phrases manufactured as may be seen to grow under the hammer of the parliamentary draughtsman especially of these times the longwinded appellative or other form of words to what purpose is it regarded as necessary   to intellection in no instance is it ever employed but that some shorter one may always be chosen which is at least as generally and fully understood and if there be any difference more so   to validity validity is exemption from nullity—and nullity the offspring of fraud and absurdity is the creation of positive law pregnant as it is with injustice as often as it is carried into effect the habit of injustice is not so extensive but that if applied to the case here in question the apprehension of nullity would for the most part be found in vain but suppose the case of the number of those in which the apprehension would prove well founded in the frequent use he makes of the longwinded appellative the draughtsman would still be without excuse since the instances of neglect are not less numerous than the instances of observance such then is the dilemma on one or other horn of which he will be sure to be impaled your longwinded appellative is it necessary to justice violation of justice is rendered frequent and unavoidable by your frequent violations of your own rule the consumption of words is it unnecessary the mischief of overbulkiness is without compensation—the sacrifice made of conciseness is without equivalent the barbarism and deformity without excuse where certainty is really the object it may be secured it will be seen without any addition to bulkiness—without any sacrifice in the article of conciseness what is more the nature of the case will be seen to afford principles and rules by the adoption and observance of which the perfections of steadiness and certainty may be combined together the principle which requires that throughout the whole body of the law for the expression of any given import one and the same word or form of words be unless for special reason undeviatingly employed—call it the principle of steadiness correspondent rule expressed for conciseness and impressiveness in a different language and that the most concise of languages—the latin—eadem natura eadem nomenclatura by proper management adapted to the nature of each case the principle of steadiness may be rendered a principle of conciseness—a preservative against redundancy and overbulkiness for the avoidance of uncognoscibility and overbulkiness and for securing to the language of the law the beneficial properties of certainty and conciseness rule throughout the whole field of law look out for such subjectmatters or objects as either by their importance or by reason of present deficiency of fixed denominations stand particularly in need of fixed denominations and form such for them     the following are among the various modes of exposition adapted to various cases—   when of a class of persons for which there exists no separate or other authentic denomination frequent mention is about to be made instead of employing for the designation of such aggregate a loose and varying description fix upon some short appellative if any such appellative there be in common use and after such exposition in the way of definition as is adapted to the nature of the object if in its nature it be susceptible of what is commonly understood by the term definition—the import of it being thus fixed and certainty so far provided for—for the sake of conciseness employ on every occasion the short appellative take for example the class of persons commonly denominated prizeagents in the act    geo iii cap    in some places mention is made of them simply under that name but it is not that name that is given to them when mention is made of them in the first instance the appellation which on that leading occasion is employed for the designation of them is a longwinded string of words after which besides the one concise and popular appellative and this diffuse technical appellative they are in different places spoken of under a variety of different descriptions in this case the following are the words that may serve for the expression of the rule—definitio semel definitum toties quoties   this appellative whether singleworded or compound as soon as it has received a definition in form let it thenceforth as often as it occurs in the text of the law of any part of the body of the laws be distinguished by a peculiar type   the several words thus distinguished let them be collected together and printed in the form of an index each of them with references indicative of the several passages in which they are employed   the peculiar type its use and signification being universally known will in the instance of each word on which it is bestowed serve as a sort of certificate or memento that the word has a place in this index—that it is accordingly of the number of those words to which the attention of the legislator has been in an especial manner directed and of which so far as depends upon his endeavours the import has been fixed this type would in different ways be of use to persons in different situations—to persons in the situation of subjects and to persons in such situations as bestow upon them a share in the process of legislation—   to the subject citizen it would be an advertisement informing him of the fixity that has by competent authority already been given to the word or combination of words in question   to the legislator by conveying to him the same information it would be a memento and a warning not to loosen and set afloat the import of that same appellative by any fresh and different sense superadded to its precedent original sense and without due warning of the difference   where a number of objects present themselves so connected in such sort as that there is frequent occasion to comprehend them under one and the same provision—in such case to avoid the need of continual repetition with the danger of incomplete repetition find or frame if any fit term can be framed some term of more extensive import capable of being applied in the character of a common genus with relation to which they shall be so many species so many congeners or congenerical species this done employ thenceforward the one generic term in lieu of the series or string composed of many specific ones thus in the act before referred to    geo iii cap    after some advance made in the act the word captors comes to be employed but for distinguishing the genus or class of persons in question and meant to be brought to view by and under that name neither that nor any other generic appellative is employed in the first instance instead of that comes a list of congenerical terms which list being in different places different is in some places incomplete in the same act occurs in different places mention of allowances of money made to persons of the description in question on various accounts which allowances are in different places characterized by the denominations of prizemoney bountymoney salvagemoney and seizuremoney encouragement in the line of military service being the object declared to be aimed at on the occasion of each of these several allowances encouragementmoney is a term capable of being applied to all of them in the character of a generic term—applied to all of them put together with no less propriety than their respective abovementioned specific appellatives are in the instance of each accordingly nomen genericum cum specificis semel genus per se toties quoties   in the case where for the designation of the object in question there exists an authentic appellative but that appeilative is manyworded and longwinded—if a popular appellative can either be found or made for it provide such concise appellative accordingly—thereupon having for the sake of certainty expounded it once for all by its authentic synonym thenceforward for conciseness sake employ it rule nomen vulgare cum synonymo authentico semel idem per se toties quoties thus in the act before referred to        geo iii cap    in some places the establishment commonly called greenwich hospital is designated by a longwinded and more formal name—the royal hospital at greenwich c but in other places it is designated by a still more longwinded denomination which has the appearance of being the name by which the governing body is designated in the charter of incorporation viz the governors and directors of the royal hospital at greenwich c greenwich hospital this name as often as it occurs might be understood as denoting the governors or the establishment of which they are governors by an intimation of which of these was intended certainty would to the utmost be provided for and the embarrassment in which a sentence is involved by a compound and longwinded appellative be avoided and so in the case of chelsea hospital in like manner by preliminary note greenwich treasurer and chelsea treasurer are so many short names that may with advantage be substituted to the formal and more compound denomination appertaining respectively to those two official persons   in some cases the same office is liable to be filled at different times in different manners for example at one time by a single person at other times by an assemblage of persons as lord high treasurer commissioners of the treasury lord high admiral commissioners of the admiralty at one time by an officer called by one name at another time by an officer called by another as treasurer of the navy paymaster of the navy in this case instead of employing on each occasion both or all of these official names take in the first instance the most simple and having for certainty subjoined to it whatsoever synonymous or equivalent expressions are in use for conciseness employ thenceforward the most simple—except it be in such places if any such there be in which by the nature of the occasion or the composition of the context this or that synonym is rendered more proper or more convenient examples   to treasury subjoin treasury board lord high treasurer lords commissioners of the treasury and so forth and thenceforward except as excepted employ the singleworded appellative treasury   to admiralty subjoin admiralty board and so forth and thenceforward except as excepted employ the singleworded appellative admiralty but in this particular case the word board may sometimes be necessary to be subjoined viz for the purpose of distinguishing this the office of administration so denominated from the judicatory styled the high court of admiralty   it will sometimes happen that an appellative originally employed to designate a class of objects of a certain extent and exactly fitted to that class shall have been employed to designate that same class with the addition of another class to the designation of which other class it is not with equal propriety adapted—in which case to save the imposition of a new and unaccustomed name there may be a convenience in employing for the designation of this new enlarged class the name which though before the enlargement strictly proper is since the enlargement become no longer so rule the import of an appellative may be ampliated—may be extended by ampliation giving proper notice so again in regard to restriction rule the import of an appellative may be restricted—narrowed by restriction giving proper notice in the index after any definition or other exposition which in any other shape has been given of the appellative add the number of all such ampliations or restrictions if any as it has received making mention of the occasions on which and referring to the titles under which those respective operations have been performed example of ampliation prize agent—extended to comprehend bountymoney agent and to salvage and seizuremoney agents rules having for their subject the directive clause or words of direction in the composition of a statute—and for their object or end in view the prevention of ambiguity obscurity and overbulkiness by prevention of unsteadiness and redundancies— rule  —command includes permission to mean to command any act to be done and not to mean to permit it to be done is impossible wheresoever therefore there are words intimative of a command to do anything words intimative of a permission to do the same thing are superfluous and nugatory     to the evil of redundancy is apt in this case to be added that of unsteadiness in respect of the useless variety in which this species of imperfection is apt to exhibit itself rule  —where an act is already lawful no matter of the permissive cast—no words having the effect of a permission ought to be inserted for of matter of this cast the effect is by implication to convey an intimation that by the law as it stood before the statute with this permission in it was enacted the act in question stood prohibited—which by the supposition is not true it is a mark of deplorable awkwardness and imbecility on the part of a legislator when he knows not how to make a law of his own without giving a false and deceptious account of such laws as before his time have already been made by others the following masses of literary matter have on this occasion been marked out for omission on the score of surplusage in the act    geo iii c      formularies of

circumjacent words    whereas doubts have arisen—inserted frequently when the imperfection calling for correction was too manifest ever to have left room for doubt    whereas it is expedient to enact

and so for example extend nor be deemed or construed to extend to the head of errata may be referred all those peculiarities in the phraseology customarily observed in an act of parliament whereby the language thus put into the mouth of the legislator is distinguished from that employed by everybody else of these vices the actual fruit is oppression and pillage what in each instance was in the mind of the draughtsman the intended result and to the attainment of which his exertions were directed is a question of psychology never worth resolving and in general incapable of being resolved it would be a great error to suppose that this excrementitious matter is simply useless the pretended object and the only object that for the purpose of apology can be assigned to it is certainty but of certainty it never is productive—it is on the contrary an abundant source of uncertainty if on every occasion redundantly copious and wordy forms were employed yes then voluminousness on the part of the composition—useless vexation and expense on the part of him whose fate is disposed of by it would be the only evil but promiscuously and interconvertibly with this most voluminous formulary on occasions exactly corresponding are employed other formularies less and less voluminous of the most voluminous what is then the effect to breed doubts concerning the import or the validity of this or that other formulary which in this or that particular is less voluminous in the view and for the purpose of causing to be made known to divers persons—in divers manners—divers sets of facts to the end that these persons objects of his care may be secured in the receipt of what is respectively their due great and assuredly by no means unsuccessful are the pains which by a correspondently voluminous and various mass of regulations have been taken by the right honourable legislator in the lastrecited act in the chain of information amidst and after all this care one link was left wanting and that was a means of conveying to their knowledge and into their hands in a concise compact and in a word in a comprehensible and intelligible form adapted to the state and degree of such intellectual powers as they might on reasonable grounds be expected and presumed to be in possession of an intimation of what had there been done for them and what on their parts was necessary to be known and to be done in order to their reaping the benefit of all this care     in the elaborate chain in question this link i say is wanting and why is it wanting—to what cause is so material a deficiency to be ascribed the answer is incontrovertible—to the sinister interest of the profession of the law in this as in every other quarter of the field of legislation it ever has been and still continues to be their interest that the rule of action should be as little known and as ill known as possible—that the conception formed of it may be as imperfect confused and erroneous as possible on this account it is that on the part of those masses of discourse which have been occupied in giving expression to it it has been their interest to nurse and cultivate to the highest degree of perfection those vices the exemplification of which has on this occasion been in some degree brought to view §   remedies for longwindedness in the consolidation prize act    geo iii c    before referred to an example may be found of longwindedness—in five contiguous sections nos             and    and in one other no  0  which occurs at sixty sections distance the general course of procedure in the high court of admiralty and the viceadmiralty courts in the metropolitan and provincial prize courts is prescribed of these sections the first which is much more than equal to all the other five put together was evidently in the date of its formation antecedent to most if not all the others in it the following are among the operations prescribed or brought to view or spoken of as liable to have place—   the preparatory examination—viz the usual one and by this one word usual the certainty belonging to written law is drowned in the uncertainty inherent in the essence of unwritten law   monition again the usual—and this usual monition must be the proper one   moreover it must be issued by the proper person be he who he may and   by another proper person executed   but not till after request   claim   entry thereof in the usual form   attestation thereof on oath   giving of notice after the execution of such monition  0 security giving thereof by the claimant for eventual costs    production of said preparatory examination    production of documentary evidence    eventual oath of nonexistence of documentary evidence    sentence eventual of discharge or condemnation    giving further time for entering claim    giving further time for finding security for something or other if one could but tell for what    sentence giving it once more    eventual examination of witnesses    giving in pleadings by the parties  0 admission thereof by the judge in this list we have twenty operations but they are not above half the number of operations brought upon the carpet neither will there be found in this enumeration above half the matter including a quantity of surplusage with the quantity of obscurity and ambiguity thereby generated and thereunto appertaining contained in this section it is an attempt to force together the contents of an entire system of procedure into one sentence with as much reason and with similar utility might the whole of cokelittleton have been squeezed into one sentence or the whole of a serjeantsinn dinner have been mashed up together into one dish supposing a man either unable or unwilling to make himself understood but at the same time under an obligation of appearing desirous of making himself understood—this is one of the ways he would take for effecting his purpose and a more effectually conducive way it is not in the power of man to take the remedy for this longwindedness is to be found in breaking down such complicated enactments into separate parts but in so doing it will be found that the length of the whole composition will be increased—the brevity of the parts and of the whole antagonize perspicuity will however be gained by lessening the excess of the grammatical sentence over the logical proposition for putting into a rational and intelligible shape the contents of this single section twenty sections would scarcely suffice and each would require its full complement of words with respect to the structure and length of sentences the following proposition and rule may be laid down— proposition the shorter the sentence the better rule minimize the length of sentences reasons—  the shorter the sentence the clearer is it to the eyes of the reader—the clearer that is to say the more free from obscurity—the more easily apprehended by the conception—the more easily retained in the memory   the shorter the sentence the clearer is it in the eyes of the legislator and the judge for the purpose of eventual supervision and amendment much clearer will it be to the eyes of the legislator for the purpose of interpretation to those of the judge to be perfectly clear to the conception the judgment and the memory every distinguishable proposition must be presented by itself unconnected with every other exceptions excepted objects more than one cannot be closely examined at one and the same moment exception is when two objects are to be confronted and compared with one another in that case the mind vibrates from     the one to the other with the rapidity of thought and as in musical sounds before the impression produced in the sensorium by the first has ceased that produced by the second is commenced by the clearness and simplicity thus contended for no bar is opposed to comprehensiveness on the contrary the more comprehensive the sentence or proposition is the shorter it may be whatsoever be the extent to narrow it addition to the number of words contained in it is necessary true it is the shorter the several sentences the longer will and must be the aggregate composed of them take any sentence or proposition whatsoever—by the insertion of a single word in it the effect of another sentence may be produced why because to compose a sentence requires the conjunction of divers of the parts of speech and when once expression has been given to a complete sentence every word added to it receives as it were the benefit of all the several words which it finds entering into the composition of the sentence to which it is added but to the difficulty in respect of conception judgment and reminiscence with relation to the whole no addition is made by the addition made in this way to the voluminousness of it by an index the eye is as promptly conveyed to the passage wanted in the largest folio as in the smallest duodecimo just so is it in the case of a dictionary if by the lettering at the back you are informed without need of opening and searching the several volumes in which volume the word the explanation of which you stand in need of is contained—a dictionary of twenty volumes is not more difficult to consult than a dictionary of one would be when the objects whatsoever be their multitude are presented to the mind one by one the mind finds itself in a state of comparative repose—there is nothing to hurry it in its course—for any length of time it gives its undivided attention to each one when in the course of a lengthy paragraph or section in an act of parliament objects propositions are presented to view by dozens scores or hundreds it is hurried off by each from every other—amongst them it finds no rest—it is in a state of bewilderment—in relation to no one of them can it obtain any clear conception form any clear judgment retain any clear reminiscence the following rules will further tend to prevent the evil of longwindedness—   avoid repetitions from habit of useless formulas as in english practice   repeat not selfevident propositions—ex whereas it is expedient c   lists of species once given form a generic term which afterwards substitute   exceptions excepted let the masculine singular comprehend both genders and numbers   denominate enumerate and tabulate principles it facilitates reference and thereby contributes to conciseness   employ abbreviative words any such word explained once for all if need be by definition performs in legal language the functions of x and y in algebra examples maximize minimize demoralize disintellectualize eulogistic dyslogistic and the names of functions   after the verb governing interpose between it and the list of substantives governed the words as follows with a punctum—then give to each item a separate line preceded by a numerical figure §   helps to intellection bisection i   of making divisions among the devices employed by the legal tribe for the preservation and increase of uncertainty and voluminousness and uncognoscibility—one is the forbearing to employ division and numeration on the occasion and for the purpose of reference break a law down into parts and affix a different number to each part—whatsoever be the part you have occasion to speak of naming the number by which it is distinguished accomplishes the purpose with the utmost brevity and at the same time without danger of mistake to this obvious and most universally practised mode substitute as is done in english statute law an attempt to describe the part in question by words expressive of the subjectmatter or the purport of it—you send a man on each occasion to hunt over the whole statute for whatever he is in quest of after which it remains matter of doubt with him what are the parts that in case of litigation would be understood to be comprised under the necessarily loose description so employed the more numerous the statutes thus referred to and the more voluminous the bulk of each statute the greater is the uncertainty and the vexation—the greater the unnecessary consumption of time and labour in hunting over them—and the greater the probability that of all this consumption of time and labour nothing better than ultimate and irremediable uncertainty may be the fruit in the case of the statute    geo iii c    there are no fewer than fifty of the small and closely printed pages of which the authentic edition of the statutes is composed in this statute in the paragraph marked viii it is enacted that all regulations herein contained respecting prizes shall apply to all cases of bountymoney granted by this act and of salvage upon recaptures from     his majestys enemies would you know what those regulations are here instead of a few figures are no fewer than fifty of these folio pages to pore over and in these fifty pages no fewer than     sections the choice of the mode of remedying this evil is not by any means a matter of indifference perspicuity and brevity are in no considerable a degree dependent upon it the objects which it is desirable should be kept in view in making such division are—  facility of reference   facility of amendment—of reference by the individual reader whatsoever may be his place in the community—of amendment by the legislator the more numerous the successive acts of division and subdivision the more numerous will be the general denominations of those aggregates which are respectively the results and the more numerous those denominations the more instructive will be the table of contents formed by the printing on the same surface and thus presenting to the eye at the same time the aggregate number of them the more numerous the points of agreement and difference between the several objects the better will the subject be understood since it is no otherwise than by means of these points of agreement and difference between its elementary parts that a subject of this sort is understood the process of subdivision cannot be carried too far for use—for let it be ever so dilated nothing can be easier than to contract it—for effecting the contraction nothing but simple elimination is necessary the further it is carried—the narrower and more particular the mass of objects characterized by the denomination given to the aggregate—the more particular the nearer it is to individuality—the clearer and more complete is the conception which to the understanding of the person in question it will present bonaparte in his code has perhaps gone further in this track than any other legislator but for understanding the more clearly what in this way has been done by him it will be of use to wait till an explanation has been given under the next head bisection ii of denominating the results on the occasion of each glance there may be a convenience in seeing instantaneously by means of the several denominations to what degree the process of subdvision is advanced for accomplishing this object the numeration table affords an expedient and it is the only one rule indicate by a numerical figure the number of divisional operations by which the result in question is produced—the figure in a broad type struck through by a thin s rule to divisional denominations substitute the numerical only the following names are already in use for the denomination of the results of such operations—section bisection trisection quadrisection and so on for the result of the last divisional operation the word article may be employed as being now in use rule when lists require to be given in an article give each item a numerical denomination and refer to them by such denomination the more numerous the acts of division the greater the mass of literary matter necessary to the giving expression to the results suppose it to have extended to a certain length so numerous will be the words that if given at length a whole line or more may be necessary in one part for referring the reader to this or that single word or matter hence comes the practice of substituting to the word at length the first syllable or the first two or three letters of it the syllable has the advantage of being capable of being pronounced—the letters if they do not form a syllable fail of putting a reader in possession of this advantage §   §   §   § by this mode of reference all it is believed will be done towards accomplishing the purpose that the nature of things will allow to be done we are now prepared to recur to the consideration of bonapartes codes the number of the codes is five besides the code of costs for the judicatory called the cour royale de paris of the results of the several acts of division in these codes the denominations are as follows in the following order—  livre   titre   chapitre   section—then comes the unit to which in the     text no denomination is given but which in the references is denominated   article or for shortness art article is the denomination of the result of the last act of division which has a name but in some instances within the article are found divers parts or clauses not denominated but distinguished from one another by numbers—and thus also in the code pénal beginning with art  0  the article is divided into other parts to which no denomination is given in words at length but prefixed to each division is the character usually employed in lieu of the word section namely the double s—§ applying the last proposed mode of denomination to the results of the several acts of division in this code the denominations assigned to the several acts of division by the numeration table would be instead of livre section § instead of titre bisection   § instead of chapitre trisection   § instead of section quadrisection   § instead of article quinquisection   § instead of any such principle of division being followed in these codes in each code the articles follow one another in a series which commences from the first the numbers of the articles in each code are as follows—   code civile        procedure civile  0     code de commerce       code dinstruction criminelle       code pénal     besides the tarif des fraix c     in each code only from the first article in the whole code are the ensuing articles numbered—no fresh series is commenced in any of the subdivisions such is the method and now for the inconvenience of it in a new edition of any of these codes between the first and second of the articles suppose matter meant to be inserted and inserted accordingly and in consequence the several other articles    0 in number the numbers all changed what would be the consequence that of all the several references made in the new edition not one would serve for any preceding edition so that these editions whatsoever were their number would be rendered all of them nearly unfit for use—nor can any limits be assigned to the practical mischief capable of being produced by the false reference if taken for true bisection iii of the employment of the substantivepreferring principle by the substantivepreferring principle understand that which recommends the employing in works of the didactic kind as far as may be a substantive in preference to the corresponding verb—a substantive or what comes to nearly the same thing an adjective with the substantive principle attached to it on many occasions a verb of peculiar import with or without the addition of tense or mood or both or a correspondent noun of the same root accompanied with what may be called a word of common or subservient use may be indiscriminately employed—thus we may either say to give extension to or to extend—to give denomination to or to denominate—to straighten or to make straight—or give straightness to in these cases there is an advantage in employing the noun instead of the verb be it the name of what it may—a real entity or a fictitious entity the noun will in every case be a denomination of something that something be it what it may will on this or that occasion be an object or subjectmatter of consideration and attention and examination for this purpose it may be necessary that by the mind for a more or less considerable portion of time it should be kept in view in the form of a noun—to wit a noun substantive it may be kept constantly in view for any length of time that can be required whilst thus in view it is capable of being taken for the subject of what the logicians call predication—any quality may be spoken of as existing in it as belonging to it example extension fixidity velocity beauty deformity in this state any quality at pleasure and at leisure may be spoken of as existing in it as being given to it or taken from it in a word it may be kept in contemplation may be made an object of study and if the nature of it be to admit of such an operation of examination for any length of time not so when the idea is presented in the form of a verb in this case it is mixed up with other words in the form of a sentence or proposition more or less complex the import of it is in such sort covered disguised and drowned that no separate nor continued view can be taken of it where a substantive is employed the idea is stationed as it were upon a rock—where no substantive is employed but only a verb the idea is as it were a twig or a leaf floating on a stream and hurried down out of view along with it when you have said i will give extension or elevation to an object in question i can take up the quality of extension or that of elevation and give to them respectively whatever consideration and examination the nature of the case admits of and appears to require but if what you have said be i will extend the object there is no extension no elevation nothing i can take up or lay hold of as a companion to the noun for the purpose of rendering it a fit substitute for the verb which the purpose of the sentence requires     a particular species of verb has been mentioned it may be termed an auxiliary verb by analogy to those fragments of verbs—will shall may can might could would should—that are in use to be employed for the like purpose on the present occasion the verb to give has been mentioned as one that is in use to be employed for the present purpose it may be employed as auxiliary for example to any substantive expressive of any species of quality as expressed by the terminations ite ants and others of like import the employment given to it will not however appear natural unless the quality present itself as being either desirable or at any rate an object of indifference it is natural to speak of giving elevation to an object or extension—it is not equally so to speak of giving depression to it or limitation in this case you would rather employ the verb to apply than the verb to give a catalogue of this species of auxiliary verbs accompanied with a catalogue of the nouns substantive to which they are in use to be employed as auxiliaries is an instrument of elucidation that remains to be constructed and by its usefulness may perhaps be found to pay for the trouble a use somewhat similar may be made of the term function each proposition in which it is employed is the equivalent of a multitude of propositions of unknown length and ever variable and varying tenor any one of which might have been employed to the same purpose but which if employed would have exhibited no feature of determinate and apprehensible resemblance one to another of this word it will be seen elsewhere† how useful it is as an instrument of useful arrangement—to no such use would its equivalents in the verbal form be found applicable the desirable properties which these forms of expression contribute to discourse are—  clearness   conciseness   recollectedness—i e giving facility to the recollection of the idea designed to be conveyed these forms of expression are subservient to distinctness by placing in the clearest light the points of difference and separatedness as well as the points of resemblance and coincidence between each object and every other the way in which the use of the word principle with the appropriate adjective is conducive to conciseness is by substituting those two words to the correspondent rule or rules that may be laid down in explanation of the principle so denominated when once explained these two words serve for the giving expression to one sentence or more not less subservient to the purpose of retention is this formula than to the purpose of conception and expressive for the purpose of communication you cannot anchor in your mind a sentence as you can a single term the contribution thus made to conciseness is analogous to that made by algebra i e the algebraical mode of expression on the occasion of those discourses which have for their subjectmatter quantity as expressed by number abstraction made of figure §  0 remedies for miscollocation for the prevention of miscollocation little can be done besides noticing such faults as have been observed that they may serve as beacons for the avoidance of the like faults in future the following are among the cases of miscollocation which have been observed— between a pronounrelative and its antecedent interposition of another word capable of bearing also the relation of an antecedent placing a negative adverb in contiguity with a subjectmatter other than that to which it is intended to be applied placing a modificative clause so as to be applicable to an unintended principal placing a pronounadjectiverelative without a preceding substantive the substantive being left to be imagined and allotted by the reader example this is only c when there is no preceding substantive with which this can combine evil resulting—obscurity the subject of predication being wanting not presenting to the eye in writing and to the ear in speaking‡ in the first place the principal object or subjectmatter of the proposition rule whatever be the principal object which your sentence is designed to bring to view bring forward as early as you conveniently can the word employed in the expression of it—if you can make the sentence begin with that same word so much the better if a word expressive of another idea come before it the mind is in the first instance put upon a wrong scent and a sort of correction and partial change of conception must have place before the idea meant to be conveyed is apprehended by the firstmentioned mode of collocation the idea of spiritedness in the discourse is suggested and the reader if not set against it by usage is better satisfied the idea meant to be conveyed being apprehended on the instant and without further trouble in the other case the idea of insipidity and heaviness in the discourse presents itself unable for sometime to conceive what it is     that is meant to be conveyed to him the reader finds himself under the necessity of crawling on and poring on in quest of it and till he have arrived at it either proceeding on a wrong ground in the course of his reflections or continuing in a state of uncertainty and perplexity rule subarticles excepted include not in one article two sentences so unconnected as to be understood one without the other reasons for the reader might consider the two as one proposition and reference cannot be made to one without the other rule in a principal proposition imbed not exceptive or otherwise modicative clauses more than one rule of exceptions give notice at the commencement of an article for this purpose the formula exceptions excepted may be used reasons   it secures to the general proposition whatsoever it may be the most concise and clearly apprehensible expression which the nature of the case admits of   being placed at the very commencement of the sentence it gives a sort of warning which has the effect of anticipating and keeping the door of the mind shut against all those false conceptions which in the first instance and for the time would be among the effect of the proposition if presented in the first instance in a degree of extent which was not intended and which as the sentence advanced would receive contradiction in the way here proposed the erroneous conceptions in question are from the first excluded—in the way ordinarily pursued they are in the first place let in altogether and then one after another ejected   in this way the door is left open a door of the most simple form at which in any number successive amendments may be let in and this without any disturbance offered to any other part of the ordinance for the purpose of judging of its completeness—judging whether an article to this or that effect might not with advantage be added to it the list of these exceptions in conjunction with the general proposition out of which they are taken may at any time and at all times be surveyed at leisure the following mementoes will further tend to secure a good collocation— let the grammatical form of sentences in which statements are conceived be as simple as possible avoid the hypothetical form in the operation of statement—especially the complex hypothetical form in which several suppositions are strung together before the proposition makes its appearance where hypothetical propositions occur break them down into categorical ones the following are forms for doing this—   before the proposition prefix the several suppositions each by itself under the head of suppositions this is where the enumeration of the suppositions precedes the statement of the proposition   where the proposition comes first then subjoin the suppositions with the word case before them as thus case   case   c—nb in this latter mode of statement the suppositions are put disjunctively—in the former conjunctively chapter vii of language §   of technical language the maximum of notoriety being the object not only the matter but the form—not only the arrangements themselves but the language employed in giving expression to them will if that object have been attained have been such as is conducive to it considered in this point of view language used in law is of two sorts—  natural   technical the word technical—the appellative by which the denominations employed in designating the names of instruments and operations in the language of english jurisprudence are commonly designated tends to convey an erroneous conception pregnant with an error from which there may be a use in keeping the mind upon its guard it presents an ambiguity under favour of which the mischievousness of the object will till it has been exposed to view in the minds of most if not all readers be but too likely to be screened from notice not only are the denominations in question liable to be productive of evil but the evil they are actually productive of is so great as to be beyond calculation of the nonnotoriety of the law the mischievous effects are allcomprehensive for by it and in proportion to the extent of it the law is prevented from being productive of the good effects it is calculated to produce it is prevented from hindering the bad effects which would not have had existence had the law been known the individual who had he known of the existence and formed a correct opinion of the purport of the law would have availed himself of it if it were a law that gave him a right—or would have abstained from the act if it were a law by which the performance of such act is prohibited—loses his right in the one case and incurs the penalty of the law in the other case now for every person but the few to whom the import of these denominations styled technical is made known by a more or less long course of attention observation and experience the existence as well as the tenor of the instrument in question is by means of this technical language as it is called but too effectively and generally concealed how then it may be asked how is it that   0 the mischievousness of this class of denominations is concealed from ordinary eyes by means of this appellative answer—in this way by confounding this class of words which belongs exclusively not only to jurisprudence but in a more especial manner to english jurisprudence with the corresponding words belonging to other branches of art and science—words from the use of which no effects but what are purely beneficial are produced—a veil is thrown over the mischief produced by this legal class and an imputation applicable with exclusive propriety to the words of this noxious class is but too apt to extend itself to the words belonging to those unnoxious and purely useful ones the case is that in the language of every branch of art and science that can be named a more or less extensive stock of words of a peculiar nature in addition to all the words in familiar use is an indispensable appendage applied to these what the appellation technical imports is nothing more than peculiar as above to some branch of art and science to wit in contradistinction to those which being likewise employed in discourse relative to that same branch of art and science have nothing to distinguish them from the words in universal use belonging to the common stock of the language—or the import of them from the import attributed to those same ordinary words but the difference between these jurisprudential peculiar words and the other peculiar words is this in the case of the other peculiar words the deviation from ordinary words is matter of absolute necessity and on the occasion of framing them the whole attention and skill possessed by the framers was commonly employed in the rendering them as expressive as possible whereas in the other case the deviation from ordinary language being as wide commonly as can be imagined—no attention has been paid to render it expressive by rendering it as near akin as possible to the words appertaining to that same common stock—to that end no attention whatsoever was employed the attention if any applied to the subject having the direct opposite end viz that of rendering them as inexpressive as possible as unlikely as possible to convey correct conception—the only purposes to which they are applicable or designed to be applied are either conveying to the persons in question no conception at all or if any such as shall have the effect of leading them into error either productive of burden to the persons thus deceived or benefit to the deceivers terms of art jurisprudence must have as well as every other branch of art and science but in english practice the terms of art are to what they ought to be what the terms of astrology are to the terms of astronomy in a word in the case of every other branch of art and science with few exceptions and those not belonging to the present purpose to the words which are peculiar to it as being known to those individuals alone who are more or less conversant with the matter of it the appellative technical which in the original greek signifies neither more nor less than appertaining to art or science may not only with indisputable propriety but without leading into error be applied were it not for the danger of inculcating the conception that these words partake of the noxious quality which belongs to those technical words which are peculiar to jurisprudence—words from which they are essentially different as well in respect of the effects actually produced the effects intended to be produced and the motives by the operation of which the intention was produced in their effect as expressive as they could possibly be made and the explanation of them by means of an equivalent expression taken from the body of the language made as extensively notorious as it can be made and so intended to be—the motive to which they are indebted for their existence being a desire to render the matter of the art or science to which they belong as extensively known as possible—and this on account of the honour or profit or both expected in return for the benefit so conferred opposite in all these several particulars is the case of jurisprudential technical terms—actual effects everywhere relative ignorance or what is worse than ignorance error intended effects the same—desire by which in the character of motive the endeavour was produced the profit looked for and but too copiously derived from the ignorance and error so produced and the reputation for wisdom which by this artifice the people have been led to ascribe to the inventors of this system and the benevolence which they have at the same time been led to regard that same wisdom as having for its accompaniment in a word of the peculiar language in the case of physical science the words are expressive and so intended to be—in the case of jurisprudential science the words are either simply inexpressive thus securing the continuance of ignorance or what is worse viz for the people but proportionably better for the inventors productive of error the effects of which in so far as they have place are mischievous §   of the importance of improvement in legal language we have already seen that the technical terms of jurisprudence are either inexpressive or calculated to produce error the necessity of improvement cannot therefore be denied except by those who are blinded to its importance by interest or interestbegotten prejudice proportioned to the uncertainty attaching to the import of the words employed upon     legal subjects will be the uncertainty of possession and expectation in regard to property in every shape and also the deficiency of political security against evil in every shape proportioned therefore to the fixity given to the import of those same words will be the degree of security for good in every shape and against evil in every shape until therefore the nomenclature and language of law shall be improved the great end of good government cannot be fully attained in medical art and science improvement is rapid and extensive at all times and in all places in legislation and jurisprudence everything is either retrograde or at best stationary the cause is no secret in medicine it is the interest of every practitioner to promote improvement and to promote it to the utmost to make whatsoever addition to the stock his faculties admit of his making—of no judicial practitioner is this the interest—his interest is directly opposite in medicine not only the nosology of the subject is constantly receiving augmentation but also the terminology—in legislation and jurisprudence everything to make the best of it is at a stand but he who will not be at the pains of making nor so much as of adopting new expressions must go on with the old ones alone and consequently with all the errors which being associated with are established by the old ones and as amongst other things all political abuses are thus established and kept on foot and in estimation by these old ones—by that part of the language which has been employed in the establishment of these same abuses hence on the part of persons so circumstanced the horror of innovation in language forms a natural accompaniment to the horror of innovation in law and hence on the other hand all persons desirous of the improvement of legal institutions must also be desirous of the improvement of legal language in so far as correct notions are substituted to incorrect ones denominations in some respects new must of necessity be employed denominations by which none but incorrect notions have ever been designated and suggested never can without alteration be made to serve for the designation and conveyance of correct ones language has in the art of healing as applied to the body natural advantageously received the form of a branch of art and science it is high time that by the like operation it should be as applied to the disorders of the body politic raised to that same elevation in the scale of dignity by an elevation in the scale of art and science understand anything rather than elevation in the scale of difficulty not to maximize difficulty but to minimize that obstacle to usefulness and human felicity is the object with every true lover of art and science but without novelty in language neither in this nor in any other portion of the field does the nature of things admit of any such elevation or of any considerable addition to the stock of matter thus elevated and without closeness and continuity of attention in some proportion to the novelty it is not possible that anything which is taught—anything however well taught as well as deserving to be taught and held in everlasting remembrance should be learned no new propositions howsoever useful can receive expression unless it be by new words or new application of already established ones—i e by using them on occasions on which they had not been at all or had not been commonly employed hence a sort of postulate necessary to be put forward in legislative art and science in imitation for the first time of the practice in the posological branch of physical art and science postulate that all new words and phrases necessary to the substitution of truth to error—of clearness to obscurity or ambiguity—conciseness to verbosity—be coined uttered and received let the mint of the greatest happiness—the mint of reason and utility be the mint in which they are coined what i am far from saying is that all who are found to start and urge these objections are enemies to human happiness and improvement but what i do say is that all who are enemies to human happiness and improvement will be found to start and urge them in so far as the conceptions hitherto entertained are inadequate or erroneous necessary to the communication of correct and adequate ones is a correspondently appropriate and adequate and therefore unavoidably a novel system of vocabulary to the words of which such vocabulary is composed one condition is at once requisite and sufficient this is that without incorrectness ambiguity or obscurity they carry to the conceptive faculty of the reader the idea meant to be conveyed either at the first mention antecedently to all definition or other exposition or at any rate after such exposition has been heard or read for this purpose it will generally speaking be sufficient if in the case of each word other words derived from the same root are familiar to the reader in question—familiar and at the same time expressive of clear conceptions or if for the explanation other words in a sufficient degree synonymous to them are subjoined in what degree for correct conception or even for the possibility of obtaining any conception     at all of the object in question men are indebted to aptitude of nomenclature persons in general are very little aware throughout the whole field of that branch of the mathematics in which forms are put out of consideration what is therein done is done altogether by nomenclature—by abridgment given to the signs by which the idea is expressed thus in common arithmetic by means of the arabic names of numbers operations are performed which by words at length without that instrument of abbreviation could scarcely have been performed whilst by those instruments of ulterior abbreviation which are afforded by algebra alone operations are performed which could never have otherwise been performed—results obtained which could never have otherwise been obtained true it is that of all these operations there is not one to the expression of which words and phrases at length are not completely adequate but in many an instance such is the quantity of literary matter that would be accumulated that ere the result could be realized confusion would ensue the mind would be bewildered and conception lost in branches of art and science comparatively frivolous and for the accommodation of those who amuse themselves in the cultivation of these branches—in a word in the several branches of natural history—no scruple is made not only of introducing new denominations but of composing a vast nomenclature altogether of such new denominations—fruits of the innovation principle for the purpose of morals and legislation united the number of new denominations requisite is comparatively inconsiderable these new denominations will mostly be taken from the latin—from that language from which most of the words of the languages of the most civilized nations are derived in the natural history branch the language from which the new denominations are borrowed is the greek—a language with which none except the extremely few have any sort of acquaintance and which has no root in the language of the people there ought therefore to be less objection to the introduction of new terms into the branches of legislation and morals than into the branch of natural history and there would be less but for that horror of innovation by which the tyranny of the few over the subjectmany may be repressed §   prejudices adverse to improvement in legal language obviated on this occasion we may remark how disadvantageous is the situation of him whose endeavour it is in this line of service to give increase to the greatest happiness of the greatest number in comparison with that of those whose endeavours are exclusively directed to the giving increase to their own personal greatest happiness and thence to that of the class to which they belong at the expense of the greatest happiness of the greatest number and thence and thereby to the maximizing the defalcation from the aggregate stock of happiness—in other words how difficult and disadvantageous the task of the friend of the people in the character of the wouldbe improver of the law is in comparison with that of the enemy of the people in the character of the feefed practitioner and feefed judge the nomenclature devised in a barbarous age by a mixture of stupidity ignorance error and lawyercraft has by force of irresistible power under favour of interestbegotten and authoritybegotten prejudice been interwoven in the language and been rendered the subjectmatter of instruction to the highest educated classes and the object of admiration and veneration to all classes—nay even the more flagrant its inaptitude the more intense the veneration for the more flagrant the inaptitude the greater the labour necessary to the attainment of that incorrect and incomplete conception of the ideas attached to it which the nature of them admits of and the greater the labour a man has bestowed upon any subjectmatter be it what it may the greater the value which he of course attaches to the fruits of that labour whatsoever they may happen to be thus it is that while on account of its antiquity the most unapt nomenclature which misplaced ingenuity could devise is an object of favour and veneration the most apt that wellplaced ingenuity can devise will as naturally be an object of aversion and disgust—inexorably averted from the idea of the new appellatives the attention of the reader will confine itself to the novelty and in that novelty will find an adequate as well as an efficient cause for those sentiments in the prevalence of which instead of reward punishment will from the same source be found the lot and the retributive reward for his labours by the benefactor of mankind necessary indispensably necessary to correct complete and clear conception is a correspondently correct complete and apposite nomenclature never to the purpose of conveying correct and complete ideas can any locution be adapted by which no ideas but such as are incorrect incomplete and confused have as yet ever been conveyed to the acquisition of new instruction necessary indispensably necessary to a correspondent extent is on the part of the instructor the framing—on the part of the learner the learning—of a new language in every other branch of art and science universally and without exception is the necessity felt esteem and gratitude on the part of the learner is invariably the consequence—invariably     part and parcel of the recompense of the teacher take for instance the art and science of chemistry and the improvement made in its nomenclature by lavoisier not less extensive than just was the tribute of admiration and applause bestowed upon that illustrious man and the no less illustrious partner of his bed for that rich product of their conjoint labours in that branch of art and science—think of what chemistry was before that time—think of what it has become since think of the plight that natural history and natural philosophy would have been in had a law of the publicopinion tribunal been in force interdicting the addition of any terms belonging to these branches of art and science to the stock in use at the time of lord bacon but the employment of the terms then in use in the field of natural history and natural philosophy is not more incompatible with the attainment and communication of true and useful knowledge in that field than the employment of the terms now in use in the field of jurisprudence is with the attainment and communication of the conceptions and opinions necessary to the attainment of the only legitimate and defensible ends of government and legislation the division of the qualities of plants into hot cold moist and dry each in a scale of degrees was not more incompatible with correct complete and useful conception of the various properties of the subjects of the vegetable kingdom than the still established division of offences into treasons præmunires unclergyable felonies clergyable felonies and misdemeanours the corruption ascribed by the lawyerbranch of the flashlanguage to the blood of those whom on this or that occasion adverse fortune has placed on the losing side in a contest between two candidates for the faculty of sacrificing to the fancied felicity of a single individual the real happiness of twenty or a hundred and twenty millions—as a specimen of this nomenclature with the atrocious tyranny involved in it will afford to all posterity a melancholy proof of the state of corruption in the hearts of those who have given creation preservation and extension to that tyranny and in the understandings of the deluded people who could remain unopposing victims of it yes within the memory of the author of these pages the population of great britain to the number of about twelve millions was divided into two not very decidedly unequal halves the one composed of those whose fondest wishes centred in the happiness of being slaves to a scotchman of the name of stuart—the other of those whose wishes pointed in the same manner to a german of the name of guelph of the twelve millions six were devoted to extermination by the lawyers on one side—the other six by the lawyers on the other side in the aggregate mass of the blood of the whole population not a drop that was not in those days in a state of corruption actual or eventual according to the system of physiology established for the benefit of most religious kings by learned lords and learned gentlemen scarcely of the whole number of those in whom according to blackstones language the capacity of committing crimes had place would a single one have escaped the having his or her bowels torn out of his or her body and burnt before his or her face supposing execution and effect capable of being given and given accordingly to the laws made under pretence of being found readymade and declared for the more effectual preservation of loyalty and social order to whatsoever particular language the aggregate mass of discourse in question belongs it will undeniably be in the greater degree apt with reference to the uses of human discourse taken in the aggregate the more it abounds with words by which ambiguity and obscurity are excluded or with words by means of which fresh and fresh degrees of conciseness are given to the body of the language every language being the work of the human mind at a stage of great immaturity reference had to the present state of it hence it is that in every language the most apt or say the least unapt not excepted the demand for new words cannot but be great and urgent in some of the departments of the field of language including the field of thought and action and the field of art and science no reluctance at all as to this mode of enrichment has place—on the other hand in others such reluctance has place in a degree more or less considerable of this field the portion in regard to which this reluctance seems to be most intense and extensive is that which belongs to morals in general and politics including law and government in particular—of this reluctance the inconsistency and the evil effects that result from it to the uncontrovertible ends of human discourse are apparent the opposite of that useful quality the degree of which would be as the multitude of apt words associated with clear ideas—with ideas of unprecedented clearness and introduced at a still maturer and maturer stage of the human mind is a quality for the designation of which the word purity has commonly been employed no sooner is the idea for the designation of which this word is employed brought clearly to view than it is seen to be     that which is aptly and correctly designated by the word indigence this word indigence wherefore then is it not employed—for what purpose is the word purity substituted to it answer for this purpose viz the causing every endeavour to render the language more and more apt with reference to the uncontrovertible ends of human discourse to be regarded with an eye of disapprobation purity is of the number of those words to which an eulogistic sense has been attached—words under cover of which an ungrounded judgment is wont to be conveyed and which are thence so many instruments in the hand of fallacy of the use made of the word purity the object and to an unfortunate degree the effect is—to express and as it were by contagion to produce and propagate a sentiment of approbation towards the state of things or the practice in the designation of which it is employed—a sentiment of disapprobation towards the state of things or practice opposite on each occasion on which the word purity is employed for the purpose of pointing a sentiment of disapprobation on the act of him by whom a newcoined word is introduced or employed reference is explicitly or implicitly made to some period or point of time at which the stock of words belonging to that part of the language is regarded as being complete—insomuch that of any additional word employed the effect is to render the aggregate stock—not the more apt but by so much the less apt with reference to the ends of language to wit not on the score of its individual inaptitude for that is an altogether different consideration but on the mere ground of its being an additional word added to that stock of words which it found already complete—a word introduced at a time subsequent to that at which the language it is assumed had arrived at such a degree of perfection that by any change produced by addition it could not but be deteriorated—rendered less apt than it was with reference to the ends of language that as often as conveyed and adopted any such sentiment of disapprobation is not only ungrounded but groundless and the effect of it in so far as it has any pernicious seems already to have been by this description of it rendered as manifest as it is in the power of words to render it an assumption involved in it is that so far as regards that part of the language the perfection of human reason had at the point of time in question been already attained another assumption that seems likewise involved in it is—either that experience had never from the beginning of things to the time in question been the mother of wisdom or that exactly at that same point of time her capacity of producing the like offspring had somehow or other been made to cease now as to the causes—the moral the inward the secret causes in which this error—this pernicious mode of thinking appears to have had its source applied to the field of thought and action taken in the aggregate they appear to be these—  aversion to depart from accustomed habits in particular the habit of regarding the stock of the matter of language as applied to the stock of ideas in question as being complete   love of ease or say aversion to labour—aversion to the labour of mind necessary to the forming therein with the requisite degree of intimacy an association between the idea in question new or old and the new word thus introduced or proposed to be introduced   where the word is such as appears to convey with it a promise of being of use more or less considerable in that portion of the field into which it is thus proposed to be introduced a sentiment of envy or jealousy in relation to the individual known or unknown on whose part the endeavour thus to make a valuable addition to the stock of the language has been manifested   of the causes above mentioned the application wants not much of being coextensive with the whole field of human discourse one cause yet remains the influence of which will naturally be more powerful than that of all the others put together this cause is confined in its operation to the field of morals and politics—taking however the field of opinion on the subject of religion as included in it it consists in the opposition made by every such new word—in proportion to the tendency which it has to add to the stock of ideas conducive to the greatest happiness of the greatest number—to the particular and sinister interests of those by whom the sentiment of disapprobation as towards the supposed effect and tendency of the new word in question stands expressed and is endeavoured to be propagated §   of the modes or sources of improvement of language in respect of copiousness of single words there are not many by which in various ways mischief to a greater amount has been done than has been done by the word purity with its conjugate pure—done in the field of morals in the field of legislation and as here in the field of taste in the fields of morals and legislation purity has for another of its conjugates a word significative of the opposite quality impurity—to the field of language the application of this negative quality does not appear to have extended itself the grand mischief here is that which has been done by the inference that has been made of the existence of moral impurity from that of physical impurity—of impurity in a     moral sense from that of impurity in a physical sense in the field of taste this word has been made the vehicle in and by which the notion is conveyed and endeavoured to be inculcated that copiousness in language instead of being a desirable is an undesirable quality—instead of a merit a blemish—purity being interpreted is the opposite of copiousness the less copious the language the more pure if ever there were a prejudice this may assuredly be called one in the field of mechanics when a workman has a new contrivance of any kind upon a pattern of his own to execute a not uncommon preliminary is the having to contrive and execute accordingly a new tool or set of tools likewise of his own contrivance to assist him in the execution of the new work such to no inconsiderable extent has been the unavoidable task of the author with respect to legal language the following are among the modes in which its improvement in the quality of copiousness may be sought— i augmentation not to speak of completion of the list of conjugates rule   from whatsoever root any branch of conjugates already in the language has been derived—from that branch deduce a root and from that root deduce every other of the aggregate of the branches of which a complete logical cluster of conjugates is composed the operation is analogous to that of the gardener who stripping off a twig from a shrub plants it in the ground where it takes root and having so done forms itself into a perfect shrub similar to that from which it was stripped off rule   give to every relative appellation its correlative rule   form new words with prefixes and suffixes matching one another rule   whatsoever group of conjugates any one of two opposites has give also to the other—to wit in so far as it remains destitute of them ii augmentation not to speak of completion of the list of compound words—viz of those in the formation of which the hyphen is employed as an instrument indicative of the junction for as to compound words in which the junction is formed without the use of this instrument the list of them will in a great degree coincide with the list of conjugates iii augmentation here completion is manifestly impossible of the list of names—univocal names of things and persons respectively in the manufacture of new words the following rules should be observed— rule   no new word from any other than an english root if any such is to be had rule   better from a latin than a greek root in either case if there be any one branch already introduced into the english vocabulary so much the better rule   introduce no species of conjugate of which there is no example as yet in the english language so long as any one equivalent to it is to be had of which there is an example in the english language when of a species which is familiar an individual which is not familiar is introduced for the joint purpose of authority and explanation at the same time bring to view other individual instances §   english language—its advantages for the purposes of legislation greek latin and teutonic are the radical languages of the most civilized nations among these languages the latin is that which affords the richest set of conjugates and consequently this language is the most apt for morals and legislation in which the rule should be—ideis iisdem verba eadem among the latinsprung languages the english is the most apt as possessing in the highest degree the aggregate of these appropriate qualities simplicity of texture ductility and augmentability its aptitude for the purpose of legislation will appear—   as to words singly considered   as to words aggregated into phrases it affords facility for the employment of new conjugates upon the pattern of the old it allows of the employing any substantive as an adjective—viz by simply prefixing it to another substantive with relation to which it then becomes an adjective in this way the names of parliamentary bills are formed the extent of this facility will be clearly perceived upon a comparison with the difficulties under which the french language labours in this particular it allows also of combining two words into one when thus united if one of them be a substantive employed as a substantive it becomes the representative of an object capable of being made the subject of predication—a fictitious entity to which for the purpose of discourse any action or quality may be ascribed it also contains a multitude of affixes—to wit prefixes and suffixes—capable of being applied to any root for the formation of conjugates chapter viii of the perfections of which the legislative style is susceptible imperfections what—nothing but imperfections and are imperfections all the     attributes of which nomography is susceptible is the whole merit of the work of which the legislator in this point of view is susceptible confined to so negative and weak a merit as that of the mere avoidance of imperfections perfections is there anything in the nature of legislative discourse which renders it unsusceptible of every quality that can with propriety be realized under that name answer   of the positive points of perfection of which discourse at large is susceptible there are none that apply to legislative discourse in respect of its being legislative discourse—none that apply to it otherwise than in respect of its being discourse   those points of perfection that apply to legislative discourse inasmuch as it is discourse are in point of importance in comparison with the negative points of perfection too inconsiderable to bear being mentioned in the same line to please—to produce in the mind of the reader a sensation of the agreeable kind but that a momentary one—such is the only desirable object they are capable of being rendered subservient to—the only good effect of which they are capable of being rendered productive   of those positive points of perfection of which discourse inasmuch as it is discourse is susceptible will some if not all in the case of legislative discourse be produced without any particular endeavour to give birth to them—produced of course by the remedial operations necessary to secure the existence of certain perfections of the negative kind force and harmony—to these two expressions all the perfections of the positive cast applicable with propriety to this particular species of discourse seem reducible force and harmony—two endowments which if they are not the only perfections of which discourse taken at large is susceptible are at any rate among those of which discourse at large is susceptible—the only ones which in the case of the particular species of discourse here in question can be either given to it or be attempted to be given to it without rendering it so much the less adapted to its own peculiar purposes harmony is a perfection which as such ought of course in so far as may be to be given to a legislative discourse as well as to every other discourse harmony has for its object and effect the affording a sensation of the agreeable kind to the ear and be the organ or the occasion what it may pleasure in so far as it is pleasure is a good and the production of it a desirable result for this perfection as for any other a discourse of the kind in question will when absolutely considered be so much the better the greater the degree in which the perfection shall have been attained by it and the advantage thus produced will be pure and clear if in the form given to the discourse in question in this view no imperfection of a more important character—none of those which have for their effects ambiguity obscurity or overbulkiness are introduced into it and in this pure and neat state proper care being taken the perfection in question may it is supposed be introduced into legislative as well as into any other species of discourse as to force in so far as pleasure to the ear of the hearer or reader is the result of this quality in the discourse this perfection may be considered as no more than a particular modification of the other—viz harmony but besides that though in general harmony would perhaps be found an accompaniment of it it may happen that the harmoniousness of a portion of discourse may be diminished rather than increased by a structure by which the force of it shall be increased the service rendered to any species of discourse in general and to this species in a particular degree by force is of a more important kind this is of the number of those cases in which the effect is to suggest the idea of strength intellectual strength on the part of the workman this idea on all occasions in so far as it finds place an agreeable one is in the present instance useful on a more important account in a case of this kind to excite in the mind of the hearer or reader the idea and opinion of the existence of intellectual strength on the part of the author is to excite in his mind the idea and opinion of the existence of a quality than which nothing can be more naturally and surely calculated to inspire confidence but among the operations which have for their object and effect the operating as remedies to imperfections of the second order and thence in other words to endow the discourse in a proportionable degree with the opposite negative perfections there are some which in general have also for their natural effect the giving to the composition the quality of vigour or force it is this which prevents ambiguity ex situ ambiguity from bad collocation by giving in each instance an apt location to every clause the effect of which is to operate in the character of a limitative clause viz of that to which it is intended to apply in the character of a principal clause by inserting it in the bosom of that clause if it be composed of two or more principal clauses by placing it at the head of the whole series†     chapter ix of forms of enactment the forms of which a law is susceptible are—  integral or say principal   fractional or say modificative—that is to say modificative of some antecedently enacted principal law to which may be added a third under the name of composite† as being composed of one or more integral laws with the addition of one or more parcels of modificative matter—modificative with reference to one or more integral or modificative laws by an integral law understand the entire matter of one command—of one sentence or proposition sentence in the sense given to the word in an institutional work on grammar proposition in the sense given to the word by logicians in a book on logic example thou shalt not or no person shall commit or let no person commit theft by a fractional law understand a law by the matter of which some modification is applied—that is to say some interpretation or some variation—to the import of the matter of some law considered as the correspondent integral or say principal law example the act of theft is committed or theft has place where not believing himself to have a right so to do a person converts to his own use a moveable subjectmatter of property to the use of which in the manner in which he so converts it to his own use he has not any sufficient right—he at the same time being conscious of his not having any such sufficient right and by concealment or carrying off of the thing so dealt with or by disguise or subtraction of his own person using his endeavours to avoid being amenable to law in respect of such his act in this example may be seen an example of a fractional law which is interpretative or say exponing with reference to the abovementioned principal or say integral law in consequence of its familiarity to every ear and every eye it is that the law expressed by the words thou shalt not steal is hereinabove employed as an example but the form thus exemplified is not the simplest form of which a law relative to this matter is susceptible a more simple form is this thou shalt not convert to thine own use any moveable thing or any subjectmatter of property which thou hast not a right so to deal with as thou hast done a law expressed in these words belongs to that class of laws which are regularly denominated civil laws or spoken of as being respectively part and parcel of the aggregate branch of law called the civil branch or the civil law or the mass of matter belonging to the civil code better in consideration of the various other senses in which the adjective civil when applied in conjunction with the substantive law is employed say nonpenal law or simply distributive law the law expressed in and by these words—thou shalt not steal or no person shall steal is in effect under the guise of a simple integral law a composite law as agreeing with the definition above given of a composite law for in the import of the word theft as also in that of the word steal—which is an abridged equivalent of the words commit an act of theft—is included though tacitly and thus implicitly the idea of punishment as being in some shape or other appointed to be inflicted on the agent who is so in respect of such act—which appointment cannot be made without a correspondent law really existing or fictitious of which latter case presently enacted for that purpose and attached to the integral law first mentioned evil consciousness is the name proposed to be employed for the designation of one of two states in one or other of which unless a mans mind have place punishment not being capable of producing any good effect—but on the contrary being sure to be productive of bad effect—cannot but be worse than useless—the other state thus alluded to being that which in roman law and language has been termed temerity temeritas and may in english be rendered by the word heedlessness that is want of that strength of attention by which if bestowed the commission of the act the maleficent quality of which is assumed would have been prevented for the designation of an act here expressed by the terms an act accompanied with evil consciousness the words a malâ fide act or an act committed in mala fides are employed in roman law and language and     thence sometimes in the language employed by english lawyers an act accompanied with evil consciousness as above is also in roman law and language said to be accompanied with dolus or say dolus is spoken of as being in the mind of the agent an accompaniment of the act inadequate however is this appellative thus used by roman and rome bred lawyers for dolus in the sense in which it is on any other ocasion employed in roman language means deceit and implies that deception is produced or endeavoured to be produced in the mind of some person on the occasion of the act—whereas it is as often employed in cases where no such deception is supposed to have been produced or endeavoured to be produced as in cases in which it is supposed to have been produced—as in case of a highway robbery or burglary committed by a man who knows that his person is well known to the party on whom and at whose expense the crime is committed laws may further be considered as integral or principal and subsidiary or say effectuative effectuative being a term of reference—by an effectuative law understand a law the object and function of which is to give effect to some principal law to which it is appended no otherwise than by applying to the mind of a person whose conduct it is designed to influence an inducement of some kind or other can any law of the effectuative class be productive of the effect intended such inducement will be constituted by the eventual expectation either of the matter of good in some shape or of the matter of evil in some shape—of the matter of good in case of compliance or of the matter of evil in case of compliance or of the matter of good in case of noncompliance and the matter of evil in case of noncompliance in which case in any event the one or other will by the person whose active faculty it is endeavoured thus to influence be receivable if it be of the matter of good that the expectation is thus held out remunerative is the term by which the effectuative law in question may be designated—if the matter of evil penal punitional or say punitive legislation has been distinguished into two modes—the direct and the indirect in the direct mode the persons at whose hands obedience is desired are different in the case of the subsidiary or effectuative law and in the case of the fractional law in the case of each of the two species the remunerative and the punitive they are howsoever it may be in regard to the principal law always the same   in the case of the remunerative subsidiary law—the persons whoeoever they happen to be by whose hands the matter of remuneration is eventually to be transferred into those in whose instance compliance with the desire which gave birth to the principal law has had place are most commonly persons belonging to the financial subdepartment of the administration department   in the case of the punitive subsidiary law—the judge to whom the cognizance of the case belongs   in the case of the principal law they are persons of any class whatsoever—persons belonging to any one of the classes allcomprehensive or short of allcomprehensive—at whose hands compliance is called for by the general code and the several particular or say specific codes—including the several still more particular and as they may be termed subspecific classes at whose hands compliance is called for in and by each one of the several particular codes in the indirect mode of legislation separate subsidiary or say effectuative law for this particular purpose there is none disguised forms of legislation may be employed either undesignedly or designedly—thus by means of a remunerative inducement there may be created an indirect mandate—under the appearance of a prohibition there may be an indirect licence indirect mandate with a remunerative inducement to compliance example mass of the matter of wealth to an indefinite amount power given to p patron to confer it—to i incumbent to receive it retain it enjoy it—but on condition precedent antecedently to be performed to wit a declaration of opinions a declaration by the utterance of which the declarant asserts that he entertains in relation to a certain subjectmatter of opinion thereupon named an opinion to a certain effect of the utterance of every such mandate the effect is the production of mendacity on the part of some part or the whole of the number of those by whom the mass in question is received how so answer because in this case by a man in whose instance the assertion is mendacious accompanied with evil consciousness the matter of good in question the reward may be obtained as surely and as safely as by any one in whose instance the assertion stands clear of any such accompaniment in the instance of no person can any other person have sufficient ground for regarding it as certain that a declaration of opinion made in the case in question is mendacious but in the instance of any person all others will have some ground for entertaining a suspicion to that effect—that is to say for regarding such mendacity as being more or less profitable the probability of the existence of mendacity in this case is in the direct ratio of the     improbability of the matter of fact the existence of which is asserted by the declaration in question and of the perspicacity of the person by whom the declaration is made for contributing to the propagation of mendacity on this occasion in this mode and by this means inducements operating on the part of a contributor are the following—   averting from himself the imputation of mendacity the persons in whose instance alone this inducement has place are those by whom the like declaration is known to have been made   producing on the part of other persons in an indefinite number a declaration of opinion clear of the imputation of mendacity on the subject in question—that is in other words causing them really to entertain an opinion to the effect in question how so answer by the force of authoritybegotten prejudice in relation to many points not to say most every man finds himself under the necessity of borrowing his opinions from others grounding his conduct not on any direct opinions of his own relative to the matters of fact in question but upon the opinions of this or that person or class or assemblage of persons whose opportunities of receiving information he regards as more conducive to the end in view than any of which he himself is in possession in this way it is that by a declaration of opinion made by a man in whose instance it is mendacious that same opinion is caused to be really entertained and consequently a declaration made of it clear of mendacity in the instance of other persons in any number   by this means giving strength to the party to which he belongs—a party having for the symbol and evidence of mutual union and cooperation the entertaining of the same opinion in relation to this or that subjectmatter of opinion no matter what licence presupposes either prohibition or mandate and has for its effect the removal of the one or the other in the instance and for the benefit of the individual who is said to be licensed in the case of prohibition the indirect mode is much more effective than the direct why because prohibition supposes delinquency on the part of him who fails to comply with it that is to say who exercises an act of the sort of those for the prevention of which the prohibition issued prohibition supposes delinquency and delinquency supposes eventual punishment and suit at law in this case styled prosecution for the purpose of inducing the judge to apply the punishment but for this purpose evidence is necessary with time and means of adducing counterevidence none of which obstacles have place in the case of indirect prohibition the greater the delay expense and vexation attendant on prosecution the greater the excess of efficacy on the part of the indirect in comparison with the direct mode in a word the mode of prohibition is indirect when the portion of good or the portion of evil of which the inducement to abstain from the exercise of the prohibited act is composed takes place without recourse had by any person to the services of the judge for the purpose of causing it to be received the portion of good that is to say the enjoyment or the efficient cause of enjoyment—the portion of evil that is to say the portion of suffering or the efficient cause of suffering prohibition with a punitive inducement to compliance attached in the indirect mode example a tax imposed on law proceedings—the amount of it payable either to the public or to a judge or other member of the judiciary establishment every tax imposed on an object of general desire has the effect of a prohibition that is to say a prohibition inhibiting the use of it to all those who have not wherewithal to pay the tax now mind the effect of a tax imposed on the faculty of obtaining the services of the judge the use of it to those to whom it is of use—the use of it in comparison with the direct mode of endeavouring to prevent that which it is desired to prevent is the faculty of effecting the prevention without the odium which would attach upon any one who should be seen to join in the application of prohibition in the direct mode by a tax on law proceedings the effect of a licence may be produced i a tax imposed on the operations performed on the plaintiffs or say demandants side operates as a licence to wrong in every possible shape at the charge of every individual who at the time in question is unable to defray this factitious expense in addition to expense in all other shapes factitious and natural taken together in this case to wrong in all shapes through failure of justice for want of the official services of the judge and his subordinates the efficient enactments by which in this case the effect i e the licence is produced are these—  a mandate addressed to the judge commanding him eventually to render to each demandant the particular services demanded by the demand and thereby to impose on the defendant the burthen whatever it be the imposition of which is called for by the demand—eventually that is to say if to the satisfaction of the judge it shall have been proved that by rendering such service execution and effect will on that individual occasion have been given to some law applying to the case   applicable to a correspondent portion of the extent covered by that same   0 mandatory enactment a prohibitory enactment inhibiting the judge from rendering such a service in every individual case in which the tax in question has not been paid ii a tax on judicial operations performed and judicial instruments employed on the defendants side operates not only as a simple licence given to the demandant to inflict wrong on the defendant in every shape in which punishment or other burthen is endeavoured to be imposed by the demand in this case not merely is a licence to commit the several enormities given but by the legislator at any rate the judge is rendered an instrument in the hand of the wrongful demandant in and for the commission of all these several wrongs—an accomplice of the wrongdoer the wrongful demandant by whom is reaped the chief profit from these wrongs the effective enactments by which in this case the effect of the licence or more than the effect of the licence is produced are—   a mandate addressed to the judge commanding him eventually to render to each demandant the services demanded by his demand and thereby to impose on the defendant the burthen whatever it be the imposition of which is called for by the demand—eventually that is to say if to the satisfaction of the judge it shall have been proved that by rendering such service execution and effect will in this indivdual occasion have been given to some legislativemade law at that time in force and applying to the case or some judgemade law operating in default of such legislativemade law and applying to that same case   a correspondent prohibition addressed to the judge inhibiting him from permitting the defendant to perform this or that operation the performance of which is necessary—or from exhibiting this or that written instrument—exhibition of which is necessary to his defence that is to say to the affording to the judge reasonable ground for being satisfied that in case of his rendering to the demandant in question the service he demands execution and effect would not be rendered to any law but that on the contrary by his rendering that same service an offence against some law actually in force would be committed of these two arrangements taken together the effect is to command the judge on the individual occasion in question to commit an act which in the eyes of the legislator himself is an act of injustice to bestow upon every person by whom what in his eyes is regarded as an adequate assurance has been obtained that another individual on whom he is desirous of imposing a burthen in any shape in which the judge is either commanded or permitted eventually to impose it that such individual will not be able to raise the money on the payment of which and not otherwise he will have purchased the permission to adduce the evidence and arguments necessary to exempt and preserve him from suffering under the burthen thus wrongfully endeavoured to be imposed—the effectual power of imposing that same burthen when by a law by which for the declared purpose of preventing the exercise of a species of act regarded as being in a preponderant degree maleficent a prohibition with a punitive sanction or say inducement is established in such sort that—while the aggregate amount of the eventual burthen appointed to be borne by a person not complying with the inhibition is fixed or confined on the side of increase within a certain limit the nature of the inhibited act is such that in individual cases more or less numerous after the offending agent has been subjected to the burthen a clear benefit or say a net profit to an amount more or less considerable remains in his hands—instead of the supposed and apparent prohibitory enactment or arrangement a mandatory enactment and arrangement with a remuneratory sanction and inducement has place to the amount of such clear benefit in each such individual case from this theoretical observation follows a practical conclusion of prime importance throughout the whole penal code in the case of every offence give to the judge the power of searching out and taking from the offender the whole profit of the offence—this done and not before that it comes to be of the nature of any burthen imposed to contribute in the character of a subsequentially privative remedy to the prevention of offences of the like nature in future to the present topic belong in strictness those cases and those cases alone in which at the expense of prohibitive enactments with punitive inducements emanating from the legislative authority an unannounced and thence by persons in general unperceived licence is granted by that same authority but a place may here be found in which in the way of allusion intimation may be given of a species of operation productive of the same effect though performed by other hands since of the mass of evil thus produced the intensity and extent are such as can scarcely fail to impress upon every readers mind a correspondent sense of its importance these other hands are those of the judicial authority and in the circumstances in which civilized society has everywhere as yet been placed though in point of fact everywhere the judicial authority is by avowed acknowledgment subordinate to the legislative and in the very nature of the case cannot but so be—yet such on the one hand has been the cunning and audacity of the members of     the judicial establishment and such the blindness or supineness of the legislative authority in whatsoever hands placed that in every country to a greater or less degree but in england in a more particular degree and to a greater extent by far than in any other country the judicial has found means on various pretexts to trench upon the authority of the legislative to destroy the effect of its enactments and thus and in so far usurp its authority in another place the device by which this state of things has been brought about has been designated by the words decision on grounds avowedly foreign to the merits and under this the practice or say operation designated by the appellative of nullification or annulment has been brought to view and shown to be the principal instrument of the evil thus accomplished it has been seen how it is that of the principal enactment whether prohibitory or mandatory with a punitive inducement the effect depends upon a corresponding enactment styled a subsidiary or say effectuative enactment commonly if not always of the mandatory cast addressed to the judge hence it is that if in any instance upon application in ordinary course made to him the conduct maintained on that individual occasion be instead of strict compliance as it ought to be that of downright noncompliance such act of noncompliance is an act of usurpation an act of delinquency in respect of which in every political community in which a degree of anarchy incompatible with general security is not preferred to a consistent mode of governance without which no adequate degree of general security can have place every judge thus acting in a state of disobedience to his universally acknowledged superordinate will be considered as a criminal and as such dealt with in this case not only does the judge in every instance assume to himself and exercise the power of frustrating and pro tanto repealing the enactment of the legislature but though in an indirect not in a less efficacious way with or without being conscious of the evil he is doing does he impart that same power to other persons in a great variety of situations for noncompliance with a certain supposed and imaginary enactment although the act of delinquency of which he stands accused have been proved upon the defendant and thereby the existence of the corresponding obligation on the part of the judge to make application of the appointed punishment the judge refuses to make such application now then if it were real this imaginary regulation what would it be it would be for example a regulation enacting that unless in the instrument of accusation denominated for example an indictment by which in so far as regards general ideas expression is given by a certain assemblage of general words while for the giving expressions to the individual ideas belonging to the individual case blanks are left such and such words shall be employed—employed by whom by the individual whoever it is by whom the words were written subject to a review performed or not performed as it may happen by his employer a person holding some subordinate situation under the judge—the punishment enacted by the legislator shall not be inflicted hence then by this regulation a power is given at any rate to some subordinate functionary in an obscure situation to frustrate any or all enactments of the legislator which come for execution and effect to the judge under whose authority he officiates—at any rate to some subordinate clerk of the arraigns or whatever he is called but in contingency and always in probability another person to whom this same power is imparted is any man whatsoever who in the capacity of a copying clerk happens to be employed by that same subordinate officer of this same maleficencelicence institution the species of licence here and elsewhere mentioned under the name of the mendacity licence is a species or say modification in this case a prohibition is enacted—a prohibition with a punitive sanction and inducement inhibiting under certain penalties the commission of any act of mendacity—of any act by which expression is given to a false assertion accompanied with the consciousness of its falsity but the case to which the application of this prohibition is confined is the case in which a special engagement to abstain from mendacity has been taken and entered into by bearing a part in the ceremony styled an oath—in this case an affirmative oath thus stands the matter in the case of the mendacitylicence taken at large but in the case of the mendacitylicence which has been established and has place on different occasions throughout the whole course of judicial procedure under the law of england as also under the law of perhaps most other countries—to this negative sort of encouragement given and licence granted by forbearance to apply prohibition is added under english law at any rate an encouragement of the positive cast afforded by a mandate with a sanction and inducement of the remunerative kind addressed to all malâ fide suitors on both sides of the suit and in particular at the outset to a malâ fide suitor on the demandants side utter—says the legislator to every man disposed to be a wrongdoer to commit depredation or simple oppression at the charge of any individual marked out by him for his     victim—utter in customary form and quantity a mass of mendacious assertion—if the individual at whose charge it is your desire to inflict wrong in this shape whatsoever it be have after a certain length of time failed to give utterance in a written form to a correspondent mass of assertory matter true or false the wrong it is your desire to commit at his charge shall take effect the mass of the matter of wealth whatever it be which being in his possession it is your wish to get into yours shall accordingly upon your carrying on the appropriate series of operations be placed in your hands or the oppression which in other shapes it may be your wish to see exercised on him shall accordingly be exercised thus pregnant with absurdity and mischief upon an allcomprehensive scale would be this practice—this institution if such it may be called if the facts assumed by it really had place namely the existence of a standard of conformity set up by competent authority and warning given of the practical consequence that would be grounded on want of conformity to such standard—namely the frustration and pro tanto the repeal of the punitive subsidiary or say effectuative law attached by the legislative authority to the principal prohibitive law so much for what in a certain supposed case would have been the state of things but this same state of things what is it in reality answer throughout the whole of the portion of the field of law over which this licence extends its baleful influence the existence of any such standard and consequently of the warning pointing to it is a mere fiction it is for not having done that which to the knowledge of these judges was impossible—the impossibility being of their own creation that the suffering inflicted by the frustration of the legislativemade law is inflicted by them suffering thus inflicted by a judge and that without so much as a pretence of maleficence or delinquency in any shape—on his part in any shape oh yes so it is for whatsoever may have been the expense not to speak of vexation in other shapes experienced by the prosecutor in the course of his endeavours to cause execution and effect to be given to the enactment of the legislature the suffering produced by it is left to rest on his shoulders without compensation while by the delinquent be his maleficence ever so enormous in no shape in addition to the vexation is suffering produced other than by such expense as he is subjected to by the proceedings carried on by him on the occasion and for the purpose of his defence by the legislator orders are given to the judge to inflict punishment on the delinquent this same judge—what does he in consequence in so far as depends upon him the criminal he leaves unpunished securing to him at the sametime whatsoever was the expected profit of his crime—the goods for example abstracted in the way of theft highway robbery or housebreaking on the party in whose breast the suffering was produced by the crime—in spite of the legislator in the very teeth of his ordinance—he heaps additional suffering of insubordination thus exemplified too much there is in the legal system of every civilized country on the face of the globe into the mass of power belonging to the master legislator to which as in duty bound he gives execution and effect this cunning servant contriving everywhere to slip in a portion of power clandestinely to add to his own use a portion of power to which he gives most sure execution and effect to his own use and to his own advantage at the expense of the power of the sovereign and the comfort of the subjectcitizens after the pattern set by romebred law à peine de nullité you see in buonapartes codes—the like in the same language or some other language you may see in other codes and the punishment thus inflicted by the utterance of the word nullité or its equivalent on whom is it inflicted on the guilty author of the injury no not in any instance but on him who in respect of the injury is not only innocent but injured of the suffering produced in the case of the most mischievous crime committed by a man who in common language is aggregated to the allcomprehensive and reproachful denomination of malefactors what is the quantity compared with that produced by the judge with the word nullity or this or that one of its kindred for a pretence thus stands the matter hitherto even in that code of that government the practice of which in this respect is least exposed to reprobation but it is in england and english law that injustice in this shape triumphs and reigns with a degree of flagrancy which leaves the highest of that exemplified in any other country far behind a sportsman who with or without a crown or a judges wig upon his head taking his station within shot of the entrance of a bridge should amuse himself in shooting men and women instead of partridges and hares might serve as the emblem of the judge with the words null and void instead of shot laying low at the command of his caprice the passengers as they presented themselves aiming at them without any other care as to the selection than that of bringing down the party robbed or hurt instead of the malefactor by whom the robbery or the outrage had been committed another exemplification of unauthorized legislation has elsewhere been brought to     view to wit that practised by individuals in the situation of jurymen throughout english law if on the part of any class of public functionaries misconduct in any shape receives a palliation it is by misconduct on the part of the same or some other class of public functionaries thus the veto put as above in individual cases by judges on all laws the most salutary and indispensable receives a sort of palliative and the mischief of it a sort of counteraction and correction in the veto which also in individual cases juries have the power of putting upon mischievous ones weak indeed would be the palliative scanty the compensation were the mischief which an english juryman by his veto has it in his power to prevent no greater than that which an english judge with the words null and void in his mouth has it in his power to propagate but the utmost mischief which the judge is likely to add to the will the power to do on any individual occasion does not go beyond that which is the result of letting loose upon society a murderer or two as when not long ago the man who had cut a childs head off was saved by a judge from punishment because some clerk or other had written in a paper a line or a word which the judge said was a wrong one whereas nothing can be more clear that were it not for the power which juries possess of nullifying amongst other portions of judgemade law that by which all free discussion of the conduct of public functionaries is constituted a crime and as such declared to be and endeavoured to be made punishable the condition of the people of england would long ago have been rendered undistinguishable from that of the people of spain and portugal instead of the child as above suppose the person to whom the amputated head had belonged a king—and suppose as would be the case the name given to the crime to be—not murder as in that case—but treason as to the judge there would be no great apprehension of his granting in this case the licence granted as in that case to the crime not altogether so in the case of the juror to him it might seem that the people would be better off without the king in question in particular or without any king whatsoever than with one and in that persuasion pronouncing the words not guilty he might by perseverance force into the eleven other mouths those same words with the perjury which english piety has added as if for a relish and thus it is that when the corruption of the english government has swelled to such a pitch as to render the whole amount of it a no longer endurable nuisance a few jurors with these two words on their lips have it at their option to accomplish the dissolution of it whereupon sooner or later a new government in some shape or other will take place and be established and as to any other equally bad with the present it is what the most timid need not be apprehensive of seeing that it is not in virtue of the form of government but in spite of the form of government that that measure of felicity whatever it be by which england stands distinguished to its advantage from any other nation is produced in effect the power thus exercised as above by judges jurymen and attorneys clerks has it not a name oh yes—a name it has—and that name is pardon everywhere on the footing on which it stands at present the power thus denominated is a relic of primeval barbarism it is the power of frustrating the declared will of the legislator the folly on which it stands in a monarchy styled limited is different from that on which it stands in an avowedly absolute monarchy in an absolute monarchy in which it is in the single person of the monarch that the whole power of legislation is vested neither in the possession nor in the exercise of the power of pardoning has contradiction in any shape or degree place in the individual occasion in question—in the individual instance in question the will of the sovereign is different from that which has place in all cases without distinction to take away the effect of the law in every future individual instance without exception is altogether at all times in his power and frequently in his practice and in comparison with this how small is the power of pardoning an individual supposing the occasion on which it is exercised ever so improper and the effect of it ever so mischievous very different is the folly on which the case stands when the monarch having no more than a share in the exercise of the legislative power so called has in his own single hand the power of frustrating the effect of any enactment howsoever salutary howsoever necessary to public security how much greater the folly for any legislature to leave the power of frustrating its enactments in the hands of jurors judges and copying clerks         appendix logical arrangements or instruments of invention and discovery employed by jeremy bentham logical arrangements which have served as so many nova organa or instruments of invention or discovery to jeremy bentham in the composition of his several works to enable himself to take a commanding view says bolingbroke of the field of law and legislation there are two principal vantage grounds on which it is necessary for a man to mount viz history and metaphysics the observation is lord bolingbrokes and it has been quoted from him by hume or some other author of the first eminence to that one of the two vantage grounds which is offered by history the road is smooth and flowery—and of those who have ascended to it and taken post upon it there has been no want to that which belongs to the region of metaphysics the road is rugged and full of thorns few are they who have attempted to gain this height and of those few still fewer who have succeeded in reaching it and placing themselves in any such station as hath afforded them any clear and extensive view of the regions stretched out at their feet in the following sketch an enumeration is given of the several monticules which in the course of his travels on the vantage ground of metaphysics—to call it by the name given to it by bolingbroke—or as some would say of logic—were descried by the mind of the author and on which from time to time it has taken its station for the purpose of the surveys it has for different purposes had occasion to take of that extensive field which is occupied below in common by ethics or morals law and legislation if their position merely be regarded—the post they occupy in the intellectual regions—these objects may according to the figure of speech employed by bolingbroke be considered merely as so many stations or restingplaces in that more arduous one of his two vantage grounds if the purposes and uses to which they have been applied be the object of regard there will be a convenience in changing the figure and considering them with lord bacon as so many engines or instruments by the aid of which the different works that have been undertaken have been either accomplished or at least laboured at and attempted in most instances the instrument thus employed by the author was constructed by himself alone—no part having been borrowed from any other hand—in other instances the instrument was found by him in part at least ready made but either enlarged by himself or applied to uses to which it had not been observed by him to have been applied by any one else as often as the hand from which he thus received it could be determined     and recollected mention has been made of it new ideas derived from logic i division of entities into real and fictitious or say division of nounssubstantive into names of real entities and names of fictitious entities— by the division and distinction thus brought to view great is the light thrown upon the whole field of logic and thereby over the whole field of art and science more especially the psychical and thence the ethical or moral branch of science it is for want of a clear conception of this distinction that many an empty name is considered as the representative of a correspondent reality—in a word that mere fictions are in abundance regarded as realities dalembert is the author in whose works the notion of this distinction was first observed by me—être fictif is the expression employed by him for the designation of the sort of object for the designation of which the appellation fictitious entity has ever since been employed in speaking of the faculties of the mind the same distinction will also be found occasionally brought to view in the philosophical works of voltaire by attention to this distinction it is that i was enabled to discover and bring to view in the case of a numerous class of words their incapacity of being expounded by a definition in the ordinary form viz the form per genus et differentiam which form of definition it has with how little success and benefit soever hitherto perhaps universally been the practice to bestow upon them and at the same time to bring to view the only instructive and useful exposition of which the words of this class are susceptible viz the exposition by paraphrasis—the only form of exposition by which the import attached to them is capable of being fixed and at the same time placed in a clear and determinate point of view see in particular the class of political including legal fictitious entities† in respect to which by indication of the relation which the import of the word in question bears in common to the fundamental ideas of pain and pleasure a distinct and fixed meaning is thus given to a numerous tribe of words of which till that time the meaning had been floating in the clouds and blown about by every blast of doctrine—words to the which in the mind of many a writer no assignable ideas no fixed no real import had been annexed ii division of entities real and fictitious together into physical and psychical— by means of this arrangement considerable has been the light thrown upon the field of psychical entities and the origin and formation of language the connexion between the nomenclature of psychical and that of physical entities has been clearly pointed out there is no name of a psychical entity which is not also the name of a physical entity in which capacity alone it must have continued to have been employed long before it was transferred to the field of psychical entities and made to serve in the character of a name of a psychical and that most commonly a fictitious entity iii relations between the import of the word happiness and that of the words pleasure and pain— sole positive element of happiness alias felicity alias wellbeing—pleasures and those determinate ones sole negative element of happiness exemption from pains and those equally determinate ones determinate import thereby given to the word utility a word necessarily employed for conciseness sake in lieu of a phrase more or less protracted in which the presence of pleasures and the absence of pains would be brought to view an action may be considered and spoken of as useful as conducive to general utility in proportion to the value of any pleasures which it is its tendency to produce or of any pains which it is its tendency to avert whether there ever were a time at which the word happiness failed of presenting to my mind the character of an aggregate or compound of which pleasures and the exemption from corresponding pains were the sole elements is more than at present i can recollect the satisfaction i remember to have experienced at the observation of this interpretation as given to it in the first place by helvetius‡ and afterward by hartley∥ affords some presumption of its being at the first of these times new to me but perhaps the cause of that satisfaction was not the novelty of the notion in relation to my own conceptions but the circumstance of seeing the confirmation given to them in these works iv elements or dimensions of value in regard to pleasures and pains— it was from beccarias little treatise on crimes and punishments that i drew as i well remember the first hint of this principle by which the precision and clearness and incontestableness of mathematical calculation are introduced for the first time into the field of morals—a field to which in its own nature they are applicable with a propriety no less incontestable and when once brought     to view manifest than that of physics including its most elevated quarter the field of mathematics the elements or dimensions of value in regard to pleasures and pains are—  intensity   duration these belong to it whether considered as past or as future and of these two taken together its magnitude is composed to these come to be added but in the case only in which it is considered as not yet past—  the certainty or probability of its arrival   its proximity propinquity or remoteness thus far it is considered as confined to the breast of a single individual if considered as seated or capable of being seated in a number of different breasts it is then considered as existing under a fifth dimension viz extent—which extent has for its measure the number of the individuals who are considered as being thus affected—the greater that number the more extensive it is the less the less extensive two other conceivable elements of value remain still to be ascribed to it viz   fecundity   purity of these elements neither it is true can be considered as belonging to the value of a pleasure or a pain when considered by itself in both instances it is considered inasmuch as it is capable of being accompanied or followed by sensations of the same or a different kind if by sensations of the same kind i e if being a pain by a pain—or being a pleasure by a pleasure it be considered as accompanied or followed it may in proportion to the number of such concomitant or consequent sensations be termed fruitful or unfruitful prolific or unprolific—if by sensations of an opposite kind it may in proportion to the number of such concomitant or consequent sensations be termed impure in proportion to the number of those which it escapes or fails being accompanied with pure for bringing to view in a concise form these elements seven in number the following memoriter verses awkward as verses of that class naturally are may for the present serve—   intense long sure not distant fruitful pure   such marks in pleasures and in pains endure   such pleasures seek if private be thy end   if it be public wide let them extend   such pains avoid whichever be thy view   if pains must come let them extend to few less awkward verses i cannot but suppose may one day be found and substituted to these with advantage by some person who is more in use to dress up language in the garb of poetry v extension of the use made of the word matter from the field of physics to the whole field of psychics or psychology including ethics and politics—   in the higher or more general quarter of them viz in the phrases matter of good matter of evil   in the department of law in general and of penal law in particular—matter of satisfaction or compensation matter of punishment matter of reward matter of punishment being neither more nor less than the matter of evil applied to a particular purpose—matter of reward the matter of good applied to one particular purpose—matter of satisfaction the matter of good applied to another particular purpose   in political economy—matter of wealth and its modifications viz the matter of subsistence and the matter of opulence or abundance each of these being neither more nor less than so many modifications of the matter of wealth and in so far as through the medium of exchange interconvertibility as between them has place with no other difference than what corresponds to the difference in the purposes to which that common matter comes to be applied correctness completeness and consistency of the views taken of these large portions of the field of thought and action—conciseness in the sketches made or to be made of them—such are the desirable effects which this locution presented itself as capable of contributing in large proportion to the production of by this means for the first time were brought to view several analogies which have been found of great use in practice—a clearer as well as a more comprehensive view of all these objects having thereby been given than in the nature of the case could or can have been given by any other means the matter of good as to onehalf of it—one of the two modifications of which it is composed—viz the negative—being the same thing as the matter of evil one and the same object—viz pain—having by its presence the effect of evil by its absence or removal the effect of good—the matter of good being in its positive modification composed of pleasures and their respective causes—in its negative modification or form of exemptions i e exemptions from pain and their respective causes in like manner the matter of evil being as to onehalf of it—as to one of the two portions of which it is composed viz the negative—the same thing as the matter of good one and the same object—viz pleasure—having by its presence the effect of good by its absence when considered as the result of loss the effect of evil the matter of evil being in its positive form composed of pains and     their respective causes—in its negative form of losses corresponding to the different species of pleasures capable of being acquired and possessed or lost and their respective causes from this correspondency and interconvertibility a practical result—in the hands of whosoever is able and willing to turn the observation to advantage—is the prevention of excess and waste in the application of both these portions a position which by this means is placed in the clearest and strongest point of view is—that by whatsoever is done in any shape in and by the exercise of the powers of government is so much certain evil done that good may come though the matter of reward and the matter of satisfaction viz for injuries sustained are in themselves so much of the matter of good yet it is only by coercion and that in a quantity proportioned to the extent to which that coercion is applied that the matter of good thus applied can be extracted that when on the score of and in compensation for injury sustained the matter of good is in the character of matter of satisfaction extracted from the author of the injury it operates in and by the whole amount of it in the character of punishment on the person from whom it is extracted and whatsoever may be the quantity of punishment inflicted in this shape in that same proportion is the demand for punishment satisfied and whatsoever may be the amount of it in this shape by so much less is the demand if any that remains for it in any other operating in any such way as to produce on the part of the party operated upon an act or course of conduct adverse in any way upon the whole to the interest of the community in question—ex gr a particular class or district or other division of the political state the whole of the political state in question or mankind at large—the matter of good and evil becomes the matter of corruption it may be either the matter of good or the matter of evil but it is the matter of good that most frequently presents itself in that character the breast in which the matter of corruption is thus operating may be that of any individual at large but the case which affords the most frequent occasion for speaking of the matter of good as operating in this character is that in which the person thus operated upon is regarded as occupying the situation of a trustee—of a trustee whatsoever be the party regarded as the correspondent principal or as the english lawyers say using remnants of an obsolete jargon borrowed from france cestuy que trust whether another individual or assemblage of determinate individuals a subordinate community composed of an assemblage of individuals individually indeterminate or the whole political state to operate in the character of matter of corruption the matter of good and evil requires not to be actually applied by this or that hand in the character of a corrupting hand of itself and without any such application the matter of good and evil especially in the form of good keeps operating in so far as being at the disposal of any individual or assemblage or division of individuals the interest of such parties is adverse to the interest of a greater number of individuals in every political state in the shape of the matter of wealth a quantity more or less considerable of the matter of good and evil lies and a still greater quantity is expected to be at the disposal of the several persons in whose hands the business of the administrative department is lodged in every state in so far as in these same hands the disposal of it is left free it is in the power of these trustees of the public so to dispose of it in favour of other trustees of the public in the other departments of government—viz the legislative and the judicial—as well as to those belonging to that same department the administrative—as to cause them to be subservient to the particular interest of these depositaries of the public stock at the expense of the public at large accordingly in proportion to the quantity of this matter being or expected to be at the disposal of these hands and the facility with which it is capable of being applied to this sinister purpose will be the force with which in the character of the matter of corruption the matter of good and evil will be operating—operating upon all persons according to the degree in which partly by situation partly by disposition they stand exposed to its sinister influence vi good and evil of the first second and third orders i e effects similar or opposite producible in society by the operation of one and the same act at different stages of its progress—effects in some cases homogeneous with reference to each other in other cases heterogeneous are produced in the way of good and evil by the influence of one and the same act in the course of its progress in and through society   in the case of delinquency—effects in the way of good and evil producible by an offence in the first stage comes a portion of the matter of good viz the advantage whether in the shape of pleasure or of exemption from pain the prospect of which was in the character of a motive or inducement the cause of the commission of the pernicious act     at the next stage comes in some cases an effect of an opposite nature—a portion of the matter of evil viz if the pernicious act be of the number of those by which a determinate suffering is produced in the breast of an assignable individual or individuals—here we have one portion of the matter of evil—call this portion the evil of the first order an ulterior and in every respect perfectly distinct lot of evil produced in some cases from the same cause has been termed the evil of the second order it consists partly of the alarm produced in other breasts by the apprehension of finding themselves among the sufferers from other pernicious acts that appear likely to be produced by the individual offence in question in the event of its having been found in its issue favourable to the offender of the mass of evil capable of being produced by an act of delinquency or at any rate by a multitude of acts of delinquency of the same nature that portion which comes in at the third and last stage of its progress is of a sort which under any tolerably wellestablished government is rarely to any considerable extent exemplified it is that which has place in so far as such being the effects of the alarm produced by the apprehension of continually recurring repetitions of the species of injury in question the mischief has from the passive and sensitive faculties of the persons thus threatened extended itself to their active faculties compelling them as it were to render themselves by their own inactivity instruments of their own ruin in that modification of delinquency and injury which is composed of acts of the predatory class may be seen the clearest and strongest exemplification of this case in asia and africa many are the instances in which spots which though situated within the demesne of regular governments and at one time kept accordingly in regular cultivation have successively been to such a degree infested by the predatory incursions of neighbouring tribes as to have at length been abandoned by their inhabitants and left in a state of perfect desolation under any european government instances are scarcely to be met with where in its progress over the community the evil produced by private delinquency has made so great an advance as to have arrived at this third stage unfortunately of evil which having been the result of the misconduct of the rulers themselves has extended itself so far as to make its appearance in the character of an evil of the third order examples are by no means rare   in the case of public punishment i e of evil purposely produced by the powers of government to the end that it may operate in the way of punishment—in the first place comes a portion of the matter of evil but as among the last effects of an act of delinquency was the operating upon the active faculties of the persons in question in such sort as to restrain and prevent them from doing that good to themselves and others which otherwise they would have done so of a lot of evil produced for the purpose of punishment the earliest effect is of the nature of good consisting in this viz that they who otherwise would in the shape in question have done evil to others are by the experience or apprehension of the like evil to themselves restrained and so thus prevented from doing it   in the case of public reward—i e of a portion of the matter of good administered at the expense of government and thence at the expense of the community to the end that in the character of matter of reward it may have the effect of giving birth to public service which in some shape or other is regarded as more than equivalent in value to the expense in the shape of the matter of reward in the first place comes the evil necessarily attendant on the coercive measures employed for the extraction of this precious matter but in the next place comes the good—i e the pleasures—which whether the application made of the matter be well or ill contrived is necessarily produced on the receipt of this precious matter—in which good we see the good which is of the first order and applies itself to the passive and to no other than the passive faculties of the persons to which it applies itself effects of the first order evil as above effect of the second order good—and that of the first order as above pleasure enjoyed by the individual by whom the matter of reward in question has actually been received effect of the third order good and good of the second order—pleasure expectation with the consequent proportionable alacrity in the breasts of all those to whom from observation made of the cause for which and manner in which the matter of reward has been bestowed in this instance it may happen to deduce an expectation of obtaining for themselves from the like service similar reward in return for similar service effect of the fourth order good and that good of the third order active service performed accordingly and here in the last stage we see the application of the precious matter invigorating and exciting the active faculty as in the case of delinquency at the same stage we see the active faculty debilitated and perhaps paralyzed and struck motionless extensive and important are the practical inferences that present themselves as following from this theory   0 in the case of evil the evil of the first order is next to nothing in comparison with the evil of the second order—not to speak of a stage of evil so unfrequently exemplified as the evil of the third order of the four classes into which the whole mass of delinquency may be divided—viz offences against persons individually assignable—offences against a mans own welfare—offences prejudicial to a particular class of persons—offences prejudicial to the whole community at large—in the second of these classes viz offences against a mans self the principal element of the evil of the second order viz the alarm is altogether wanting vii springs of actions—appetites—desires—motives—interests explanation of these psychical fictitious entities of the pathematic class by that connexion which is common to them with pleasures and pains in the several shapes of which they are susceptible viii sanctions or sources of obligation and inducement five in number viz—   the physical sanction   the moral or popular sanction   the political including the legal sanction   the religious sanction   the sanction of sympathy limited in its application to a particular class of cases in so far as the word sanction is employed what is thereby brought to view is not the species of pleasure or pain by the prospect of which the influence on human will is exercised and the effect produced but only the source whence the pleasure and pain in question is expected to flow   in the case of the physical sanction the source or root of the pleasure or pain is in the preestablished nature of things and not in human agency thus in respect of intoxicating liquors in respect of the pain resulting from the drinking of them when pursued to excess the tendency of the force of the physical sanction tends in a certain degree to restrain a man from giving into such excess†   in the case of the moral or popular sanction the source or root of the pleasure or pain regarded as eventually about to have place is in the good or ill offices of mankind at large that is of such of its members to whom the knowledge of the incident or transaction in question may happen to come—viz in the degree of estimation in which on the occasion in question the agent is regarded as likely to be held—or in other words in the opinion good or bad favourable or unfavourable likely to be entertained in relation to him thence in the mental sensations pleasant or unpleasant of which the idea of the act is likely to be productive in his mind—thence in the good or ill offices—in the case of good commonly expressed likewise by the word services popular—for the employing of the word popular as the designation of the sort of sanction here in question what it may be asked is the ground or warrant answer in this consideration viz that the people at large without distinction of persons are the persons at whose hands the good and evil in question are respectively expected the good and evil—viz of the good whatsoever may be the result of the good offices which the people at large freely and without coercion may on the consideration in question respectively feel themselves especially disposed to render—of the evil whatsoever may be the result of such evil offices as the same persons are under and by this and the several other sanctions left free to render to the persons on whose conduct the force of the sanction here in question is considered as applying itself moral—for the employing of the word moral on this same occasion and to this same purpose what is the ground or warrant answer in this consideration—viz that for the performance of such acts positive and negative together as though not sanctioned by the political sanction nor on the occasion in question by all persons considered as sanctioned by the political sanction and yet at the same time are considered as obligatory the moral sanction or the sanction of morality is the term by which the source of the obligation seems commonly to have been designated   in the case of the political including the legal sanction the source or root of the pleasure or pain regarded as eventually about to have place is in the good or ill offices of that portion of mankind in whose hands in the political state in question the powers of government are lodged and who in consequence have at their disposal an unlimited proportion of the matter of good and of the matter of evil capable of being employed and applied at pleasure in the character of matter of reward and matter of punishment the case and the only case in which the adjunct legal is applicable to the sort of sanction here in question is that in which under the authority of the legislative department of government the matter of good and evil is disposed of and applied in the express and declared view of operating in the character or     matter of reward or matter of punishment thereby giving or endeavouring to give direction to those to whom application is actually made of the matter itself or the prospect and expectation of it in this department it is principally to the avowed purpose of giving to mens conduct in the character of subjects that direction by which they are made to abstain from such acts principally positive acts as are treated on the footing of offences principally in consideration of the mischief of which they are regarded as productive or threatening to be productive that the matter of good and evil is applied and that accordingly principally in the shape of matter of punishment but in so far as in the shape of matter of wealth or any other shape it is applied although it be not declaredly in the character of reward or in that of punishment that application is made of it by persons invested with the powers belonging to the administrative department of government the matter of good and evil operates not less in this than in the other case—the matter of good and evil is capable of being made to operate in the character of a sanction in such sort as to give to mens conduct in the character of subjects such direction as whether in the pursuit of those public ends which in that department of government are avowedly the objects of pursuit or in pursuit of the personal or other private ends of those in whose hands the public powers in question are reposed in this case in so far as the ends in pursuit of which the matter of good and evil is administered are of the personal or other private and therefore sinister ends just mentioned it is in the character of matter of corruption that it operates—but how ill soever the design and effect is with which it is thus made to operate towards the giving to mens conduct the direction so endeavoured to be given the effect of which it is productive is not the less the same as where being in the character and under the name of a sanction it is avowedly employed to the giving to mens conduct the sort of direction above mentioned as endeavoured to be given to it when employed in the name and character of matter of punishment or matter of reward by the treasury board under the direction of the first commissioner suppose an office given or promised to be given to a member of parliament for the purpose of engaging him on all occasions to give his vote according to the direction prescribed by that member of the administration department—the sanction by the force of which the direction in question is thus given to the conduct of the functionary in question cannot with propriety be termed the legal sanction but to its being termed the political sanction no objection seems capable of being made   in the case of the religious sanction the source or root of the pleasure or pain regarded as eventually about to have place is in the good or ill offices of an almighty but to man an invisible being in whichsoever state of existence whether the present or the future considered as about to be rendered   lastly in the case of the sanction of sympathy or sympathetic sanction the occasion on which any pleasure or pain appertaining to this sanction is capable of being experienced is when of some act which the person in question has it in contemplation to exercise a consequence about to result is pleasure or pain in any shape as the case may be in the breast of some other person in whose wellbeing the person in question experiences an interest produced by the force of the sympathetic affection in this case in the joint proportion to the force with which this affection operates in his breast added to the magnitude of the pleasure or pain which is regarded by him as about to result to the object of this his affection in the event of his exercising the act in question is the force with which by this sanction he is urged to exercise or to forbear to exercise such act—to exercise it in so far as it appears likely to be productive of pleasure or an equivalent good to forbear exercising it in so far as it appears likely to be productive of pain or an equivalent evil appears likely to be the result of it in this case the pleasure or pain by the idea and contemplation of which human conduct is operated upon and liable to be determined being the immediate result of the conduct of the person in question produced and regarded as about to be eventually produced without the intervention of any exterior will—of any will exterior to his own—it follows that when considered in this point of view this sanction falls within the description of the physical sanction but between these two cases the difference seemed considerable enough to indicate the propriety of representing the conduct in question as being in the two cases the result of two different sanctions—so great is the difference between selfregarding and sympathetic affection—between the case where the pleasure or pain by the consideration of which a mans conduct is determined is his own purely and immediately and the case when it is his own no otherwise than in consequence of a correspondent pleasure or pain being regarded as experienced or about to be experienced by another person—between the case where the pleasure or the pain is his own purely and directly and the case in which it comes to him no otherwise than as it were by reflection and through the medium of a portion of pleasure or pain of a different nature regarded as having place in another breast     taken in the aggregate the four preceding sanctions may with reference and in contradistinction to this sanction—to the sympathetic sanction—be termed purely selfregarding ones the influence of the sympathetic sanction—i e of the pleasures and pains belonging to this sanction—corresponds to and is coextensive with that of all the purely selfregarding ones a person dear to me presents himself to my conception as suffering or eventually about to be made to suffer pain by the love i bear to him i am impelled to do what may be in my power towards relieving or exempting him from it that pain may be a pain inflicted by the power of any one of those four sanctions or an evil composed of so many distinguishable pains inflicted by the powers of every one of them take for example the habit of drunkenness by that habit it may happen to the same man to be subjected to bodily suffering in a great variety of forms all comprehended under the general denomination of ill health—here we have the pain of the physical sanction it may happen to him to be exposed to public shame and by that means to sink in the esteem of his friends and his acquaintances—here we have the pain of the popular or moral sanction it may happen to him to lose some office more or less lucrative or honourable of which he is in possession or expectation—here we have the pain of the political sanction either for the scandal of the exposure or for some injuries done to individuals or other excesses committed in some paroxysms produced by intoxication it may happen to him to be subjected to punishment at the hands of the law—here we have the pain of the legal branch of the political sanction it may happen to him to be tormented with apprehension of punishment about to be administered to him by the hands of the almighty in a life to come—here we have the pain of the religious sanction that in comparison with the several other moral forces to which the name of sanction has here been given the force here termed the sympathetic sanction is in general very weak is not to be denied but for the omitting it from the list of sanctions this weakness were it greater than it is would not afford any sufficient warrant of itself i e without assistance from any of the other sanctions it is every now and then seen productive of very considerable effects it is to the force of this sanction that the principle of utility understand of general utility stands indebted for whatsoever reception it meets with other than that which it may happen to any other articles in the list of sanctions to be instrumental in procuring for it under the guidance of the principle of utility it operates in alliance with the several other sanctions under the same guidance it may not unfrequently be seen operating in opposition to them and checking them in those sinister courses of maleficence into which in opposition to the dictates of general utility they are all of them more or less apt to be led by the political sanction whether under its own guidance or under the guidance of the religious sanction equally steady and efficient in its action with any of those selfregarding sanctions it cannot be said to be but a force howsoever weak and unsteady is still not the less a force and were it not for the operation of this sanction no small portion of the good physical and moral which has place in human affairs would be an effect without a cause in exact proportion to the efficiency of this principle would be the error committed by him who on the occasion of any calculation made of the result of the moral forces on the sum or balance of which an effect depends the production or prevention of which had become the object of human endeavour should leave out of his calculation the operation of this cause origin of the theory of the five sanctions in speaking of law viz the internal law of any political state internal i say in contradistinction to international blackstone by whom it is by an appellative not very appropriate termed municipal after puffendorf and others divides it into four parts one of which he terms the sanction or sanctionative part the sanction or sanctions of law is accordingly an expression of not unfrequent occurrence so likewise the sanction or sanctions of religion and accordingly this or that portion is spoken of as being confirmed by or having received the sanction of law or the sanction of religion but as to that which as above is here termed the popular or moral sanction i have no recollection general or particular of ever having seen it employed to the sanction termed political and employed in contradistinction to the legal sanction viz in so far as the whole of anything stands distinguished from a part of it the same observation may also be extended in fine so may it to the physical and the sympathetic for in relation to all these several sources of action two things have as above and it is hoped not unsatisfactorily been shown—viz that they are each of them distinct from all the rest and that they are all of them what they are here termed sources of action viz motives or sets of motives derived in each of these five instances from so many different sources to which may be added that each of them is according to circumstances susceptible of such a degree of force as may prove sufficient perhaps even the     weakest of them to enable it to overpower any one or more of the rest i e to give determination to human conduct even while all those others are operating in opposition to it ix conditions requisite for the accomplishment of any object in so far as depends upon human means— qualifications both of them necessary and together sufficient on the part of the agent or agents in question for the due accomplishment of any object whatsoever and in particular for the due discharge of every political obligation and thence for the due execution of every public trust—appropriate will and appropriate power power is either power ab extra or power ab intra power ab extra is correspondent to and its efficiency proportionate to the extent and degree of compliance on the part of those over whom it is considered as being said to be exercised power ab intra will be in proportion to the degree of relative or appropriate knowledge and the degree of appropriate active talent on the part of him by whom the exercise of it comes to be made in so far as operation or cooperation towards the accomplishment of the object is considered as matter of duty or moral obligation to possess the appropriate will or inclination is to possess the virtue of probity—relative probity and when put in contrast and contradistinction with this requisite state of the will appropriate knowledge has been termed intelligence wisdom probity and power—of these three on attending blackstones lectures and afterwards reading them when in print under the name of commentaries on the laws of england i observed the concurrent existence laid down by him as conditions necessary to and at the same time sufficient to insure in any given political community the existence of good government with reference to government in the highest stations—and in these alone are these conditions and qualifications brought to view by blackstone—neither by him is anything done to show the relation borne to each other as above by these associated fictitious entities or towards satisfying the reader that the division thus exhibited is of the exhaustive kind with the help of such amendments as seemed requisite the enumeration and division appeared to me capable of being with equal propriety and utility applied in the political line to all subordinate stations in the next place to the accomplishment of any object whatsoever in the ascending or more comprehensive line x obligation and right— explanation of these moral including political fictitious entities and of their relation to one another by showing how they are constituted by the expectation of eventual good and evil i e of pleasures and pains or both as the case may be to be administered by the force of one or more of the five sanctions as above viz the physical the popular or moral the political including the legal the religious and the sympathetic of either the word obligation or the word right if regarded as flowing from any other source the sound is mere sound without import or notion by which real existence in any shape is attributed to the things thus signified or no better than an effusion of ipse dixitism xi proper ends of the distributive branch of law— ends or purposes the fulfilment or accomplishment of which this branch of law ought to have for its principal objects—security subsistence abundance and equality in the mention made of security a tacit but necessary reference is made to the several classes of injuries against individuals other than the man himself to which every individual stands exposed security is security against mischief—against evil from whatever quarter it may happen to it to come and against whatsoever of a mans possessions or vulnerable part of a mans frame it may happen to it to be directed or to strike on this occasion the great difficulty consists in tracing the lines of distinction by which these several factitious entities are separated from each other subsistence and abundance have one and the same matter—the matter of wealth of security that same matter is itself a main instrument and means whereby all other instruments of security may be obtained in the case both of subsistence and abundance over the relation they bear to security there is some obscurity security has several branches—as many branches as there are distinguishable objects exposed to deterioration or destruction and in the list of these objects are comprised that matter the matter of wealth which is common to subsistence and abundance—security against mischief to human life person reputation property i e the matter of wealth considered as lodged in the hands of the individuals or assemblages of individuals in question and condition in life security is again divisible into as many branches as there are different sorts of offences or pernicious acts by which pro tanto security is destroyed or endangered all these objects are with relation to each other so many antagonizing forces in some instances by the measure by which one is attained so are one or more of the others     in other instances one cannot be attained or endeavoured to be attained but by the relinquishment or pro tanto the sacrifice of one or more of the others equality in particular finds in each of the other three a rival and an antagonist—and in security and subsistence rivals and antagonists of which the claims are of a superior order and to which on pain of universal destruction in which itself will be involved it must be obliged to yield in a word it is not equality itself but only a tendency towards equality after all the others are provided for that on the part of the ruling and other members of the community is the proper object of endeavour at the same time in proportion as the subject is inquired into it will be found that in all good systems of law and even in all systems the very worst not excepted more or less regard is paid to equality that in the aggregate of the body of laws in every state all these others are constantly aimed at are the objects of constant care solicitude and active operation and that in fact the laws have no other objects or ends in view but which short as it is are comprehended in this list and that in all bodies of law the great and constant difficulty is on each occasion in so far as the competition has place to decide to which of them the greatest portion of favour is due—for which in preference to the rest provision is to be made these things considered of the ends or objects of the distributive branch of the law how with propriety could any list more or less ample differently composed have been given xii formation of an uniform and mutually correspondent set of terms for the several modifications of which the creation extinction and transfer of subjects of possession whether considered as sources of benefit or as sources of burthen are susceptible—and thence of a mutually connected and correspondent cluster of offences consisting of the several possible modes of dealing as above with such subjects of possession in the case in which they are considered as wrongful and as such prohibited by statute law or considered and treated as prohibited by judiciary alias judgemade law   collation   ablation in the case and at the point of time at which the subjectmatter is for the first time brought into existence collation has place without ablation if it be already in existence then collation and ablation have place together and of their union translation is the result in so far as ablation has place without collation then not translation but extinction is the result performed in favour of the collator himself collation is selfcollation—if regarded as wrongful it is wrongful selfcollation or in one word usurpation is the name by which it has been and at any time may be designated performed by the ablator himself ablation is abdication—if by the laws regarded or treated as wrongful—wrongful abdication is accordingly the name by which it may be designated xiii division of offences—by which is meant all such acts as on the score of their reputed mischievousness are fit or have been or are likely to be regarded as fit to be—viz by the application of punishment—converted into offences—from the consideration of the person or persons with reference to whom in the first instance they are regarded as being or likely to be mischievous into offences against others—i e regarded as prejudicial to others and offences against a mans self—i e regarded as prejudicial to a mans self division of offences regarded as prejudicial to others into offences against assignable individuals alias private offences—offences against the unassignable individuals belonging to this or that class or this or that local district alias semipublic offences—and offences against the unassignable individuals of whom is composed the population of the whole political state from the distinction thus brought to view have been deduced diverse conclusions of no inconsiderable importance with reference to practice—offences so far as the mischief if any which they have for their result is confined to the author of the offence are no fit objects of controul by punishment and penal laws of the offence which in this case is regarded as mischievous—the mischief if any being by the supposition confined to the offender himself—the consequence is that no sooner is it felt—viz by him the offender—than by the whole amount of it it operates upon him in the character of so much punishment division of offences into positive and negative or rather observation made that in the nature of the case for every offence committed by a positive act there is room for a correspondent offence committed by a negative act the case of a positive offence that where the mischief of the offence as above has for its cause a positive act—an act of commission the case of a negative offence that in which the mischief has for its cause a negative act—an act of omission an act which consists in a mans omitting to do that which it was in his power to do towards the prevention of a mischief which for want of such positive and preventive act on his part either actually did take place or at any rate would have taken place but for some preventive     obstacle in the application of which he had not any share the principle of division here brought to view extends itself over the whole field of delinquency—be the positive act what it may—the opposite negative act is alike conceivable—is alike capable of being exemplified if in the case of the positive act any mischief seem to flow the correspondent negative act can never be altogether unproductive of the like consequence as to the difference between the mischief of the one and of the other it consists altogether of the mischief of the second order for as to the mischief of the first order if it have place in both cases it is exactly the same in both cases but in the case of the negative offence the mischief of the second order—the alarm and the danger—is next to nothing on the part of the offender all endeavours to prevent the mischief which in the instance in question was actually produced were wanting true but it follows not that he will at any time employ any exertions in the endeavour to produce a similar mischief in respect of punishment cases there are in which under the laws perhaps of all civilized nations the negative act is put exactly upon the same footing as the positive act in these cases for example viz when one person having another in his power keeps him without sustenance till he dies—by a mother or nurse a newborn child—a jailor one or more of his prisoners in respect of punishment the negative course of conduct of which in these cases loss of life is the result is commonly put upon a footing little if any thing different from that which has place where the mischief has for its cause a positive act so in case of a design hostile to the person or power of the sovereign or this or that member of the sovereignty in a state the negative offence which in the case of a person by whom the existence of the design is known is committed by omission to give information of it to the competent authorities is commonly punished not perhaps with exactly the same punishment as that which is appointed for him by whom an active part is taken in that same design but yet with some other punishment which does not fall much short of it wheresoever the obligation considered as imposed by the law is of a positive nature the only sort of offence which the nature of the case renders possible is of the negative kind and in this whole class of cases the concomitancy of the two forms of delinquency fails the sort of offence commissible by nonpayment of taxes may serve by way of example but in every other case little has been the notice as yet taken of it xiv ends of political economy— these are the same as those of the distributive branch of law wherein then lies the difference answer in so far as political economy is the object so it is that to two of those objects viz subsistence and abundance a more particular and direct attention is paid than either to security or to equality by distributive law is declared what on as many occasions as shall happen to have been taken into view shall be each mans own by political economy is endeavoured to be ascertained how far and for what particular purposes chiefly for the general purposes of abundance and subsistence i e security for subsistence the use which otherwise under distributive law each man might make of his own shall for the more effectual fulfilment of these several ends be directed and restricted xv limits applied to the quantity and productions of industry by the quantity of the necessary instruments of production which at the place in question—at the time in question are in existence these instruments are—   the aggregate mass of existing capital   the aggregate mass of capacity for labour that no end can be successfully pursued to any point beyond the productive power of the aggregate mass of means of all sorts necessary to the pursuit and attainment of it is a selfevident not to say an identical proposition any proposition inconsistent with it would be a contradiction in terms yet from this theoretical aphorism follow divers practical inferences which though they will scarcely be found to admit of denial have found great difficulty in obtaining assent         equity dispatch court proposal containing a plan for the speedy and unexpensive termination of the suits now depending in equity courts with the form of a petition and some account of a proposed bill for that purpose by jeremy bentham bencher of lincolns inn originally published in    0         question by whom is it necessary or may be of use that cognizance should be taken of the proposed law reform system in general and these pages in particular answer by the persons here following—   equity suitors desirous of the relief promised by it   persons at large desirous of seeing law reform at large   in particular persons at large desirous of seeing established the system of local judicatories with a view to which the institution of the dispatch court with the system of procedure for the application of it is proposed as a measure of experiment   more particularly still members of parliament desirous of seeing produced these same results or any of them section i purpose explained jeremy bentham to the honest and afflicted among equity suitors fellow countrymen and fellow countrywomen   to convince you of your affliction words would be thrown away feelings afford but too sufficient proof that which you have need of is relief and to put you in the way—the only way—of obtaining it is the object and business of this address   you the honest—you the afflicted—to you alone is it made—from you alone can that information and cooperation which are necessary be looked for by honest i mean of course those who are such in relation to the suits in which they are respectively embarked to define the two classes and at the same time to draw the line between them—a line and that a clear one—a few words may suffice honest and afflicted those who to the plan which you will see presently give their consent dishonest and afflicters those who refuse it for by the plan as you will see minutes of continuance are substituted to many years shillings of expense to hundreds or thousands of pounds probability of right decision not lessened but increased by the same system of simplicity by which existence is given to the saving in delay and expense   instrument of relief what—course to be taken by you for the obtaining it what—these are the heads of the matter which i have to submit to your consideration accompanied by the offer which you will see of my gratuitous services such as they are towards the accomplishment of this great purpose   first as to the instrument of relief for presenting it to your view—a general idea of it—here too a few words may suffice   mode of procedure the summary—substituted to the selfstyled regular with a judicatory of a species correspondently simple substituted to that complicated diversified entangled extortious and purposely dilatory system of judicature by which your affliction is produced   regular procedure otherwise called technical technical from the greek meaning artificial originally in a good sense but in this case from the employment given to it now in a bad sense the distinctive character of it being the employment it gives to artifice in substituting expensiveness to frugality delay to dispatch misdecision or nondecision where decision is due to right decision—all for the sake of the profit extractible from the extraexpense   judicatories in which the regular is in use for example the westminsterhall courts and in particular those which are the scenes of your torment the so miscalled equity courts as likewise the no less miscalled courts christian alias spiritual courts alias ecclesiastical courts   judicatories in which summary procedure is in use—the smalldebt judicatories called courts of requests and courts of conscience—those held by justices of the peace when acting singly or otherwise than in general sessions—those held by bankruptcy commissioners add to these courts martial and committees of either house  00 of parliament when employed in the elicitation of evidence   secondly as to the course to be taken by you for the obtainment of this same instrument of relief for this purpose i must begin with bringing to your view the authorities the cooperation of which will be necessary—these are—  parliament   king acting separately   house of commons acting separately parliament by the requisite enactments king by his commissions given to judge—say the dispatch court judge and his subordinates house of commons—eventually by the elicitation as you will see of some eventually necessary evidence—over and above all which there can be any adequate assurance of your being able to give respectively for the purpose of enabling the judge to determine in relation to each one of your several suits whether it be so circumstanced as that his authority is capable of being employed in it to advantage  0—i first as to the enactments and the bill containing them in the texture of a draught for that purpose which will presently be brought to your view you will see besides the enactments examples where they presented themselves as necessary or useful for the explanation of them reasons for the explanation as well as justification of them and instructions to the judge where in each individual case—to enable him to do justice by the adaptation of his decrees to each individual case—the liberty allowed by such instructions may be necessary instead of the obligation imposed by a set of general and indiscriminating enactments applying alike to mutually different cases such as require mutually different orders and decrees for which cases accordingly one and the same enactment could not so well serve a draught of this texture is one of the subjectmatters of the offer which you will see ii next as to the distinct cooperation necessary on the part of the king for the obtainment of it as also for the obtainment of his concurrence in the act of parliament a petition from such of you as are repectively desirous of this relief will as you will see be necessary a draught composed of the proposed tenor of such petition is another matter of the offer which you will see iii now then to enable the king and his advisers to judge whether the change will be beneficial upon the whole as well as whether you are respectively desirous of it as also to enable the judge in relation to the suits in which you are respectively engaged to satisfy himself beforehand whether it will be for your advantage that he should take cognizance of it—information under various heads from yourselves and for the reasons that you will see presently generally speaking not from your lawyers will be necessary but for this lastmentioned purpose all the information you will be able to give as to the state of the suit will not in the instance of every suit be sufficient and where it is not to give completeness to it the authority of the house of commons applied to the solicitors in the several suits and employed in the elicitation of the particulars of them may for the information of the judge be necessary of the heads of such information you will presently see a list the receipt of as much as can be received by me of this body of information and the making use of it for the purpose of the bill is another of the subjectmatters of the offer which you will see now as to some further details respecting the proposed instrument of your deliverance and the course to be taken by you for the obtainment of it and the putting it to use the plan i have formed for this is as follows—   that if necessary to calm the apprehension of those on whom it depends the duration of the change so to be effected be but temporary say for example for three years unless at or before the expiration of that time made perpetual or continued   that instead of being chosen by the recommendation of some person or other whose emoluments and power might by the administration of such relief be more or less reduced—the judge be chosen by you—the persons for whom it is intended   that the mode employed for the manifestation of this choice be—the ordinary mode in use in elections—by ballot to exclude danger of offence   that the title to vote be constituted by a written instrument presented to the returning officer that instrument being the duplicate of a petition to the king which had been delivered in at the proper office praying his majestys concurrence as above in relation to the several suits in the event of the passing of the act that is to say by his commission given to the judge so elected that petition being signed by parties one or more who are desirous of seeing such transference made so signed and thereupon exhibited by a party signing or by some person employed by a party signing as agent for that purpose   that the petitions so presented and exhibited be composed all of them of a printed paper of the same tenor each of them containing in manuscript a description of the circumstances of the individual person and the individual suit in question under the hereinaftermentioned heads   that for the purpose of enabling the judge to determine within himself in relation to each suit whether the advantage of the parties—or of such of them at the  0  least whose object is the attainment of the ends of justice would upon the whole be promoted by the transference of the suit to his cognizance as well as to perform as per no   the examination of the solicitors—you do each of you annex to such his petition information in relation to the suit under those same heads in so far as he is able   that for the purpose of completing as far as may be relative to each suit the body of information under these same heads for the use of the judge—a committee at the motion for example of the mover of the bill be appointed with power to examine as per no   the solicitor or solicitors one or more in each of the several suits then in pendency and in particular in the suits here in question as likewise in relation to any suit in which no party has preferred any such petition to ascertain what the cause is why no such petition has been presented   that in relation to each suit of which he sees reason to take cognizance the judge do proceed by calling before him at the outset the solicitor or solicitors for the purpose of learning the state in which the suit is and the documents the inspection and possession of which is necessary to the giving due determination to it   that forasmuch as by every suit thus taken out of their hands the interest of all the several lawyers official as well as professional—professional at least inasmuch as no indemnity can be awarded to them—cannot but suffer detriment on which account opposition to the transference and resentment towards the suitors known or suspected to be sharers in the endeavour to obtain it will on the part of the generality of them if they be as other men are be a natural not to say necessary consequence which resentment their relative situation will afford them the means but too ample for carrying into effect to the injury of the suitors in all degrees up to that of utter ruin—all requisite measures be taken for keeping from all such and other adversaries in relation to each such petition all knowledge and even suspicion of the fact that on the occasion of that same suit measures have by the suitors or any of them been taken for the obtainment of the relief contemplated  0 that of the saving of loss so severe to you the many loss to any amount to that portion of the comparatively few in question should be an inseparable consequence is a matter of undeniably just regret but such is the condition of human affairs nor from this consideration can any defensible reason for omitting to administer the relief be deduced    true it is that if the obtainment of the relief were a certain consequence of the application for it no such secrecy would be needful but too true it is no such certainty has place    not a man will give his name to such a petition this is what was said to me said to me and by whom by a man who to a sincere desire to see the measure take effect adds as complete an acquaintance with all the circumstances requisite to the formation of a correct opinion on this subject as the soundest judgment applied to adequate opportunites can give but this was immediately upon the first mention of the proposed petition and before the provision made for the requisite concealment had been mentioned to him which mentioned he joined with me in being satisfied with its adequacy and the bill in the state it was in had received not only the most cordial good wishes but the most unreserved approbation    if it were necessary that the delivery of the petitions at the office should be performed before the passing of the act your desire to be rescued from the gripe of your tormentors might be known to them before you had such an assurance as you would be capable of receiving as to the being rescued from it but in such delivery there would be no use unless and until the act were passed in which case as you have seen it would be necessary to the purpose of the election of the judge in that event and at that time true it is that it could not but be liable to be known to them and even in that event to no one of you could it be matter of perfect certainty that his case would be of the number of those of which it would in the eyes of the judge be of advantage to justice that he should take cognizance but of these same precautions you will hereafter see such a description that no such apprehension will have place in more than a small proportion of your whole number and by declining to take part in the election they will have it in their power to exempt themselves from it of that case a sufficient description will be seen in the hereinafter account given of the bill    in the event of the passing of the act in such strength will the protecting power of the eye of public opinion be bent upon the whole scene that by the most timidminded suitor scarcely could any apprehension be felt capable of deterring him from taking his chance for so unexpected and consolatory a benefit    a state of things that will probably he not unfrequently exemplified is this—though all parties concur in interest and probable wishes yet no more than one may have seen this address or be so situated as to be capable of being made to see it with the degree of speed desirable and desired  0  for the concurrence of no person so circumstanced it should seem need any petition wait    a state of things calling indubitably for this result and frequently exemplified is this—persons there are one or more whose names must in compliance with legal forms have had place in some of the proceedings of the suit—but in whose case they having no interest in the event of it the concern they have with it will not be known to a party whose desire it is to see applied to it the here proposed change    if and when such dispatch court shall have been established—the judge instead of the king will be the person to whom the petition for the cognizance to be taken by him will be to be presented by all persons desirous of seeing their suits thus transferred   now for the offer i have to make to you drawing the petition drawing the bill finding a member adequate to the task of moving for it securing for it able supporters in the house—all this is done already   remains for the secrecy the security which i promise you and the description of which will presently here follow the offer you will each of you consider as addressed to himself   by a letter addressed to me inserting on the cover the words on the dispatch court apply at the westminster review office no   wellington street for a copy of the petition which immediately follows whatsoever be the number of the parties one and the same copy will suffice for all of them of the price the regulations of the stamp office are said to inhibit the mention in this place   this copy or some other each party or set of parties will return to the private office or shop with the signature or signatures of the party or parties intending to present the petition to the government office—this copy with the answers made to the queries or say heads which you will see inserted in §   of this for the purpose of eliciting the information hereinbefore spoken of as requisite   should the bill pass—in that case and in that case only you will apply again to the abovementioned private office and obtain another copy for the purpose of its being delivered at the government office with the manuscript part as above transcribed from the first copy in such manner as to render the second an exact duplicate of it   a third copy letterpress and manuscript together will be requisite for the purpose of serving at the abovementioned election of the judge as proof to the returning officer of your right to vote   if and when the number of the suits so petitioned for is in the opinion of the proposed mover of the bill sufficient to produce the requisite share of attention in the house—in that case and in that case alone will the motion be made   for this purpose an account of the filledup petitions received will be kept at the private office as above and each day will be put up and kept hanging in a place in which it will be conspicuous to passengers it will be composed of a paper printed in placard letters with manuscript characters exhibiting the number of such copies received on the foregoing day and the total number received up to that day on that same paper should any occurrence have taken place of which it might be of use that you should be informed indication will be made of it   when your determination to take part in the business is taken the sooner you give effect to it the better for the greater the number of you the greater will be the probability that your wishes will be accomplished and the greater the number known to have concurred the greater the encouragement afforded to all persons who are in the same sad case  0 moreover in the bill will be found a clause that among those who belong to the same class in respect to degree of aptitude of their cases for the reception of the relief the case of each persons suit shall come on for hearing antecedently to the cases of all suits the petitions for which were not received till a day posterior to that on which his was received and that in the case in which several petitions have been received on one and the same day the order of preaudience shall be determined by lot    to each one of the unhappy suitors who on the ground of a pretended contempt are immured by equity in the fleet prison all these copies will be delivered gratis    on the same terms copies would be delivered to every proposed petitioner who would give me adequate assurance that his circumstances would not afford the expense—were it not that i have been assured by a competentlyinformed and judicious friend that in that case demands would rain in upon me in intolerable number that is to say—partly from dishonest persons thus seeking to obtain copies for the purpose of selling them partly from dishonest suitors for the purpose of exhausting the stock obstructing the plans and punishing the originator for having originated it    however if any member of parliament whose name will of course as such afford an adequate security against abuse will for this purpose apply himself to me as above mentioning the name of the suit  0  and the name of the suitor for whom and at whose desire he applies the three copies shall be delivered to him on the same gratuitous terms    when your petition is delivering in at the government office request of the person to whom it is delivered proof of the fact of such delivery by his attestation written on the copy so delivered in as likewise on the copy reserved by you for the purpose of the election as above should the making of these entries or either of them be declined at the office—an event against which how improbable soever the requisite provision must not be omitted you will do well to enter on both copies in the same words a memorandum of such refusal but before the making of such memorandum you will do well to apply at the office with some trustworthy person in quality of witness to give his attestation to such your unavailing endeavours    as to what depends on myself towards the preservation of the abovementioned secrecy—it is not without regret that i consider and acknowledge that the nature of the case affords not as far as i can see any better assurance than my name promises if to you any additional security presents itself state it to me and the requisite attention shall be paid to it my way is—if on any occasion i see reason to regard myself as being an object of suspicion—if i am even expressly told as much—no offence do i take much less do i as some on an occasion of this sort do betake myself to blustering such being the natural and ordinary resource of a person in whose instance a suspicion is well grounded but join cheerfully in contributing what depends on me towards the removal of the suspicion and quieting the anxiety of which i am the cause not but that were it my desire to do injury it would be in my power so to do to individuals in number more or less considerable without frustrating my plan in regard to the rest but being thought to be what i am thought to be my hope and belief is that there are not many persons in whose eyes the danger such as it is will be formidable enough to prevent their taking their chance for the relief    to a member of parliament as being prepared to move for the bill allusion has been made already a man of the first rate for talents and influence stands pledged to me for the rendering you that service no session no day will be wasted no moving resolutions or a preparatory committee or committees for the elicitation of evidence to form a ground for it a motion for a committee will follow whether the leave be granted or refused for the resolutions if it be refused no exertion no effort which affords were it ever so slight a chance for your relief will be shrunk from so long as life remains in the hand that moves this pen    some account of this same bill forms the matter of the third section of these pages section ii equity suitors petition for dispatch court to the kings most excellent majesty— the petition of the undersigned persons all of them suitors in one or other of your majestys equity courts humbly showeth   that in common with the rest of your majestys english subjects but in a more especial degree we feel ourselves sorely aggrieved by the delay expense and vexation by which obstruction is opposed to applications for justice in the superior courts in general and above all in the courts called equity courts   that this obstruction is the result not of the natural state of things nor yet of any misconduct with which the functionaries of justice in these our times are especially chargeable but of that mode of remuneration for judicial service which the rude state of society in the early ages perhaps necessitated   that this grievance though at all times so constant in existence and operation in judicial practice—has at all times stood prohibited by an express law and that the law styled by preeminence magna charta—the very law which stands first in the statutebook and has at all times been regarded and spoken of as the cornerstone of that constitution by which the government of your majestys kingdom has at all times been so highly distinguished to its advantage from all other monarchies   that by the said statute it is declared in express words as follows nulli differemus nulli vendemus nulli negabimus justitiam—we will not delay we will not sell we will not deny justice to any one   that in direct contravention of an ordinance and promise thus clear and express—justice in your majestys equity courts has at all times by artificial devices been delayed to all without exception sold to the comparatively few who have been able to pay the extortious price at all times put upon it to which unhappy number belong we whose names are hereunto subscribed and utterly denied to all who have been unable to come up to that price to which last class belong the vast majority of your majestys english subjects not to speak of others   that for some generations in and by your majestys courts of justice two essentially  0  different forms modes or courses of judicial procedure have been carried on and acted under the one called the regular the other the summary the regular mode having been almost the whole of it the work of a set of judges who all the time have acknowledged and declared themselves incompetent to make law the summary the work of the only legislature of these your majestys realms—the king lords and commons in parliament assembled   that this course of procedure—the only one which has its foundation in acknowledged law—not only in the nature of it shuts an effectual door against all factitious delay expense and vexation but is in a superior degree not to say exclusively calculated to ensure rectitude of decision and is accordingly not a mere makeshift but the only course really adapted to the purpose of giving execution and effect to that main part of the body of the law to which it is intended to give execution and effect—in a word to the attainment of the ends of justice   that the giving to us your majestys subjects in all cases the benefit of this exclusively apt course of procedure would necessitate the revival of that allcomprehensive system of local judicatories which had place in the days of our saxon ancestors and which though traces of it still remain became virtually extinguished by means of the norman conquest and though ultimately if administered as it ought to be and might be and substituted to the present so inadequate system of judicatories the aggregate expense would even be reduced by it—yet in the first instance a very considerable expense would be an indispensable preliminary to it   that antecedently to the disbursement of that extra expense—an institution which if practicable would of course be highly desirable is—one by which the effects of the substitution of the summary system of procedure when substituted to the equity mode which is the most oppressive of all the modes of the regular system might be rendered matter of experience which experience obtained either the supposed improvement will be shown to be impracticable or a sufficient warrant will be given for the expense necessary to the making a general application of it  0 that we have seen a work published under the title of justice and codification petitions by jeremy bentham in which by the name of the dispatch court a description is given of a judicatory by means of which an effectual trial might be made of the proposed summary system with very inconsiderable expense and without any arrangement produced in the case of any suit other than the several individual suits in which application will have been expressly made of it    that under the existing system the interest of men of law being for the most part so unhappily and to no small extent irreconcileably adverse to that of the rest of your majestys subjects—the interest of men of law in general but more especially of those among whom your majesty would have to make choice of a judge for the proposed new court and of those by whose advice and on whose recommendation such choice would in ordinary course have to be made—we cannot consistently with observation made of the universallyregulating principle of human action entertain any the least hope of a successful issue to the proposed experiment if the choice in this respect were made without some deviation from that same ordinary course    that a course however there is by which—in a mode universally familiar and approved—a choice satisfactory to us and fully competent to the purpose might be made without prejudice to your majestys undisputed and indisputable royal prerogative—and without other sacrifice than such of which precedents in abundance are already in existence    that accordingly by the  th and  0th of king william the third chapter the   th access to justice is provided by means of judges who under the name of arbitrators are chosen by the sole will of suitors without any commission from or cognizance of such choice taken by the sovereign of this realm and to the decrees of the occasional judges thus chosen is the force of law accordingly given though in a very inadequate manner and to a very inadequate extent owing to the adverse interest and irresistible power of the permanent judges of the superior courts    that in like manner at divers times and in divers places originally under the name of courts of requests and thereafter under the name of courts of conscience courts officiating by the like summary course of procedure have—each of them—by a statute made and enacted for the purpose been established and that in the instance of none of them in the choice or appointment of persons therein officiating as judges has any part been given to be borne by your majesty or any of your majestys royal predecessors    that confiding in your majestys paternal goodness and praying as by these presents we humbly but earnestly do pray that in the appointment of a judge of the herebyproposed dispatch court the choice may in the first instance in this case as in that of an arbitration court as above be made by suitors—we desire not to exempt such choice from the controul of your majestys  0  paternal hand on the contrary it is our humble request that as often as made any such choice shall be made subject to disallowance by your majestys royal negative    that accordingly we further pray that it may please your majesty to issue your majestys royal proclamation—declaring—that if and so soon as it shall have pleased your majesty in parliament to institute a court of the description above mentioned with powers necessary and requisite for the giving execution and effect to the institution thereby established your majesty will be graciously pleased to appoint a place at which we the undersigned and such other persons as may have successively added their respective signatures may assemble and then and there in the way of ballot make choice of a person to be appointed to that office and under and by virtue of your majestys royal commission to act under and give execution and effect to the powers thereof subject however to your majestys undisputed and indisputable royal negative upon any person at any time so elected    that in the humble hope of such your majestys gracious and compassionate compliances we your majestys afflicted subjects have hereunto subscribed our respective names residences and conditions in life in respect of marriage prefixing in each instance the names of the suits in which we are suitors as likewise the names of all the several other suitors in such suit and on which side thereof respectively as far as known to us witness our hands— section iii dispatch court bill—some account of it   the bill may be considered as divisible into two parts in part the first is contained the matter belonging to the necessary new judicatory in the other part the matter belonging to the so well known but to suits of the description in question so newly applied course of procedure   of part the first heads under which the matter will be distributed are the following—   § i judge located how   ii judges remuneration   iii registrar   iv eleemosynary advocate   v deputes to judge and registrar   vi judges powers exemptions and checks   vii prehensor and his deputes   viii consignees   ix grounds of decision   x suits comparative suitableness   xi auxiliary judges if needed   xii sittings times of   of part the second the matter is distributed into sections under the heads following—   § i examination of solicitors   ii preaudience by lot   iii initiatory examination of parties   iv appropriate intercourse constant and universal secured   v mutual security for appropriate forthcomingness of things and persons secured   vi nonlitigants attendance secured   vii subsequential evidence elicited   viii equity court costs disposed of   ix dispatch court costs disposed of   x execution how performed   xi suit how terminated   xii eventual retrotransference of suits not terminable within time   xiii expense of the court how provided for   in the bill itself—as between judicatory and procedure the formation of the instrument by which the work was to be done was the object which had the best claim it was thought to precedence but in the account here to be given of it for the information of the proposed petitioners conception it is thought will be assisted by bringing to view the work itself—the system—for the application of which the official hands are to be employed—before bringing to view those same hands with the powers given to them for the purpose of the employment § i examination of solicitors   or   purpose of this examination obtaining as to the nature of the several suits such insight as will enable the judge to see which of them afford the best promise of being dispatched within the length of time provisionally allotted for the duration of this experimental system and with subordinates in no greater number than that to which frugality appears to prescribe the limitation of it § ii preaudience by lot   or   having by the lights afforded by the information contained in the answers made to the queries inserted in the several petitions constitutive of the titles to the votes at the election by which he was seated—together with the result of the examination of the several solicitors—obtained such insight into the nature of the several suits and the progress made in them as may have enabled him to distribute them into classes with a view to preaudience what shall the judge do in relation to this point as between individual  0  and individual in the same class answer as to days first come first served all suitors whose petitions were sent into the private office on a monday heard before all those whose petitions were not sent in till the tuesday and so on—a premium this for promptitude as to those which were sent in on the same day let chance determine reason choice admits of undue partiality chance does not whenever choice presents no advantage it is a rule with me both in legislation and judicature to employ chance which possesses this advantage § iii initiatory examination of parties   or   the suit with the documents belonging to it being taken out of the hands of the judges of the equity courts by the dispatch court judge in consequence of the lights obtained by the examination of solicitors as above—and notice being given to the parties or such of them in the instance of whom such attendance is at once needful and practicable—you will thereupon find yourselves in the presence of your adversary or adversaries—or in the case of an amicable suit of the parties jointly interested with you—all of you at the same time in the presence and under the orders of the judge   or   instead of the five years and upwards—which at the commencement of the suit it would have been in the power of a dishonest defendant to cause to elapse before an effectual answer had been given by him to the demand made upon him for his evidence—you will now have the advantage if you are on the plaintiffs side of receiving all the evidence at that same hearing extractible from him in support of your demand—and either the evidence itself or information of the evidence which he looks to employ in his defence against such your demand if the side you are on is the defendants side your advantage will be—that of furnishing the judge thus early with reasons why he ought to put an end to the expense and vexation under which you are suffering   or   whatever answers a party examined on your behalf gives you may follow up your first question by further questions arising out of such his answers and so on toties quoties and thus you will obtain a much greater probability of eliciting all the evidence which it would be of use to elicit from him than you could obtain from him at a distance in the way of epistolary correspondence as in the equity court practice  0 or   on this occasion—according to the stage at which the suit is arrived you will possess the means of putting an end to or anticipating any measures which in consequence of the opposition of the interest of your solicitors and your several other agents—might otherwise have been taken for giving further increase to the expense and delay of the suit for the sake of the profit extractible by them out of the expense and in this endeavour the judge—his interest having as you will see in the judiciary part of the bill been made the same as yours—will not only assist you but if and so far as needful anticipate you    or   and now as to probability of rectitude of decision on the part of the judge over and above the saving in respect of expense and delay—you see already what advantage this natural and familiar mode of procedure will give you—in comparison with the unnatural technical and lengthy mode devised and supported under the existing system for the sake of the profit extractible out of the expense § iv appropriate intercourse constant and universal secured    or   in no more than a comparatively small number of instances will it be possible to give termination to the suit at this first hearing in the other instances further hearings one or more will be necessary by the dispatch court bill every person whether party or witness who comes upon the stage is before his departure laid under the obligation of giving information of some mode of addressing letters to him which in the course of the letter post may be sure to reach him at a foreknown time so long as the suit lasts changing the information upon any and every change of residence thus is put the extinguisher upon all chicaneries about notice prodigious is the mass of expense delay and injustice against which the door is shut by this arrangement see in the petition for justice—title blind fixation of times for judicial operations vol v p   0 § v mutual security for appropriate forthcomingness of things and persons secured    or   namely—of things whether in the characters of articles of value and as such subjects of the contestation or in that of sources of evidence of persons whether in the character of persons under guardianship—as in the case of wives children and prisoners for the benefit of those same persons—or in the character of sources of evidence or as in the case of defendants for the purpose of their being compelled to contribute by disclosure to the forthcomingness of things or persons for either of the just mentioned purposes    or   for actual forthcomingness provision is made in part i judiciary under the head of prehensors and deputes messengers    or   security for forthcomingness whether of things or persons for the purpose of eventual compensation or punishment in  0  case of wrong—this security if given to both sides is serviceable to both sides and conducive to justice it is accordingly under the proposed system given to both sides of all possible modes of affording this security—power is given to the judge to employ in each case that or those by which to all parties taken together the least quantity of inconvenience will be produced    or   harshness and inefficiency—these opposite defects with the addition of complexity dilatoriness and expensiveness all in the extremes—such are the vices by which the practice of the equity courts has been shown to be polluted see petition for justice—and from which the proposed practice of the dispatch court may be seen to be pure § vi subsequential evidence elicitation    or   the evidence with the elicitation of which the suit commences is elicited in the justicechamber by word of mouth as above of ulterior evidence—the source whether it be a person or a thing may be at any distance upon the distance it may depend—whether it will be for your advantage that the dispatch court judge should take cognizance of your suit where the evidence is at a distance it will depend upon circumstances—whether to employ the word of mouth mode or to save the delay and expense of travelling the mode by letters or say the epistolary mode    or   by the dispatch court either the word of mouth mode or the epistolary mode will be employed instead of the secret mode which under the existing equity system now in use is employed upon all persons but defendants—and even upon them in some cases that is to say after they have been examined by the bill in the epistolary mode in this same secret mode the examination is performed by interrogatories as the phrase is by a clerk instead of the judge    or   for the flagrant inaptitude of the examination by interrogatories as it is called as if it were not by interrogatories that all examination is performed see the rationale of evidence § vii  viii equity costs and dispatch court costs  0 or   trifling in comparison will have been the dispatch court costs grievous to the amount which you all feel those of the equity courts under whose gripe you are suffering imperfect would be the provision made for doing you justice if such provision as the circumstances of your adversaries admitted of were not made for reimbursement of the whole loss to which by selfconscious injustice you have been subjected for substituting humiliation to the triumph over you which had been promised to itself by premeditated injustice by the dispatch court such provision will be made accordingly as to all such costs as it finds disbursed or incurred in the equity court    or   as to the dispatch court costs the aggregate of them will on this occasion require to be distinguished into two branches the first will be composed of all those the burthen of which will be prevented from pressing on the shoulders of suitors—those children of affliction on whom after all possible alleviation made the pressure will remain so deplorably heavy—by being laid upon the people at large who without being loaded with this burthen enjoy all the benefits which law affords—the other branch will be composed of those which are not susceptible of so desirable a distinction    or   to the first branch belong those which are necessitated by the remuneration and equipment of the public functionaries as to which see in the part which relates to the judiciary the seven first sections and in particular section   prehensor and deputes messengers and section   consignees    or   to the other branch belong those costs which are necessitated by the elicitation of evidence for this purpose the whole mass of evidence which on this occasion can require to be elicited may be distinguished into that part the source of which is situated within the local field of the jurisdiction given to the dispatch court—namely the metropolis and its vicinity—and that part which is not thus fortunately situated    or   in regard to this home part as it may be called the expense of elicitation will not be considerable enough to be on this occasion worth bringing to view the oral being the mode in which of course the elicitation will be performed    or   remains that which may be called the foreign part as to this the holder of it—is he is he not to the purpose of securing the forthcomingness the verity and the sufficiency of it—in any effectual way within the power of the dispatch court within its power—that is to say by the prehensibility of his person or his property including not only things corporeal moveable or immoveable but things incorporeal or as they are termed rights    or   if the evidenceholder is thus desirably situated then will come to be considered whether the elicitation of it is capable of being performed with advantage to justice upon the whole including probability of right information and thence of right decision on the one hand and saving of expense and delay on the other hand if yes it will be so performed accordingly if not there remains only the oral mode in which way the elicitation can no otherwise be performed than by  0  some person or persons invested with judicial authority for this purpose such persons are under the existing system styled commissioners their commission a commission for examining witnesses abroad    or   a recent case has just been stated to me—an equity case—the particulars of which i could have to produce—in which the expense of this commission had amounted to about £ 000 let any one imagine—supposing the judge to have sufficient hold upon the individual as above—to how trifling an amount comparatively speaking the expense in this case might have been reduced by substitution of the epistolary mode—the mode of which that by bill and answer in equity court practice might afford an example supposing it not poisoned by the irrelevant mendacious and other worse than useless matter with the factitious delay by that and other instruments manufactured    or   but in this case by whom asks an equity lawyer shall the oath be administered—i answer—by nobody for the uselessness and mischievousness of that ceremony see the petitions for justice vol v p     by the preliminary examination of the solicitor as per section i will these particulars have been elicited and from them will the judge determine whether it will or will not upon the whole be for the advantage of the parties that he should take cognizance of the suit as to the points on which this examination will be performed see the concluding section of this proposal § ix execution how performed    or   of those powers in relation to things and persons the exercise given to which is antecedently to the termination of the suit provisional and but temporary—the exercise given at the termination of the suit for the purpose of executing the judges ultimate decrees in relation to it will be made definitive compare with this simplicity—you who are able—the infinite diversification—needlessly uselessly and so much worse than uselessly—employed under the existing equity system § x eventual retrotransference of suits not terminable within time  0 or   the dispatch court being but a measure of experiment—the duration of the powers of the judge and the other functionaries must accordingly be limited but sad would be your case if after having been taken out of the hands of the equity court judges and being proceeded upon by the dispatch court judge—the suits were sent back to those same tardy and rapacious hands—a calamity to which it might be doomed for example by nonforthcomingness on the part of any necessary piece of evidence provision against this contingency is accordingly made—see as to this matter part i judicatory section    auxiliary judges if needed—auxiliary judges and accountants § xi expense of the court how provided for

consequence duty regularly violated and all the sufferings resulting from the violations of the duty produced  0     or   one is—where the quantity of the remuneration keeps pace with the number of the operations performed or charged for as if performed and the number or length of the written instruments manufactured or charged for as if manufactured say where payment is made by the job or in one word jobwork such is the form in which according to the general rule under the existing system remuneration is allowed to be exacted by lawyers official and professional by professional lawyers by whom in the nature of the case it cannot be received in any other mode by official lawyers by whom it not only is capable of being but actually is in addition received in the mode of salary of which presently    or   the other mode in which interest is placed in opposition to duty is—that in which the quantity of the remuneration keeps pace with the length of time occupied or presumed to be occupied in the performance of the duty it being at the same time in the power of the functionary to give increase to this same length  0 or   instances in which in the case of official lawyers it has place are afforded by the functionaries following—i masters in chancery number of them  0 ii masters by a recent institution located in the equity side of the exchequer court   iii bankruptcy commissioners number of them  0—permanent judges all the above iv commissioners for elicitation of evidence under equity court procedure in country causes v barristers employed as arbitrators at sittings and assizes in virtue of the necessity created by the flagrant impracticability of jury trial in so large a proportion of the cases in which employment is given to it c c not to speak of cases in which the business being in its nature but temporary—it cannot under the existing system be practicable to employ any other than this same temporary mode such for example as that of the commissioners for the settlement of the nabob of arcots debts and that of various sets of commissioners for inquiring into the state of practice in various departments for the purpose real or pretended of legislative reform or improvement    or   on the other hand two modes there are in which alone remuneration is capable of being applied in such sort as not to place in a state of opposition to duty    or   one is—that in which the whole of the functionarys applicable time being engaged for is actually applied to the performance of the duty such vacation time excepted as is allowed for private business and recreation this is the mode exemplified in so far as the form of salary is the form given to it with fixation or limitation on the diminution side of the number of the days in the year and of the hours in the day required to be occupied in the actual performance of the duty or in readiness to make such performance in the event of its being called for    or   the other is—where the duty consists in the making distribution of a mass of property among a number of colitigants or other coapplicants with or without the previous formation of that same mass by collection of the matter of which it is composed—and the payment is allotted in the shape of a percentage upon the sums received by each demandant adequate provision being at the same time made against precipitation for the purpose of giving acceleration to the time of the receipt of such remuneration by dispatch given to the business for which it is bestowed    or   this accordingly is the form herein proposed to be given to it in the cases in which the duty is that appointed to be performed by an auxiliary judge located for the purpose whether for a time certain or for the particular occasion by the principal dispatch court judge in a case of the justmentioned description examples are—  distribution of the matter of a mass of government annuities or of shares in joint stock annuities   distribution of the matter of a mass of property which is first to be formed by previous collection for instance of a person deceased among his creditors genealogical representatives and legatees or of the property of a bankrupt or other insolvent § iii registrar    or   of the sort of functionary thus denominated the function—the duty—consists in the making and keeping of the permanent signs of all sorts the principal of which are written instruments with accounts of every material operation performed by functionaries and suitors upon or in relation to others in that branch to which he belongs of the department to which he belongs    or   under the existing system—of the produce of the most material operation performed namely the elicitation of the evidence in the commonlaw courts no such account generally speaking is kept in the equity courts generally speaking the product of the operation is preserved witness bills and answers and depositions elicited by interrogatories    or   under the existing system—no authentic account is kept or taken of what is said by judges for judges are the hands by which the practice has been created and so long as man is man to men in power it will be an object—not to maximize but to minimize their responsibility in respect of the exercise given to their trust    or   under the hereproposed system registration having among its objects the opposite result—to the duty of this functionary   0 the correspondent extent is accordingly allotted    or   for a mode of producing for so many various destinations eight or more copies by the same hand at one and the same time—a most ingenious and effective mode styled the manifold mode—see the petition for justice and see vol v p  0  § iv eleemosynary advocate  0 or   some of you my friends—alas but too many of you—the hereproposed transfer will find in a state of indigence of indigence absolute or at least relative some having by the equity suit been found in that state others put into it    or   under the existing system the judges when they have found you in or put you into this unhappy state punish you for the crime of having been so dealt with by them upon your failing to pay those fees which they require and of which the payment is impossible to you they inform you that you hold them in contempt this is the justification they make for thus dealing by you thus it is—that with the utmost regularity under this regular system the impoverished and the afflicted are among the chosen subjects of the depredation and oppression which they exercise accordingly when a debtor has been incarcerated by them for not being able to pay further fees to them in addition to the debt and to the former fees by the exaction of which they have prevented him from so doing—he is kept in jail by them for not having wherewithal to pay to the jailor a fee for being let out a fee from which a judge by whom for this purpose the jailor was placed in such his situation reaps accordingly the proportionate benefit and to procure this benefit to the judge the public is eventually loaded with the further expense of keeping the victim for an indefinite multitude of ulterior years    or   of this statement that which under the proposed system you will experience is as far as it can be made the opposite for assistance in so far as needed by you in support of your demand or defence as the case may be—it provides this functionary whose remuneration is provided for at the expense of the whole community of which you are the afflicted members    thus much as to the costs of the judiciary establishment as to those of the course of procedure you have seen what is said in part ii ix dispatch court costs c part ii sect    § v deputes namely of judge registrar and eleemosynary advocate    or   under the existing system scarce any judge has his occasional substitute    or   under the hereproposed system the provision made is as it were elastic according to the occasion it stretches itself and contracts itself it fits every state of things like the fabled boots which fitted themselves to every leg    or   from scottish practice name and function of depute are both borrowed but the application made of the names is different in scottish practice as the sheriff never acts the so styled depute is in fact the principal by him are appointed substitutes one or more who answer to the hereproposed deputes    or   in english practice—namely in the administration department—a paid principal with an unpaid substitute is not without an example by    geo iii c    §   it is declared to be lawful for the vicetreasurer of ireland to appoint any person to be his deputy to act during his absence or incapacity from sickness and that all acts done by such deputy shall be as good and valid to all intents and purposes as if they were done by such vicetreasurer in his own proper person and moreover that such vicetreasurer shall be answerable and responsible for all acts done by such deputy in the execution of the duty of his office    or   in the hereproposed judicatory to the depute no actual emolument will accordingly be given for if it were the judge principal if he were a man would for the benefit of the patronage add depute to depute without stint as in bankruptcy judicature commissioner has been added to commissioner    or   nor yet will the measure of labour and the number of labourers needful be otherwise than full for by the prospect of the pecuniary part of the remuneration will be formed the eventual part of his inducement for acceptance and by the power and dignity inseparable from his office the actual and constantly concomitant part of it—all without addition in any shape to the public burthen  0 or   at the same time like the thames in the poets picture of it it is without overflowing that it will be thus full for as the number increases the probability of succeeding to the pecuniary part of it will in all eyes decrease and thus in each ones eyes the prospect of succeeding will in that same proportion decrease in value the consequence is—that if deputes more in number than work can be found for are called for by the principal the call will cease to find labourers to answer to it    or   nor is the provision thus made much less effectual for appropriate aptitude than for cheapness and sufficiency for of that qualification—as in every other service     so in this—a strongly operative cause and thence presumptive proof is relish and of relish length of continuance in practice    or   for completing the security against deficiency without detriment to economy one arrangement remains if work more than there are workmen for remains undone because deputes are in number so great as to stop the value of the office in the eyes of all duly qualified candidates—then will be the time for an appointment to be made by competent authority of an additional principal thus—as in a watch the appropriate quantity of velocity—the appropriate quantity of judgepower is provided for and regulated by antagonizing springs    or  0 and so in the case of the other functionaries—the registrar and the eleemosynary advocate and the prehensor of whom in § vii § vi judges powers—exemptions—checks    or   under the existing system may be seen—on the one hand inadequate power on the other hand inadequate checks in the here proposed system—on the one hand adequate powers with necessary exemptions on the other hand adequate checks both in hitherto unexampled force    or   by the powerful and influential among the existing fraternity of lawyers with few and casual exceptions both will of course be cried out against—the strength and efficiency of the powers—because while by the opposite deficiency the power to do good to the public is lessened the power to do good to themselves at the expense of the public is not lessened the checks—because to the so complete irresistibility impunity and irresponsibility at present enjoyed by judges liability to punishment in case of delinquency is here substituted and thus an example in their eyes evil will be set and held forth to public view    or   as to those same powers and exemptions on the one hand those same checks on the other—with the enumeration and delineation of them in detail i will not attempt to trouble you in the bill they will come before you in the meantime you will probably without much difficulty give me credit for the adequate observation and enumeration of them    or   one however there is—the importance and efficiency of which on the one hand with the novelty and formidableness on the other concur in calling for some mention of it thus early for the purpose of obviating the objections which in any mind may be so apt to oppose themselves to it this is the selfextensive power boundless and accordingly dangerous in the extreme as if taken by itself it would by this its very denomination be even acknowledged to be—it will on further view be seen to be by appropriate checks bereft of all its natural dangerousness the teeth of the viper drawn out nothing but the salubrious flesh left remaining power of disallowance—instantaneous disallowance at any time is not only reserved to parliament but given to king lords and commons—exercisable by each one of the three authorities without need of concurrence on the part of any other    or   far indeed from faint was you see the call for this arrangement applied to the purpose of frustrating the proposed institution—on the parts of the existing functionaries always supposing them to be human beings all that can be done by human ingenuity strengthened by long practice was of course to be looked for and provided against    or   for the obtainment of power to sell the liberty of every man to every man who would pay for it the price set upon it by himself—the vender—hale—lord chief justice hale—president of the gods of lawyers idolatry—and really the very best of them—scrupled not to wage war with his brethren of the other bench with wilful lies for weapons object of depredation no more than a scrap of jurisdiction employed in making arrest for debt from any other man in any correspondent situation what is not the resistance to be provided against when as in this so vast and undefined a proportion of the emolument is at stake § vii prehensor and deputes  0 or   in the proposed bill is shown the need there is of three different sorts of functionaries—prehensors messengers and consignees for carrying on the necessary intercourse between the judge on the one part and things and persons on the other    or   also—that while in the several cases of judge registrar and eleemosynary advocate it is expedient that whatsoever deputes have place should be located by the respective principals—in the case of a prehensor—after one or two located by the principal—for others in whatsoever number they may come to be necessary to no person can this function be intrusted other than the judge § viii consignees    or   under this head it is shown—how by means of the summary procedure system—by examination of the parties themselves at the outset of the suit the nature of every part of a debtors property being—each distinguishable portion of it—brought to view—the sort of hands best qualified for taking charge of it will thereby at that same time be brought to view and to these same fittest hands it may—each portion of     it—at a comparatively inconsiderable expense be thus disposed of to the greatest possible advantage    or   this course being pursued done away will be the three abominations—the bailing system as carried on under the present practice the bankruptcy system and the insolvency system and by these means the property of a person who is not able to pay the whole of his debts will be divided in equal proportions among his creditors instead of being as at present in the case of bankruptcy shared among the lawyers in vast proportion and in the case of insolvency almost the whole of it between the lawyers and the confidential friends of the insolvent among these for their use and his as he and they can agree    or   in the case of the business of holding to bail as carried on under the regular system according the present practice the benefit of the change is no less applicable to the case of common law suitors than to yours but as it is by your case that this application of it was suggested it is for your information that it is thus for the first time brought and held up to view § ix grounds of decision    or   prepare here for another outcry enter now for perforce i must present it to you the disappointment preventive or say nondisappointment principle why thus present it to you answer because of all the decisions which my dispatch court judge will have to pronounce this will in almost all cases constitute either the sole ground or if principles more than one have application to the case the main ground because of every part of the rule of action which has property for its subjectmatter—civil branch and penal branch taken together—this next to the greatest happiness principle is the main foundation because in the genealogy of human feelings this is the immediate lineal descendant of that same parent principle    or   which is there of you all that does not know that disappointment has for its inseparable accompaniment a pain a pain—the intensity of which where money or moneysworth is the subjectmatter is in the direct ratio of the value of it in his eyes and in the inverse ratio of his affluence    or   reader whoever you are—in relation to anything you look upon as being yours—a coat for example that you are in expectation of from the tailors—put to yourself and make answer to two questions question the first—would it not be matter of more or less uneasiness to you to learn that it had been stolen from you or taken from you by somebody under the notion of his having a right to it question the second—looking at any other man does the thought that the coat which he has on his back will be kept by him and not given to you occasion any such uneasiness assuredly not well then here you have that which on the ground of reason is the main foundation of the law of property in both its branches—civil branch and penal yes on all great occasions in all high places and more particularly in the highest—in houses honourable and right honourable this it is that men mean if they mean anything—this is what they appeal to though till now no name has there been to call it by when they appeal to the first principles of justice or to give to the ground its utmost strength every principle of justice    or   this being the case it is shown that for the dispatch of suits in which it is your misfortune to be embarked—no regard need be paid or ought to be paid to any rules on which in the courts in which you are respectively undergoing plunderage the proceedings have been grounded for that no decision can be more decidedly in contradiction to any one of those rules than in instances in vast abundance those same rules are to one another and that accordingly a much better chance for the prevention of disappointment will be obtained by aiming at that object immediately than by aiming at it through so unconducive and in every respect unapt a medium as that which is composed of those same rules    or   that in the employment thus given to a new standard of reference not so much as the weak and stale objection of innovation can with truth be applied for—if for the overruling the disposition made of property by the equity courts a new rule of action with a correspondent system of procedure is employed in and by the proposed dispatch court—the equity courts will receive no other treatment than they themselves in their origin gave and thenceforward have always been giving to the commonlaw courts  0 or   were it even true which it is not that of reference made to the nondisappointment principle to the disregard of all the sostyled established rules decision relatively wrong would in each case be the result—still upon the whole good not evil would be the result for by the system of procedure proposed to be employed more evil will be done away with than by the misdecision would be produced more evil namely the suffering produced by the delay vexation and expense    or   that to obviate a class of phrases by which the relief proposed to be given to you would not fail to be opposed by your plunderers and oppressors namely that the consequence would be—the shaking of foundation violation of vested rights and so forth—still     meaning if anything neither more nor less than the production of disappointment with the suffering attached to it—to obviate i say these objections—an enactment that would certainly be effectual and might perhaps be advisable is—that in all suits in which you are not parties the complicated rules such as they are shall continue to be observed and that accordingly in no one of such suits shall reference be ever made to any rule of the dispatch court system which is in opposition to any one that at the day of the institution of this same court can be found established by the existing equity court system established that is to say in so far as two rules that are the direct opposites of one another can with truth be said—both of them—to be established in the bill reference will be found made to some of those same sets of mutually conflicting rules § x suits—their respective suitableness to this purpose    or   questions of all the proposable suits—to which if to any is it inapplicable among those to which it is inapplicable are there any and what to which by any apt additament it might be rendered applicable    or   answers these—suits to which it will not be applicable are those in which the existence is perceived of an indispensably necessary piece of evidence—such that by no means which the dispatch court is in possession of can it be rendered likely to be forthcoming within the time proposed to be allotted for the continuance of this judicatory true but by the giving perpetuity to it in the first instance this bar to its suitableness would be effectually removed    or   suits to which though otherwise inapplicable it might be rendered applicable by an additament are complex suits additament the institution of auxiliary judges as to which see the next section—section xi auxiliary judges for complex suits    or   to all suits not contained within one or other of these descriptions—it will be simply and completely applicable    or   to suits of the abovementioned descriptions respectively present themselves as called for the following explanations as to suits disqualified by nonforthcomingness of evidence this circumstance depends not on the nature of the demand it constitutes not any particular class of suits it is what may have place in the case of any individual suit of any class    or   in regard to your suit proposed petitioner whoever you are—antecedently to your having any trouble other than that of making appropriate communication in answer to this invitation it will be ascertained—whether or no it will be for your advantage to give ultimate acceptance to it ascertained that is to say by the examination to which your solicitor will have been subjected by the dispatch court judge    or   as to these same complex suits—the complexity has for its main cause—the multitude of the suits or say demands which have to be disposed of and thence the multitude of the several simple suits which in virtue of and in the course of this one may eventually have to be disposed of    or   this complexity may have had one or both of two principal causes—  multitude of the individuals or bodies of men among whom an already formed mass of property may have to be distributed demandants the several claimants   multitude of the individuals or bodies of men from whom the several portions of the matter of the aggregate may have to be collected and the aggregate thus to be formed demandant or demandants some one person or set of persons on whom this right has devolved  0 or   take for examples these they may be seen rising one above another in the scale of complexity    or  0 i suits in the course of which a mass of government annuities may have to be disposed of among claimants and other persons interested in any number

management—among a multitude of trustees under the abovementioned name of consigness all operating at the same time and making a correspondent defalcation from the mass of delay each of them specially apt for the management of the subjectmatter committed to his charge instead of their being—the whole number of these how differently soever circumstanced portions—committed indiscriminately to the

experimental judicatory under the name of the court of dispatch for exemplifying in practice the manner in which the proposed summary may be substituted to the so called regular system of procedure and for clearing away by the experiment the arrear of business in the equity courts now first published from the mss of jeremy bentham   0 editors note the ensuing work was the last upon which its author was engaged his career was closed whilst he was employed upon it the manuscript was left in a very unfinished state and some imperfections will still be observed which under other circumstances would have been removed it is not deemed necessary to point these out more particularly the subject is mentioned only that they may not be considered as having been overlooked the work was written at different periods in         0 and      and the authors original plans appear to have undergone some modifications thus in consequence of the expected petitions for the institution of the court not being presented new arrangements were necessary a note on this subject will be found at the commencement of the tenth section the eight first sections of the bill were sent to press and prepared for publication by the author himself some additional matter has however since been found and inserted and some minor alterations have been introduced from notes made by him at later periods in the dispatch court proposal sect iii see p  0  is a list of the sections proposed to be comprised in the bill in some respects the author deviated from this list certain of the titles were subsequently altered by him and two entirely new sections were added namely sect xiii definitions still imperfect and sect xviii evidenceprocuring money how provided the two supplementary sections—xxv bankruptcy and insolvency and xxvi henceforward dispatch court—are also new not being included in that list the dispatch court was designed as an experiment in the first instance of temporary duration the period of that duration although alluded to sect ii art     as intended to be limited is nowhere fixed the work throughout bears reference to the authors procedure code and should be taken in connexion with that work london   th march          preface summary procedure or regular procedure that is the question to regular substitute summary procedure everywhere seldom has change so important been found expressible in so few words the regular mode being found loaded with the mass of factitious expense delay and vexation—that everybody sees and feels—the summary altogether clear of it—why then not substitute to the regular the summary mode at once the good being so palpable and so undeniable if any evil there be that would result from it upon you the objector it lies to set it forth is it that by the substitution ultimate justice would be rendered less likely to be the result this then it lies upon you to show but this is what you never can do the contrary i am prepared to show on any occasion whatsoever take any one of the several operations by the performance of which and instruments by the exhibition of which it is that the regular procedure is characterized and distinguished from the summary—i am prepared to show the mischievousness of it how it contributes to needless delay expense and vexation how it obstructs instead of contributes to rectitude of decision and the giving execution and effect to the provisions made by the main branch of the body of law here then and in the compass of a single page the question is decided—decided in every mind which is not closed against the light of truth by sinister interest interestbegotten prejudice custombegotten prejudice or authoritybegotten prejudice in the present state of the law all those who are to a certain degree opulent behold it in their power to divest of any part or the whole of their property all those who are relatively indigent the instrument which in one sense of the word offers itself for this purpose is an equity suit the instruments which in another sense of the word join in this offer are the equity lawyers that this state of things should continue as long as the human race continues is not in the nature of man and things—so intolerable to human feelings will be sooner or later the mass of misery produced by it so shocking and disgusting the demoralization in the eyes of all men of common honesty becoming as it will be more and more so in proportion as the form of government receives that improvement which while these lines are writing is so happily progressing if by the constituted authorities whatsoever at the time in question it may happen to them to be an end be not put to such a scene of misery and vice this grievance will of itself suffice to cause the then existing form of government to be changed to some other in which the official situations shall be occupied by men in relation to whom a general assurance has place of their determination to substitute to the system of procedure which has for its object the promotion of the prosperity of the lawyer tribe and their partners in iniquity a system which has for its object the promotion of the prosperity of all besides by the fulfilment of the ends of justice to say that the change so expressed will be made is to say that amongst other things the existing equity courts will be abolished and the suits at that time in their hands will be transferred to other judicatories having for the ends of their procedure the ends of justice in other words proceeding in the natural—that is to say the summary—mode instead of the existing technical mode the present work is designed as an instrument for the purpose of effecting this change in the composition of whatsoever discourse has the effect of law two operations are in the very nature of the case of necessity conjoined—the initiative and the consummative the consummative cannot be the work of any other hand than that of the supreme authority of the state but for the initiative no individual is there in the human race to whom the nature of the case does not lay open a chance for the performance of it—a chance the probability of which will be in proportion to his aptitude for this chance the author of these pages is the first to put in this comfort it is not in the power of sinister interest clothed in authority to take from him in this assurance is contained the certainty that sooner or later the present draft will be taken into consideration it consists of a system of arrangements by which an experiment will be made on a small scale of summary procedure a system of petitioning     being the machinery employed in the introduction of it in two cases this machinery will not have to be employed—i if the rulers do the work without it willingly   if unwillingly in either case what regards the machinery will be useless but it will not render useless any other part an alreadypublished work is the equity dispatch court proposal its object producing the requisite number of petitions by equity suitors framed under the expectation of the accession of this number were the eight first sections inclusive as well as some other subsequent portions before the rest was finished such accession was become hopeless but by this change no reason was afforded for losing the labour employed on the parts that remain applicable that which is believed to have been the cause of this nonaccession was on the part of the suitors dread of the equity lawyers but for that it is not in the nature of the case that any relatively honest substitution of a system in which delay and expense are minimized for one in which they are maximized should have failed to be accepted for clearing off the arrears in the equity courts a talk has every now and then had place at the bar—a talk of a set of commissioners—number precedent would of course say three mode of procedure what of course the accustomed simile according to the french proverb employing ink to bleach ebony learned gentlemen in whose eyes this mode of decision finds favour would they substitute minutes of delay to years shillings of expense to scores or hundreds of pounds decision none but on the merits to decision sometimes on sometimes off the merits they know better things among equity lawyers procedure by affidavitevidence goes by the name of summary what a libel on the only honest mode call affidavitevidenceelicitation summary—as well might you call arsenic sugar—yes sugar of lead to the arrangement thus proposed two propositions present themselves one is that it is not likely to be found capable of being carried into effect the other is that if carried into effect its doing more harm than good is at least not less likely than its doing more good than harm as to its not being likely to be carried into effect—on every occasion the main consideration if not the sole one is it need not be said the convenience—that is the interest—of the influential ones among the lawyers as to that of the million if it be in any degree an object of consideration it is but a secondary one in regard to judgepower—a term the meaning of which if not understood by itself will be understood by all who understand that of horsepower—a notorious subject of complaint is the deficiency of it already any such fresh commission would either be composed or not composed of judges if composed of judges the deficiency of that same judgepower would be enhanced and the correspondent evil increased if not of readymade judges then would there be to be made a new batch of judges to be put over the heads of the existing ones—a sort of scandal in a high degree offensive to that dignity in comparison with which the interest of suitors shrinks into insignificance the arrear extinguished then would the soanomalouslyelevated judges fall back into the condition of barristers were not pensions of retreat the panacea for all the pains that are felt by those whose feelings are of any importance and in the case of these representatives of and substitutes to the lord high chancellor the weight of this panacea would not be a trifle fearful of this descent the probability is that those the first located would continue in office all their lives long and be followed by a neverending train of successors the cause remaining so would the effect as in a meadow while the first crop was cleared off another would be coming on the superior commonlaw courts inquiry commission has had two effects—staving off the actual application of all remedy—of all even inadequate—of all so much as palliative remedy—and the giving increase to the quantity and value of the mass of patronage the ensuing proposed law with its accompaniments has two purposes purposes intimately connected but at the same time perfectly distinguishable one is—and that the main and ultimate one—assuming the inaptitude of the existing system of procedure with the judicial system occupied in the application of it to demonstrate by an appropriate experiment the aptitude of a different one the arrangements for which are accordingly exhibited in the form of a parliamentary bill the use of the experiment is to prove at a small expense the usefulness and adequacy of an institution which could not in its entirety be established but at an expense the magnitude of which might without such a guarantee oppose a pecuniary bar how economical soever it might prove in the long run to its adoption the other purpose is—by means of this same bill if passed into an act to afford immediate relief to as many as choose out of the whole number of suitors in that class of the existing judicatories whose inaptitude is most universally notorious and the sufferings produced by it on the part of suitors most severely felt and loudly complained of this     less extensive object of the two is the only one to which the provisions of the bill have any immediate application different species of matter all along in this bill accompanying each other and all bearing relation and applied to the same subject—namely—  enactive   instructional   exemplificative   ratiocinative   commentative—or say illustrative composed of notes to the above office of these notes bringing to view the dispositions made in relation to the same subject in and by the existing system of the first four and the use of them respectively some account may be seen in the publication intituled official aptitude maximized expense minimized vol v of the enactive no farther mention will here be requisite other than that it is the same species of matter of which all codes as yet in existence and force have been mostly if not exclusively composed—composed chiefly if not wholly to the exclusion of all other matter in this or that one of those codes here and there may perhaps be found a slight sprinkling of the exemplificative matter detached from the general matter of which the enactive portion is composed on the occasion of this bill the course that has been pursued is as follows—on this as on former occasions under one or other of those four heads alternating as occasion calls the matter all along presents itself enactive exemplificative ratiocinative and instructional to which is here added the annotative i e notes of the annotative no part it will be manifest can have been intended to receive the touch of the sceptre the other parts respectively may be employed or not according as it may be the pleasure of the constituted authorities that styled enactive is in substance every part of it regarded as indispensable it may be employed in its present form or in case of necessity it may be translated into the customary form which however in the judgment of the draughtsman it cannot be without detriment in large quantity and in a variety of shapes that even in case of such translation more or less use of the exemplificative matter may be made seems not altogether improbable that in that case any use should be made of the ratiocinative seems altogether hopeless and in much the same case seems to be that to which the word instructional has given the name in the english statutes a practice hitherto prevailing has been to preface each one by a sort of attempt at a rationale composed of a paragraph or a string of paragraphs strung together by so many repetitions of the conjunction whereas in the judicial decrees of french procedure the same function is performed by so many repetitions of the participle considerant followed by the adverb que of this arrangement one consequence is the painful strain upon the mind while it is kept in suspense panting under the conjecture what can be the end of this introduction which in one instance has been observed to contain matter enough to give expression to a story capable of filling a volume eminently ill adapted to the purposes of language seemed the grammatical form thus given to the matter to the more important reform in the matter this little alteration in the form presented itself as no inapt prelude when into the texture of an act of parliament anything in the shape of a reason does find its way the preamble is always one place and most commonly the only place in which it is inserted though now and then to this or that particular section a particular preamble is prefixed generally speaking the matter of the act be it ever so voluminous—for all this ratiocinative matter no more than one spot it may hence be imagined how vague and loose the most instructive terms that the case admits of cannot but be my practice exemplifications of which have already been given is—to give to each enactment or intimately connected with it its own set of reasons—its own ratiocinative matter as i have found convenience in denominating it but readers of acts of parliament being in use to begin with a preamble applying to the whole aggregate it has seemed good to me for their accommodation to submit to their consideration the following one should it not be found to embrace every topic touched upon in the bill it will at any rate be found to touch upon the most considerable in number and value as the phrase is in regard to creditors the need of the whole of this introduction being in my view of the matter superseded by the specially applying and constantly concomitant matter above mentioned it seemed not worth while to expend more time labour matter and space in the endeavour to render it allcomprehensive thus much in deference to custom and authority i have done but to squeeze the whole of the matter into the compass of one sentence—this is what i could not prevail upon myself to do not only in the statutes at large but in the bill there to preparatory marginal abridgments are constantly inserted in the present bill no such additament has been made in the cases in which this instrument of elucidation is employed its indispensableness is indisputable the matchless diffuseness and lengthiness of the plan constantly pursued is such that but for these helps the difficulty of forming any tolerably clear and comprehensive     conception of the matter for the current purposes would be extreme proportional the number of those who would give up the attempt altogether and of those in whose minds misconception would with more or less frequency have place in the present instance no such repulsive and pernicious lengthiness having place insertion of the sort of notes in question has been regarded as a superfluity that might without inconvenience be omitted state of things in regard to the two systems—the hereproposed system and the existing system—reader as you read mark well whether it be not as follows— under the hereproposed system strong and adequate powers—strong and adequate securities against abuse under the existing system weak and inadequate powers—weak and inadequate securities against abuse of good under the hereproposed system multum in parvo under the existing system parvum in multo—of evil multum in multo for and under the hereproposed system preliminary and preparatory survey of the whole field of law allcomprehensive under the existing system preliminary survey of the whole or any considerable part of it none for and in the hereproposed system over the whole expense of the field roads made straight and broad under the existing system paths erooked and narrow wretchedly adapted as the existing system may all along be seen to be to its professed purpose admirably adapted it has been found to be to the interests—the particular and sinister interests and thence to the main purposes of its contrivers and conductors in what proportion moral and in what proportion intellectual causes have been contributory to the effect it is not possible to determine in what proportion the sinister interest in what proportion the want of appropriate knowledge judgment and active aptitude nor to the present purpose in any greater degree is it needful than practicable to the legislator belongs the task of doing away with the sinister interest and thereby securing moral aptitude to individuals that of supplying appropriate knowledge and judgment and thereby furnishing guidance to all such legislators and other rulers as are in possession of the appropriate active aptitude and this service happily for mankind no sinister interest in the breasts of rulers has been able to prevent the performance of moreover in regard to laws though in the giving birth to them the consummative the obstetric part is everywhere confined to rulers yet is the initiative the generative everywhere by the very nature of things left open to individuals—to all individuals—to the best qualified as well as to the worst qualified—under the most absolute and maleficent government a man may write and for publication convey the product of his labour to happier climes reader mark well the character of the arguments with which the proposed system will be combated with the exception of such of them by which imperfections and correspondent need of amendment are brought to view observe whether there are any that come to close quarters see whether they may not be found written all of them in the book of fallacies vol ii p     necessary to the accomplishment of the purpose of this act—necessary on pain of utter inefficiency—is perfect selfsufficiency on the part of the proposed dispatch court namely by the possession of powers sufficient for the accomplishment of this same purpose not only without aid from any other judicatory but even notwithstanding any resistance or obstruction capable of being opposed to it whether by individuals taken at large or by any other judicatory whatsoever operations for the performance of which corresponding powers are hereby lodged in the hands of the dispatch court judge are accordingly the following— i stoppage of the proceedings in the several courts in question from the cognizance of which the suits are respectively meant to be transferred to that of the dispatch court judge taking into the custody or power of the the dispatch court judge all documents and written instruments at large the inspection and possession of which may be necessary to the accomplishment of this same purpose iii so all subjectmatters corporeal or incorporeal moveable or immoveable the disposal of which by the said judge may be necessary to this same purpose—disposal whether definitive at the conclusion of the suit in question or provisional or say instrumental or interlocutory in the course of it iv surmounting all resistance and obstruction capable of being opposed to the performance of any of the abovementioned operations v elicitation of all such ulterior evidence whether personal real or written the possession or inspection of which may be necessary to the accomplishment of this same purpose vi applying upon occasion adequate punishment to all persons concerned—either in the carrying on any proceeding after such stoppage performed as above par i—or in the opposing resistance or obstruction to any of the operations of the dispatch court ii iii iv v vii in case of need of aid to the dispatch court judge or the ordinarily employed subordinate functionaries attached to the service of his court as such in the performance of     any of the abovementioned operations—power to them respectively to call in and cause to be rendered the appropriate aid of all persons whatsoever appropriate exceptions excepted viii obviating all proceedings capable of being carried on by any other court tending designedly or undesignedly to the frustration of this same purpose necessary on the other hand is the securing the application of adequate punishment in the event of any abusive application of any of the above powers on the part whether of any functionary or any other person acting in subordination to the dispatch court judge or on the part of the judge himself so much as to the necessity of these powers to the institution of the proposed dispatch court other topics not to be lost sight of are these— i of these same powers the efficiency to the purpose in question and their undangerousness to the procedure of the court out of whose hands the suits are proposed to be taken undangerousness with respect to whatever suits are left in their hands ii of the powers proposed to be given to the dispatch court at the charge of the suitors on both sides the efficiency and undangerousness iii of the means of responsibility proposed to be established for the purpose of securing the suitors against danger of the abuse of the judges powers the efficiency and at the same time the undangerousness to him and the unobjectionableness on his account but as to these qualities the time for bringing them to view will not arrive till the arrangements themselves have been brought to view as to the necessity of the arrangements in question to the institution of the proposed dispatch court—satisfaction on this head might not be satisfactory to every eye if its undangerousness to the procedure of the existing courts in respect of any preponderant evil were not clear in their eyes this necessity might oppose a peremptory exclusion upon the proposed institution altogether by all persons by whom dangerousness is alleged let specific evils not mere vague generalities be adduced be this as it may their simplicity will not be questionable striking will be the contrast they will be seen to make with the existing system in every part of it egregious would be the misconception if the simplicity were on account of its novelty regarded as detracting from their efficiency simplicity and efficiency go hand in hand so do in the existing system inefficiency complexity and entanglement with the hereproposed remedy compare every other in every as yet proposed change behold either an exacerbation or if a remedy a wretchedly inadequate one halting with tardy steps in the traces of a rapidlyadvancing and widespreading disease turn to an index of the statutebook—ruffheads for example look at the general title amendment look at any of the numerous particular titles professing to have for their object the amendment in some way or other of the immense chaos think in each instance of the malignity and flagrancy of the abuse—of the length of time it must have continued—of the quantity of the suffering it must have been producing all that time—of the impossibility of its having been any part of that time overlooked by those in whose power it was to remedy it how incapable of being continued without being purposely kept up—kept up for the sake of the filthy lucre of the extraction of which it was the instrument think of the hundreds of years during which it had continued—of the reluctance with which it was given up and of the parade of examining and reexamining with so many hundreds of appropriately learned eyes into practices the depravity of which would manifest itself to any the slightest glance of any single—and howsoever inexperienced—eye not fascinated or blinded by the delusions spread around for that purpose amendment and reform with snails pace abuse with racehorse pace you who wish to do so and think you can find answer to these thoughts in the very nature of the case among the effects of the hereproposed institution one undesirable one to a more or less considerable degree cannot fail to have place namely detriment to the particular interests of individuals of various descriptions and classes and in particular the class composed of professional men the professors of the law in relation to such detriment justice requires that provision should be made and it is hereby proposed in mode and degree following under and by virtue of the greatesthappiness principle no such detriment to particular interests—number of persons interested and value of their respective interests taken into account—can afford a preponderant reason for putting a negative upon the proposed system of reform but under and by virtue of the nondisappointment principle for all detriment thence resulting to particular interests in every instance in which satisfactory evidence as to the existence and quantity or say value of the pecuniary loss or detriment in any other shape can be elicited it ought to be elicited and satisfaction in the shape of compensation in respect of it to be administered such compensation ought to be fully equivalent     and in case of doubt it ought to be rather more than less than equivalent reasons— i the greater the benefit from the measure to the community at large the better can the community at large afford to make the compensation required ii proportioned to the quantity of suffering by loss uncompensated is the magnitude of the evil of the first order iii so likewise that of the evil of the second order that is to say alarm produceable on the part of other individuals of other classes regarding themselves as exposed to be eventually detrimented by reform real or supposed set on foot by the same constituted authorities or their successors so likewise danger lest by the consideration of the individual operation in question in the character of a precedent similar suffering should under and by virtue of the imitative and the customfollowing principles be produced iv independently of all regard for the feelings of assignable individuals prudence that is to say regard had to the probability of successful issue suggests the propriety of doing whatsoever without preponderant evil can be done for augmenting the probability of a successful issue by the removal of whatsoever opposition might otherwise be made v with as little expense as possible to the community should such compensation in this as in every other case be made vi if accordingly and in so far as such compensation can be made without expense incurred on purpose as well as without preponderant evil in any other shape it ought so to be made for example if in lieu of the office the abolition of which is necessitated by the reforming measure in question other offices require to be and are accordingly created the quondam occupants of the abolished offices should in so far as qualified to perform the duties of the newly created offices be located therein receiving at the same time adequate compensation for whatsoever if anything the remuneration attached to the new office falls short of being equal to that attached to the abolished office when everything has been done which the nature of men and things admits of being done towards making the aggregate of the enjoyment derivable from the aggregate of the compensation equal to the aggregate mass of suffering produced by the measure of reform still there will be in most cases and in this case in particular an aggregate nor that an inconsiderable one of suffering for which no compensation can by possibility be afforded to this head belongs the sort of humiliation with the accompanying pain of mind which a man cannot but feel when removed from preeminence in a certain branch of art and science or from any situation in life by which in a greater or less degree the occupant is rendered in the eyes of the community an object of respect on the present occasion the quantity of uncompensable pain produced from this source will unavoidably be preeminently great a condition absolutely necessary to the establishment of the hereproposed new system is the extinction of the whole quantity of popular respect hitherto paid to the occupants of the abolished offices in such sort that the quantity of respect possessed by each such dislocated functionary will thereupon be confined to that which will be paid to his individual character and the objects of general desire which when the measure in question has been carried into effect will be found remaining to him the quantity of respect then attached to preeminence in the profession of the law and more especially to official situations in the judiciary department being of the first order vying at least with the quantity attached to the other departments of government respectively—proportioned to the enjoyment from the possession will be of course the suffering resulting from the loss from these considerations flow in every considerate breast two results—  the emotion and affection of sympathy called into existence by the consideration of the intensity and extent of the mass of mental suffering above brought to view   the anticipation of the force of the opposition with which the proposed measures of reform how beneficial soever to the community at large cannot fail to be encountered the strenuousness of such opposition and the extraordinary quantity of relative power possessed by the persons in question on the occasion of this opposition the art of persuasion including as a branch of it the art of deception in a degree of strength altogether incapable of being equalled in any other instance common discernment will suffice for teaching a man to anticipate weak indeed must be that discernment by which in respect to the means used in an opposition so composed sincerity in any degree on the part of any opponent can really be expected when for a mass of property—a dwellinghouse for example or a multitude of contiguous dwellinghouses—taken into the hands of government for the benefit of a neighbourhood or the community at large compensation comes to be provided—who is it that ever expects on the part of an individual proprietor unknown sincerity in respect of the value by him assigned to it or by whom would he to any such degree be confided in as that without some controul applied to it his declaration would be received what would be the opinion entertained in respect     of the probity or wisdom of a finance minister who after pronouncing an euloguim on the general probity and on that individual occasion on the assured sincerity of the proprietor in question should leave it to him to fix the price but on the one hand the proprietor of a house or a street is not as such in any peculiar degree prone to insincerity on the other hand every person engaged in the profession of the law is much less is every such proprietor a selfdeclared professor of the art of insincerity while every individual embarked in the profession of the law is a consequence that does not absolutely follow is that in respect of everything which he will say in opposition to a measure of reform such as that in question every man engaged in the profession of the law—every man without exception will to a certainty be insincere but a consequence that does absolutely follow is that on the part of every other man—every man not engaged in the profession of the law—who in taking into consideration the opinion delivered by an individual so engaged on the subject of a measure which in what degree soever beneficial to the community at large was unquestionably detrimental to the aggregate body of the individuals engaged in the profession of the law should regard absolute sincerity as being either certain or even so much as equally probable with the opposite state of mind no small degree of mental blindness would have place     preamble considerations on which this act is grounded are the following— art   in the early times of this monarchy when money was scarce and the revenues of the crown not yet established on any settled footing—remuneration in the shape of fixed salaries for the functionaries of government employed in the several departments not being capable of being provided in sufficient quantity recourse was had of necessity to the expedient of suffering them to extract payment for themselves at the expense of such of the kings subjects as stood in need of their respective services in which state of things by giving increase to the number of the occasions on which the suitors to their respective offices have need of such their services these same functionaries having it unavoidably in their power to give increase to the aggregate amount of the emoluments thus extracted the interest of the possessor of each such power is placed in a state of opposition to such his duty of which opposition the abuse of such power is to a considerable degree a necessary consequence art   of this opposition of interest to duty in judicial hands the result has been the undue increase of expense in the shape of fees as also the undue increase of delay for the purpose of giving time for and bringing into existence incidents whereby the demand for fresh operations and legal instruments and thereby addition made to the number of fees exacted and thereby to the aggregate of expense art   of these additions again sale denial and delay of justice are the necessary consequences—that is to say sale of justice to all those who having wherewithal do accordingly thereby disburse the amount of the expense denial of justice to all who by inability stand excluded from the capacity of purchasing it delay of justice by the amount of all such retardation as had for its effect the augmentation of the expense art   in and by the statute entitled magna charta which has in all times been regarded as the stock root or foundation of all those liberties whereby the condition of the subjects of this realm stands distinguished to its advantage from that of the subjects of other monarchies is contained a declaration expressed in these memorable words nulli differemus nulli vendemus neque negabimus justitiam—to no one will we delay to no one will we make sale to no one will we make denial of justice—to none of which promises was it perhaps at that same time in the power of the monarch of this realm to give fulfilment by constant or even at any time by adequate performance art   by the operation of this cause the grievances by which at all times the subjects of this realm have been afflicted and which in the natural course of things have at all times been in a course of continual augmentation have at length arrived at such a pitch as to threaten the dissolution of all government and to cause men to look for security in powers and safeguards other than those provided by the law art   the system of procedure which is styled the regular has by the causes hereinabove mentioned been swollen to such a pitch of dilatoriness and expensiveness as to have been by the continually repeated recognition of parliament itself acknowledged to be incapable of fulfilling its intended purposes in consequence of which a mode of procedure styled by comparison the summary has on each such occasion been substituted to it art   if the course so pursued be well adapted to the elicitation of the truth in any one case it can scarcely be otherwise in any other art   in the course so styled the regular in courts of various descriptions but more especially in the courts called equity courts the length of the proceedings in any the most simple case is not unfrequently spun out to as many years as under the summary course of procedure it would occupy minutes art   it is accordingly greatly to be desired that if not incompetent in other respects the course styled summary should with such improvements as the continually     increasing stock of experience shall be found to have suggested be throughout substituted to the regular art  0 the summary mode or course of procedure necessitates and supposes special and unavoidable exceptions excepted the attendance of the parties in the presence of each other and of the judge and in particular that the mode of giving commencement to a suit be by the attendance of the individual who desires to be admitted plaintiff or of some other person on his behalf art    to render the burthen of such attendance as light as may be it is necessary that every individual so attending should have the faculty of doing so without passing the night elsewhere than at his own home art    the giving universal establishment to this faculty could no otherwise be affected than by the reestablishing with improvements suited to the present state of society the system of local judicatories which having had place in the saxon times became gradually extinguished after and by means of the norman conquest art    by and in proportion to the narrowness of the bounds within which the local field of jurisdiction of each such judicatory would necessarily have to be confined the necessary number of such judicatories would unavoidably be to be increased art    by the erection of edifices for this purpose as well as by the allcomprehensive substitution of remuneration in the shape of salary to remuneration in the shape of fees—remuneration at the expense of the public to remuneration at the expense of the suitors—a proportionably large addition would unavoidably be made to the present amount of the regularly recurrent national expense it is desirable that before the correspondent expenditure has been incurred and the correspondent burthen imposed upon his majestys subjects the aptitude of the hereproposed plan should be subjected to trial previous to its being extended in case of success demonstrated by experiment and experience to the proposed judicatories throughout the whole country art    two modes of procedure the regular and the summary are both of them in use the regular having had for its authors the members of the judiciary establishment acting under the influence of particular and sinister interests as above the summary having parliament itself as the sole authority by which law is acknowledged to be made as often as cognizance of any case has been given to a justice of the peace acting singly or to justices in numbers acting otherwise than in general sessions declaration has impliedly indeed but not the less decidedly been made of the inaptitude of the regular mode in each such case and of the aptitude of the summary mode in that same case the exclusive aptitude of the summary mode being so repeatedly and continually recognized in relation to all those cases can there be any case in which it has not place if there be no other case in which it has not place insomuch that in such case the regular mode ought as at present to be employed and the proposed summary mode not—this considered it is hereby declared that it is in the contemplation of the legislature to make application of the summary mode to all cases art    the appointing on the occasion of a legal demand made an arbitrator or arbitrators more than one chosen by mutual consent of his majestys subjects to exercise without any appointment from the crown the functions of judge is a practice which has received the sanction of parliament—that is to say by a statute of the  0th year of king william the third chapter    art    it continually happens that cases which by their complexity are essentially incapable of being determined by jurytrial are nevertheless entered in the assizes court for the declared purpose of being so determined on which occasion such complexity being in open court declared by counsel on the one side and assented to by counsel on the other side the case is thereupon under the authority of the judge consigned to arbitrators in some such form as is thereupon agreed that is to say subjected to the determination either of one single person learned in the law or not so learned chosen on both sides at the suggestion or with the approbation of the judge or else to the determination of two persons under the name of arbitrators chosen in like manner the one by the one side the other by the other side with power to such arbitrators in case of disagreement to choose by their joint assent another referee in the character of umpire whose determination it is thereupon agreed shall be final art    for want in all such cases of powers adequate to the purpose of securing the forthcomingness of such evidence as it has happened to the individual case to afford the provision thus made for right decision is but precarious while the delay and expense is swelled to an indefinite extent by reason of the opposition between interest and duty created by the mode of payment appointed for the remuneration of the official service rendered on this occasion by the occasional judge or judges so appointed and officiating art    notwithstanding the inconvenience attached to this mode of judicature yet the practice of consigning the determination of suits to persons other than such as are exclusively appointed by the crown has not only received the sanction of precedent   0 but is moreover thereby demonstrated to be in continual and allcomprehensive use art  0 for the purpose of the experience hereby endeavoured to be obtained it is necessary that according to the course hereby proposed suits in large and indefinite number should in this same way be heard and determined by one and the same judge art    that no reasonable ground of complaint might have place if without consent of parties on either side and without special and sufficient cause shown a suit which had been commenced in one of the ordinary courts and been there carried on according to the now established course of judicial procedure were removed to the cognizance of the dispatch court judge—the dispatch court judge should be located by the suitors subject to the approbation of his majesty art    in so far as everything is performed with consent of all parties interested the good hereby done will be altogether pure and all possible ground of objection to the departure thus made from the ordinary course of judicature will be obviated be it therefore enacted as follows— part i— judiciary section i judge located how enactive—ratiocinative art   for the better administration of justice by experiment made for the purpose of an allcomprehensive substitution of the summary to the socalled regular mode of procedure antecedently to the disbursements necessary for the institution of the requisite allcomprehensive

the court of the lord high chancellor will be the dispatch court art   instrument of location a commission signed by his majesty and countersigned by the president of his majestys privy council or by

to be thus disposed of form of commission as per schedule to this act annexed no i enactive—expositive art   suits of which the judge will take cognizance these∥ of the suits depending in the equity

shall     have been manifested by an appropriate petition authenticated by his signature form of each as per schedule no ii name thereof a dispatchcourtpraying petition enactive—instructional art   of a printed copy of the matter of that same no of the schedule will such petition be composed but in addition to the     letterpress will be inserted in manuscript the matters following— i at the head of the letterpress—   name of the suit of which the removal and transference prayed for is desired   names of the several persons mentioned in the course of the documentary papers belonging to the suit as parties in and to that same suit or of such of them as are known by the petitioner or petitioners so to be ii at the close of the letterpress—   names of the party or parties whose desire is thus expressed attested and thus authenticated by their respective signatures art   of a dispatchcourtpraying petition thus delivered in two copies at the least both provided with the same signatuae or signatures will be produced to the clerk to whom the function of receiving them is committed on that one which is kept in the office he will write at the top of the first page a numerical figure or figures expressive of the rank occupied in the order of priority by that same petition in the list of the dispatchcourtpraying petitions in that same office already received and at the close of the form immediately below the name or names of the petitioner or petitioners his own names personal and official with the word received and the year month and day of the month when received to the individual by whom the two copies were brought he will return the other after having marked thereon the same number as that marked as above on the copy retained and having moreover copied thereon his own acknowledgment written as just mentioned art   fee to the clerk  s on receipt of a fee to that same amount he will moreover deliver a like copy to every other party to the suit by whom by word of mouth or in writing with his name in his own handwriting thereto added demand thereof shall have been made expositive art   unanimous the petition will be styled if of all the persons of whom as above it is stated that they are parties to the suit the names appear as expressed by their respective signatures—an exparte petition if of the names so to be signed any one be wanting instructional art   in relation to any such exparte petition arrangements will in manner hereinafter mentioned be taken for causing it to be known whether the same is to be considered as unanimously assented to or by any and what number of the parties dissented from but from the mere absence of the name of a party no such conclusion can justly be drawn as that of his being dissentient in relation to it for putting a negative on such conclusion any one of a variety of accidents may suffice the party in question absent for example in another hemisphere—or in a state of infancy—or his relation to the business that of a trustee without any real interest in the event or matter of the suit enactive art  0 so soon as dispatchcourtpraying petitions in suits to the number of  00 have been delivered in notice thereof under the care of a secretary of state will be published in the london gazette appointing time and place for the meeting of the petitioners for the purpose of making election of a dispatchcourt judge ratiocinative art  0 the judge of the dispatch court why thus located that is to say not as are judges at large by commission from his majesty directly but by election first made by the parties interested and then by his said majesty approved and confirmed art    answer—reasons— i as to election by the parties interested to a situation conferring the judicial function in principle this course is already by statute law established to wit by the statute   and  0 w iii c    by which individuals named by the parties to a dispute relative to a matter of right are authorized under the name of arbitrators to hear and determine demands and under the name of awards to pronounce judgments to which force of law is commanded to be given by the judges of the ordinary courts ii as much as in the way of judicature is in that case authorized to be done is authorized to be done without any special appointment made by the king for the time being but to the present purpose what is moreover necessary is—that by the judge in question various judicial powers not given to the functionaries so elected by the parties should be possessed in the conferring of which no person other than the king is competent in particular powers for compelling evidence at the hands of third persons as well as parties iii the ultimatelyproposed new judicial establishment and the hereproposed experimental institution taken together being in so far as favourable to the interests of the rest of the community unavoidably more or less unfavourable to the particular interests of men of law taken in a body and the preposessions and inclinations of that body being by the universallyprevalent principle of human nature rendered necessarily adverse to any such change—the consequence is that     for a situation such as that in question recommendation could not consistently with an adequate sense of the irresistible force of that same principle of human action be expected to be received through the ordinary channels by any other person than one whose endeavour would be naturally to bring into discredit and by all other safely practicable means frustrate both institutions rather than to render them productive of the benefit intended by this act iv at any rate whether of an individual so recommended this were or were not in fact the disposition—such it could not fail to be suspected of being by all persons by whom by attentive reflection an adequate conception of the springs by which human action is regulated has been obtained v on the part of the proposed electors—that is to say all suitors in the equity courts in question those suitors excepted whose interest and thence their endeavour is—to profit by the imperfections of the existing system—and who accordingly stand designated by the appellation of malâ fide suitors—the existence of a sincere and anxious desire to see invested with the powers in question whatsoever person would be most likely to give to these same powers that exercise by which the benefit of this act will in the highest degree be produced—is by those same principles of human nature in proportion as the tendency of these same powers is perceived by them rendered altogether secure enactive art    mode of election ballot returning officer by whom the business will be conducted the said secretary of state or an undersecretary belonging to his office to him all persons desirous of being considered as candidates will have given in their names business other than that of ascertaining the individual on whom the choice has fallen none candidates excepted spectators at large as in a court of justice will not be present speeches will not be made between candidates two or more in case of equality in the number of the votes lot will determine ratiocinative art    the election why by ballot that is to say not in that customary mode in which it is known to all persons interested in which way each person gives his vote but in a mode in which the suffrage being given in secret no such knowledge can to a certainty be obtained by anybody answer—reasons— i lest by fear the electors in any number might be induced to give their votes in favour of a candidate in any degree by want of aptitude in whatever shape moral or intellectual rendered likely to frustrate as above the design of these institutions rather than to promote it ii of the transfer hereby indented to be made the effect would be pro tanto to take business out of the hands of the several high judicial functionaries here following—  the three superior judges of the chancery equity court   the eleven subordinate judges of that same court the masters in chancery   the four superior judges of the equity side of the exchequer court   the subordinate judges analogous to the masters in the chancery court moreover among the members of the bar all those whose practice has for its theatre any one or more of those several judicatories and among these are always some by whom influential situations are occupied in parliament iii on the part of all these so highlyinfluential persons unless constituted in a manner different from that of the whole remainder of the human species—a sure object of endeavour if supported by an adequate strength of hope would be as above to cause to be elected of all the several candidates the one in the lowest degree apt or if there be a difference in the highest degree unapt for this purpose two sorts of characters would stand open to choice—  a strongminded man whose strength in all shapes would be employed in the endeavour to frustrate the design preserving all the while by plausible pretexts and appearances such as the existing system would be found to furnish in abundance his own repute from deterioriation   a weakminded man by whose weakness even though unaccompanied by sinister intention the arrangements furnished by this experimental institution might be prevented from being followed by those good effects of which in apt hands it would be productive iv in case of failure of the whole design every suitor concurring in the business of petitioning would be lying and would see himself to be lying at the mercy of all these irresistible adversaries and unpunishable natural and probable oppressors whose vengeance by the war thus made upon their personal interests and affections he had thus provoked v note that in different degrees formidable would be this resentment in the two cases of an unanimously signed and an exparte signed petition by an unanimously signed petition it might happen that one party would not be more exposed than another on which supposition injustice to one for the sake of undue favour to another—or vice versâ undue favour to one for the sake of injustice to another—would not perhaps be an object of apprehension but in a case in which the petition having been concurred in by one or more had by nonconcurrence or in a more conspicuous way by active and open opposition been opposed by parties one or more—the situation of a petitioner could not but     present itself to his view as truly perilous whatsoever candidate known or supposed to possess in his favour the good wishes of these tremendous personages sitting in clouded majesty might how inapt soever in the conception of the elector or in reality or in both be the only one in whose favour it might seem to the elector consistent with prudence to bestow his vote vi in the case of a suit in which for increase of delay expense and vexation to a suitor or suitors on the opposite side either the demand had been made or the defence made—the suit having on the one side or the other for its commencement or continuance the dishonesty of a malâ fide suitor—he who of course could not without acting in contrariety to his own designs be of the number of the petitioners—he would of course be and be seen to be the object of favour to those influential personages and the petitioners objects of corresponding resentment and accordingly exposed to corresponding danger vii even in the case of a petition which being signed by every party wore thus upon the face of it the appearance of a unanimous one—a state of things which in instances in any number might happen to be exemplified is this by apprehension of disrepute or evil in some other shape parties one or more may have been induced to give their signatures at the same time from the nature of the interest they have in the suit on their part nothing but unwillingness has had place on the other side all the willingness and in this state of secret unwillingness supposing their signatures added to the rest would be the minds of all malâ fide suitors enactive—instructional art    instrument by the exhibition of which to the returning officer the title to vote will be established a petition as per art   attested as per art   entitled to give a vote will be—not each person by whom the petition has been signed but that person petitioner or nonpetitioner to whom for this purpose the petition has been entrusted art    the candidate on whom the choice has fallen having been ascertained and a record of the proceedings as per schedule no iii drawn up the secretary of state will forthwith present the same to his majesty for approbation if the choice be approved his majesty will attach to the said record the word approved followed by his signmanual and countersigned by the said secretary of state if not approved his majesty will instead of the word approved write the words not approved in both cases followed will be the signature by the mention of the year month and day of the month and in case of disapproval on that same day in and by a london gazette extraordinary notice of such disapproval being made public notice for a fresh election to be made as per art    and    will be given the day not being further distant than that sennight art    should the candidate on whom on the occasion of such second election the choice had fallen fail of receiving approbation and confirmation as above a third election will have place in the same manner as the second and so toties quoties until some candidate shall have received approbation and confirmation from his majesty as above art    should the time appointed as per art    for a fresh election have elapsed and neither approval nor disapproval as above been manifested the petitioners will reiterate their petitions until an election having taken place shall have received confirmation as above art    at the same time and place at which his majestys approval of an elected candidate is as per art    signified a commission from his majesty as per schedule no i constituting the person so approved judge of the dispatch court will in like manner be signed by his majesty and countersigned by the said president of the privy council keeper of the privy seal or secretary of state art   enactive art    for falsehood—relevant and material falsehood—inserted in the matter of such petition every person knowingly concerned therein will be punishable punishable by fine and imprisonment one or both at option and as to quality at discretion the imprisonment not to exceed three years expositive art    criminal the offence will be if accompanied with evil consciousness culpable if committed through rashness temerity or say inattention want of that due attention by which if bestowed the commission of the offence would have been prevented and which of the two cases the offence belongs to declaration will on the occasion of the sentence be made by the judge exemplificative art    follows here an example of a falsehood for which in case of impunity an adequate and determining motive might be found for causing a petition to appear and to be regarded as unanimous stating as complete an incomplete list of the parties to the suit enactive art  0 for forgery wilfully committed in relation to any such petition every person knowingly and wilfully concerned therein will be punishable by fine imprisonment and transportation any one or two or all three of these same punishments at option the imprisonment for not more than three years the transportation for not more than seven the fine at discretion     ratiocinative art  0 supposing the acts prohibited in and by articles    and  0 to remain unpunishable persons not entitled to vote in the election might in any number intrude themselves the whole business be thus involved in confusion and the design of the institution frustrated—by persons whose particular and sinister interests stand opposed to it as it is small indeed seems the probability that these penal enactments will any of the three be ever called into action but as in other cases so in this by the efficiency of a security when employed no reason is afforded why it should be left unemployed section ii remuneration enactive art   attached to this office will be a salary of  ayear payable at the same time and in the same manner as that of the lord chief justice of the kings bench expositive—ratiocinative art  —i as to quantity of remuneration note here a most material difference between the case of the experimental dispatch court and the ultimatelyproposed local judicatories with a view to which and for the sake of which the experiment is hereby intended to be made ii in the dispatch court the remuneration must be upon the present high scale namely for the purpose of engaging men in whom in consideration of the extent of their practice and the height of their reputation the electors may be supposed to repose their confidence iii in the system of local judicatories no such rate of payment could be afforded no such rate of payment could be requisite no     need it will be seen would there be for buying off lawyers from the highest ranks of the professional class iv so much for what by the friends to reform would be proposed to be done now as to the course that would be taken in opposition by corruptionists in office and in power—as such enemies to reform v by them would be stated as altogether indispensable for every one of these local judicatories a salary upon the present principle and scale of excess the amount of which would of course be maximized—from the persuasion that from the magnitude thus alleged to be necessary one or other of two advantages would be expected to be reaped—  the institution might be rejected altogether in consideration of the insupportability of the expense or   if it were carried there would come the profit by the patronage—a profit rising in proportion to the excess vi of the inferences deducible from the present fundamental axiom namely aptitude is as opulence—a rule not only acted upon but avowed—the utmost possible advantage would of course be made give no more than £ 000 ayear to the judge of each local judicatory a very inadequate degree of aptitude you must be contented with give £ 000 ayear so much the better but to make any tolerable approach to perfection you must give the £ 0000 given at present enactive art   of no person on any account will the judge of the dispatch court receive under the name of a fee or under any other name any money or moneys worth on the occasion or in consideration of any service rendered or expected to be rendered by him as such by or in the execution of the power belonging to such his office acceptance of any such benefit by him by his own or any other hand to his use will be deemed extortion and as such punished for endeavour and design respectively punishment correspondent ratiocinative art   receipt of fees why inhibited to the judge answer—reasons— i in the case of a judge as in that of every other functionary and every human being good behaviour depends on the conformity of interest with duty ii by this mode of remuneration his interest would be placed in a state of irreconcilable opposition to his duty and as will be seen the very design of the institution frustrated iii of such opposition in the situation in question as well as every other so long as man is man sacrifice of public duty to personal and other particular interests as far as may be with safety is that which at the hands of the vast majority of persons invested with political power is on each occasion the most probable result and that on the expectation of which all arrangements should accordingly be grounded iv under the name of a fee or any other name to authorize a judge to receive money moneys worth or benefit in any shape on the occasion of any sort of operation performed by him or written instrument authorized by him is in other words to give him a premium or say a bounty on the production of expense—a bounty the amount of which increases with the number of those same operations performed and those same instruments so produced by him v so to give him a fee or other benefit proportioned to the length of any such written instrument is—to give him a bounty on the length of every such written instrument so produced by him and thus also a bounty upon the expense vi by these arrangements it is rendered his interest to swell to the utmost the expense of every suit to the suitor by this interest is supplied the adequate motive by his office and by the power belonging to it the adequate means and be the effect what it may wherever motive and means both adequate unite in the same person the effect follows of course vii the act of employing in the exaction of money or moneys worth to an undue amount to the powerholders own use the power derived from an office is professed to be dealt with as a crime it is termed extortion and is taken for the subjectmatter of an inhibition or say prohibition backed by punishment authorizing a judge thus to extract it—and to permit is to authorize—is therefore to authorize extortion to authorize that which at the same time is professed to be constituted a crime here then against inhibition on the one hand is express permission and thereby encouragement on the other unhappily the inhibition is in this case but nominal inoperative ineffective illusory falsely pretended hypocritical the permission—the encouragement—the inducement—is efficient effective and effectual viii a bounty on extortion operates as a penalty on abstinence from extortion for a bounty on any positive act operates as a penalty on the correspondent and opposite negative act so much for the factitious expense ix by the same means by which such needless expense is produced needless delay is moreover produced for to the number of judicial operations increase cannot be given without increase given to the time allotted for the performance of them and over and above the time necessary for the letting in the known and constantly accruing sources of delay accident will in proportion add to the length of     such time by giving birth to incidental and ulterior efficient and effective causes of that same grievance x moreover with the length of every such written instrument increases the length of the delay producible and produced in respect of the framing it examining it and making answer to it xi here then in addition to the penalty on abstinence from extortion is produced by these same fees a penalty on dispatch xii be the article what it may if a price be set upon it and it be delivered to those alone who pay the price it is sold—sold to all persons to whom on payment of that price it is delivered xiii moreover it is denied to all persons to whom it is not thus sold xiv how it is that by this mode of remuneration delivery of justice is delayed has been shown above and delay of justice is of itself denial of justice so long as it lasts xv thus it is that by every judge by whom for acting as such a fee is demanded justice is on the occasion of each demand either sold or denied sold if the money be received denied if it be not received xvi between the number of those to whom justice is sold and the number of those to whom it is denied the proportion will of course in each suit be rendered greater or less by the amount of the aggregate of the fees so demanded on the occasion of that same suit xvii the sort of suits which are here in question are those of which the equity courts take cognizance of the proportion between the number of those persons to whom by the fees thus demanded it is sold and the number of those to whom it is utterly denied the stock of data as yet accessible affords not any tolerably correct means of forming an estimate that the number of those to whom it is utterly denied is several thousand times as great as the number of those to whom it is sold may however be asserted without much fear of error xviii be the article what it may if the possession of it would be more useful to a man than the money the denial of it to him is productive of greater suffering to him and a worse injury to him than the sale would be those therefore to whom what is called justice is sold are if it be justice the favoured few xix all this while of the aggregate of the evil produced by fees allowed to be taken by a judge to his own use no more than a small part is it that is ever presented to view by the words which give expression to it in the law for by the judge no operation is performed without being accompanied with correspondent operations performed by other persons in whose instance remuneration is no less necessary than in the instance of the judge thus it is that for the purpose and with the effect of producing a comparatively small quantity of enjoyment to one man in the situation of judge suffering in vast and immeasurable quantity is produced on the part of a vast and immeasurable multitude of other persons in the condition of suitors xx of a law requiring fees to be paid to judges thus maleficent would be the effect even if the aggregate amount of those fees could be and were fixed or limited—limited by the law itself in such a manner as not to be capable of being by any act of the judge or any person other than those appointed by the legislature made to receive increase beyond that limit xxi but this is what never has been the state of things nor ever can be of the sorts of occasions on which in the sorts of suits in question the fee is allowed to be taken the number may be limited so of the sorts of operations on those several occasions performed and of the sorts of written instruments on those several occasions issued but in the instance of an individual suit of any sort individually taken for the legislator to apply limitation to the number of the operations or the instruments or to the length of any instrument unless where it is prescribed in terminis is not possible do the legislator what he will to quantities it will remain in the power of the judge to make his own additions     xxii fixation limitation regulation of fees allowed to be taken by judges and their subordinates not to speak of functionaries in other departments—all these are but so many covert modes of giving maximization to the quantity of money exigible by them and thereby to the quantity of extortion practised and corruption kept infused by force of law xxiii what if a statute were passed establishing a pecuniary qualification for enabling a man to apply for justice to an equity court and the like for enabling him to defend himself against any application so made—say a hundred ayear in a certain shape as in the case of the qualification of a justice of the peace or three hundred ayear as in the case of a member of parliament what an outcry would not such a law raise this would be in other words establishing a prohibition or say inhibition inhibiting every man not so qualified from making any such application or any such defence xxiv men govern others—men suffer others to govern them—by signs without looking further—without looking to things signified many times the qualification sufficient to enable a man to act as justice of peace would not suffice to enable a man to make a wellgrounded application to an equity court for what it deals out under the name of justice or to defend himself against an utterly groundless and unjust one not it indeed here then is prohibition put upon application for justice and upon selfdefence against injustice xxv thus would gnats be strained at by those by whom camels are swallowed much more effective is this virtual and undeclared prohibition than would be even a prohibition operating by a declared penalty to the same amount for by the virtual prohibition the penal effect is made to take place without the uncertainty of success and the certainty of that expense delay and vexation whatsoever it be which have place as often as effect is endeavoured to be given to a declared penalty xxvi so in the case of the correspondent remuneration in the actual state of things the manufacturer of the expense and delay who pays himself for what he himself does has nobody but himself to apply to in order to obtain that which he so makes in the case of a declaredly remunerating law he would have to make application to others—that same application loaded with the uncertainty as to success and in case of contestation the certainty as to delay expense and vexation as in the case of the probibitory and penal law as above xxvii taking money or moneys worth in remuneration for operations performed by a judge on the occasion and by the means of exercise given by him to the powers of his office is for shortness termed selling justice it is the same thing in other words xxviii indefinitely numerous are the forms of words by which in the hands of the legislator the effects of bounty and penalty—thence of production and prevention—are capable of being produced—a form more effective than the above the language does not furnish with as much reason might it be said that when the legislator imposes a tax he does not mean it should be paid as that when he allows fees to be taken by a judge he does not intend that extortion corruption factitious expense and factitious delay—all to a boundless amount with the correspondent suffering should have place xxix to authorize a judge to exact in this manner to an amount thus unlimited for his own remuneration is to authorize him to impose taxes to the same unlimited amount and put the proceeds into his own pocket xxx not less defensible would be a law authorizing the head of the army to pay himself what he pleased for so being than is that state of the law by which the head of the law is authorized so to do xxxi the head of the army would not choose among those who are already in a state of impoverishment and affliction those on whom he would levy his contributions the head of the law does make this cruel choice xxxii were the head of the army to take in that way £ 0000 ayear for himself he would not take more than £ 0000 from those on whom he levied the money the head of the law who takes £ 0000 ayear for himself in the way of fees does take as above a vast many times as much as £ 0000 from those on whom he levies such his money†     xxxiii a tax so called is generally speaking a tax upon prosperity a tax upon the injured suitor or upon the injured man who would have been suitor but who for want of money cannot pay the tax is a tax upon adversity xxxiv the legislator who imposes taxes on litiscontestation under the name of taxes establishes a cruel grievance the legislator who imposes taxes under the name of fees establishes a still more cruel grievance his parallel is only to be found in the surgeon who should drag a patient out of a sickbed when suffering under gout rheumatism or stone and flog him for the purpose of obtaining payment for dressing his sores xxxv all this notwithstanding the practice of employing this mode of remuneration in the case of judges in general and thereby in the case of an equity court judge in particular has been defended and recommended for continuance sole ground of defence the exertion of which this mode of remuneration is alleged to be productive answers to this allegation these— xxxvi—  the alleged advantage supposing it reaped would be reaped by these persons alone to whom by the judges so remunerated what is administered under the name of justice is as above sold it would not be reaped by any of those to whom that same boon is utterly denied and these it has been seen are hundreds of times or thousands of times as numerous as those here then is the most favourite supposition here then is an advantage which is not worth a hundredth or a thousandth part of the price paid for it lawyers in all they say—in all they write—assume justice to be accessible—universally accessible whereas inaccessibility is the rule accessibility only the exception xxxvii—  but in no one instance can the extraexertion in question be in any degree actually produced by any such fee nor consequently the supposed advantage reaped if the extraexertion were made the occasions on which it was made would be those on which the judge is occupied in hearing vivâ voce pleadings or hearing or reading papers belonging to the suit and on those same occasions to be productive of that effect it would be necessary that with the degree of the exertion the amount of the fee or the probability of the judge receiving it should receive increase but on no such occasion has any such increase of remuneration in any instance been so received by him nor can it be—the operations he receives his fee for are operations performed by other persons what is more—in no instance by the alleged cause—namely the receipt of the fee—can the alleged effect—namely the extraexertion—be produced for to be produced it would be necessary that the exertion should increase with the fee which is impossible xxxviii—  that which is thus impossible to be done by means of the instrument the use of which is thus recommended may be done to a certainty by other means by other means which require no extra cost it is produced in so far as on his part assiduity is produced and publicity as to that which after hearing and seeing what is proper he says or writes has place the greater the respectability and the number of the persons to whose minds he expects that what he thus utters will be applied the stronger will be his exertion to save himself from that disapprobation which will attach itself to his conduct in proportion as it is blameworthy and to obtain that approbation which will attach itself to his conduct in proportion as it is praise worthy xxxix conclusion as above announced—by the allowance of fees to the judge the design of the dispatch court would in a proportionable degree be frustrated enactive art   to every subordinate of the judge applies art   as well as to the judge himself ratiocinative art   receipt of fees why interdicted to all subordinate judicial officers answer—reasons— i because were not this same extent given to the interdiction in this case the interdiction to the judge would be without effect ii these several functionaries in their several situations being so many instruments in the hand of the judge—instruments without which it would not be in his power to produce the effects for the production of which he is located—it is matter of necessity that upon his will should depend their existence in their several situations that by the judge each such subordinate should in case of inaptitude sufficiently proved be dislocable and accordingly dislocated is therefore matter of necessity iii and that on each vacancy the new functionary should by the judge in being be located is desirable he having an interest greater than any other individual has in the making of an apt choice iv but by every fee received by any such subordinate of his the effect produced on the mind of the judge is in kind the same as if received by himself to his own use the relation which in this case has place between   0 the situation of the judge and that of the subordinate is that which has place between locator and locatee in ecclesiastical language between patron and incumbent in familiar language between patron and protegé—as the value of the subordinate situation increases and diminishes so does that of the superordinate v on the mind of the judge not only is the effect producible by the fee received by his subordinate the same in kind as if received by himself but it may be so even in degree and this in the case of each one of a number of these subordinate offices and officers vi or even greater as in the case in which the location is not in the way of sale but in that of gift—and thus in outward show gratuitous and to the locator unprofitable for suppose the judge to have a son to whom out of his own money he was about to make over an allowance of £ 00 ayear for his life and a vacancy happening in an office in the fathers gift to which is attached a mass of emolument to that same amount the judge gives to his son this office and thereby saves to himself the expenditure of this same part of his own income in this case the patronage is worth even more than the incumbency for in the moneymarket phrase the life of the son is of course worth more than the life of the father it may be worth several times as much vii but what under the feegathering system may happen but too easily is—that so great may be the number and value of the subordinate offices in the gift of one and the same patron that in comparison with the value of the patronage attached to it the value of the remuneration attached to the superordinate office may be in any degree inferior viii be the business what it may in so far as relish for it is a cause of aptitude for it purchase by the locatee is presumptive proof of his aptitude the greater the price the stronger the presumption—and so on the other hand of inaptitude—comparative at least in comparison with purchase—is the presumption afforded by acceptance from gift be the purchasers aversion to the business ever so strong and his inaptitude ever so flagrant if pay is attached to it a man who has no other means of subsistence office and pay together will accept of it rather than starve rather than starve the most arrant coward would accept gladly not only the commission of a military officer but even the situation of a private while had he any other means of subsistence not a penny for it would he give enactive—expositive art   correspondent to the length of the judges term of service will of course in respect of duration be the value of his remuneration whatever be the limit prescribed to the duration of this act the same will in course be prescribed to the continuance of the judge in this his office and thence to that of his salary for the duration given to this act see below ratiocinative art   the institution—why thus made temporary—answer that it may be seen that only in the event of its affording assurance of preponderant benefit will the community be burthened with it and the established course of regular procedure be subjected to that interruption and disturbance which after all endeavours used to minimize it cannot but in some degree have place enactive—instructional art   should this act not receive continuation it will be for the consideration of parliament whether to grant to the judge of the dispatch court and his subordinates any and what pensions of retreat ratiocinative art   of the office of the judge with the remuneration annexed the duration why thus made temporary and no pension of retreat secured answer—reasons— i because by this means the force of the motives to exertion and manifestation of appropriate aptitude in all its branches in so far as depends upon the will is maximized were a pension of retreat made secure to him the exertion of the judge might slacken if in his natural disposition indolence or a preference for other occupation had place ii true it is that if by the uncertainty thus attached to the continuance of the remuneration an individual more apt than any other who could be found were deterred from the acceptance of the office here would be a bad effect to set against the good produced by the saving in expense but no such undesirable consequence seems likely to have place so manifest and in case of success so vast will be the service done to the community in respect of justice that on the supposition though it were but a moderate degree of appropriate aptitude on the part of the benemeritant functionary moral aptitude in the shape of sincerity included to any individual desirous of the situation and feeling himself competent to it the continuance and perpetuation of the institution could scarcely fail to present itself as indubitable families in     such number rescued from absolute ruin families so high in rank and opulence delivered from vexation and embarrassment so quick the succession of the benefits thus conferred scarce a day past without his beholding a fresh group of fortunate beings beholding in him the author of their salvation to crown the whole the institution of the allcomprehensive and allbeneficent system of local judicatories secured and he the main instrument in the establishment of it considerations these by which will naturally be inspired a degree of animation much beyond any

proposed system of local judicatories an effectual one being the institution of an eleemosynary advocate—provision for the securing of appropriate aptitude on the part of functionaries eventually located in that office will herein be made in manner hereinafter following— expositive art   by an eleemosynary advocate understand—a functionary whose office consists in the rendering gratuitous assistance to a party on either side of the suit who by relative indigence is rendered unable to afford the remuneration requisite to the obtainment of professional assistance art   authorized hereby is every barrister whether of the english or the irish bar to act as eleemosynary advocate on either side of a suit in the dispatch court enactive art   remuneration in possession in the shape of salary or in any other shape at the public expense any more than at private expense not any—remuneration in expectancy will be the situation of eleemosynary advocate with a salary in one or other of the proposed local judicatories ratiocinative art   in the dispatch court why no such situation as that of an eleemosynary advocate filled exclusively by a determinate individual with or without a salary answer—reasons— i in the instance of this situation no place has that demand for remuneration which has been seen to have place as per section ii in the instance of that of the judge no sacrifice at all by officiating in the character of eleemosynary advocate in the dispatch court will a barrister who as yet has no considerable practice as such have to make ii if a salary were provided—by no more than one person or at most some other very small number of persons could the situation be occupied—the functions exercised no salary being provided—the exercise of the function may without inconvenience be left open to as many as shall feel disposed to undertake it iii the greater the number of those by whom this function is exercised the greater the number out of which those to whom it belongs will have to choose if and when the time comes for the filling the situation of eleemosynary advocate in the several proposed local judicatories iv note that of these local judicatories there will require to be at the least nearer three than two hundred v as to fear of any deficiency in the desirable number whatever it be of persons ready and willing to give this exemplification of their aptitude for the fulfilment of the duty attached to this office—no ground assuredly can there be for any such apprehension whatever manifestation a man makes of his aptitude for the exercise of this function on gratuitous terms the same will he make of his aptitude for the exercise of this same function on the ordinary terms and upon these gratuitous terms the faculty of exercising it will thus lie open to men by dozens and by scores by whom the faculty of exercising it on the ordinary terms would not have been attained vi analogous to the gratuitous practice of medical men in hospitals will be that of juridical assistants of parties in the dispatch court strenuous on every occasion is well known to be the competition for the situation of physician or surgeon to a public hospital yet in the view of no person other than colleagues and patients does a medical man practise in a hospital whereas in the view of the whole public will a candidate as above for the situation of eleemosynary advocate give exemplification of his appropriate aptitude in the dispatch court vii by the universality of the liberty thus given to all barristers to practice in the capacity of eleemosynary advocates that demand which will be seen to have place for deputes in the case of the judge the registrar and other dispatch court functionaries will be seen to stand excluded viii the greater the number of barristers practising in the dispatch court as above in the character of eleemosynary advocates—each in expectation of the situation of eleemosynary advocate in one of the local judicatories—the greater the number of those who by personal interest as well as affection will stand engaged—they and their respective connexions—to lend such support as may be in their power to the proposed measures for the institution of the system of local judicatories     section v judges c deputes enactive art   to obviate delay and failure of justice the judge will within  days after the day of his location locate a depute by this substitute his seat will be occupied at all times during which the judge his principal is taking the benefit of the vacation days as per section xii sittings times of or is by sickness rendered unfit for duty art   power to his majesty at any time within  days after such location to dislocate such locatee power in that case and with obligation to the judge within  days after such dislocation to locate a fresh depute with like power of dislocation to his majesty as aforesaid and so toties quoties until a depute shall have been located of whom it shall have pleased his majesty to approve so likewise toties quoties in case of selfdislocation or say resignation by such depute art   to the end that such substitution of the depute to his principal may never have place without sufficient cause—of the nonattendance of the judge by reason of sickness the registrar will on that same day give information that is to say by a bulletin transmitted to each of the london daily newspapers evening or morning whichever shall be next published on receipt of which the editor of each such newspaper shall with all practicable dispatch give insertion thereunto art   on the first day of his attendance after nonattendance by reason of sickness—the judge will at the commencement of the sitting make open declaration thereof and of such declaration the registrar will forthwith make entry on the minutes of the registerbook art   if at any part of the judges vacation time as above it should happen to the judge depute to be nonattendant by reason of sickness as above—like notice of such sickness and publication thereof shall have place as per art   and in this case the judge will be in attendance instead of his depute unless by distance from london such attendance is rendered impracticable art   power to the judge at any time to dislocate or suspend his depute for special cause assigned entry thereof will thereupon be made in the minutes and copy of the instrument of dislocation delivered to the dislocatee power to the judge in this case and with obligation to locate a fresh depute obligation on the judge at the same time his vacation time notwithstanding to attend during  days after such location for the instruction of such his new depute art   responsible in damages will be the judge for any wrong to any individual or body politic or to the public at large by any act positive or negative done by his depute ratiocinative art  —i let it not be thought that by this obligation any apt and competent person will be deterred from subjecting himself to this eventual damage to serve their respective friends or connexions—without remuneration received or expected—men of all descriptions are continually seen exposing themselves to this same risk and this—even after and in consequence of proof of misconduct in some determinate shape in some individual instance on the part of him for whom this risk is incurred witness all instances of binding to good behaviour by recognizance with coobligors ii in the present instance slight will be the risk valuable the compensation given for it—slight the risk for from among all his acquaintance will the functionary have to select the object of his choice valuable on the other hand as will be seen the compensation attached to this risk valuable notwithstanding the terms on which the depute will have to serve see this topic further pursued below art    enactive art   to no pecuniary remuneration in any shape and in particular in the shape of fees will be entitled any judgedepute located under this act instructional art   in addition to the power and dignity naturally and inseparably attached to his office—a remuneration he will have in the prospect of succeeding to the office on the death or dislocation of his principal and consideration had of the peculiar experience obtained by him and the relative aptitude evidenced by him in and by the fulfilment of his duty in respect of such his office—his succession thereto will in a manner take place of course saving always to his majesty his negative as per sect i art          ratiocinative art   as to service without pecuniary remuneration it has place in some thousands of instances on the part of justices of the peace true it is that on the part of those functionaries the service is not obligatcry and on the free will of each one of them depends the time and in good measure the place in which it is performed on the other hand not having unless by corruption any pecuniary remuneration with the exception of the small value in the shape of patronage in respect of the fees received by a clerk—they have not any pecuniary remuneration comparable in value to that which as above is in expectancy in the case of the judgedepute and as to the obligation of duty—in     his case it extends not for a certainty beyond the small quantity of vacation time allowed to the principal as to the casual addition by his sickness it is what may never happen for it is what in experience has in many instances never happened art  0 power to the registrar to locate a depute in like manner as to the judge as per art   art    power to the registrar to dislocate and from time to time suspend his depute in like manner as to the judge per art   art    responsible will be the registrar for any wrong done by his depute in the same manner as is the judge by art   ratiocinative art    of the deputation system applied as it is in general and in particular applied as it is to the offices here in question—namely that of the judge and that of the registrar—but more particularly that of the judge—beneficial effects these— i operating as an efficient cause of the existence of appropriate aptitude in the functionary appropriate aptitude that is to say in all its branches ii affording an experimental demonstration of that same existence iii affording an indication of the degree in which in the instance of each candidate it has place iv in case of deficiency to any amount in respect of any of these requisites—affording facility of dislocation with the least possible commotion on the part of the public mind and with the least possible hurt to the feelings of the individual v produced by the deputation system as here applied may be seen to be these so desirable effects—all of them in conjunction each of them in a manner and degree as yet without example vi as to appropriate aptitude on the part of the depute—appropriate aptitude in all points taken together and more especially moral aptitude at each period of his service the state of his mind in respect of this quality will depend—partly on what it was on entrance into the situation partly on subsequentially intervening circumstances say partly on initial or say original—partly on subsequential aptitude but as to initial aptitude in a prodigious degree more effective is the security afforded in this case than that which is afforded in the ordinary mode of patronage in the present case responsible in a pecuniary way is the principal for the good behaviour of his depute not so in the ordinary case the patron for his protegé mark now in both cases the consequence in the case of the dispatch court—to the judge thereof—that is to say to the judge principal—the aptitude of this object of his choice—of this partner of his fortune—of this his occasional proxy cannot possibly fail to be an object of attentive examination and sincere solicitude while in the ordinary case of a patron no motive whatever capable of making any approach to the degree of force adequate to the production of any such attention has place vii the risk thus incurred as above already alluded to art  —is it in the nature of the case that it should have any such effect as that of preventing a fit person from giving his acceptance to the trust not it indeed for so says continual experience so many instances in which in existing practice one man joins in security for the good behaviour of another—so many instances in which the demonstration is afforded but in this case beyond comparison stronger is the inducement than in those in those cases on the part of the object of the confidence reposed delinquency already manifested is an essentially concomitant circumstance in those same cases to set against and afford compensation for the risk no benefit in any selfregarding shape has place frequently nothing in addition to the simple pleasure of sympathy or say benevolence while in the present case in compensation for a so much inferior risk comes the benefit of rich patronage—the patronage of so high an office and thus it is that in so far as in consequence of the good behaviour of the depute in such his situation he becomes eventually elevated by the competent authority to the rank of principal—the patronage of this important office is virtually and as it were insensibly transferred from an essentially unapt into an essentially apt class of hands from hands indiscriminately occupied in the promotion of justice and injustice to hands exclusively occupied in the promotion of justice viii so much for initial appropriate aptitude now as to subsequential ix or i as to the moral branch here     may be seen each functionarys interest brought into connexion and coincidence with his duty by the closest ties neither by delay nor by expense neither by being lavish of the time nor of the money of other men will any one of these functionaries have profit to gain in any shape while by the care taken to expend of both those precious articles taken together no more than the smallest quantity that consistently with rectitude of decision can be expended reputation will every one of them have to gain—reputation which in his situation is everything x or ii as to appropriate aptitude intellectual and active here by each one of these dispatch court judge deputes with a degree of instructiveness proportioned to the number of the suits that have passed through his hands will be a sort of apprenticeship served preparatory to the subsequent mastership an apprenticeship and in what occupation—not as the unknown political satirist phrases it in the indiscriminate defence of right and wrong but in the pure and undeviating pursuit and support of right xi or iii as to manifestation of the existence of this aptitude and of the degree of it—in the dispatch court in full view of the assembled public by every one of these deputes will demonstration be each day made each such dispatch court judge depute will be a probationer with reference to a permanent situation in one of the contemplated local judicatories xii or iv for the seeking or the acceptance of a situation thus circumstanced what encouragement could present itself to any man who is not inwardly conscious of a competent degree of appropriate aptitude in all its several shapes as above distinguished xiii or v on the other hand suppose the dispatch court out of the question and the local judicatories instituted with what promise of appropriate aptitude would they be to be filled what proof tolerably conclusive what proof so much as faintly presumptive would be to be found anywhere else xiv or vi the greater the number of these deputes whom without lessening through want of experience the probability of rectitude of decision means could be found for employing in the dispatch court—the greater would be the benefit produced in both situations in the dispatch court and in the local judicatories likewise in the dispatch court by augmentation of the number of the suits to which the relief in respect of the delay and expense would be administered in the local judicatories by augmentation of the number of the judicatories for which judges endowed with the thus demonstrated degree of appropriate aptitude would be help up to view and presented for choice vii nor is the name depute an invention of the present day besides the kindred name of deputy employed in so many government offices and to an extent so much greater than could be wished—the institution indicated by the name depute is in scotland exemplified in the case of divers judicial officers witness sheriffdeputes though of the use made of it in the present instance no more than a comparatively small part

such importance and difficulty as that embraced in this section to have before him a preliminary sketch of the whole of the ground on which he is about to tread as marked out by the prime and immediate divisions of it uses throughout derivable from this exhibition—association of clear ideas with the terms employed relations as well of accordance as of difference which have place between the several objects all along made distinctly visible   on the present occasion as on every other to will the end is to will the necessary means by him by whom the end and the necessary means are thus willed—of those some of which are necessary those which to him present themselves as most desirable will of course be willed and employed in preference on the present occasion those whatsoever they may be which to the community in question are deemed most beneficial and least burthensome are those which will be endeavoured to be employed in preference to others   end in view upon the present occasion to the existing mode or say system of judicial     procedure the utter and allcomprehensive inaptitude of which is regarded as demonstrated namely the system styled the regular—the substitution of the assumed completely apt summary mode or say system that is to say after application made to it of such ulterior powers and arrangements as the allcomprehensive extent hereby given to it will be seen to necessitate the measure of aptitude being the degree of conduciveness to the aggregate of the ends of justice   among the means necessary will be seen to be the powers exemptions and checks following checks—that is to say to those same powers and to the powerconferring effect of those same exemptions   in relation to the powers in question subjectmatters of consideration with

valuable or   relatively valuable   by things relativelyvaluable understand things which are such with relation to things infrinsically valuable such are all documents and other written instruments of which it may be of use to the judge as such to have possession principally for the purpose of determining the disposition to be made of things intrinsically valuable and giving facility to the making of it in the number of these same things relatively valuable will be all those the possession of which may be necessary to the application of any of the powers here in question   things intrinsically valuable are either—  corporeal—or   incorporeal or say fictitious  0 things corporeal are—  immoveable for example portions of land with or without edifices thereon erected or works therein made   moveable   complex—that is to say composed of things immoveable with or without moveables thereto belonging and with or without things incorporeal spoken of as attached or otherwise belonging to things or persons   —ii persons on or in relation to whom in quality of subjectmatters of operation powers will have to be exercised are either—  official persons or say judicial functionaries or   persons at large    the official persons are judicial subordinates these subordinates are either—  those which are such with relation to the judge himself or   those which are such in relation to the judges of other courts and in particular the equity courts here in question   —v powers exercisable in relation to these same subjectmatters these are distinguishable into—  powers considered without reference to the application made of them or say powers in the abstract   powers considered with reference to and expressive of the application made of them or say the several purposes to which the exercise given to them applies itself—say powers applied   —i powers in the abstract are—  the prehensive followed of necessity by   the dispositive   the imperative followed of course by and correspondent to power prehensive is in every instance in relation to the same individual subjectmatter power dispositive for whatsoever subjectmatter is for     any purpose of justice taken in hand whether it be thing or person must for that same purpose be in some ulterior way disposed of for the several modifications of the disposition capable of being thus made see below power applied    applicable as well to persons as to things are—  the prehensive and   the dispositive owing to the nature of the subjectmatter applicable to persons alone and not to things is the imperative    according to the nature of the act by which compliance is manifested towards the exercise given to it power imperative is either—  jussive or   inhibitive or say prohibitive jussive where it is by relative motion that the compliance is manifested inhibitive where it is by relative rest that the compliance is manifested positive is the name given to the act when it is by relative motion that it is to be performed or say exercised negative when it is by relative rest synonymous to a negative act is an act of forbearance or say abstinence corresponding verb to forbear to abstain from    reference made to the relative time of the ministerial negative act called for an inhibitive power is distinguishable into—  perpetually inhibitive or   suspensive or say sistitive    considered as being productive of the effect sought by the exercise given to it power imperative is termed coercive the effect coercion—power jussive compulsory or say compulsive the effect compulsion—power inhibitive restrictive the effect restraint   —ii as to the applied powers the names of which are taken from the consideration of the particular purposes to which they are applied those which on the present occasion there will be need for the employment of are the following they constitute the result of the first division made of the great aggregate some of them will of course require to be subjected to ulterior division as the objects requisite to be presented to view become more and more particular and less and less extensive powers thus applied are these—  0—  power sistitive of the imperative this will be seen to be the inhibitive branch applied by the dispatch court judge to the special purpose of stopping ulterior proceedings in the existing courts and in particular the equity courts in which he finds the several suits carrying on the cognizance of which requires for the purpose of this system of dispatch to be transferred to his hands operator magisterial the dispatch court judge operators ministerial the appropriate subordinate functionaries belonging to those same existing functionaries see below tit operators   —  power evocative of that same imperative power this will be seen to be the jussive branch applied to the special purpose of causing to be transferred into the possession of the dispatch court judge the subjectmatters requisite—  operations   things   persons—are these same subjectmatters—  operations or say acts the several acts which may have to be performed in the course of the proceedings by which commencement continuance and termination will be given to the suit thus evoked into the dispatch court—  things the several things intrinsically valuable and relatively valuable the possession of which may become necessary to the exercise given by him to the aggregate of his power whether things corporeal or incorporeal corporeal whether moveable or immoveable—things relatively valuable the several written instruments and other documents if any that have been exhibited in the coart à quo on the occasion of the suit—  persons for the special purpose of securing the transference of those same things and eventually for the elicitation of any such evidence as it may be found necessary to call for at their hands   —  power punitive exercisable on all persons omitting to pay obedience or applying resistance or obstruction to such power imperative as the purpose in question may require to be exercised by the judge special purpose of it—by the fear of it securing obedience to corresponding mandates by the issuing of which exercise is given to the imperative power in its several branches as above   —  power remunerative exercisable for any special purpose in so far as fear of punishment is insufficient for the accomplishment of that same purpose note that remuneration involving in it the necessity of eventual punition for the purpose of obtaining the matter of reward is in its nature more expensive than punishment besides being to a great extent less certain in respect of the production of the effect aimed at   —  power satisfactive exercisable in relation to persons if any by whom suffering shall have been incurred in consequence of aid lent to prehensive power when employed in the endeavour to produce obedience or surmount resistance or obstruction included in satisfaction is compensation   —  power selfextensive exercisable in so far as by experience or well and specificallygrounded and assigned anticipation the several other powers hereby instituted and conferred may have come to be in the eyes of the dispatch court judge insufficient for the accomplishment of the allcomprehensive end or purpose of this act as to this power see art from    to      —  power selfregulative power of making any such ulterior general regulations as may be found necessary to the accomplishment of that same general end or purpose     both these powers being as per article    subject to instant disallowance by any one of the three several conjunctly supreme constituted authorities namely king lords and commons   —vi operators these will in the first place require to be distinguished into—  those by whose acts exercise is given to the several powers—say magisterial the several powerholders   those by whose acts submission or say compliance is manifested in relation to the exercise given to those same powers—say ministerial operators    in both cases the hands employed in the operation may be either the person himself who is spoken of as the operator or those of some other person acting in his stead in the first case the operation and the operator may be said to be immediate in the other case unimmediate in the first place calling in aid the latin language the operation may be styled an operation propriâ manu in the other case an operation alienâ manu    note that where the operator is the judge and the power exercised is the imperative the hands employed by the judge will naturally and most probably be his own the operation an operation propriâ manu where the power exercised is the prehensive if the subjectmatter be a thing corporeal or a person the hands employed will be those of a subordinate styled accordingly a prehensor the operation accordingly in so far as the judge is operator an operation alienâ manu—in so far as it is a thing incorporeal and thence not tangible the act of prehension will like the thing said to be prehended be but fictitious and as will be seen the power really exercised the imperative and thence the operation performed an operation propriâ manu  0 in so far as delegated authority has place the distinction between operations propriâ manu and alienâ manu has place the party delegating operating alienâ manu the party delegated to operating propriâ manu   —vii relative time under this head nothing presents itself as requisite to be said in addition to what is above   —viii purposee according to the most general and comprehensive description that can be given of them to the accomplishment of which the exercise given to several of the abovementioned powers requires to be directed these—   —  giving execution and effect to the ultimate decree or say judgment which the judge on the consideration of the law applying to the case and the facts belonging to the case as presented to his view by the evidence may see reason to pronounce at the conclusion of the suit of which he has taken cognizance call it the ultimate or say executionperforming purpose   —  making appropriate provision beforehand for such execution and effect namely by securing the eventual forthcomingness of the several subjectmatters real and personal necessary call it the instrumental or say executionsecuring purpose   —  securing the exhibition of such appropriate and needful evidence as the individual suit in question happens to have afforded namely by securing the forthcomingness of the source of the evidence in each instance the source whether personal real or written—written consisting of personal exhibited through the medium of real call it the evidencesecuring purpose   —ix occasions on which exercise may come to be given or require to be given to the several abovementioned powers when considered in the most general point of view these may be said to be as follows—   —  for exercise to be given to power imperative need of obedience or say compliance for the several purposes in question as towards the several mandates requisite to be issued by the dispatch court judge   —  for exercise to be given to the prehensive power disobedience resistance or obstruction manifested to the exercise of the imperative power subjectmatters on this occasion operated upon as above persons of all descriptions things of all sorts to the prehension of which resistance or obstruction is opposed or to the subsequent disposal of them according to their several destinations   —  for exercise to be given to power satisfactive power compensative included need of compensation for damage sustained by aid lent in case of necessity to functionaries occupied in surmounting resistance or obstruction as above  0—  for exercise to be given to power remunerative need of the motive produced by hope of good in aid of the operation of the motives produced by fear of evil as applied by exercise given to power punitive for the purpose of surmounting resistance or obstruction as above    to one or other of these heads will be found referable whatsoever operations require to be performed or written instruments to be exhibited in the course of judicial procedure whatsoever may be the subjectmatter of the suit—of procedure whether in a case called civil or in a case called penal enactive art   the judge of the dispatch court when and so soon as he has determined to take to himself the cognizance of any suit at that time depending in any one of the equity courts in question will make the arrangements requisite for staying all proceedings in that same court name of the mandate by the delivery of which such stoppage will be     effected a sistition mandate form as per schedule no viii for the course to be taken for determining whether or no to take cognizance of the suit see section x suits cognisable c and section xiv examination of solicitors enactive—instructional art   persons to all or any of whom such his sistition mandate will upon occasion be addressed the following— i the town solicitors and where need is the country solicitors of the several parties to the suit ii the several parties to the suit iii in the three several branches of the chancery court—towit the lord high chancellors the vice chancellors and the master of the rolls courts—the several masters in chancery iv in the equity side of the exchequer court the remembrancer v any other persons if any such there be to whom for the effectuation of the stoppage it is in the judgment of the dispatch court judge necessary that such sistition mandate be addressed in so doing it will be his object—to produce the requisite effect in the speediest manner and with the fewest mandates possible art   in a case in which the equity suit is by a bill of injunction having for its object the staying the proceedings in a common law suit—power to the dispatch court judge to take cognizance of such equity suit in the same manner as of any other equity suit and in the same manner to hear and determine and give execution and effect to the suit and for this purpose to issue sistition mandates if necessary to any functionaries employed or about to be employed in the common law suit the proceedings in which had been by the bill of injunction stopped as well as to attorneys and any other persons concerned as to ecclesiastical and other courts see arts    and  0 enactive art   exceptions excepted—persons of all sorts—things of all sorts written instruments included—for dealing with all such matters in all such modes as for the purposes of this act that is to say the establishment and employment of the new judicatory in question may be requisite and necessary power is hereinafter given to the dispatch court judge instructional—expositive art   prehension in this may be seen an operation the performance of which may be requisite and necessary in relation to persons of almost all sorts and things of all sorts without exception instructional—expositive art   prehension and imperation in this may be seen the operation which it may be requisite and necessary to perform in relation to persons of all sorts exceptions excepted as per article   —prehension that is to say in some instances without need of antecedent imperation in other instances not unless and until imperation relative thereto has antecedently been performed art   in relation to the same subjectmatter followed of course must exercise given to power prehensive be by exercise given in some shape or other to power dispositive for whatsoever is for any purpose of justice taken in hand will in some ulterior way have to be disposed of enactive art   power prehensive and dispositive power to the judge to cause prehend and for the general purpose of giving execution and effect to his decrees and other mandates to make disposal of all such matters the disposal of which is in any way necessary to the fulfilment of any purpose of this act expositive art   subjectmatter relatively valuable—subjectmatter intrinsically valuable under the one or the other of these heads will all the subjectmatters here in question be comprised by subjectmatters relatively valuable understand all such as are so relation had to the suit be it what it may which on the occasion in question for the purpose of this act the judge is thus taking out of the hands of any at present existing court into his own hands art  0 necessary to the enabling him to make disposal of all such intrinsically valuable things as are subjectmatters of the suit in question will be the possession of those same relatively valuable subjectmatters possession that is to say in conformity to their several and respective natures enactive art    in relation to every suit of which he takes cognizance power is accordingly hereby given to the judge as far as may be to take into his possession all such documents   0 as at that time are or shall thereafter have come to be in the possession of the equity court in which such suit is in pendency towit whether such court be the master of the rolls court the vicechancellors court or the lord high chancellors court art    for this purpose he will issue addressed to the registrar of the high court of chancery his documenttransference mandate     tenor of it as per schedule no ix giving therein notice of a day on or before which the matters in question shall be delivered to the registrar of the dispatch court together with a list of the documents so delivered and of all others if any which are expected and a certificate declaring that the articles in that same list contained are all that have been respectively received or expected art    the power of taking into his     possession the documents belonging to the suit why thus conferred on the judge of the dispatch court answer—reasons— i to the original existing equity court unless and until restored to it as per section xxiii eventual retrotransference of suits they cannot be of any use ii to the dispatch court it may very naturally happen to them to be of use iii for guidance to subsequent relative proceedings knowledge of those antecedent is in the nature of things generally speaking necessary and to this general rule the particular case here in question presents no exception iv the principle is recognised in practice in the case of the transference of the record from the commonlaw courts in westminster to the county courts at the assizes on the occasion on which the trial is performed that is to say after an interval of six or twelve months at the end of which if anything is done it is nothing more than the elicitation of the evidence an operation which might so much better have been performed at the commencement instructional art    in the most ordinary state of things—on the part of the proposed defendant the forthcomingness besides the advantage of contributing     to secure the performance of the service as above in the event of its being found due will have the effect of throwing more light upon the state of the case in respect of the matter of fact than could be thrown upon it by the presence and examination of any other person and in this case by such his presence both these desirable purposes would be accomplished at the same time but if in consequence of such examination as above the state of the case appears to be such that no benefit is likely to be produced either to the other party or to the defendant himself by such his attendance—at any rate not till some light has been thrown upon the facts of the case by the examination of some other person or persons—in this case not of the defendant but of such other person or persons will the examination be taken in the next place thus much as to things really existing called by lawyers things corporeal as for things fictitious called by them things incorporeal or in one word rights and that which prehension will be found to mean when applied to them and in particular those rights in the prehension of which functionaries under the name of sequestrators are wont to be employed in and by the equity courts—as to these things for the prehension of them no intermediate agent will be necessary enactive art    if on the day so appointed such transmission as per art    has not been effected the judge will on the then next day or at any day thereafter dispatch to the official chamber of the registrar a prehensor with directions to prehend and bring with him the instruments in question wheresoever they are to be found for what belongs to a prehensor see section vii prehensors c art    to the exercise of this power should any resistance be made—power to such prehensor to prehend and bring before the judge any or every person so resisting whereupon—after taking and making entry of the examination—to wit of all persons so resisting and of any such other persons to whom it has happened to be in a condition to furnish evidence in relation thereto—he will if he thinks fit whether for the purpose of procuring compliance or for that of punishment for the transgression commit any person so resisting to any such prison in the city of london or any one of the four thereto contiguous counties as to him shall seem meet name of the warrant or say mandate issued for this purpose an incarceration mandate form thereof as per schedule no x art    term for and during which the incarceration produced by such commitment shall be appointed to continue—any number of days not exceeding seven entire days exclusive of odd hours reckoning from the moment of commitment—the hour as well as day of liberation being in the mandate of commitment mentioned—which said time may as often as shall be judged by him to be needful he renewed by a fresh incarceration mandate and may at any time be terminated by a disincarceration mandate form thereof as per schedule no xi art    to the exercise of such prehensive power should any resistance or destruction be opposed power to the prehensor to give exercise to his appropriate aidcompelling power as per section vii prehensor c art    art    for giving execution and effect to such documenttransference mandate as per art    power to such prehensor to call upon any person belonging to any office appertaining to any such equity courts to aid him in the selection of the appropriate instruments and in case of refusal or apparently intended delay in respect of the performance of such service to prehend any such person and bring him before the judge who will accordingly deal by him as per art          art    of all proceedings carried on in relation to the exercise given to any of the above powers—including all evidence thereto relative—the registrar under the direction of the judge will take minutes and make entry in the register art  0 in these minutes will be contained not only the evidence elicited but the questions or say interrogatories by which the several statements were respectively elicited and in both instances the very words which were employed art    after such transference as above—to whatsoever written instruments or other documents it shall have happened to be delivered in or tendered to any office belonging to the abovenamed equity courts as per art    the officer having the direction of the business of such office is hereby required on the earliest day thereafter possible to transfer the same to the office of the dispatch court registrar as per art   —and to every such subsequentlyreceived instrument apply the powers for securing the transference thereof as above—and moreover to these several provisions the lord high chancellor vicechancellor and master of the rolls are hereby required in case of need to do what depends upon them respectively towards giving execution and effect art    to the equity side of the court of exchequer apply the several powers by articles    to  0 applied to these several abovementioned divisions of the equity side of the high court of chancery but in such sort that whatsoever in those same chancery cases applies to the registrar applies in the case of the exchequer court to the remembrancer     art    subjectmatters intrinsically valuable or in relation to which exercise may be given to the judges power of prehension are—all subjectmatters of which in the nature of things the prehension is possible expositive art    these same subjects are either persons or things things are either corporeal or incorporeal things corporeal again are either immoveable or moveable follow exemplifications and explanations presently art    in relation to things intrinsically valuable apply all the several powers as above by articles    to  0 applied to the purpose of surmounting noncompliance resistance and obstruction to prehension and disposal of things relatively valuable art    purposes for which such prehension may be made—prehension whether of things or persons—these— i executioneffecting purpose giving execution and effect to that disposition of substantive law on which the suit is grounded—executioneffecting or say ultimate or effective purpose ii executionsecuring purpose securing to the judge the means of effecting the aforesaid effective purpose in the event of his seeing reason so to do—executionsecurity or say interlocutory intermediate interventional provisional enabling instrumental or defeasible purpose iii evidencesecuring purpose making effective provision for the elicitation of such evidence as it has happened to the suit to afford in relation to the several matters of fact on which the demand and the defence respectively shall have been grounded—securing the elicitation of the evidence that is to say by securing the forthcomingness of the persons things and written instruments or other documents which are respectively the sources of it instructional art    on the occasion of exercise given to the judges prehensive power—mementos which for his guidance in respect of the choice to be made by him of subjectmatters of such exercise he is required to bear in mind are these which follow— i introductory observation this not only in respect of the subjectmatter of the suit but in respect of money for incidental costs may need of prehension have place hence to any degree small may be the sums for the discharge of which prehension may have to be made and to any degree indigent may persons be whose misfortune it is to have been made defendants ii in making prehension for the executionsecuring purpose—take such subjectmatters as are applicable to the executioneffecting purpose in preference to such as are not iii accordingly in preference to persons† take things that is to say things of all sorts—moveable immoveable and incorporeal iv among things—in preference to those which are valuable to no person but the owner and other things not valuable to the plaintiff take such as are valuable to the plaintiff—that is to say capable of being rendered so by transference of possession temporary or definitive v in preference to things by the prehension of which no effect can be produced other than that of burthen‡ to the defendant—take those by the prehension of which benefit as well as burthen is producible that is to say benefit to the acquirer thereof as well as burthen to the loser vi among things by the prehension of which benefit as well as burthen is producible—take in preference those by which the greatest benefit to the plaintiff is producible in preference to those by the prehension of which no benefit is producible to the plaintiff or not so much as by the prehension of other things vii accordingly in preference to things incorporeal or say rights not transferable—take things corporeal or rights transferable viii in preference to a thing in which a third person—that is to say a person who is not a party to the suit—or say who is a stranger to the suit has an interest or say a share—take things in which no person other than the party in question has a share ix not that by any such extraneous interest any objection will be afforded if it be clear that by the prehension of the thing in     question the interest of such stranger to the suit is not damnified or being damnified will have received adequate satisfaction in every shape compensation for the damage included x take for example the mode of prehension styled under the existing system foreign attachment—stopping the payment of a debt due to the defendant in the suit stopping the payment that is to say with a view to its being actually or eventually made to the plaintiff in that same suit for forasmuch as the money is in all events to be parted with it will commonly make no difference to the stranger to the suit in question whether it be by the one party or the other that it is received xi of the case where by the prehension the interest of a stranger to the suit is liable to be affected not this instance at the hands whether of an individual or of government the defendant receives—in the shape of salary for example—a continuous remuneration for correspondently continuous service due if so it be that by abstraction made of the portion in question of such his pecuniary means the service capable of being rendered by him is liable to be rendered less valuable to the stranger to the suit as above the detriment to the interest of the stranger will be to be taken into account xii in preference to a subjectmatter of which the party has not the actual possession but only in relation to it the right of possession to be taken in future absolutely or in contingency—take one of which he has the actual possession for example to the prehension of an estate in land in remainder or reversion for the purpose of raising money by the sale of it—take in preference an estate in possession of equal marketable value for commonly such thereaftereventuallyabouttobepossessed estate will not sell without more disadvantage to the party than in the other case xiii note that if of things by the prehension of which burthen alone is produced prehension is allowed to be performed—it is only either for the executionsecuring purpose or for the evidencesecuring purpose for if by execution no benefit to the plaintiff is produced the only beneficial executioneffecting purpose is instead of being fulfilled disfulfilled by the imposition of any such burthen no good purpose other than that of punishment can in any shape be produced and for punishment by the supposition in the sort of suit in question namely a purely civil suit no demand has place in a suit of this class if any such demand has place it must be on the ground of some transgressions committed in the course of the suit in the dispatch court xiv among things by the prehension of which benefit to the plaintiff will be produced as well as burthen be imposed on the defendant—take those by the prehension of which without lessening that same benefit burthen the least afflictive will be imposed on the defendant in preference to those by prehension of which burthen more afflictive will be imposed on that same defendant xv example—for the executioneffecting purpose—in preference to household goods or stock in trade for the purpose of their being sold take portions of government annuities commonly and familiarly called money in the funds or stocks xvi in preference to things for the prehension of which the more complex and thence the less surely effective and more expensive mode of operation is necessary—take those for the prehension of which the less complex and thence the more surely effective and less expensive mode will suffice xvii example here likewise the preference given as above to prehension of money in the funds xviii further exemplification of the mode of minimizing afflictiveness—whether it be for the executioneffecting or the executionsecuring purpose—take in preference to useful household furniture trinkets and furniture merely ornamental and in preference to necessary tools and other instruments of workmanship household furniture useful as well as ornamental in a word all such things as are not necessary in preference to all such as are xix for the purpose of effecting the transmission of a right to a valuable thing for the use of the plaintiff at the charge of the defendant—never will the judge seek to employ the unwilling hand of another person in preference to the effecting it by his own hand or by willing hands under his command xx accordingly only for the elicitation of evidence—whether for the purpose of determining the right to the subjectmatter in dispute—or for the purpose of ascertaining the existence and securing the eventual forthcomingness of the things in question—or of property of the defendant to be received in lieu of them—will the judge prehend the body of the defendant never for no other purpose than such as the compelling his signature to a deed by which the right to the thing in question is transmitted to the plaintiff or to any person on his account for if effected by the signature of the judge the transmission of the property might be the work of no more than a single instant if endeavoured at by compulsion applied to the individual it might be staved off for years or be prevented altogether     art    on whatever occasion the judge performs prehension at the charge of one party—it will be his care to exact at the charge of the party at whose instance or in whose favour he performs it such adequate countersecurity against abuse as the nature of the case and the circumstances of the parties appear to him to require enactive art    in regard to any mass of property constituting the whole or any part of the subjectmatter of the suit—power to the judge to place the same for the purpose of the suit under the care and management of persons one or more—in such number as he shall deem requisite—to be chosen and approved of by joint choice and consent of all persons interested therein and if after the party or parties on one side have made their choice the party or parties on the other side refuse—or after invitation received and adequate time allowed omit—to make their choice nominating accordingly the same or some other person or persons—power to the judge himself to make such choice and nomination in their stead name of a person so appointed a consignee as to these see section viii art  0 at the instance of any party to the suit or of his own motion—power to the judge at any time to cause to appear before him and submit himself to wordofmouth examination every such consignee or say trustee touching his proceedings on the occasion of the trust instructional art    note that this special power he would have in virtue of his general powers sole cause of the special mention thus made of it—maximization of the security against misconception and misinterpretation in relation     to a matter of such essential importance to the end that the efficiency of this same security may be the more clearly and fully conceived art    reciprocally beneficial will be the application made of these several powers at the charge of the plaintiff for the benefit of the defendant as well as at the charge of the defendant for the benefit of the plaintiff instructional—ratiocinative art    for the guidance of the judge are these suggestions delivered not in any instance for the imposing on him a peremptory obligation forasmuch as to an extent more or less considerable in many instances it is not on any one of these pairs of competing circumstances considered by itself but on several of them considered in conjunction that upon the whole the course most proper to be taken will depend enactive—ratiocinative—expositive art    in vain would be created and conferred on a dispatch court judge the powers in general terms above mentioned if the giving special and effective exercise to them depended on the concurrence of any authority coordinate or superordinate to his own accordingly deemed wrongs and constituted offences are hereby all acts having for their object or tendency the frustrating or weakening the relief hereby intended to be administered to suitors and persons having need to become suitors and against those wrongs provided will be seen hereafter the several appropriate remedies by means of the correspondent specific powers acts hereby constituted offences by whomsoever committed whether he be a suitor a public functionary or an individual at large are accordingly those here following— i noncompliance with or say disobedience to or nonobservance of any mandate issued by the judge for the sistition editor of the suit or for the transference of any written instrument or subjectmatter thereto belonging as per articles              ii resisting the transference of any written instrument or any other document from any other court to the dispatch court resisting—that is to say by physical force in an immediate way applied iii obstructing such transference obstructing that is to say preventing or needlessly retarding it or doing any act in the intention of preventing or needlessly retarding it iv purposely forbearing or through negligence omitting to afford aid to such transmission when by or by authority of the dispatch court judge requisition of such aid has been made v of anything immoveable resisting or obstructing the prehension or prehensionfollowing or say post prehensive legal disposal when the thing has been prehended or endeavoured to be prehended by authority from the judge for any purpose of this act vi so of anything moveable vii so of any incorporeal subjectmatter of property in which case the resistance or obstruction may be figurative corresponding to the nature of the subjectmatter viii retaking or endeavouring to retake any written instrument or other document or thing immoveable or moveable after prehension as above ix resisting or obstructing the prehension or consequent legal disposal—say the postprehensive disposal—made of any person when endeavoured to be effected for or on account of any such resistance obstruction omission or recapture as aforesaid x resisting or obstructing in the justicechamber any of the proceedings of the dispatch court during the sitting thereof xi in relation to any relatively important matter of fact endeavour used to produce deception in the mind of the judge acting as such endeavour by whatever means—whether immediately or through the medium of any other person or of any thing and whether by communication of deceptions information by word of mouth or in writing or by any other signs evanescent or permanent or by suppression of instructive information xii liberating or endeavouring to liberate any person by force or fraud from any such prehension or postprehensive legal disposal as above exemplificative art    of obstruction to the proceedings of the dispatch court judge during the sitting of the judicatory—exemplifications these— i motion produced in any mode productive of that effect     ii sound produced in any mode inarticulate or articulate by its loudness or otherwise productive of that effect iii in particular ungrounded illwill or contempt by language gesture or deportment manifested towards the judge or any other person during the sitting of the judicatory iv continuance to speak after silence imposed by the judge art    of the modes of such effectuation of or endeavour at deception examples are the following— i false assertion whether spontaneous or in answer to any question or say interrogatory put in relation to the suit in hand—whether by the judge or by any other person hereby authorized to put the same—interrogatory whether in the oral or say wordofmouth form or in the written form oral including all other evanescent forms of discourse written all other permanent forms of discourse ii forgery of or committed upon any document employed or designed to be employed or of a nature to be employed in the character of evidence in any suit transferred to or instituted in or designed to be transferred to or instituted in the dispatch court forgery whether defalcative fabricative or alterative iii suppression as applied to any evidentiary document in the form of writing or in any other tangible and permanent form—suppression to wit whether definitive destructive included or temporary and whether of the document itself or of the information of its existence iv personation committed by the delinquents pretending to be this or that other person v suppression of any material evidence which might otherwise have been orally delivered suppression—of evidence from whatsoever source personal real or written and whether by deception by physical force by intimidation or by hope or receipt of remuneration vi production of or endeavour to produce by any other means in the mind of the judge deception in relation to any relevant and relatively important matter of fact relation had to the event or to the course of the suit enactive—instructional art    evilconsciousness and heedlessness or say want of due attention in meting out the quantity of punishment the judge will bear in mind and hold up to view the differences produced by these two circumstances in the evil of the offence ratiocinative art    on evilconsciousness depends almost the whole of the evil of the second order composed as it is of danger and alarm danger of repetition by the delinquent himself or others similarly circumstanced alarm produced by the apprehension of that same danger as to the evil of the first order it consists in the suffering actually felt by individual sufferers where there are any such persons as in the case of a private offence there are always—in that of a purely public offence never in the case of a purely public offence where the subjectmatter of the offence is a subjectmatter of property—money say or moneys worth—and nothing else were it not for the evil of the second order as above no preponderant evil at all would be produced no suffering to set against the enjoyment the prospect of which constituted the motive to the offence the evil of the second order consisting as above of danger and alarm is in the case of heedlessness at the utmost small commonly next to none in the case of evilconsciousness with intention naturally persisting in extent in some cases commensurate with that of the whole country and its population—witness the case of an offence contributing to war whether foreign or civil—it is in most cases indefinite not to say infinite enactive art    power to the dispatch court judge to cause to be prehended and incarcerated any person by whom any such frustration as per art    shall have been endeavoured to be effected—time of prehension the very instant after the commission of the offence or as soon thereafter as may be and this whether the time and place of the endeavour be that of the sitting of the judicatory or if need be any other art    term of incarceration no longer     than seven full days but renewable at discretion toties quoties by a fresh mandate or addition made to a former mandate as often as the purpose shall be found to require ratiocinative art    why such renewals and these repeated at the end of such short terms— answer—reasons—   that by forgetfulness the offender may not be left in a state of sufferance for a longer term than one week   that the powercontrouling eye of public opinion may be the more frequently drawn down upon the transaction instructional art  0 safe custody merely or coercion—whichsoever of these two different objects it is that the purpose requires the judge will on this occasion be careful to have in view expositive art    coercion is either positive or negative positive that is to say compulsive or in one word compulsion negative that is is to say restrictive or in one word restraint enactive—instructional art    if safe custody only be the object his endeavour will be to find some apt individual to whom with the consent of the person to be placed under such custody he may accordingly be so placed art    only in case no such apt person can be found will the offender in question be consigned to a prison art    some one person being responsible as consignee pecuniarily responsible may be rendered other persons in any other number in so far as necessary art    when coercion is the purpose—as for example compelling disclosure or actual delivery of a thing moveable—apt for this purpose as consignee can be no other person than the keeper of a prison instructional art    in what prison the incarceration shall in this case have place the dispatch court judge will determine regard being had to convenience in respect of nearness of the prison to the justicechamber and aptitude of the accommodation capable of being afforded by it art    for the interval during which a person about to be consigned to the custody of a friend of his choice is on the lookout for such friend—he will continue in the custody of a prehensor—principal or depute and in such custody he will continue and if need be go about in quest of such consignee until the time allotted by the judge for the purpose has elapsed ratiocinative art    extinguished on this plan will be the delay expense and vexation attached to the practice of holding to bail as at present carried on enactive art    on or at any time after such incarceration—power to the judge to liberate the offender on his finding security for the eventual surrender of his body in any such mode or modes in and by which to all parties taken together the least quantity of inconvenience danger of loss included promises in his opinion to be produced instructional art    referable to one or other of four   0 heads will be found every remedy capable of being applied to the wrong done by any maleficent act those here in question included which by prohibition explicit or virtual has been converted into an offence namely i the preventive or say the anticipative or antecedently preventive ii the suppressive iii the satisfactive including the compensative iv the punitive or say the subsequentially or ulteriorly preventive remedies preventive or suppressive are the above powers and such applications as are hereby intended to be made of them instructional art  0 persons by whom for the application of any one of these remedies the requisite proceedings may be instituted these— i an individual alleging himself to be or in danger of becoming a sufferer by any hereby as above prohibited offence ii his majestys attorneygeneral iii the dispatch court judge himself of his own motion instructional—expositive—enactive art    now as to the punitive remedy for the misdemeanours in art    mentioned—all of them detrimental to the ends of justice in general and to the end and purpose of this institution in particular—the judge will apply pecuniary punishment or say mulct and imprisonment or say incarceration at option and at discretion at option that is to say having the choice whether he will employ one of the two and which or both at discretion that is to say having at his choice in regard to whichever of them he employs the quantity of it he will employ instructional—exemplificative art    note well—that the suffering and thence the punishment for the offence does not commence till after and at the point at which the enjoyment and thence the profit in all shapes from the offence is taken away towit by pecuniary loss or by other punishment to an equivalent amount a punishment which falls short of being equivalent to the profit by the offence operates by the exact amount of the difference in the character of a reward this accordingly will the judge in meting out the quantity of the punishment be careful to bear in mind and to apply to practice art    mulct appointed for the species of offence suppose £  profit by the individual offence £ 0 consequence of the proposed penal law reward to the amount of £  in name and outward show the law is penal in effect it is remunerative operating in a way the exact reverse of that which in appearance at least was intended art    in meting out the quantity of the mulct the judge will be directed not by the absolute quantity but by the relative quantity relation had to the pecuniary circumstances of the delinquent in the breast of a person by whom property is possessed to the value of £ 0000 less suffering will naturally be produced by a mulct of £ 0000 than in the breast of a person who has no more than forty shillings would be produced by a mulct of ten shillings such is the interpretation which he will accordingly put upon the statute called the bill of rights in which it is said excessive punishment ought not to be inflicted art    offence say perjury or subornation of perjury punishment suppose transportation or imprisonment with hard labour for seven years less afflictive might it be to the offender to lose half or more of his disposable property though it were £ 0000 or £ 00000 than be subjected for that length of time to that species of punishment instructional art    for information as to the pecuniary circumstances of the offender—the judge in so far as in his judgment the relative amount of the mulct contemplated renders it worth while will make special inquiry and this as well by the evidence of the offender himself as by evidence from any other quarter or say extraneous evidence as to this see section xix see also as to the undangerousness and positive advantage of the powers herein conferred note at the end of section xxiv art    for the bringing into the shape of money whatsoever he thinks proper to be taken in the way of mulct the judge will take into account and so far as meet is take in hand and dispose of whatsoever property the delinquent himself has power to dispose of†     enactive—instructional art    exceptions excepted—the pecuniary punishment in so far as the means of undergoing it have place will be preferred to the corporal ratiocinative art    the pecuniary why preferred to the corporal punishment answer—reasons— i in the case of the pecuniary to wit out of the evil produced by the punishment cometh forth—over and above the good consisting in the subsequentiallypreventive efficiency of punishment additional good to wit profit applicable to the use of the individual wronged or the public or both as the circumstances of the case may require out of the corporal punishment—good over and above such preventive efficiency none ii in this case imprisonment will be the punishment specially suited to the circumstances of the indigent—pecuniary to those of the opulent offender enactive—instructional art    exception is—where of divers cooffenders one being relatively indigent is as far as can be learnt likely to receive for any mulct imposed on him compensation at the hands of one or more who are relatively opulent in this case to the opulent it may be proper to apply in addition to the pecuniary the corporal punishment lest after indemnifying his accomplice he should be in receipt of net profit in any shape from the inefficiency of the punishment enactive—instructional art  0 for the offence be it what it may where pecuniary is the shape in which in the whole or in any part the punishment is applied—to the purpose of satisfaction to wit in the shape of compensation for the suffering in all shapes produced on the part of individuals will the produce of the mulct be applied in preference to the public revenue ratiocinative art  0—reasons these— i not less great is the subsequentiallypreventive efficiency of the forced transfer when employed to the profit of the individual than if employed to the profit of the public revenue ii commonly it is even greater inasmuch as if there be any difference if the purse into which the profit goes is that of the individual whom it has been his the offenders endeavour to cause to suffer and to whom he accordingly bears ill will the suffering produced by the contemplation of the profit and enjoyment by such transfer will naturally be greater than will be the suffering produced by the contemplation of it if the receiving purse is that of the public at large toward which no such illwill was borne by him enactive—instructional art    if the pecuniary circumstances of the party damnified are better than those of the delinquent the judge will not take from the delinquent anything beyond what is adapted to the subsequentiallypreventive purpose of punishment for if he does the more he takes the greater will be the aggregate composed of the sufferings of the two parties     ratiocinative art    the power to administer compensation and award damages why thus conferred on the judge of the dispatch court answer—reasons— i true it is—that under the regular system by judges are costs alone awarded by jury damages true but no reason does this precedent afford why it should be so under the here proposed summary system ii if a suitor has to pay a given sum say £ 0 what matters it to him whether it is by the fiat of a jury or of a judge that he has to pay it—or whether instead of costs or damages the word employed be fine so far as concerns the sum on one and the same occasion paid by him—altogether immaterial to him as above is the difference     iii that in the present case compensation for suffering occasioned by misconduct should be awarded—is exactly as needful—as decidedly required by justice—as in every other case but if awarded at all it is by this same judge that it must be awarded for by no other authority can it be by a jury it cannot be awarded without giving existence to the very evil which the hereproposed institution is employed to annihilate iv to the judge by the supposition every particular—on the one hand of the suffering—on the other of the misconduct by which it has been caused—is immediately and directly known by no fresh evidence by no fresh argumentation could it be rendered more particularly or more completely so v to the cognizance of a jury would be to be presented instead of the phenomena themselves—at the end of an interval by which the image of the facts in the memory would have been more or less truncated obscured and distorted an alleged description given by somebody or other it is neither easy nor material to say who of these same facts—a portrait ornamented on both sides with an embroidery of costly and useless eloquence vi but if as above to the quantity of money allowed to be abstracted on the score of punishment no certain limit can with propriety be prescribed—how can or why should any such limit be prescribed to the quantity allowed to be abstracted on the score of compersation or say damages by whatsoever is abstracted from a man on the score of punishment in no other shape can good be produced than that of the contribution made to the prevention of subsequent similar offences—to the would made by the past offence no healing balsam is applied—whereas by every particle of the matter of good not merely abstracted from the author of the wrong but transferred to the sufferer by that same wrong the would is in proportion closed and contribution so far made to a perfect cure vii as per article   indispensable necessity requires that for execution and effect to be given to them the decrees and other mandates of the dispatch court judge should not be in any way or degree dependent on the freewill of any other judicatory viii because though nothing hinders that under the procedure of the judge a jury might be put to officiate in this dispatch court—yet of the complication of the machinery necessary to the introduction of that system and the uncertainty resulting from the want of all determinate rules for its guidance a quantity of delay and expense incompatible with the application of the summary course of procedure to the field here in question would be the unpreventible result†     enactive—ratiocinative—expositive art    lest any evidence which it has happened to the suit to afford should remain unemployed and for want of it deception and misdecision be produced—created and conferred on the judge of the dispatch court to be applied to the purpose of this act are the ulterior powers following— i power to elicit evidence from all sources without exception—sources whether personal real or written quasiwritten included personal derived from persons real derived from the appearances of things written derived from persons and communicated through the medium of things that is to say paper written on or any other matter so dealt with as to constitute a visible or tangible and permanent instrument of discourse personal evidence whether that of an evidenceholder at large or say an extraneous evidenceholder or that of an evidenceholding party on either side of the suit who respectively are by this same means rendered evidenceyielders art   —ii so to elicit evidence in all shapes that is to say whether responsive or spontaneous—responsive that is to say in answer to questions or say interrogatories—spontaneous that is to say uttered by a person to whom on the occasion in question no interrogatories have as yet been addressed—responsive whether by oral or say wordofmouth answers to questions orally uttered or epistolarily uttered in a written or quasiwritten shape the evidence elicited in the orallyuttered shape being by means of counterinterrogation and otherwise more effectually secured against the danger of being contributory to deception in the epistolarilyuttered shape admissible for the purpose of obviating expense or delay or both when likely to have place in such quantity as by the evil thereof to outweigh the evil likely to be produced by the probability of misdecision that is to say for want of the security afforded against it by the oral mode of elicitation subject to counterinterrogation as above art   —iii so on every occasion to permit questions to be put not only by parties on both sides and their several professional assistants but also by any other person at large by whose interrogation a promise appears to be afforded of its being productive of instructive answers     art   —iv so of his own motion or say spontaneously to put questions to a person under examination or say an examinee so it be vivâ voce and in open judicatory without waiting for spontaneous narration on the part of the examinee or for questions put to him from any other source as above ratiocinative art    why admit of the judges instituting—of his own motion without application from any other quarter an examination and thereby a suit answer—reasons— i of information from any other quarter the only use is in relation to the facts in question to plant knowledge in the mind of the judge ii this being the case—if by means of his own observation such knowledge be possessed by him so much the better iii obviated by the means here in question is the danger of the evidences not being possessed by him at all namely by reason of its not being presented to him from without iv so likewise all such delay and expense as might have been produced by the presentation of it at a later period v to such knowledge by what means soever obtained by the judge the same publicity will of course be given as will be to any extraneous evidence vi on this plan in case of delinquency in any shape the certainty† of the application of the punitive and of the other remedies in so far as respectively applicable will be at its maximum     enactive—instructional art    for the obtainment of evidence which how material soever might not otherwise have been obtainable although in a superior degree presenting a probability of being impartial and thence trustworthy—created hereby and conferred on the dispatch court judge is the additional power following by means of the evidence elicited at the outset the judge will in many cases see reason to believe that from such or such an individual considered in the character of an evidenceholder evidence material to the suit may in all probability be elicited in such case whatsoever advance if any of money is regarded by him as requisite to be made to such evidenceholder power is hereby given to him to cause it to be made made by all parties in so far as they actually take part in the suit and this without regard to the question in whose favour such evidence is most likely to operate art    in what proportion such advance shall be made by the several parties the judge will determine consideration had of their respective pecuniary circumstances art    for the purpose of securing compliance with this requisition he may announce to each such party his intention in the event of noncompliance to proceed as if the evidence in question having been elicited had been in any degree how high soever unfavourable to the interest of such noncomplying party and accordingly in case of necessity so may he proceed and such noncompliance may be considered and spoken of by him as an exemplification of that species of fraud the result of evilconsciousness which is practised by suppression of evidence ratiocinative art    reasons—evils by this same power obviated— i evil the first misdecision through mendacity produced by bribery ii cut off will thus be a source of undue favour which under the existing system has place on the part of witnesses namely under the notion of advance made for no more than the expense necessitated by the journey to and fro with demurrage and compensation for loss of time—receipt of money in excess in addition to what is necessary—money     advanced for the purpose and with the effect of a bribe by committing to the discretion of the judge the determination of the sum and the imposing—upon all parties—alike or in proportion to their pecuniary circumstances respectively the burthen of the advance—this source of corruption will be cut off iii evil the second oppression and depredation by imposition of needless costs in the present state of things a suitor who in respect to the subjectmatter of contestation is confident of being deemed to have right on his side—and on that score of obtaining the reimbursement of his costs at the hands of the party or parties on the other side—has it in his power to heap oppression on his adversary to an indefinite amount by needless expenditure on this score oppression—and moreover depredation for the benefit of persons connected with him—for example his solicitors or other lawyers iv the richer a man is the stronger is the temptation into which he may be led by the invitation thus given to him by the existing state of things v this is among the resources which will of course be seen presenting themselves to the hand of the dishonest—the malâ fide suitor and his authorized professional accomplice enactive—exemplificative art    if a question the ultimate decision of which depends jointly upon the proceedings in an equity court and those in an ecclestastical court is in pendency in an equity court—cognizance thereof may be taken by and thence transference made of both suits into the dispatch court examples are as follows— i if on the ground of insanity the validity of a marriage is disputed or about to be disputed in an ecclesiastical court ii if the subject of contestation is the validity of a last will or the disposal of the property under it enactive—ratiocinative—exemplificative art  0 as to the designation of the species of subordinate courts not sufficiently comprehensive is the preceding article another example is afforded by whatsoever intercourse an equity court holds with any commonlaw court whether of record or not of record it is therefore hereby provided that whatsoever authority in the course of any suit for the effectuation of the object of the suit the equity court has need to make exercise of in relation to the proceedings of any court thereby and in so far rendered subordinate to it or in relation to any functionary thereto belonging the same authority is the dispatch court authorized to exercise in relation to that same subordinate court enactive—ratiocinative art    dispatch court judges selfextensive and provisionally or say eventual enactive powers lest for want of adequate power in the judicatory the beneficial purpose of this act should in any respect fail of being fulfilled—power is hereby given to the judge from time to time to make any such provisional arrangements—subject to disallowance by his majesty or either house of parliament in manner hereinafter mentioned—as in his judgment shall for that purpose have been found requisite and necessary name of the instrument by which any such arrangement is effected a judiciarybred eventual act or statute supplemental to—this present act naming it instructional art    circumstances indication of which will be attached to

commons for the use of the house of commons another in like manner to the speaker of the house of lords for the use of the house of lords and another to the president of his majestys privy council for his majestys use and of such several deliveries notice will on that     same day in like manner be delivered for immediate insertion to the printer of the london gazette and to the printers of such

commons—will be seven full days exclusive of the day on which the delivery of the printed copy of the supplement in question has been made art    days from which the length of time will be computed these— i during the sitting of parliament neither house being in a state of adjournment the day of delivery as above ii in the case of the house of lords—if the house be under adjournment the day on which the house meets iii in the case of the house of commons if the house be in a state of adjournment the day on which the house meets iv during the recess in the case of his majesty—if neither absent at more than one hundred miles distance from his majestys palace in the metropolis nor labouring under an indisposition incapacitating him from attention to business—the day on which such delivery as above is made to the president of his majestys privy council v if absent at a distance greater than one hundred miles—the day on which his majesty has returned to his said palace or arrived elsewhere within that same distance as certified to the judge of the dispatch court by the said president vi if labouring under indisposition as aforesaid—the day on which such indisposition shall have ceased as in like manner certified to the judge of the dispatch court by the said president enactive art    power to the judge to add to any amount to the abovementioned length of time but not to defalcate from it art    on each individual occasion respect for the legislative authorities will dispose him to make any such addition as can be made without detriment to the ends of justice enactive art    if on any occasion through inadvertence or under the pressure of some unforeseen exigency it should happen to him to have made defalcation—such defalcation may be on his part a misdemeanour but no act which on the ground of the exercise so given to his provisionallylegislative power he may have performed in his judicial capacity will on that account be void art    of the issuing of such eventual act information will be given by the registrar by delivery of a printed copy thereof under the signature of the judge to the several constituted authorities in manner following— i to his majesty by delivery to the president of his majestys privy council ii to the house of lords by delivery to the speaker thereof iii to the house of commons by delivery to the speaker thereof iv to the secretary of state for the home department by delivery to the secretary for the time being or any undersecretary of his instructional art    to the care of the judge it will

take its place among the temporary acts of that same or if parliament be not sitting of the preceding session and will bear on its title the name of the day on which it begins to be in force art    of such certificate as per art    immediate notification will under the care of the said president be made to all suitors of the dispatch court and to the public at large in the london gazette to wit in a gazette ordinary or extraordinary as the case may require art    to such disallowance or suspension as per art    expression will be given in manner following— i if effected by his majesty by the word disallowed or the words suspended until     meeting of parliament written on the instrument in question with his majestys signature thereto attached and the countersignature of the president of his majestys privy council ii if effected as above by the president of his majestys privy council—by the single signature of the said president iii if effected by the house of lords—by the words by the house and the signature of the speaker thereof iv if effected by the house of commons—by the words by the house and the signature of the speaker thereof art    for the purposes aforesaid—power to his majesty from time to time to appoint to officiate as deputy to the president of his majestys privy council on the occasion of his majestys absence as above or indisposition—any other member of his majestys said council art    each such judiciarybred eventual act when by expiration of the disallowance time it has received the assent of his majesty and the two houses and thus passed into a

those regulations of generallyapplying and permanent effect which in the language of the westminsterhall courts are styled orders or rules and orders ratiocinative art    this selfextensive power—why give to the judge a power thus unprecedented answer—reason—beneficial effects the following— i making without the delay of an act of parliament and the correspondent consumption of the time of parliament provision for unforeseen defects and exigencies ii committing to the functionary who by his appropriate aptitude derived from such experience and correspondent attention as cannot have had place in the instance of any other person is best qualified the duty of making on each occasion the provision requisite iii giving an example of an arrangement having for one of its objects or say ends in view the maintenance of the constitutional subordination of the judicial authority to that of the legislature iv in outside show by this arrangement addition is made to the power of the judge in design it is and in effect it will be seen to be—the applying a limitation to it and that a highly needful one   0 enactive art    to the validity of any article in any such judiciarybred provisional act its repugnancy how decided soever to any preceding act of parliament will not constitute any objection     ratiocinative art   —reasons— i scarcely proposed could be any enactment in relation to which might not be found in this or that statute some general clause to which such proposed enactment might not and not altogether without truth be stated as repugnant ii witness for example the clause in magna charta we will not deal with any man so and so but by the judgment of his equals or by the law of the land here then it might be said is a law of the land to which the proposed enactment in question would be repugnant iii an enactment having its origin in this source would not in any instance have received the force of law without having received the assent of all three branches of the legislative body as truly as any act of parliament that ever was made iv of judgemade law every proposition to which the force of law is given is repugnant at any rate to this clause of magna charta and commonly to this or that clause in some other statute v no ground can be stated for any apprehension of a plan formed by the judge of this proposed court for giving to his power any extension detrimental to the ends of justice vi purged as he is of sinister interest by the disallowance of all fees no motive for any such undue extension could he have vii supposing him actuated by any such sinister motive no ground could he have for any such hope as that of seeing any such plan carried into effect not proposable by him could be any enactment which would not run counter or be thought to run counter to the particular interest of judges and of all persons linked to them by a community of sinister interests—and thereby excite and bring out into action their opposition to it in both houses if for such opposition any colour could be found enactive art    null and void will be any operation by which—immediately or in whatsoever degree remotely—obstruction is offered to the operation of the dispatch court for example by certiorari writ of error mandamus to or from a commonlaw court injunction by or appeal from an equity court by any such proceeding should any such obstruction be attempted the dispatch court judge will proceed as if no such proceeding had issued art    in pursuance of an incarceration mandate from the dispatch court judge a person suppose has been incarcerated—and by some existing judicatory a writ of habeas corpus—or say a bodyadduction mandate—has been served upon or say delivered to the keeper of the prison in which the incarceration has place in this case—if for the issuing of such bodyadduction mandate the judicatory in question has lawful authority—obedience thereto will in course be paid but with the body the keeper will transmit the incarceration mandate and upon sight thereof the judicatory in question is hereby required to remand the prisoner in the custody in which he came to the prison from which he came art    by the judge or judges by whom such bodyadduction mandate had been issued or by any other judge or judges should the prisoner instead of being remanded have been disincarcerated or sent into or to any other place of confinement—power to the dispatch court by a fresh incarceration mandate to cause the reincarceration of the said prisoner and so toties quoties art    power also to the dispatch court judge to inflict on the person or persons concerned in such disincarceration—one or more or all of them—at option and at discretion such punishments as in and by art    are appointed stating on the occasion in question whether the delinquency had for its cause evilconsciousness or want of due attention art    ratiocinative art    why thus give to the judicatory power to cause the adduction of the prisoner divested at the same time of the correspondent power of disincarceration     answer—reasons— i to obviate all power of abuse in the hands of the dispatch court judge ii to obviate on the part of the public at large all suspicion of such abuse enactive art    for any expense and vexation produced by the application made for such bodyadduction mandate power to the dispatch court judge by his compensationawarding mandate to administer at the charge of any or all the individuals who have been contributing to the production of such expense and vexation compensation to the respective use of those who have been sufferers by it ratiocinative art    why thus give power to the dispatch court judge not only for frustrating all endeavours on the part of the existing authorities to frustrate the incarceration performed by him but moreover to impose on them the burthen of compensation and even of punishment answer—reasons— i to omit anything that was necessary to the impossibilizing the efficiency of all chances for such frustration would be—to establish eventual appeal from the dispatch court to some such already existing courts one or more of them ii suppose no such powers provided a course which would naturally be taken by any adversary of the proposed relief would be the harassing with the expense and vexation inseparable from the existing system any or all of the persons on the several occasions concerned in the administration of this same relief iii for this purpose any one of all the several authorities who at present are authorized to issue a writ of habeas corpus would suffice iv to secure against frustration the hereintended design the mere frustration of the endeavour to prevent the disincarceration would not suffice were it not for the proposed punishment the mere expense necessary to the infliction of the expense and vexation on the persons concerned in the administering the relief would naturally find but too many who would be effectually disposed to take it upon themselves v under the checks hereinafter provided much less probable will be seen to be any abuse of the dispatch court judges power of incarceration with the subsidiary powers here provided than would be the power of disincarceration with the subsidiary powers of inflicting vexation if left in the hands of the existing constituted authorities vi of such virtual appeal the effect would be—instead of substituting the summary to the dilatory system to add the one to the other and thus render the course of procedure still more dilatory than the proposed relief found it vii as to the nature of the addition—this would depend upon the course of procedure pursued in the at present existing judicatory by which by the supposition cognizance would in this indirect way have been taken of the proceedings of the dispatch court viii in the state of things here proposed no exercise or assumption of this power can have place without appropriate warning without drawing to it the attention not only of the public at large but of the superordinate authorities—legislative and executive ix exercised as above by the existing judges—exercised on each occasion is this same power altogether without warning of the intention to exercise it nor unless by a sort of miracle has anybody out of doors any knowledge of what is to be done x by malâ fide suitors—by dishonest suitors on both sides at the suggestion of their learned advisers it would of course and to a certainty be employed—by learned judges it would—but too naturally and probably—be countenanced and effectuated xi by the hereproposed principle how formidable soever may be the appearance presented by it to a superficial glance no change whatever in the constitution will be produced—no power added to or subtracted from the crown or either house—no power given to the people at large xii necessary to the keeping the door     shut against all frustration will upon due examination be seen to be all this machinery but what is most probable is—that under the controul established by it matters will go     on so quietly as to cause it to present itself to a hasty view as needless and superfluous enactive art    of all proceedings in relation to this matter before the bodyadductionmandateissuing judicatory the dispatch court judge will so order matters that minutation and recordation shall be made and the record kept in the office of the registrar of the dispatch court enactive—expository art    included in this same selfextensive power of the judge is the power of making from time to time general regulations for the direction of the proceedings of this his own judicatory ratiocinative art    of this arrangement under the form of an extension applied to the power of the judge the effect is in truth a restriction for in respect of the exercise of it a sort of moral obligation may be seen to have place supposing no such power he would on each occasion do without preannouncement whatsoever it were his pleasure to do ii on the other hand let this power be established he will in this case in proportion to the exercise given to it give to all persons concerned information of what they have to expect and thus in a proportionate degree prevent disappointment iii at the same time by so doing he will submit such his arrangements to the tribunal of public opinion and thereby to any imperfections that may have place in them elicit the appropriate amendments antecedently to any suffering on the part of individuals in consequence of those same imperfections enactive—ratiocinative art  00 strong as above being the mass of power conferred on the dispatch court judge correspondently strong will need to be the checks provided for security against misexercise of that same power hence the enactments which now follow for corruption oppression or extortion the judge may be punished as for a misdemeanour mode of procedure information filed ex officio by his majestys attorneygeneral and not otherwise enactive art  0  at the trial questions may be put to the defendant as to any extraneous witness in case of wilful falsehood his punishment may be the same as that of a witness would be in case of perjury from silent or irrelevant response the judge will draw inferences as from any other portion of circumstantial evidence all objection on the ground of his being called upon as the phrase is to accuse himself notwithstanding ratiocinative art  0  why thus elicit evidence from the lips of the defendant answer—reasons— i as to the rule of common law by which exclusion is put upon evidence from this source for a demonstration at large of its absurdity in all cases see the rationale of evidence ii so of its inconsistency the exclusion having place where the evil and danger from the admission of the evidence in question amounts absolutely to nothing and not having place where the evil is at its maximum iii so in respect of the exclusions which have place where the evidence is elicited in its best shape—namely that of response to interrogation vivâ voce subject to counterinterrogation on the spot—and having not place where it is elicited in the worst possible shape—namely that of affidavit evidence—with time in indefinite abundance for premeditation and exemption from the security which subjection to counterinterrogation affords against falsehood and against deception by means of it iv even were the exclusion proper in all other cases it would not be so in this forasmuch as—in this case a man could not be subjected to the interrogation without his own previous consent as signified by the acceptance given by him to the office by which he will have been subjected to it†—see further section xix subsequential evidence c         section vii prehensors and messengers instructional—ratiocinative art i—i prehensors—messengers—consignees     of the three different classes of functionaries so denominated conjunct consideration will be seen to be necessary they are all three so many channels through which is and cannot but be carried on between the judge on the one part and things and persons on the other part that intercourse which is so indispensably and continually necessary to all exercise of his authority in relation to these its subjectmatters presenting to view the mutual relations between all these several functionaries is the purpose of the following observations— ii in an immediate way with neither of these two subjectmatters can any such intercourse be carried on otherwise than to a comparatively very narrow extent more especially with things for the remainder necessary therefore is the intervention of intermediate functionaries under one or other of the following denominations will all these functionaries be found comprised iii of the intercourse of the judge with a thing the sole purpose in view is its forthcomingness namely for one or more of the purposes in section vi judges powers art    mentioned of his intercourse with a person an additional purpose is—information—obtainment of evidence or say information without need of forthcomingness either at the judgmentseat or anywhere else information at the hands of a person who in this case is considered and dealt with in the character of an evidenceholder or say eventual informant iv necessary in addition to the intervention of the prehensor becomes thus that of the secondlymentioned sort of functionary—the messenger v so likewise for producing on the part of the person without prehension locomotion namely for the purpose of forthcomingness whether at the judgmentseat or at any other place vi if for any one of the three purposes for which as per section vi judges powers art    prehension may require to be made—namely the executioneffecting the executionsecuring or the evidencesecuring—continuance in the possession of any functionary acting under the orders of the judge is necessary—thereupon comes the demand for the thirdlymentioned sort of functionary—the consignee or say intrustholder as per section viii art   vii if it be to the class of things moveable that the subjectmatter to be placed in the possession of the consignee belongs—an intermediate functionary whose service is necessary is—a prehensor locomotion being in this case requisite viii so likewise if it be to the class of persons if to the class of things immoveable not—locomotion being in this case impossible ix so likewise if to the class of things incorporeal and for that same reason x as to fitness—for the three species of service in question materially different for the most part are the sets of qualifications requisite hence the need of functionaries in a corresponding degree different xi on the part of a prehensor—qualifications requisite are—in company with the appropriate instruction strength of body and mind over and above the ordinary degree true it is—that for the prehension of a thing were persons out of the question for no such extraordinary qualifications would ever need have place but forasmuch as for     prehension of a thing removal of obstruction opposed by persons may eventually be necessary—hence for the prehension of things qualifications the same as for the prehension of persons will be necessary xii on the part of a messenger no qualifications of any sort in a degree above the most ordinary are necessary xiii but for this branch of service apt in an extraordinary and peculiar degree is the whole machinery of the letterpost—trustworthiness punctuality and cheapness being as per art    the attributes in a peculiar degree belonging to it xiv on the part of a consignee if the subjectmatter of the consignment be a person qualifications necessary will be those of a jailor if a thing immoveable or an aggregate of things moveable the qualifications will be those requisite for custody and management and will accordingly vary according to the nature of the things in relation to which the exercise of those two functions or one of them is necessary for the purpose in question whether it be executioneffecting or executionsecuring xv accordingly any person who is fit to be a prehensor is fit to be a messenger not true however is it that every person who is fit to be a prehensor is fit to be a consignee or say an intrustholder to whose management or custody things immoveable or aggregates of things moveable are consigned or say confided so much for principals now as to deputes under two former heads—in the case of two abovementioned functionaries—namely the judge and the registrar—mention has been made of the sort of functionaries styled deputes and of the sort of functionaries by whom it is fit that they should be located—namely their respective principals but in the case of a prehensor this fitness it will be seen as per art   has not place enactive art   power to the

hands of occasional prehensors answer—reasons— i somewhere or other power of providing functionaries for the exercise of functions of this description there must at all times be and altogether without limit is the number the need of which may have place ii to the prehensor principal power thus unlimited cannot safely or consistently as in the case of the dispatch court registrar be allotted too strong to be at all times effectually resisted would be the temptation to overstock the office with incumbents iii of the judges mandates the efficiency and thence in that respect his reputation will in the nature of the case depend in some degree upon the aptitude of the choice in each instance made by him iv consequence—in hands other than those of the judge power in this shape cannot it should seem with propriety be reposed art   pay of a prehensor occasional whatsoever at the time or on the occasion in question the judge shall think fit to appoint art   source of such pay the purse of the

accordingly dealt with by the dispatch court judge—will be any act by which such application shall have been made or entertained and endeavoured to be effectuated ratiocinative art    reasons— i only for the purpose of obstruction—only with evil consciousness for its accompaniment—could any application to a court acting under the regular system have place ii in the dispatch court heard and delivered it would be at next to no expense iii in a westminster hall court—not but at an expense having on each side for its limit downwards not so little as £ 0 upwards how many hundreds it is impossible to say expense in special pleading and appeal included as they cannot but be instructional—ratiocinative art   —i eminently apt for the purpose of messengers service is the class of functionaries employed by government in the conveyance of letters styled in the aggregate the letterpost trustworthiness punctuality cheapness—in a degree of perfection absolute as well as comparative—are all these desirable qualities possessed by the system carried on by it ii thus seated not only would the weight of the burthen be in a prodigious degree lessened but the whole of it would be taken off from the sogrievouslygalled shoulders of the afflicted suitors iii were it not for the danger of abuse—of abuse of which in such magnitude and such multitude and variety of shapes the regular system of procedure affords examples—the party on whose account the missive requires to be delivered—and by whom the mission of it will in natural course have been applied for—might for this purpose be as at present to so large an extent his professional assistant is the functionary on this ocsion employed iv though to entrust to a person so circumstanced the execution of this trust to the exclusion of all other persons would as above be to expose the service to too great a danger—yet to no objection seems exposed the giving permission to the party in person or by proxy to accompany the government functionary a course which in some cases for securing the appropriate delivery he will naturally be disposed to take enactive art    to every prehensor whether permanent or occasional belongs the aidcompelling function† expositive art    by the prehensors aidcompelling function understand that by the exercise of which if need be he calls for and by the fear of eventual punishment in case of noncompliance uses his endeavour to obtain—active assistance at the hands of each person so called upon towards the enabling him to give execution and effect to the mandate whatever it be issued and directed to him in such his capacity by the judge or to any general regulation when any such there is by which he is required to render his official service in any shape on any occasion without waiting for any mandate to be on the individual occasion in question issued by the judge enactive—ratiocinative art    to the end that with all requisitions made by a person lawfully exercising the authority of a prehensor compliance may   0 at all times be given—and that to no requisitions made by any person falsely pretending to be possessed of such authority compliance may at any time be given—provided with an appropriate badge of office will be every prehensor whether permanent or occasional by the choice and under the direction of the judge of the dispatch court will this symbolical instrument or apparatus with any such component parts as shall have been deemed requisite to it be at all times provided enactive—instructional art    in respect of the description of the persons on or over whom it shall be exercisable to this authority there is no certain limit on all persons whatsoever—at his discretion on his responsibility—exercise will on each occasion be given to it instructional art    for the guidance of such his discretion rules prescribed to him are these which follow i only in case of need will any such aid be ever called for by him ii only to the extent of the need will the call for it be made or continued iii in so far as by the circumstances of the case a choice of persons is afforded—choice will in preference be made of those whose aid—relation had to the public purpose in question—promises to be most effectual and among them of those to whom the assistance thus given promises to be least dangerous and in other respects least burthensome at the same time—with reference to the evildoers against whose unlawful opposition the aid is requisite—least in danger of being productive of suffering in quantity beyond what is needed instructional—ratiocinative art  0 where the quantity of force needed is to such a degree considerable—a party of regular military men promises to be in general preferable to any other namely as being more effectually under command and on that account less in danger of producing evil beyond necessity as well as of failing to fulfil the purpose true it is—the smaller the quantity of such force necessary and accordingly kept up the better but the quantity of it being given—the more extensive the application made of it to all useful purposes the better enactive art    in case of noncompliance with an aidcompelling requisition made by a prehensor power to the judge to impose on each person so offending a pecuniary mulct in case of damage in any shape sustained in consequence of such noncompliance—in compensation for such damage will this mulct or such part of it as shall have been recovered be applied if there be no such damage then will the whole of the mulct be transmitted by the judge to the receipt of his majestys exchequer for a form for the instrument of such transmission see schedule no xvii so likewise any such ulterior mulct as shall have been deemed fit to be imposed over and above such sum as shall have been deemed requisite for compensation as above art    in case of inability on the part of the offender to pay such mulct or any part thereof—power to the judge to commit him or her to prison for such term as—by the apprehension of the like offence on the part of other persons exposed to the temptation of becoming offenders—shall in his judgment afford an adequate promise of preventing them from becoming so that is to say for such term the suffering wherefrom in the breast of the said offender shall in the judgment of the judge be the equivalent of that which would have been produced in the breast of that same offender by the forced payment of the sum in question had he possessed it or been able to obtain it enactive—instructional art    the prison will naturally be—some prison in the metropolis or within a few miles thereof but for reason assigned any prison within the quondam kingdom of england may be employed by him in preference—and also for reason assigned the prison at any time changed instructional—ratiocinative art    on this occasion the judge will consider and inquire—whether it was ill will or timidity or a mixture of both that such noncompliance had for its cause inasmuch as in the quantum of suffering proper to be inflicted by him on the score and for the purpose of punishment the difference may be in an indefinite degree considerable in so far as timidity alone has been the cause—scarcely on any other account than that of satisfaction in the shape of pecuniary compensation will be subject the noncomplying individual as above to pecuniary privation why because generally speaking in such case suffering will in the character of punishment be useless for the evil the avoidance of which was sought by the noncompliance may have been bodily suffering unlimited in magnitude and that immediate and in appearance and perhaps in reality certain whereas generally speaking the evil apprehended in the shape of punishment for noncompliance will have been and to the person called upon have appeared to be comparatively small and that remote and more or less uncertain instructional—exemplificational art    if the individual at whose hands the aid is required be of the female sex—timidity is that which noncompliance will have for its commonlyprobable and thence generally speaking presumable cause but if from other circumstances it appears that     not timidity but illwill was the cause—then in regard to punishment for noncompliance small if any by the consideration of sex will be the difference to be made if for example by the purposed closing of a door a person of the female sex affords to one who should have been prehended the means of escape—or by information afforded delivers into his hands for the purpose of vengeance a prehensor or any person occupied in lending aid to him enactive art    in case of damage to person or property sustained by an individual in consequence of his being or having been occupied in lending aid to a prehensor in the exercise of his authority—power to the judge as per art    to administer to the individual so damnified compensation at the charge of all persons by whose delinquency such harm was produced as to this power of awarding compensation considered in respect of the reasons on which it is grounded see section vi judges powers c art    art    so likewise to inflict on any or every such wrongdoer punishment—in every instance in which and so far as the suffering produced by the obligation of making compensation as above would in his judgment fall short of being sufficient for punishment in respect of its subsequentiallypreventive purpose always remembering that—supposing the amount to be in both cases the same—the suffering produced by the obligation of parting with money or moneysworth payable into the purse of an adversary will naturally be greater than if it were into the public purse art    in default of the obtainability of the matter of compensation from the property of delinquents as per art   —power to the judge to give to parties so damnified drafts upon the lords commissioners of his majestys treasury every such draft being accompanied with a brief report expressive of the state of the case of the several acts of delinquency committed and of the damage by them severally or conjunctively produced and the amount in respect of which the pecuniary means of the several delinquents were found insufficient for the extraction of the penalties respectively assessed art    by their said lordships—if they see not any sufficient reason for suspecting excess on the part of the amount so drawn for—it will accordingly be paid within six days after sight in the contrary case their lordships will by a minute in the treasury book and a copy thereof sent to the judge—express their desire that a copy of the minute of the whole transaction as entered in the register of the dispatch court be transmitted to them which received they will either make and communicate to the registrar appointment of the time or times on which the amount of such draft after such deduction if any as they shall deem proper—shall be paid or give notice of disallowance in the london gazette whatsoever is paid—without fee at the expense of the individual it will be paid art  0 so in case of loss of time to a considerable amount or extraordinarily meritorious exertion on the occasion of aid so lent by a person whose means of subsistence are wholly or principally composed of the price of daily labour—power to the judge on special proof made and recorded to cause reward to a correspondent amount to be administered to the individual in question by order upon the registrar by whom it will be paid and entry thereof made under the head of contingencies of such order—copy will at the requisition of the registrar which will accordingly be made be printed in the next london gazette instructional art    on this occasion the judge will be on his guard against needless service rendered or required for the sake of the reward instructional—ratiocinative art    note—that on the occasion of the provision thus made for rewards care is taken by the legislature not to allot by a fixed sum to a service subject to indefinite variation in respect of magnitude and meritoriousness reward to an amount which if so fixt would in most cases be either insufficient or excessive in the very nature of the case a premium on contribution made to the infliction of punishment as for a crime is if fixt a premium on contribution to the commission of that same crime the more crimes a man produces the more rewards he receives for causing them to be punished in the existing state of things this disastrous tendency is but too extensively seen ripened into act†     section viii consignees or say intrustholders expositive art   by an intrustholder understand a functionary to whose custody and care with or without management under the orders of the judge a thing or a person has been consigned or say delivered and thus confided namely by a prehensor until the arrival—of the thing in kind or in value at its ultimate destination—of the person at his ultimate destination—on the occasion and for the purposes of the suit     art   by a confidee understand—a

the capacity of intrustholders the confidee is confided or say intrusted in this description—qualifications and number as in the articles hereinafter following being included art   of the ultimate purpose—or say of the aggregate of all these purposes collectively taken—the description is the giving in the completest manner and degree possible consistently with the nonproduction of preponderant evil execution and effect to such articles or clauses in virtue of which for the purpose of giving execution and effect to that part of the substantive law which is in question termination may in favour of whichsover side it be require to be given to the suit art   as to things of which—they being originally in the custody of the judges of the existing judicatories in question as per section vi art   the value is purely relative—either they will not need to be prehended or if prehended they will in an immediate way be delivered to and placed in the custody of the registrar of the dispatch court in relation to such things—no demand for the service of an intrustholder will have place art   of the sorts of things intrinsically valuable by the nature of which a demand for the service of an intrustholder may have place—some there are in relation to which it may happen that no demand for special management has place nothing beyond safe custody in the case of things of these sorts so as the proposed intrustholder be in himself sufficiently trustworthy or by collateral security rendered so what may happen to be the case and generally speaking will be so is—that for no special qualification on the part of a proposed intrustholder is there any demand—and that for the due and adequate exercise of the functions belonging to the trust a single intrustholder will be sufficient examples of things thus circumstanced are the following—     money to any amount     a dwelling furnished or unfurnished art   for the due and adequate exercise of the functions of an intrustholder—in relation to things or aggregates of things with relation to which demand for special and appropriate management has place—correspondent demand for qualifications in various groups corresponding to the respective natures of such things will in consequence have place examples are the following— i groundhusbandry profitseeking concerns     agricultural     mining     fishing ii manufacturing profitseeking concerns     manufactures by wholesale     handicraft businesses iii merely distributional profitseeking concerns   wholesale trades home or say domestic   wholesale trades foreign   retail trades   trade ambulatory by water iv a profitseeking concern having for its subjectmatter a thing incorporeal—source of profit—the exclusive right to sell things of the species in question this right being derived from—     the inventorship thereof or     the fabricatorship or     the vendorship example of the inventorship—authorship of a literary or imitative work enactive—instructional art   on the occasion of the location of an intrustholder it will be for the care of     the judge to look out for persons one or more possessed of appropriate qualifications correspondent and adapted as above to the nature of the concern whatsoever it may be—hearing whatsoever may be learnt in the shape either of proposal or argumentation from all parties interested that is to say in so far as distance and thence danger of preponderant evil by delay will admit art   so to take into consideration the number of the intrustholders whether it shall be one or more and whether in the case of a concern which has divers branches they shall be intrusted—all of them to one hand or assemblage of hands or one to one another to another and so on art  0 so the exaction of security at the hands of intrustholders in regard to each whether it shall be exacted and if yes in what shape and—whether security from within or say ab intra shall suffice—or security from without or say collateral or ab extra shall be added—from within that is to say by eventual appropriate obligations submitted to by the intrustholder himself from without that is to say by such obligations submitted to by coobligees or say in the present case coassecurators art   so the several appropriate functions which in relation to the things in question may require to be exercised by such intrustholders respectively—functions namely i as to things—  the procurative   the conservative   the applicative   the reparative   the eliminative ii as to money—  the procurative   the custoditive   the applicative iii as to things money persons and occurrences—  the statistic   the minutative and recordative iv as to states of things arrangements and ordinances the meliorationsuggestive art    so in regard to remuneration namely in the instance of each such intrustholder whether any shall be received by him and if yes its quantity and its quality or say how much and in what shape art    in regard to the shape it will be the judges care that in no instance it shall be such as to place his interest in a state of opposition to his duty examples of such opposition these—   in intrustholders hands money continuing in such quantity as to be capable of affording profit in the shape of interest art    so in regard to stock in all shapes as per art   the judge giving admission and having at all times regard to suggestions by interessee as per art   art    in and by the instrument of consignment or say the consignmenteffecting mandate the dispatch court judge will make mention of the purpose for which the transfer is made as for instance—   purpose management name of the instrument the managementprescribing—or say directing—mandate form as per schedule no xviii   purpose sale name of this his instrument the saledirecting—or say prescribing—mandate form as per schedule no xix so if for any other purpose art    now as to the case where the confidee is a person—general heads under which the purposes as per art   may be ranked in this case these—   remedial—functions of the intrustholder in this case those of a keeper   tutelary—functions those of a guardian   evidencesecuring—functions those of a keeper art    general purpose remedial—specific purposes in this case may be— i preventive examples—   prevention of acts of force having for their object obstruction to the exercise of any power belonging to the dispatch court judge   prevention of evasion from consignment made of the confidee to any intrustholder for the purpose of confinement restrictive the purpose may in this respect be termed ii suppressive to wit of negative delinquency in the shape of noncompliance with a mandate of the judge—ordering for example the transference—or say extradition—of a thing as per articles following in the character of a source of evidence written or real—or of a person in the character of an evidenceholder—and in each case for the purpose of prehension and delivery to an intrustholder or ordering indication to be made of a matter of fact for the purpose of its being employed in evidence in this case compulsive is the denomination of the remedy compulsion being the means by which or say the mode in which it operates iii satisfactive including the compensative applied to a thing the remedy in this shape may be administered by extradition as above applied to a person it cannot be administered otherwise than by effecting extradition of a thing or things—valuable as above—and delivery thereof in kind or in value as above iv punitive or say subsequentially preventive intrustholder in this case—keeper of a place of confinement the confidee being placed under the care and custody of the intrustholder namely whether for the purpose of punishment thereby to be suffered or for prevention of evasion of ulterior punishment in that or any other shape     art    subjectmatters for the consideration of the judge are in this case the following namely— i the quantity of the suffering to be applied ii the place within which or at which by the intrustholder the confidee shall be kept or say confined iii the time during which such confinement shall continue art    of the suffering applied the judge will of course keep the quantity reduced to the smallest amount consistent with the fulfilment of the special purpose as per art    with a view to which it is inflicted—and with the nonproduction of preponderant evil in any shape art  0 as to the place it may be either stationary or ambulatory examples of the places when stationary these— i the house of the confidee himself ii the house of a friend of the confidee the occupier of the house praying for or consenting to the application thus made of it iii a lockuphouse that is to say—a house in which by an intrustholder by whom such his business is carried on—professionally and for profit confidees are lodged with or without board in a state of confinement iv failing the above places in case of necessity a prison ratiocinative art  0 why this power of inflicting punishment on the innocent answer—reasons— i in the case here in question preponderant suffering to the imprisoned individual none to parties one or more for want of the evidence suffering in a pecuniary shape to the magnitude of which no limits can be assignable ii of suppression of true evidence the maleficent effects may be as great as those of falsification of true evidence or fabrication of false and suppression of evidence is if wilful an offence against justice iii punishment is not in this case a proper appellation for divers purposes other than punishment is suffering in this same shape habitually produced in english law and in the laws of civilized nations in general namely the purpose of prevention and of suppression as applied to maleficent acts of all sorts punishment is one out of the four species of remedies employable in the cure of the disorder called delinquency the three others are—  the preventive   the suppressive   the satisfactive the  th is the punitive—the preventive that is to say the antecedently preventive the punitive having for its object the prevention of subsequential offences and this being the only purpose for which the application of it is justifiable iv application of imprisonment for this very purpose is not without example in english practice nor are the examples rare v this too without any of that attention which is here directed to be applied for the purpose of minimizing the suffering and without either receipt or expectation of such attention to imprisonment individuals purposely subject themselves—the evils of it being regarded by them as less than those to which if out of prison they would be subjected by indigence see section vi judges powers enactive—instructional art    instead of stationary as in the above four cases—power to the judge—to render the restriction as to place—and thence the condition of the confidee in respect of rest and motion ambulatory† the course of his locomotion being all the while such as is most agreeable to him the confidee going wheresoever he pleases so as he be all the while in the custody of the intrustholder or some person employed on the occasion by him the intrustholder being responsible for his forthcomingness—and subject always to all such mandates restrictive or even compulsive as for any of the above desirable purposes shall have been delivered by or by order of the judge art    in every one of these cases—for prevention of evasion security will if needful be exacted by the judge as per art  0 according to the circumstances of the individuals interested in each individual case—regard being had to the two antagonizing objects of consideration namely the evil producible by evasion and the good produced by reducing to its minimum the quantity of suffering inflicted for the prevention of that same evil instructional—ratiocinative—exemplificative art    minimized may be by these means the expense and vexation produced under and by the existing system in the view of providing security for the forthcoming of the persons in question—extinguished for example the abuses following—     i the bailing system with its expense delay and vexation as at present carried on ii for transfer of real property compulsion† applied to a party to cause him to do that which without agency in any shape on his part might be done by the judge in which case lodged in the same partys hands is a sort of negative applicable to the appropriate exercise of the judicial power in question and capable not only of obstructing but of frustrating it enactive—expositive art   —ii general purpose the second tutelary specific purposes correspond to the several efficient causes of the demand for the service of the intrustholder which are the following— i intellectual weakness by reason of immaturity of age or say in one word minority specific appellative of the intrustholder in this case guardian of the confidee ward ii intellectual weakness by reason of mental derangement not referable to age specific appellative of the intrustholder in this case committee of the confidee idiot or lunatic idiot when the weakness is regarded as having had its commencement at birth and as being thence incurable lunatic when regarded as having had its commencement at some point of time posterior to birth and thence as curable or incurable as it may happen iii intellectual weakness by reason of longevity in which case it has been denominated caducity on this score under the existing system no such consignment is known to have had place no appellative consequently in use for the designation—either of an intrustholder or of a confidee appellatives that might here be applied are—to the intrustholder curator to the confidee the overaged‡ art    every minor if any such there be who having father or mother living is in contrariety to the declared wishes of such father or mother in wardship under the lord high chancellor—under the notion of the relative inaptitude of such his or her parent on the score of persuasion in matters of religion—the judge will emancipate from such guardianship restoring the ward to the guardianship of the father or if the father be deceased to that of the mother or of any person by him or her appointed guardian as the case may be ratiocinative art   —i for if on this score a public functionary had it in his power to take a child out of the care of his natural guardian or of any person by him or her appointed as guardian—a power of persecution would thus be possessed the peace of families exposed to disturbance and by successive chancellors so many mutually opposite persuasions might be endeavoured to be implanted in the same infant minds ii so likewise even if on the score of morals iii if throughout the whole community in the case of all minors under natural or naturally appointed guardianship as above—suits on this ground were liable to be instituted—no end would there be to the number of such suits nor to the length of them respectively iv supposing the institution of guardianship in this case beneficial no sufficient reason can be assigned why the benefit should by law be conceded or denied according to pecuniary circumstances conceded to the rich because rich denied to the poor because poor∥     enactive—instructional art   —iii general purpose the third evidencesecuring—case i confidee a thing of a thing considered in the character of a source of evidence—prehension may require to be made for either of the three purposes following— i securing its forthcomingness ii securing it against changes liable to be made in its appearance for the purpose of deception or say against forgery of real evidence iii securing it against change with the like effect though without any such sinister purpose whether such change be the effect of a purely natural cause or of want of attention to prevent it instructional art    in this case the judge will have to consider—whether of the change of hands—loss or detriment in any shape to any person will be a consequence and if yes whether to place the thing in the hands of an intrustholder making at the charge of the party requiring the consignment compensation for such detriment—or in consideration of such detriment leaving it in the hands in which it was found enactive—instructional art   —case ii confidee a person—for the purpose of evidence—to prevent the deperition thereof power is hereby given to the judge to place in quality of an evidenceholder a person in case of need in the condition of a confidee in the custody of an intrustholder—that is to say if in his the judges opinion the importance of the suit to the parties and the importance of the expected evidence in relation to the suit are such as to afford an adequate compensation for the inconvenience about to result from the restraint enactive—instructional art    in this case of the costs of such consignment including adequate compensation to the confidee for whatsoever inconvenience has in any shape been produced by the consignment—that is to say of the burthen of the cost—distribution will be made between the parties regard being had to their respective pecuniary circumstances enactive art  0 by the judge an intrustholder     of a thing or money may be—  located   suspended   dislocated   relocated this toties quoties so an intrustholder of a person art    for vexatious application made against an intrustholder compensation may be made or punishment inflicted section ix grounds of decision for the dispatch court judge instructional—expositive art   of every suit the subjectmatter of contestation is either—  matter of law   matter of fact or   both together enactive art   so far as regards the matter of law every decision of the dispatch court judge will have for its ground the nondisappointment principle—or say the disappointmentminimizing or expectationfulfilling principle instructional—expositive art   correspondent to the disappointmentminimizing principle is the following rule to which it makes reference on every occasion in so far as benefit in any shape is the subjectmatter of dispute the question being to which of a number of parties the possession present or future in whole or in part shall be adjudged—the manner in which for that purpose disposition will be made of it is that by which among all the interessees taken together least disappointment will be produced† art   for the purpose of determining as to the arrangement in question whether it would be in contrariety to the nondisappointment principle the judge will consider within himself whether if the case were his own if that same arrangement took place any such uneasy sensation as that expressed by the word disappointment would thereby have been produced in his breast art   for the purpose of determining as between any two arrangements which of them would be most which least conformable to the nondisappointment principle the judge will consider within himself by which of the two the greatest by which the least pain of disappointment would be produced as above in his breast art   for the purpose of determining the several arrangements which the greatesthappiness principle requires to be established in the several parts of the field of law various     other subordinate principles will have to be employed but this is the only one which by his own authority the equity dispatch court judge can consistently with that same allruling and master principle make application of for the applications made of the several others respectively fresh enactments will be requisite and necessary enactive—instructional art   to no decision or rule in force or supposed so to be in any other judicatory at the time when the question comes before him for decision—to no practice or dictum of any such judicatory—will the dispatch court judge pay any regard referring to this article he will reprimand and stop from proceeding in this course any person by whom in argument any such irrelevant and inapplicable matter shall have been introduced ratiocinative art   reasons these— i be the arrangement what it may by whomsoever it is declared to be contrary to every principle of justice or contrary to the first principles of justice or contrary to justice it is thereby acknowledged to be unfit to have place ii next in importance to the rule which prescribes maximization of happiness on the part of interessees is the rule which prescribes minimization of disappointment on their part iii conformable to the nondisappointment principle any such rule or decision as above would be useless unconformable it would be maleficent iv consistent with one another are all arrangements rightly deduced from the nondisappointment principle completely inconsistent with one another are many of the rules and decisions listened and conformed to by the existing equity courts v not more hostile to the rules and decisions of the existing equity courts can be any arrangements deduced from the nondisappointment principle than are to one another many of the existing rules and decisions of those same courts witness those pronounced on the subject of last wills† vi not worse nor otherwise dealt with will thus be the rules and decisions of the existing equity courts by the equity dispatch court than by those same equity courts without any the least reserve are those of the several commonlaw courts and those of the several ecclesiastical courts throughout a great part of the extent of the field of jurisdiction occupied by these same equity courts if it is or ever was fit that the rules of one court should by another court established in a dark age be overruled why not by one established in a more enlightened as well as in a less enlightened age vii ex post facto arrangements as well as contrary to the nondisappointment principle are both those made by the existing equity courts and all those that are grounded on the judgemade and socalled unwritten law by the commonlaw courts and the ecclesiasticallaw courts and admiralty courts but most scandalously inconsistent with that exclusively defensible principle—the nondisappointment principle—are the rules and decisions of the existing equity courts as well as with the profession included in the import of the term equity intimation being thereby meant to be conveyed of a better sort of justice viii contrary to acts of parliament are various of the rules and decisions application of which is made by the existing equity courts witness those on the subject of the registration of deeds ix avowedly in contrariety to the enactments of the legislature may be seen rules and decisions of the equity courts witness the instances brought to view in the tract intituled indications respecting lord eldon in the miscellany intituled official aptitude maximized—expense minimized v     x by the exclusion put upon all mention of the rules and decisions of the existing equity courts saved will be the prodigious quantity of time and expense employed in the reference to them in the existing practice instructional art   of interpretation in cases of doubt applied to postobituary dispositions—principles applicable these— i nondisappointment or say disappointmentpreventing or minimizing principle   0 ii where and in so far as this principle has no application the benefitmaximizing principle iii when neither the disappointmentminimizing nor the benefitmaximizing principle are applicable the lotemploying principle—rather than by litiscontestation applying the money part of it to the use of lawyers in sheer waste for example in the scribbling of useless writings or partly in travelling iv in the first instance—i e antecedently to application made of the benefitmaximizing principle apply the lotemploying principle as being the simplest in its operation and saving the property from being wasted in the purchase of lawyers service useless witnesses and journeys of evidenceholders this done then the judge will determine whether the inequalities of fortune on the part of coclaimants are sufficiently great to warrant the application of the benefitmaximizing principle v in cases in which no one of the abovementioned principles is applicable give the matter in dispute to government for the benefit of the whole community vi determine to what degree of remoteness in relationship expectation of postobituary acquisition shall be considered as extending and this in the two several cases of existence and nonexistence of amicable intercourse betwixt the defunct and the living   means of simplification or say simplicityeffecting arrangements proposable as aplicable to postobituary dispositions— i applying to the subjectmatter of property— abolition of the distinction between real and personal property ii applying to the judicatories having cognizance of contestation in relation to those same subjectmatters of property— abolition of all sorts of judicatories except one giving to one and the same sort of judicatory exceptions excepted jurisdiction in all sorts of cases   an example this of the distribution capable of being made of the subjectmatter of legal arrangements for the purpose of cooperation in codification   note in this point of view that of postobituary and introvival or say intervival disposition the subjectmatter is or may be the same namely exceptions excepted the aggregate mass of the objects of general desire including the matter of wealth in all its ramifications vii modes of division in cases in which no ground can be found for giving the subjectmatter in question to one of two contending parties to the exclusion of the other these—   division into two equal shares—the assumption being that the right does belong either to the one or to the other beyond doubt no third person having any ground of title to it   lot without division—according to the result of the lottery the subjectmatter going in totality either to the one or the other of these two the mode of division seems the preferable one ground of this opinion this—what cannot but be admitted is that in the breast of each one of the two competitors the pain of disappointment cannot fail to have place on the other hand what is supposed and assumed to be true is that the sum of the pain in the case of division will not be so great as the sum of the pain in the case of nondivision and conversely the sum of the pleasure produced in the case of division will be greater than the sum of the pain in case of nondivision† section x‡ suits comparative suitableness and order of cognizance instructional art   of the dispatch court the institution has in view two purposes—  main purpose introductorily to the establishment of a     proposed allcomprehensive system of judicial procedure having for its object the minimization of delay expense vexation misdecision and denial of justice together with the correspondentlycomprehensive judiciary establishment necessary to the application of it—the affording without the expense which would be necessitated by the establishment of the system in the first instance an experimental proof of the conduciveness of the procedure system to such its beneficent end—  collateral purpose—by means of this experiment affording relief to a number as large as conveniently may be of the persons labouring under the pressure of those same evils in a species of judicatory the procedure of which is pregnant with them in the most signal abundance instructional—expositive art   subjects of consideration on this occasion these— i from what court or courts suits shall be transferred to the dispatch court ii from such court or courts what shall be the suits so transferred iii the suits so transferred what shall be the order in which cognizance shall be taken of them by the dispatch court judge enactive—expositive art   as to the court or courts—from the high court of chancery alone shall suits be transferred to the dispatch court—from the high court of chancery including the vicechancellors court and the master of the rolls court ratiocinative art   not from the equity side of the court of exchequer for if of suits more than one hearing takes place they cannot any two of them be heard at the same moment and if not heard at the same moment they must be heard in some order one after another and if so heard one after another a determination as to what shall be the order in which they are to be heard must be made beforehand if from one court alone they     are received a predetermination in this sort is capable of being made but if it were from courts more than one that they were designed to be received no such determination does the nature of the case admit of enactive art   the dispatch court judge will not in any stage of the proceedings take in hand any suit which has been instituted by a commission of bankruptcy ratiocinative art   why not answer—reason so great may be the quantity of business to be done in a single suit that it might fill up the time of the judge to such a degree as to keep back for and during an indefinite length of time equity court suits in indefinite number enactive art   a petition which in the case of a suit commenced by a commission of bankruptcy is in present practice presented to the lord chancellor will accordingly be addressed to the lord chancellor and not to the dispatch court judge enactive art   the dispatch court judge will not in any stage of the suit take in hand any proceeding which has been commenced in the insolvency court ratiocinative art   reason the same as in the case of a proceeding commenced by a commission of bankruptcy enactive art   exception excepted every proceeding the commencement of which has taken place either by a commission of bankruptcy or in an insolvency court will be carried on in the same courts respectively as at present anything in this present act notwithstanding enactive art   exception is where for giving execution and effect in a suit which having taken its commencement in the equity court has been transferred into the dispatch court it is necessary that by the dispatch court exercise should be given to powers operating on subjectmatters on which those same courts have either of them begun to operate exemplificative art  0 of these powers examples are the following— i power of prehending and disposing of property which at the time of the transference was in the hands of either of those same courts ii power of prehending and putting to use any written source of evidence which at that time was or has since come to be in the possession of either of those same courts enactive art    for giving execution and effect to the abovementioned powers the powers exercisable by the dispatch court in relation to persons and things belonging to the abovementioned courts are the same as those exercisable over and in relation to persons and things belonging to the equity courts as per section vi judges powers enactive—instructional art    in manner following will the suits transferred and the order in which cognizance is taken of them be determined— i issued will be on the  day of  next his majestys commission by which appointment will be made of the dispatch court judge ii so soon as he has received his commission the dispatch court judge will issue his mandates addressed to the needful officers of the several equity courts requiring them forthwith to make returns comprising the information following—namely     names of the several suits the first proceedings of which bear date in any part of the several years from the year of our lord    0 to the present year both inclusive     in a column headed by the word concluded as to such in relation to which it can be ascertained that they have been concluded information of the day on which such conclusion took place and in a third column the species of document by which it appears that the same took place and in a fourth column the names of the last proceedings that have been had in those in relation to which it does not appear that the conclusion thereof has taken place     name of the species of suit in so far as the same can be ascertained     names and official residences of the several town solicitors on the plaintiffs side in the several suits ratiocinative art    as the bill cannot pass without the approbation of both houses one or other house might be depended upon for the spontaneous procurement of the justmentioned information but as it may happen that with reference to the purpose for which it is hereby required the information so obtained may fall more or less short of being complete—hence the necessity of a provision to this effect for the supply of it the rather as the demand for it will be more constantly and assuredly under the eye of the dispatch court judge than under that of either house of parliament and may arise at times at which those same houses respectively are not sitting†     enactive art   —iii into the dispatch court will be transferred in the first place all suits which will have taken their commencement within twenty years reckoning back from the day on which his majestys commission to the dispatch court judge is issued art   —iv on that same day by an advertisement in the london gazette a day will be appointed before which all suits if any such there be the commencement of which took place at a date anterior to those same twenty years shall be so

superannuated or say subsequentially appointed—being added together in one list the order in which the total number of them shall come in for cognizance will be determined name of the justmentioned list the total or say the aggregate list of the sotransferred suits ratiocinative art    why these suits alone—not all such as are in pendency—answer some sorts of suits there are in relation to which it is not possible to say for and during what length of time they may have been in pendency in which case no year later than the first of the proceedings of which any record of the court is extant could be pitched upon as that in which commencement shall be given to the series here then would be in vast proportion to the useful a quantity of useless matter in the supplying of which a correspondent quantity of time and labour would have to be consumed enactive art    as to the order in which by the dispatch court judge cognizance shall be taken of the suits transferred to it from the equity courts if it be not determined as per art— by the order in which dispatchcourtpraying petitions are received it will be determined by lot ratiocinative art    question why by lot answer for the reasons following— i of the suits included in the abovementioned period the number will be a determinate one but unless and until the number of those to which anterior points of time gave commencement is also a determinate one the total number of those to which admission to the dispatch court is to be given will remain undetermined ii even supposing this total number in any way determined still the order in which cognizance is to be taken of them will remain undetermined for though by the official books the day on which each suit took its commencement would be indicated still by this circumstance the order of cognizance will not be determined for though the order of the days in the year is a determinate one still as between the suits that took their commencement all of them on the same day of the order in which they did so no indication will by this means be afforded nor in the nature of the case can be afforded by any other means than lot iii lot will thus far be employed of necessity longevity the ordinary and thence the most obvious one is by the uncertainty of the influx of suits of anterior date prevented from being employed throughout nor on consideration will any decisive reason it is believed be found why it is desirable that it should be iv it may be thought that the quantity of the suffering from the nontermination of the suit is the proper standard by reference to which precedence should be settled but upon closer consideration it will be found that from no possible data singly or collectively taken is this quantity ascertainable—  value of the subjectmatter in contestation   expense of the suit   longevity of the suit—not from any one of these circumstances nor from all of them together     of every one of these circumstances not to the absolute quantity is that of the suffering proportionable but to the relative—relation had to the individuals pecuniary circumstances and thence in the case of each individual different not to speak of the universally unascertainable quantity of individual sensibility   in cases to a great extent the value of the subjectmatter of contestation will not even at the termination of the suit have been ascertainable as for instance all those in which the suit has for its object the applying to wrong the preventive remedy   as to the expense of the suit—it is composed partly of the money already at the then present time disbursed partly of that remaining about to be disbursed—a quantity of which in most cases the ascertainment would be impossible   as to the longevity—it is composed partly of the past duration partly of the eventually future duration that is to say of that which in the case of nontransference would take place and unascertainable would be not only in most cases the eventually future but even in many instances the past—namely by reason of the impossibility of ascertaining the day or time of commencement without going back to such a number of years as would render the delay productive of burthen to an amount preponderant over the benefit enactive—instructional art    mode which for determining the order of priority as between suit and suit among suits of the same class will on the present occasion be employed—mode of proceeding by which choice is excluded and to all eyes shown to be so—this square tickets of card paper—all

aptitude of the functionaries to whom it is allotted vi that in respect of the shape in which it is administered for the sake of appropriate intellectual aptitude cognitional and judicial and appropriate active aptitude matters may be so ordered that by fear of public opinion all persons absolutely or comparatively inapt in those respects be deterred or prevented from accepting official situations vii so all persons in quality of locators from locating them in those several situations viii that on the part of functionaries thus located emulation may have place that is to say competition for remuneratory approbation at the hands of the public opinion tribunal—that judicial authority in relation to which the popular or moral sanction is the legislative ix that no suit should by its complexity and thence by its lengthiness put a stoppage beyond what is unpreventible to the dispatch of others more than one x that for minimization of delay and expense conjoined with each other the supply of judicial functionaries may be elastic—always sufficient for the maximum of dispatch never more than sufficient—at all times fitting itself to the quantity of the business by which the demand is produced xi that by means of the correspondent number of subordinate judges of the various operations which have need to be performed in the course of the same suit as many as possible may be carried on at the same time xii that the chain of causes and effects may thus be organized in such sort as to maximize the probability of the production of the several desirable results each of them in the highest degree possible art   for accomplishing by the above means the above objects the arrangements that are provided will here be seen in regard to the minimization of delay and expense the accomplishment of the object will depend partly upon the state of mind on the part of the operating functionary—partly on the state of things on the part of the subjectmatter operated upon in relation to minds that which presented itself as capable of being done has already been brought to view in the several preceding sections remains to be seen what is capable of being done in relation to the subjectmatter to be operated upon—namely the aggregate mass of the matter belonging to the several suits which the dispatch court judge will at the time of his appointment find depending in the several equity courts many hands make light work says the proverbial rule corresponding principle the distribution principle art   under the guidance of this principle for the assistance of the judge hitherto designed by the appellation of the dispatch court judge is provided a set of judges under the name of auxiliary judges—for his assistance and thence operating to wit on different parts of the matter of the same suit at the same time as he—for his assistance and thence operating under him and by his direction thus then over and above the stock of machinery already brought to view comes to be brought to view an additional and different stock under the name of auxiliary judges with their et ceteras art   but whatsoever were the objects in view and aimed at in the case of the original machinery the same will have place in regard to the case of the supplementary machinery with respect to the quantum of the supply always enough and never more than enough was the quantum aimed at and endeavoured to be provided in the case of the original machinery the same is the description of the quantum aimed at and endeavoured to be provided in the case of the supplemental machinery—and to speak more particularly for the dispatch court judge have been provided his deputes for the auxiliary judges be they ever so many must be provided their respective deputes thus then and for the purpose of this close fitting as in the case of the fabled sevenleague boots already alluded to the same elasticity suppleness and pliancy will be needed in this case as in that art   thus much as to the quantity of the fresh supply so as to quality—appropriate aptitude in all its four branches as to the means of producing it and instruments to be provided for the production of it together with the manner in which application requires to be made of those same instruments here as there the instrument is the matter of reward—the active the moving force by which application is made of it remuneration here as there the direction and mode in which application is made of it such as will accelerate the motion of the instruments it is applied to and in a word the whole moving part of the machinery—not retard it here as before this will be determined by the terms and conditions on which they operate and the publicity of those same operations—upon the force with which the voice of public opinion operates upon them in such sort as to secure the rectitude of the direction in which and the velocity with which they operate art   for aught that as yet has appeared no reason has been given why to the dispatch court judge and his deputes addition should be made of a set of judges of a different species according to the intimation given by the provision thus made of a different name the reason of this diversity     is the benefit looked for from the saving in the article of expense for an auxiliary dispatch court judge a small fraction—say a tenth part—of what at the commencement of the institution would probably be found necessary may as will be seen suffice and considering the magnitude of the number of assistants which it will probably be necessary to provide for the dispatch court judge principal not inconsiderable will be the total amount of the saving thus produced indeed were it not for this economy it seems probable that in practice an insuperable bar to the whole institution would be opposed by the magnitude of the expense art   for this reason a necessary operation has been the putting out and deducting from the remainder of the business that sort of work for the performance of which the remuneration attached in practice to the less difficult sort of work can be shown to be sufficient and for this purpose magnifying glass in hand to apply the eye of scrutiny to the several atoms of which the matter of the practice or say procedure is composed this accordingly is what has been done art   in so doing observation came to be made of a distinction which has place between the species of suits which may be styled simple and a species which may be styled complex by a complex suit understand any suit which contains in the body of it and as it were imbedded in it a number more or less considerable of simple suits insomuch that after the commencement of the complex suit in question before it can have been brought to its termination other suits arising out of the matter of it must in a number more or less considerable have received not only their commencement but their termination likewise of this see further on enactive—expositive art  0 thus then established in the dispatch court there will be four distinguishable classes of judges whose denominations are the following—     head or say chief judge principal     head or say chief judges depute     auxiliary judges principal     auxiliary judges depute by these several denominations they will henceforward be designated enactive art    functions of an auxiliary judge two—that is to say— i the masters serviceperforming function or say the masters service function ii the elementary or say excretitious suitdispatching function or say the collection and distributionperforming function expositive art    by the masters serviceperforming function—understand that function to which exercise is given by the performance of the several operations which in the court of chancery are performed by the functionaries styled masters with the exception of these administrative operations which by section viii are transferred to consignees†     expositive art    by the elementarysuit or say excretitioussuitdispatching or say collectionanddistributionperforming function—understand the following—where by a last will or a conveyance of the whole or any part of the estate or say property of an individual with his concurrence and consent for the discharge of his debts a gross sum has to be divided into shares—deciding in what manner it shall be parcelled out among such persons as by the written documents received from the equity court or from the claims put in by the persons in question in the proportions that shall appear to be due to them—and in case of contestation deciding upon the validity of the several claims made of the several shares instructional art    in a pecuniary account as between debtor and creditor whatsoever be the number of items no one of them is there to which it may not happen to be the subjectmatter of contestation and thence of a suit in this way out of one suit which when transferred to the dispatch court was still in pendency in the equity court out of which it was transferred may after such transference be made grow suits in any number to which may accordingly be given the denomination of excretitious suits and to the equity suit out of which they grew the correspondent denomination of a pregnant or say prolific or proliferous suit art    of a suit of this sort the subjectmatter is of the number of things spoken of in section viii as being of a nature to be placed in the hands of a consignee until an effectual distribution of the aggregate sum of money in question among the persons thereunto entitled can be made art    accordant with one another are the two functions in this—namely that to the due exercise of them no scientific law learning is necessary any more than to the commissioners of most of the smalldebt courts by whom are notwithstanding exercised functions as effectually and incontestably judicial as those exercised in and by any of the several wesminsterhall courts nor so much as to one species of judge—the class of judges styled justices of the peace on the chief dispatch court judgeprincipal is the reliance for the performance of whatsoever operations to the performance of which the need of scientific law learning such as that supposed to be possessed by the wesminsterhall judges has place enactive—ratiocinative art    taking cognizance each of them of so

law learning is regarded by him as needful to an auxiliary judge in his quality of accountant whatsoever part there is in the instance of which correctness in arithmetical operations is necessary and dispatch of course desirable enactive—ratiocinative art    of every such court by whichsoever functionary kept the judge depute or the judge auxiliary the doors exceptions excepted should be constantly open in each instance if visitors came the more there were of them the better if none came no harm could any such arrangement be productive of and in every case on the part of the judge the

party defendant will either be found being so on the occasion in question in some other court than the equity court in question or not if yes the dispatch court judge principal will at the time of the transference by him made of the cognizance of the suit to the judge auxiliary cause the documents if any and money if any thereto belonging to be transferred to the equity court registrar as per section vi judges powers and retaining the money will hold the documents ready to be produced at all times for the inspection of the auxiliary judge during the hearing of the suit in question as also at all other times the demand being thereupon about to be resisted in the auxiliary court the judge will on the application of the plaintiff convene the defendant that is to say him who is so in such other court and thereafter the proceedings will be the same as in the case where at the time of the transference into the dispatch court the suit was not found to be in pendency in any other court art    when on the occasion of a suit in and by which collection or distribution of money having to be made the cognizance thereof so far as regards these purposes is by the judge principal transferred to a judge auxiliary—the instrument by which such transference is performed will be an appropriate mandate issuing from the judge principal and addressed to the judge auxiliary name thereof a

time ii to preserve the parties from the delay expense and vexation of the sole accustomed remedy against such injustice namely an equity suit enactive—instructional art  0 on the occasion of each individual suit the dispatch court chief judge principal will either perform with his own hand the whole of the business belonging to it or distribute the whole or any part of it among the several other judges in such proportion as shall have been deemed by him most conducive to the ends of justice art    thence it is that between the functions belonging to one of the classes above named art    and the functions belonging to another—as between the functions belonging to the hereinaftermentioned accountants no need has place for the drawing of an exact line art    that which on this as on every occasion is essentially desirable is—that as elsewhere mentioned the provision made should be elastic—fitted or capable of being made fit to the circumstances of each and every individual case proportioned to the degree of this elasticity is the latitude of the discretion given to the judge proportionably dangerous would this latitude be but for the regulator which is capable of being applied to it this regulator is the obligation of giving reasons for what he does for by this operation of reasongiving the matter is brought under the cognizance of the public opinion tribunal expositive art    between the service of the auxiliary judge and that of the dispatch court judge depute in respect of the elementarysuitsdispatching function the difference is this—by the dispatch court judge depute the whole of the business of the suit in question is carried on in the same manner as it would have been by the dispatch court judge principal by the auxiliary dispatch court judge in virtue of his excretitioussuitsdispatching function such parts only as are hereinabove mentioned see art    ratiocinative art    of the institution of these same auxiliary judges over and above the dispatch court judge deputes as per section v the uses and correspondent reasons so far as regards their excretitioussuitsdispatching function are these— i of the sorts of suits of which the judge principal has cognizance there not being any one to which it may not happen to be taken cognizance of by a judge depute—in other words his field of service being coextensive with that of the judgeprincipal whose depute he is—thence it is that for the rendering of the service for which he is engaged need has place for appropriate skill in his instance not less than in the instance of the judge principal by whom he has been deputed need for appropriate skill and thence ultimately for correspondent remuneration at public expense—whereas for the cognizance of a suit of the sort of these same elementary suits the minimum of appropriate skill may be sufficient for example that which is possessed by the species of unlawlearned judge styled a commissioner of the sort of small debt courts styled courts of requests or courts of conscience ii small it will have been seen is the number in which dispatch court judges need or ought to be constituted whereas on the occasion of one and the same pregnant suit it may happen to elementary suits in any number to have place and to any number of them to be referred to the cognizance of one and the same auxiliary judge iii whatsoever be the number of these same elementary suits and whatsoever be the number of the auxiliary judges among whom they are distributed so many as there are of these same auxiliary judges so many are there which are capable of being carried on all of them at the same time thence a correspondent saving of delay to the suitors and of the expensivelyremunerated time of the judge principal exemplificative art    examples of excretitious suits are—  suits maintained in quality of plaintiff by the consignee of the estate of a person deceased on account of monies which he has to collect   suits maintained by him

subordination to the lord chancellor the vicechancellor and the master of the rolls enactive art    located by the chief dispatch court judge will be the auxiliary dispatch court judges in such number

discretion of the dispatch court judgeprincipal the choice of every auxiliary judge with the several correspondent powers of suspension and dislocation—thus absolutely and without rendering the possession of a qualification in any determinate shape necessary answer—reasons— i in the case of the situation of a justice of the peace the power of location is thus absolute and so as to the power of dislocation and in that case no need of application for the purpose of obtaining such dislocation has place ii as to qualification in the case of that situation no qualification of any kind has place other than one in which it is nugatory affording not any the least security for appropriate aptitude in any shape in the case of a justice of peace at large income of £ 00 ayear in a particular shape in the case of a justice of the peace in the situation of a london police magistrate the having eaten a certain number of dinners in one or other of four large diningrooms iii responsible will the judgeprincipal be to the public opinion tribunal for every such choice and on every occasion fixed upon him with a view to it will be all eyes responsible is nobody for the choice made of justices of peace at large—nobody to any effectual purpose in the case of the police magistrates iv for the uses thence the purposes by which the institution of these judges was suggested and which accordingly constitute the grounds and reasons which it has for its support see those to which expression is given above in section v judges deputes art    v to the needful number of the dispatch court judges deputes limits comparatively narrow may be seen set by the considerations there brought to view if in the case of complex suits as above described that number were not capable of being enlarged equity court suits in indefinite number would have to stand still waiting for the termination of this or that one comparatively unimportant and insignificant suit vi what is the number likely to be found requisite—answer at the utmost very considerably less than that of the masters in chancery considering how much more assiduous their attendance would be and that they would not have anything to gain by the practice by which those masters in the arts of depredation make such enormous gains—that of chopping the business times into small scraps the greatest part of each of which evaporates in inefficiency—in gossip newspaperreading or nonattendance and who attend not more than half the days in the year or some such matter upon an average of one of them in particular in a pamphlet published a few years ago mention may be seen made in whose instance the time employed in the exercise of his functions  0  exceeded not five months out of the twelve enactive art    power to the dispatch court judge to locate accountants in such number as from time to time in his judgment the demand indicates enactive art    on the occasion of every such location he will frame an appropriate report stating his reasons as in the case of auxiliary judges depute by which he has been induced to make such location art    this report he will address to the house of commons and deliver or transmit the same to the clerk by whom execution is given to the orders made for the printing of papers for the use of the honourable house enactive art    attached to the office of auxiliary dispatch court judge will be a salary of £ 00 ayear payable at the same time and in the same manner as by section ii art   that of the dispatch court judge principal ratiocinative art   —i this was the salary attached to the office of police magistrate at the institution of it anno      with this remuneration david colquhoun the wellknown and most meritorious functionary the office was ever filled by was well content to

alteration it was from good to indifferent and from indifferent to still more indifferent ii added to remuneration in this pecuniary shape and quantity and the inducement it affords will be in expectancy though not certain yet in degree proportioned to the appropriate aptitude exhibited in this situation the situation of judge principal in one or other of the proposed local judicatories if and when as herein proposed instituted enactive art    attached to the office of accountant auxiliary dispatch court judge will be a salary of £ 00 ayear payable as above ratiocinative art    this and no more is the remuneration attached to the office of comptroller in one of the boards and with this remuneration the occupant located in the office in the teeth of usage by mere merit was and is well content to the knowledge of the author of these pages enactive—instructional—ratiocinative art    between the description of persons employed as judge deputes and the description of these employed as judge auxiliaries shall there be any and what difference—answer yes of the appointment made of judge deputes the purpose is their doing all sorts of business without exception that are done by the judge principal—those which require the greatest share of lawlearning as well as those that require the least whereas the business allotted to the auxiliary judges is that in the case of which the greatest quantity of time is necessary and the least quantity of lawlearning sufficient—as per art    enactive—instructional art  0 qualifications suitable and desirable are so far as regards judiciary procedure—such as the elicitation of evidence—lawlearning and lawpractice so far as regards the taking the accounts accountantship practice art    of persons in whose instance the requisite lawlearning may reasonably be looked for are—  barristers of short standing as such   students of long standing as such of persons in whose instance the requisite accountantship may reasonably be looked for any person by whom in the character of a profitseeking occupation that business is carried on suits there may be in which a demand for appropriate qualification in both these respects may have place to these cases the judge principal will pay due regard instructional art    the logical field of service being as above no wider than that of one of the numerous judges of a small debt court called a court of conscience they not being lawyers no greater share of lawlearning will be necessary in his case than is regarded as necessary in theirs enactive art    if in a case of which an auxiliary judge is taking cognizance a point of law comes upon the carpet power to the auxiliary judge or to any party in the suit to cause the decision to be referred to the judge principal enactive art    to the dispatch court judge principal appeal lies from the decisions of every one of the judges subordinate to him as above art    from no one of those same judges does appeal lie to the decision of any other ratiocinative art    and   —i of any transient glance bestowed upon the immense delay and expense produced by every appeal in the present state of judicial practice a natural result is an apprehension of the like in this case altogether groundless it will be found on a second glance ii in relation to any point or any number of points in the decision of any one of these subordinate judges appeal may on that same  0  day or even in that same hour be made to the one judge appellate and ultimate decree pronounced by him iii in this case of the causes by which in the present practice effects so pernicious are produced one will not have place at all the other will not have place but in a much inferior degree of efficiency iv the cause which will not have place at all is—on the part of the malâ fide suitor on the defendants side when debtor staving off the time of payment thence profit by interest of money or profit in trade on either side when to a certain degree richer gaining the matter in dispute by the inability of the adverse party to go on with the suit on the part of the lawyers on both sides the profit by fees v the cause which will not have place but in a much inferior degree of efficiency is—on both sides the lawyers profits by fees by exclusion of that part of the expense which is produced by the delay exclusion will be put upon the lawyers profit on that expense what remains obtainable by the lawyer or lawyers amounts to no more than the fee for a single speech in addition to the first and by the cost of this second speech the malâ fide suitor will be divested of all benefit in every shape from a groundless or illgrounded appeal vi in the ordinary state of things the uses of appeal are—  preserving consistency as between one and another in the series of judicial decisions   security against malâ fide misdecision but as to the first of these uses no application has it on the present occasion for by express provision all such application is purposely interdicted and the other will actually be derived from it vii as to any further stage of appeal in addition to this one what has been elsewhere shown is—that from any number of such additional stages in any number no additional security against bonâ fide misdecision can be derived enactive—ratiocinative art    such appeal may be made not only from the ultimate decree but from the decision on any intermediately intervening question from the commencement of the suit to the close of it for by any such intervening decision it may happen that the fate of the dispute between the parties may be decided as well as by the ultimate decree enactive art    in case of groundless appeal power to the judge appellate to give costs and even in addition thereto to

has or has not need of the several functionaries in question ii so likewise whether and in what degree relation had to the office in question the several functionaries are endowed with appropriate aptitude iii they will each and every one of them have the most efficient motive for doing his best in the exercise of the functions belonging to his office iv no individual who does not feel within himself a consciousness of his appropriate aptitude together with a determination to do his best will take upon himself the duties of the office no impelling motive will he have for taking it upon himself an effectual restraining motive he will have to prevent him from taking it upon himself see section v judges c deputes art    v no impelling motive will the auxiliary judge principal have for locating any such depute unless in his judgment the service has need of an additional functionary in the office in question and the individual whom he has it in contemplation to locate possesses appropriate aptitude in relation to it—aptitude not merely absolute but comparative also comparative comparison had with every other individual by whom acceptance would be given to the office vi by the exertions made by their subsequentially located colleagues the antecedently located auxiliary judges will be stimulated to correspondent exertions on their parts and thus will be kept alight a spirit of emulation from which on the part of the whole number appropriate aptitude will naturally receive increase the fire of emulation will be kept alive and continually on the increase vii all this without a particle of expense to the public—to the public nor yet to any individual who is not with his eyes fully open prepared and willing to take the office upon himself viii the service will not be in danger of continuing burthened with the expense of a needless or unapt functionary—expense in the shape of money or reputation—burthened by the reluctance to inflict a wound on the feelings of the individual ix in the whole field of efficient service  0  is there a situation to which this principle of probationary location—say this probationarylocation principle—may not be seen to be applicable with indisputable advantage—in every instance good consequences important and indisputable evil consequences none is there any such situation absolutely none such is the answer that may be given with unhesitating confidence enactive art    thereupon the auxiliary judge principal will present to the chief dispatch court judge a written instrument containing the name of the person proposed by him to be located in the situation of auxiliary judge depute and declaratory of his opinion of the appropriate aptitude of the individual so proposed name of the instrument an appropriate aptitude certificate form of it as per schedule no xxvi enactive art  0 thereupon the chief judge if consenting will subjoin his countersignature to the signature of the auxiliary judge principal and the location will thus be perfected enactive art    should the chief judge refuse or forbear so to join in the location power to the auxiliary judge to present to the chief judge a requisition to state in writing his reasons for such refusal or omission and if within four weeks from the day of the delivery of such requisition no such statement shall have been made the instrument of location will be valid notwithstanding the nonappearance of such countersignature entry being made thereon of such requisition and noncompliance form of the requisition as per schedule no xxvii expositive art    by his consent as testified by such his countersignature the chief dispatch court judge is not to be understood to be responsible to public opinion for the aptitude of the individual so proposed by the auxiliary judge principal instructional—exemplificative art    businesses of which in the existing practice the masters in chancery have cognizance proper for the cognizance of the judge principal and his deputes and which as such will be reserved by him for his and their disposal are those for the dispatch of which lawlearning is requisite such as is regarded as not being obtainable otherwise than by professional practice—examples the cases in which it is referred to a master to report concerning the goodness of the title to a landed estate which is destined to be sold or purchased art    of the businesses of which in the existing practice the masters in chancery have cognizance those proper for the cognizance of an auxiliary dispatch court judge are those for the disposal of which lawlearning such as is regarded as not being obtainable but by professional practice is not requisite examples are— i elicitation of evidence for to the judges of the small debt courts called courts of requests otherwise called courts of conscience by none of whom is any such lawlearning possessed is this function in every instance assigned ii formation of a judgment on the question of fact in evidence to him exhibited or by him or in his presence elicited for to no unlawlearned men at large in the character of jurymen is this function in every instance assigned art    to one or other of the above heads will be found referable all businesses of which under the existing practice masters in chancery have cognizance enactive art    in contemplation of the absence of sinister interest it is that in a suit coming under the cognizance of the dispatch court judge power is herein given to him—for deciding in favour of the authenticity and verity of an alleged source of written evidence for the purpose of saving the delay and expense which would be the inevitable accompaniment of the transference of it to the justice chamber in which the judge in question sits—a decision to this effect—not indeed absolute and immutable but liable to reversal or modification in the event of subsequential adequatelyprobative evidence of its want of authenticity or its falsity on which occasion moreover adequate security will be taken for the application of adequate remedy in the satisfactive shape in the event of disproof so made instructional—ratiocinative art    for this reason in addition to that of the saving in delay—for these reasons it is that instructions are given to the judge principal to take into his own hands as much as may be without preponderant evil by the consumption of his own time the elicitation of the mass of evidence that belongs to the case instead of committing the function to the charge of a master or masters as in the practice of the equity courts instructional art    in the procedure of the dispatch court judge sources of saving in respect of delay and expense whence correspondent accelerative and economizing arrangements will be the following— i eliciting without interruption the whole mass of evidence which the suit affords instead of splitting the process amongst days in indefinite number distant one from another by intervals to an indefinite degree longer ii absence of all sinister interest by reason of fees the aggregate of which increase with  0  the aggregate quantity of time employed or supposed to be employed in the elicitation of it—an interest which operates to so flagitious an extent iii where and in so far as without preponderant inconvenience it can be done distributing among auxiliary judges in an indefinite number the elicitation of different parts of the mass of evidence belonging to one and the same suit of these sources of saving the two first have place in jurytrial the last is peculiar to the present institution iv giving power to the judge to assume provisionally the establishment of a relativelymaterial fact by adequatelyprobative evidence where no ground of suspicion of want of authenticity or verity has place security being taken for eventual reversal or modification of the decision so grounded as for example the authenticity of a signature to a written document forgery especially under such a check being too improbable to be reasonably presumable v care thus will be taken by the judge to maximize the number of admissions that is to say the number of the material facts admitted by the party in whose disfavour they operate the greater the number of these admissions the greater the saving of the delay and expense of extraneous evidence the expeditious means of procuring such admissions epistolary correspondence per post with inducement administered by the imposition of the burthen of costs with ulterior remedy satisfactive and even punitive if need be in case of evil consciousness in respect of refusal to admit the existence of a fact the existence of which could not but be known to the party so refusing enactive—instructional art    of the matter of the several suits the chief judge principal will on each occasion make such distribution among the judge deputes the auxiliary judges and the auxiliary judge deputes as shall in his opinion be most conducive to the ends of justice—saving the regard due to the responsibility of the auxiliary judges for their several deputes instructional—ratiocinative art  0 in regard to the question of fact what is material is—not that by one and the same person or body of persons judgments should be pronounced having for their grounds evidence applying to facts between which no connexion has place as in jurytrial is uniformly the case—but that in so far as possible without preponderant inconvenience in the shape of delay or expense or both the elicitation of the whole mass of orallyelicited evidence should be performed by or in the view of the same person or persons by whom the judgment grounded on that same evidence is pronounced why i because where falsehood accompanied with evil consciousness has place it is capable of being betrayed and made apparent by indications which it is not in the power of description to present to the judge—by indications—that is to say by tone of voice colour and lineaments of the face gesture and deportment in all imaginable respects whence also the importance of having in the presence of each other two evidenceholders whose evidence is on good grounds expected to be in a state of mutual contradiction ii true it is that in some cases this identity is not material in others not possible the case in which it is not comparatively speaking material is where on the part of the evidenceholder no sinister interest applying to the suit in question has place as for instance a public functionary having in his custody a source of written or oral evidence iii cases there may be in which either absolutely or without preponderant evil in the shape of delay or expense or both evidenceholders two or more cannot be brought together in the presence of the same evidenceeliciting and deciding judge instructional art    by the institution of auxiliary judge deputes the finishing stroke will be given to the system of accelerative and expensesaving arrangements included in and provided by the institution of the dispatch court with its correspondent procedure art    as the dispatch court proceeded—as the chancery courts became emptied of their business the masters in chancery might be pensioned off power to the lord chancellor or to the dispatch court judge with the vicechancellor or the master of the rolls so to dispose of such and so many of them as he thinks fit—a man to whom this retreat was an object of desire would of course make application for it by a written document in the case of a man should there be any such one to whom it was not an object of desire the appearance of its being so might be put on by his signature being attached to a document to the same effect this being an expedient he would naturally be glad to concur in as a screen from the imputation of inaptitude ratiocinative art    why give this power to functionaries more than one answer—reasons— i that on the occasion of any operation unpleasant or pleasant to the individuals thus dislocated the individuality of the operators may not be known to them ii this is one of the cases small in extent and number in the instance of which the exception has place to the general rule by which individual responsibility and thence on the part of the functionary singleseatedness is recommendable  0  iii increased will be the demand for this concealment by exercise given to the power of assigning a situation with its functions to each functionary thus dislocated in such sort as to render the pension conditional on acceptance given to the situation so assigned section xii sittings times of enactive art   exceptions excepted every day in the year will the judge of the dispatch court sit on duty—hours not fewer than   that is to say from  0 in the morning till   in the afternoon ratiocinative art   every day duty of the dispatch court judge why rendered thus assiduous answer—reasons— i if for so much as a single moment delay of justice—that is to say denial of justice for the time—is an evil so is it at each succeeding moment and the greater the number of such successive moments the greater is the aggregate of the evil ii completely is it in the power of the government to put an exclusion upon this evil yet does it decline to do so why—answer even because for the comparatively small benefit and comfort of the comparatively few to whom it is bound by the bands of a common sinister interest it chooses with its eyes open to afflict with the immensely greater burthen and discomfort all besides iii on no day in the year does a justice of the peace in a case in which he is empowered to act singly—that is to say without another justice of the peace sitting and acting with him—on no day does he scruple or if so inclined omit to take cognizance of any suit which is brought before him at its commencement or to proceed in one of which he has already taken cognizance iv justice of the peace—of the sort and degree of assiduity actually habitual on the part of judges of this class what are the causes—answer these— v as to the sort and degree of assiduity this requires explanation day on which a justice of the peace sits—not every day but any day that is to say any day that is agreeable to him to sit yes every day that it is agreeable to him to sit—all those days but no other days vi motives by which existence was given to this species of judicatory what answers—   benefit thereby afforded to the particular interests pecuniary and quasipecuniary straightforward and sinister together of those by whom it was instituted   to that same particular interest benefit afforded in the shape of power   so in the shape of amusement—a comedy tragedy or tragicomedy acted a dramatic entertainment the principal part by an amateur performer—his worship the inferior parts by his suitors vii for the benefit of this or that sinister interest which they possess in common honourable gentlemen and noble lords concur in the enactment of this or that act—whether salutary or for their conjoint benefit predatory or oppressive to make sure of giving execution and effect to it they concur in constituting each one of them—himself and every other of them judges to whom cognizance is given of all offences alleged to have been committed against this law what is the result—answer the system of procedure styled the summary—the only system of procedure which ever had for its ends the ends of justice in a word to render the system perfect and applicable to all sorts of cases so far as regards the mode of procedure nothing wanting but certain additional powers and means on the part of the judiciary establishment certain securities for appropriate aptitude moral intellectual and active whereof those for appropriate moral aptitude are commonly called checks of these securities about forty may be seen provided in constitutional code ch xxi judiciary collectively §    securities for appropriate aptitude viii when sleeps injustice so may justice too too often repeated can never be till it is profited from this memoriter verse as often as a measure of sham law reform is in discussion in either house—and into neither have any better measures been as yet introduced—some stentorian voice speaking through a trombone should lift itself up and drown the sound of hypocritical trash on both sides ix health recreation and comfort of the profession quotha this is a paramount and predominant consideration conclusive for the securing of good in this shape to preeminently learned few—for the ordinarily learned will not complain of being overburthened—for the small comparative ease of this minute minority of the community—for the sake of a dozen or two or a score or two—for these it is that the millions are to be tormented x nor is this all for on the field of law tyranny has place and is exercised on a large scale and by the lawyers in silk gowns the lawyers in stuff gowns by whom nonlawyers are plundered and oppressed have themselves been oppressed and plundered of their rightful share in the common xi in the cluster composed of three of the so called equity courts two of the judicatories  0  could not be brought to sit at the same time why because had they done so the consequence would have been that though by this simultaneity the addition made to delay by setting them down to operate at different times of the day would have been done away by which means in a correspondent degree the torment of suitors that is to say the relatively honest part of the number would have been lessened yet so would have been the mass of the fees stowed into the preeminently learned pockets shrouded by the silk gowns xii after consuming the first fruits of his energy and enfeebling his faculties with perhaps more or less of his health in a morning court in the service of one set of clients the learned harpy gives the dregs of those same faculties to another set of clients in an evening court the consequence is that those barristers who if the two courts had sitten at the same time would have been leaders in one fail of being leaders in either of the suits that within a given time might have been heard and ought to have been heard and if all pretended regard for justice were not a mockery would have been heard only half are heard why this addition to factitious delay why the everpertinacious refusal to break down the monopoly thus established—answer because of the whole goodly fellowship of those leaders actual and possible the most eminent and influential have seats in honourable house in which said honourable house if for their sakes the less influential are not kept in a state of comparative starvation they might become troublesome and instead of helping ministers to plunder and oppress the subject many might consume honourable and right honourable time in debates and obstruct the execution of the measures determined upon xiii among all these learned harpies and in particular the archharpies among them should it to any one have happened to make sacrifice of hygeia to plutus—to have thus thrown away a part of his health in his search for gold—indemnity is called for by him indemnity at whose charge at the charge of the relatively honest part of the whole population of suitors—delay—the quantity of delay measure of which is taken as above organized and established set apart of every year is to be a large portion during which the learned harpy is to continue feasting upon the prey seized by him injustice all the while triumphing xiv a surgeon a physician—what vacations what holidays what respite from hard and painful labour what assistance to health by alleviation of it have they or either of them for any good to himself whether in the way of pleasure or of profit from any other source or saving from loss what day in the whole year can either of them stand assured of for a shilling or two or from efficient and unrequited benevolence all night long pinched with cold or drenched with rain does the country surgeon pursue his way to the poor sufferers cottage in the scale of morality and beneficence of all professional men does not the medical man stand highest—the indiscriminate defender of right and wrong by the indiscriminate utterance of truth and falsehood lowest—down at the bottom many degrees below zero—even at the point where mercury freezes xv true indeed it cannot but be forasmuch as both are men—that as by a lawyer a suit is nursed so by a medical practitioner every here and there instead of the patient the disease but in the case of the medical practitioner this sacrifice of morality and the happiness of the comparatively many to the happiness of the comparatively few is but an exception whereas on the part of the law practitioner it is the universal rule in the case of the medical practitioner only in the less employed and inferior part of the profession is it the practice for the most amply employed—those whose whole time is employed have nothing to gain by any such cruel and dishonest practice whereas in the law profession it is by those who being the most amply employed are thereby possessed of the largest portion of influence and in places in which the lot of the million depends upon the course taken by the one or the few—it is by these cruelly and dishonestly that evil upon such immense scale is produced xvi not that it is upon degrees in the scale of morality that the question turns it stands upon ground much more easily measured it turns upon numbers on what ground stands the claim to regard on the part of the subjectmany—on the part of the subjectmany and in particular against the lawyer tribe and the dishonest part of their hirers that of the relatively honest and afflicted portion of the community of suitors added to the so much greater portion of the community consisting of those who were they not by tyranny and corruption bereft of the means would become suitors of the twenty millions or thereabouts of which in the two islands the community is composed where is he whose happiness has not as good a title to regard as that of any other whatsoever may be the number of those of whose happiness for the purchase of happiness in larger portion in the breast of others it may be absolutely necessary to make sacrifice xvii if in one shape—namely the shape of immediate profit—the medical practitioner has an incentive to nurse the disease—in  0  another shape—namely that of reputation obtainment of good repute and avoidance of bad repute—he has a restriction and whatsoever suffering would in his instance be produced by dishonest practice it would be present to his senses accordingly honesty has sympathy for a corroborative xviii but in the case of the law practitioner whatsoever is done in the way of nursing the suit is covered from the eyes of all but his accomplices and sharers in the profits of the miseryproducing trade nor in the higher branch of the profession of the suffering produced by any malpractice of his in any shape is any part ever unless by mere accident present to his senses so that in this case no place is there for sympathy by this or that question or by purposed misrepresentation of this or that matter of fact the law practitioner—the law practitioner of the highest order—puts the extinguisher upon this or that claim of the wellgroundedness of which neither he nor any one else to whom the state of the case is known entertains any so much as the smallest doubt on the occasion of which the expectation of the party in the right is of course correspondently intense and sanguine the disappointment produced with its inseparablyaccompanying pain correspondently intense and severe of this suffering to the senses of the solicitor presents itself or does not a single glance to those of the leading advocate by whom it was caused not so much as a momentary glimmering into the purse of the author of the evil have found their way some ten or twenty guineas of the injured suitor the whole life remains drenched in bitterness by which he is at last brought to an untimely grave xix by the medical practitioner the man whose leg has been fractured is not left to die of a mortification the man who has a stone in his bladder is not left to suffer for years together for want of the solution or extraction of it whence comes this state of things—answer from this were the sufferer to die for want of medical aid no fee would the medical practitioner receive were the sufferer left to suffer with the stone in his bladder for one two or three years no fees all the time would the surgeon receive in which state of things the longer the stone remains without anything done towards ridding the sufferer of it the longer is the time during which no fees are received—whereas in the case of that malady the seat or source of which is in the bodypolitic the longer the delay with its attendant pain continues the richer the profit made by the authors of it xx uniformly opposed to the interest of the client is the interest of the law practitioner of the practitioner on the opposite side of the suit completely of the practitioner on his own side not altogether but to a considerable degree always if it be his interest that his client right or wrong justly or unjustly should gain the suit it is not the less his interest that the expense—and so far as that is increased by delay the delay—be maximized xxi partly from the close connexion between the interest on the one side and the other—partly from the sympathy produced by the spectacle of human suffering as above beneficence—gratuitous beneficence—to a vast extent has place in the instance of the medical practitioner to no extent at all in the case of the law practitioner of the afflicted the number gratuitously relieved by the medical practitioner is perhaps not less considerable than the number for relief of whom remuneration is received—in the case of the sufferer whose suffering has injustice for its cause inquire where you will scarcely in a single instance will you find any such thing as gratuitous service xxii among law practitioners infamous would that man be held who should be known to be ready to render his appropriate service upon reduced terms to coventry would he be sent by the whole fraternity of his learned brethren to consign him to utter ruin no endeavours on their part would be wanting for the giving increase to the present business and extorting pay of advocacy service by no expedient that could by

sides takes place the plaintiff—that is to say he or his solicitor—in order to continue the elicitation of the facts which he expects will operate in favour of his case will have to put and propound to a party on the defendants side questions having for their object the elicitation of evidence operating in favour of his the plaintiffs case art    this done the defendant himself or his solicitor will put to the plaintiff questions tending to bring forth facts operating in favour of his the defendants side and this done will state of the facts operating in favour of his the defendants side such if any as have happened to fall within his own knowledge in other words in relation to which he has himself been a percipient witness note that the general complexion of the case will have been

defendants—there are parties more than one whose interests in the suit are in such sort and to such a degree opposite that no argument can be used in favour of one and made to operate in favour of one of the interests without its operating in disfavour of another on that same side in which case the judge will if he think proper give admission accordingly stating his reasons for so doing of which

imposed by penal responsibility in case of falsehood being the only statements having in respect of evidence any claim to regard the counsel on the plaintiffs side will not in every case have to make a statement of the several facts constitutive of the ground of the plaintiffs demand nor the counsel on the defendants side to do the like on that side but the solicitor on the plaintiffs side or the counsel on that side as the case may be will state in the first place such facts in relation to which according to his conception the parties are agreed stating thereafter such if any such there are in relation to which they are disagreed stating at the same time wherein such disagreement consists and the like statement if needful having been made on the defendants side thereupon will cease the elicitation of the evidence†     enactive art    to solicitors—that is to say to the town solicitors respectively employed by the several parties admission cannot be refused the party in some

individuals immediately and directly acquainted with the several proceedings disguised as they have been by their technical dress that have had place in the course of the suit moreover though every party will be competent to make answer to questions concerning facts which have come or are supposed to have come within his or her knowledge it is not every party that will have been adequately

perjury that is to say by fine or imprisonment or fine and imprisonment together with or without hard labour in which case the falsehood will be styled criminal but will not be punishable by transportation and for falsehood not wilful but committed through temerity or say heedlessness such examinee will be punishable by the said judge as for a misdemeanour in which case the falsehood will be styled culpable art    if in the judgment of the judge     the proof of such falsehood criminal or culpable is sufficiently conclusive he may proceed to execution on the spot as in case of contempt of court committed during the sitting of the court art    so likewise on suspicion where ulterior proof is regarded as necessary commitment may have place on suspicion if deemed necessary to prevent

any mention of the thing itself will you find turn to the earliest law book extant in which any thing occurs on the subject of such practice scarcely of anything but excuses will you find anything said strange enough the difference to a first glance altogether natural to a further glance on the part of an individual on whom the burthen of attendance at a distance from home was sought to be imposed—and this for no other purpose than that of imposing on him another burthen to an indefinite degree greater—for throwing off both burthens and if possible making his escape from them altogether ingenuity would of course be upon the rack—abundant would be the excuses proportionably so what would be to be said of them in the books so much for practice in its ancient form on the other hand on the part of a man in whose instance the taking on him the burthen was never other than an operation voluntary and well paid for—no such sensation as that of reluctance being possible no such operation as that of making excuses can ever be performed consequently on the subject of this operation nothing in any book written on this same subject would there ever be to be said so much for practice in its modern form in the view given by glanville of the course of procedure as carried on in that day by that same glanville chief justiciary under henry ii in his work intituled de legibus et consuetudinibus angliæ—under the name of essoignes or exoines in lawfrench—in lawlatin essonia plural of essonium —a list is given of excuses received in those days in lieu of attendance good says the inquisitive reader so much for this incidental topic but of the principal matter what is said the subjectmatter of controversy being suppose title to a piece of land what is said of the efficient cause of the demandants alleged right or title to this same land what is said why next to nothing the parties being once fairly brought together in the presence of each other and the judge the question who was entitled to it was a question which it was assumed would presently be settled just as at present a demand is which in a smalldebt court is made by a baker on a customer for a dozen of quartern loaves—on which occasion employment might be given to an action of ejectment with a few years of delay and a few hundred pounds of expense with about as much propriety and use as at present employment is given to an action of the sort so denominated on the occasion of a dispute about the property of a piece of land as to efficient causes of title—of any such matter incidentally only in the way of allusion and under a different head is mention made namely of about five or six of them in book xiii chap ii nor altogether without reason was this same assumption this assumption of promptitude made strange as it may seem to those whose ideas of realproperty law have no more instruction nor other source than that system of procedure which has had for its object and occupation the maximizing the insecurity of that same property and the dilatoriness of all law proceedings in relation to it for the benefit of its pretended guardians to this dead and for so many hundred years buried topic resurrection will now be given and as to the name essoign it still lives remaining attached to one of the days reckoned from in lawyers gibberish when putting to use the fixt days

society for which it was given for giving it completeness common sense applied to the common exigencies of society in its present state will now suffice for securing verity to the affirmation

locked up and authorized by law existing mendacity licence will have been cancelled responsibility substituted substituted as effectually as by punishment for perjury under the existing system it is vainly the individual by whom the excuse is sent in will be either he whose attendance it is that is commanded—say the mandatee or another individual for him if the mandatee the noncompliance to be accounted for will be the nonattendance but in each of three cases—that is to say death noninformation of the summons and physical inability to make response—not only will     compliance but excusation or say assignment of the cause of noncompliance that is to say of his nonappearance be on his part impossible here then is provision to be made of a vicarious excuse given or say excusator or apologist by whom affirmation will be to be made which may be by letter post of the fact by which the nonresponsion in conjunction with the nonattendance was produced here then will be two species of eventual excusator—excusator proper and excusator vicarious—to whom on the cover every mandate for attendance will be directed eventual mandatee vicarious a person uncertain any person to wit at that time seen by the messenger the postman in the house to which functionary the requisite instruction for the performance of his duty will in and by the particular code belonging to his office have been communicated by malâ fide litigants and their solicitors and attorneys for staving off the termination of the suit and consequently for evading proof of the receipt of the mandate devices as many and effective as human ingenuity can contrive will of course be contrived all these the tenor of the law will have used its endeavour to obviate under the existing system in the local field of procedure a sort of hunt has at all times been carried on and at all times under every possible system so long as man is man will continue to be carried on carried on on the part of each apparent hunter with or without intention to catch according to circumstances to the species of game which is the subjectmatter of this hunt no name has as yet been assigned yet name assigned to it there must be or no directions as to the catching it can be given call it then a summonee and on this particular occasion a summonee for attendance and attached to every summonee proper for attendance and response both will be a summonee vicarious for response alone as above thus it is that for the purpose of this logical species of hunt the huntees require to be put in couples in all cases as in the natural species of hunt do the hunters in some cases in regard to permission and obligation as to attendance provision will have been made by law for interest in all its several established modifications selfregarding interest trusteeship and partnership which is a compound of both trusteeship in all the several forms in which the relation between the trustee and the intended benefitee

litigantwitnesses and the evidence of extraneous witnesses or say individuals who are not parties to the suit no distinction will be made as to competency or trustworthiness ratiocinative art    why this provision—answer i on the part of an extraneous witness an interest not less strong even in any degree stronger than on the part of a party to the suit may have place not only without possibility of being proved but without being so much as exposed to suspicion hence if on the score of interest and for fear of deception by reason of it the evidence of a party or the evidence of a nonparty known to have an interest in the suit ought to be excluded so ought all evidence whatsoever ii whatsoever be the value in dispute on the occasion of the suit the seductive force of pecuniary interest will depend not on the absolute quantum of the value but upon its relative value relation had to the pecuniary and other circumstances of the individual in question iii the force of the seductive interest in question being the same suppose in both cases its tendency to produce deception will be much less in the case of a party witness than in the case of a nonparty witness why—because in the case of the party witness the judge is aware of it and of course upon his guard against it in the case of the nonpartywitness not iv under the existing system in cases in which the seductive force of interest is at its maximum and the mischief producible by it also at its maximum the evidence of a single witness has commanded and may at any time command the decision instances more than one have had place in which a man has been put to death for murder on the single evidence of an accomplice purchased by impunity with a thousand pounds reward promised in case of conviction and not otherwise nor in these cases did any doubt in respect of the guiltiness of the sufferer anywhere manifest itself v under the existing system in cases in which no seductive force in any shape is known to have place the mere name of interest in a pecuniary shape—namely the eventual expectation of a profit amounting to no more than a minute fraction of the value of the smallest denomination of coin necessitates exclusion in here and there a particular instance the bar has been removed by a statute on purpose but with these exceptions it remains unremovable vi scarcely in any other than the pecuniary shape is interest received as a cause of exclusion by no other attractive force than that of money is a mans testimony capable of being drawn aside from the path of sincerity and by that attractive force of money though it be next to nothing every mans testimony is sure to be thus drawn aside such in relation to this matter are the maxims on the ground of which the existing system has been established enactive art    in regard to priority of elicitation as between codemandants defendants and extraneous witnesses respectively the judge will in each individual case be guided by the circumstances of that same case employing in the first place his endeavours to elicit with the utmost prudentially practicable promptitude or say with the minimum of useless delay each piece of evidence in the next place his caution in not giving to any piece of evidence publicity in such sort as to give mendacityassisting instruction to subsequentlyabouttobeelicited evidence regard     being also had to the convenience of all persons concerned in respect of times of attendance section xx execution how performed instructional art   of a suit in the dispatch court the sole side to which the operation designated by the term execution applies is the defendants a case in which the side it might be supposed to apply to is the demandants or say the plaintiffs is only where in an anterior suit connected with that in which execution is called for he was defendant art   in every suit at the close thereof the question is in respect of the service demanded at the hands of the judge by the suit shall it be rendered or not if not whether any and what instead thereof in either case unless the correspondent service demanded at the charge and at the hands of the defendant in question is rendered by him execution will have to be performed if both services be denied no such execution will have to be performed art   in the course of any suit as well on the part of a demandant as on the part of a defendant it may happen that delinquency may in any one of a variety of shapes have had place and in consideration and on the account of such delinquency that remedy in the shape of compensatory satisfaction or punition or both may be to be administered but by any demand for either of these purposes initiation or say commencement is given to a fresh and distinct suit in no other shape than that of inactive in consequence of a simple refusal can execution be performed to the disadvantage of the demandants or say the plaintiffs side art   under the head of the executionsecuring purpose have been seen the several operations which for that purpose the judge is empowered to perform upon the person of the defendant and on things belonging to him to perform execution at the charge of a defendant is to give fulfilment to the effective purpose of the prehensive powers or say the power of prehension given to the judge as per section vi judges powers c art   difference between fulfilment given to the executionsecuring and the executioneffecting purpose this for the former whatsoever suffering is inflicted on the defendant is but defeasible in other words may be temporary short of perpetual—in the other it is perpetual for example if it be a house or a horse that is taken from him if the operation be the executionsecuring he loses the use of it for a time if the executioneffecting he loses it for ever so in the case of money by the difference between the two purposes will the difference between the operations respectively performed by the judge be

delivery of the subjectmatter in question that appropriate satisfaction is administered to a demandant this subjectmatter being a thing intrinsically valuable will be either a thing or an aggregate of things corporeal or incorporeal if corporeal moveable or immoveable money with casual exception to a small extent the representative equivalent and substitute of the above—in a word of all other things without the consent and concurrence of the owner are all other things capable of being prehended so likewise money in so far as the individual pieces are in the physical possession of this or any other individual and by the judge it is ascertained that they are and where they are not so money in the sense in which it is indicative of value and as such is capable of being delivered and removed in the shape of a given number of pieces of the precious metal in question the individual pieces supposing the value of them to be to the amount in question being at the choice of the person on whose account they are delivered enactive—instructional art   for the purpose of such execution the judge will take such course by which at the charge of all parties delay expense and vexation will be minimized taking accordingly for the subjectmatter of prehension things or persons or both and if things the causing to be made over to the person to whom satisfaction is done either the things themselves or money in lieu if money then to raise it causing the requisite things to be sold by virtue of his vendition mandate or say saleordering mandate expositive art   by the initiatory examination and during the continuance of the suit the means of intercourse for this purpose will have been ascertained and established section xxi equity court costs how disposed of enactive—instructional art   costs incurred in the equity courts in the suits which the dispatch court disposes of—in relation to this matter what course shall the judge take—answer i take it into his own hands he must     otherwise as to this matter the suit remains in the equity court effectual relief afforded none ii supposing the suit terminated by mutual consent—in this case in some way or other the costs cannot but be disposed of the course taken in that case will so far afford a parallel and standard of reference but upon such agreement compulsion is out of the question and here need for compulsion may have place especially where on either side mala fides has place iii the only difficulty is that which regards taxation that both parties should sit down with their own costs would not be consistent with justice it would be giving to the malâ fide suitor the benefit sought for by him where there is no mala fides each party may sit down with his own costs unless difference as to pecuniary circumstances may present a claim to allowance to the relatively indigent from the relatively opulent in return for the relief afforded him by the dispatch court where no taxation has place simple arithmetic may do the business where taxation has place—i e where mala fides has place—in this case by a judgedepute may the business perhaps be done enactive—expositive art   in the course of an equity suit it every now and then happens that in virtue of some rule of procedure or practice reimbursement of costs to one party at the expense of another has place on some incidental occasion and without reference to the mere question between the parties or to the consideration of which party has in respect of the main question been most in the wrong or most in the right from which state of things it may happen that a party who on the score of the main question has to receive costs—that is to say reimbursement of the costs expended by him—has had to pay and has accordingly paid costs in respect to this or that incidental matter as above to arrangements of this sort when already made the dispatch court judge will not without some special and sufficient reasons give disturbance but neither in any of these ways nor in any other will he assist any party in taking advantage of his own wrong whatsoever arrangements he finds necessary to make to avoid doing injustice in this shape he will on this as on every other occasion make art   under the name of equity court costs include for this purpose and on this occasion costs expended and incurred in any courts commonlaw or ecclesiastical on the proceedings of which or in the result thereof the equity court costs had on the occasion of the suit in question exercised or was in a way to exercise any controuling or directing power as to which see section vi judges powers c enactive—instructional art   suppose a case in which on the part of the plaintiff at the commencement of the suit the demand made in it was groundless and he conscious of its being so but in the meantime in the course of the suit on the part of a party to whose damage wrong has been done by the institution of the suit incidental breach of regulations or say irregularity has been committed in such sort that money on the score of costs has been paid by him to a party on the other side or according to the regulations become requisite to be paid by him in the allotment he makes in regard to costs the dispatch court judge will consider that but for the dishonesty of such plaintiff and the suffering thereby wrongfully inflicted by him on the defendant to whom he has constituted himself adversary no such transgression on the part of the defendant could have had place power accordingly to the dispatch court judge to cause such malâ fide or say evillyconscious plaintiff to refund the whole or any part of the money so received or allowed in account under the name of costs and in any proportion allot and refund it to the party by whom it was paid or his representatives as the case may be to him or them alone or else to the public revenue alone or in any proportion to divide the same between the individual and the public revenue enactive—instructional—ratiocinative art   note that though in general there will in this respect be no difference between one party and another on the same side and accordingly on failure of proof direct or circumstantial to the contrary the presumption acted upon will be that there is none—yet as this is a case not incapable of having place accordingly should it appear to have place the judge will act accordingly seeing the regard by him had in this as in all other cases to their several pecuniary circumstances he will assess the whole of the costs upon him or those whose state of mind has been that of evil consciousness no part upon him or those whose state of mind has been that of blamelessness and so in the case of blameable heedlessness section xxii dispatch court costs how disposed of enactive—ratiocinative art   as in the case of compensation making imposition of mulct and disposal made of equity court costs so in the case of the costs disbursed and incurred in the dispatch court regard will be had to the pecuniary circumstances absolute and relative of the parties—regard had and correspondent and appropriate allotment made for whatsoever reason for such regard and disposal has     place in any one of those cases the same has place in every other to no person does it make any material difference under which of all these names on which of all these occasions for which of all these causes he has to pay in regard to payment to him all that is material is what he has to pay and where and at what time or times he will have to pay it section xxiii eventual retrotransference of a suit to the equity court enactive art   antecedently to the day on which this act is appointed to expire the judge unless in the mean time further continuance shall have been given to it is hereby required to pronounce a decree in relation to each one of the suits which are at that time in pendency in his judicatory this decree will be final or interlocutory according to the progress made in the suit if it be interlocutery the suit will for the purpose of receiving a final decree revert of course to the court from which it had been withdrawn and except in so far as appealed from in such court all directions contained in such decree will in and by such court be conformed to and carried into effect as if it were in such original court that the decree had been pronounced and in such direction will be included whatsoever it shall have seemed good to the judge to determine in relation to costs art   in respect of all such suits if any in which a final decree having been pronounced by the dispatch court judge execution either in the whole or in part remains on the dissolution of such court unperformed such decree will receive its completion or its entire performance in the original courts instructional—enactive art   if as hereby eventually intended a complete system of local judicatories shall have been established antecedently to the expiration of this act or of any act passed for the continuance of it or if a local judicatory for the london judgeshire shall have been established all such suits as at that time are still in pendency in the dispatch court will be to be transferred to such london local judicatory instead of the original court section xxiv expense of the court how provided for enactive art   at the charge of the public revenue disposal of which is made by the parliament of great britain and ireland will the whole expense of the dispatch court be defrayed ratiocinative art   of the hereproposed institution it is a principle that of the remuneration received by the public functionaries employed no part shall be paid by a party on either side of the suit but the whole by government in the same manner as most other parts of the national expenditure on the contrary under the existing system paid on the whole or in great part at the expense of the suitors are the functionaries belonging to the equity courts instead of leaving the several subjectmatters of the suit in the hands in which they are at present deposited and operating upon them while in the hands of the functionaries of the equity courts why remove them into the hands of the dispatch court judge answer as above—if after a suit has been taken out of the hands of an equity judge any subjectmatter of the suit were to remain in the hands of his subordinates or any of them the consequence would be that whatsoever disposition came to be made thereof need would from time to time have place for some operation to be performed in relation thereto by this or that one of those same subordinates either those which such subordinate had been accustomed to do no otherwise than on receipt of a fee he would have to do without receiving remuneration in that or any other shape or fees such as he would have received otherwise will be to be received by him at the expense either of the suitor or as above of government compelling him to do without remuneration that for which by legal practice he had been authorised to expect remuneration would be an infringement of the nondisappointment principle and would afford a natural nor that an altogether ungrounded matter of complaint on the score of injustice take the subjectmatter out of his hands this cause of complaint has no place true it is the pecuniary loss to him is the same in the one case as in the other but on the other hand in the one case the labour such as it is continues to be imposed upon him—imposed upon him without his being paid for it but what is more material is—that he is in no other state than he would be in if it were by compromise or by impoverishment of the parties on one or both sides that the cessation were produced and it will be hard to say that the state ought to be inhibited from granting to parties that cessation of suffering which they would not be inhibited from granting to themselves or that the government having by its unapt arrangements for the sake of its creatures begun to administer to the parties impoverished something under the name of justice should be bound merely for the sake of those its functionaries to do the suitors evil to an amount much more than equivalent to the good thereby done to those same creatures     as to the fees were the payment of them to be continued the continuance of the expense would not be the only evil produced to it would be added that of the delay for in each instance when a fee is received it is on the occasion of some operation performed if the payment of the fees be continued so must be the performance of the several operations coming to be performed on the several successive occasions enactive art   fund out of which the expense of the dispatch court will be provided for—the consolidated fund art   an auxiliary extraordinary and specific fund to be drawn upon in aid and relief of the abovementioned general and ordinary fund will be composed of the produce of such fines or say mulcts as will by the judge have been imposed upon and exacted from offenders or say transgressors or delinquents in respect of all such offences or say acts of transgression or delinquency on the occasion and in consideration of and punishment for which such fines will respectively have been imposed for the list of these same offences see section vi judges powers c art    ratiocinative art  —i so far from being a source of expenditure the dispatch court proceeding on the principle in that section indicated may reasonably be expected to be and ought to be endeavoured to be made a source of revenue so also and thereby of moral melioration ii consideration had of the prodigious amount to which under the existing practice falsehood—wilful falsehood as well with oath as without oath—has place it is but too certain that notwithstanding the repressive power of the arrangements herein above provided it will at the outset have place to a very extensive amount on the part of persons of all degrees of opulence in the several capacities of suitors and witnesses iii but in each such instance no sooner is it become manifest in the eyes of the judge and as he will perceive in the eyes of all the bystanders that delinquency in this shape has had place than under section vi the delinquent will be detained in the justice chamber interrogated as to his pecuniary circumstances and if the judge sees reason incarcerated and not liberated till he has paid the sum which by the mulcting mandate he has been ordered to pay and this process may be continued by the examination of extraneous witnesses in the case of delinquency in this shape exactly as in the case of delinquency in any other shape iv as to the amount of the mulct in each individual case the grounds upon which it is to be fixed have been already pointed out in section vi art    and following if from an individual the aggregate of whose property amounts to no more than £  it is right and justifiable for the judge to exact on the score of delinquency in any shape such his £ —from an individual the aggregate of whose property amounts to £ 00000 can it be otherwise than right and justifiable for that same judge on the score of delinquency in that same shape to exact such his £ 00000 v true it is that wrong and unjustifiable it would be if into the pocket of the judge money to his own use being in both cases exacted by him money to a greater amount were exacted in the case of the £ 00000 than in the case of the £  but by the dispatch court judge no money would to his own use be exigible or receivable in either case or in any case vi not on the absolute but on the relative quantity need it be said of the money exacted from a person on the score of delinquency and punishment depends the quantity of the suffering produced by the loss—on the relative quantity relation being had to his pecuniary circumstances vii almost too obvious and too manifestly incontestable is the truth of this position to admit of its being thus in a direct way laid down in the character of a ground of proceeding laid down however it must be—to such a degree and to such an extent by sinister interest and interestbegotten and authoritybegotten prejudice have at all times the eyes of public men—of the ruling and influential few—been blinded to it viii this blindness—if real selfregard has it for its efficient cause if apparent only hypocrisy for its accompaniment ix in the direct and exact proportion to his opulence is the rich and influential man a gainer by the success with which this delusive rule having been received as if prescribed by justice is applied to practice x in this same proportion if besides being a depredator he is an oppressor—a hater of those under him as well as an inordinate and too passionate selflover—is the pleasure he derives from the thoughts of the suffering of which on their part it is productive xi excessive fines ought not to be imposed—by these words is expression given to one of the positions propositions aphorisms or axioms contained in the famous declaration of rights to which the revolution of      gave birth and the absolute is the sense in which we see by judges of the supreme criminal court as in one sense it is so aptly called it has ever since been interpreted and of the interpretation thus put upon it what have been the efficient causes one negative cause this—by this outward     show of mercy nothing has been lost to the judge from a fine to the largest amount no more money goes into his pocket than from a fine to the smallest amount     supplemental sections—   i bankruptcy and insolvency   ii henceforward dispatch court section i or xxv bankruptcy and insolvency by the arrangements hereinbefore provided see section xi auxiliary judges would be effectively made that due distribution of the assets of an insolvent which by the two existing systems—namely the bankruptcy system and the insolvency system is so vainly endeavoured to be made and the enormous waste made by the machinery of the bankruptcy court and the still more enormous waste which has place in the case of insolvency would thus be saved the first person to whom it happened to suspect the solvency of his debtor would repair to the judicatory and obtain from the judge an attendancecommanding or a prehensionandadduction mandate whichsoever the case presented itself to the judge as requiring the defendant on his appearance would be asked whether he admitted the demand or contested it if he admitted it or on contestation judgment for it were pronounced against him he would be asked whether he is ready to pay or prays a respite if he prays a respite he will then be required to produce an account of his debts his credits and other means of payment and on failure of assets notice will be given to his other creditors as well as this one to come in by being brought into court and therein into the presence of the judge a mans suffering is not greater than nor so great as by being consigned to a gaol or under the notion of a mitigation to a spunging house where instead of being divided amongst all his creditors or made over to any one of them his property is divided so large a portion of it among the lawyers official and professional the keepers of those illfamed houses being a species of gaoler and as such an official lawyer     by being laid under the obligation of giving a list of his debts and his assets on this occasion and in this way without expense his suffering is not greater than it would be under the bankrupt laws for under the bankrupt laws this same disclosure he would be obliged to make instead of one alone to the detriment of all the rest all persons to whom money from him is due will receive the same proportion of their due no part of it would go into the pockets of a set of men to whom no part of it is due—namely the aforesaid lawyers of that part of the aggregate mass of the property of bankrupts and insolvents which now fails of being paid to their creditors a large proportion would be saved for them not it is true the whole for before the debtor has been caused to appear before the judge it will have been in his power to any amount—  to give undue favour to a creditor or creditors of his own choice   to do so in appearance for his own benefit by making over to them his property in trust for himself   to dissipate it by giving it away   to lay it out in the purchase of services yielding no permanent equivalent transferable to creditors or   in the purchase of consumable goods consumed accordingly but in the two first cases the transfer in so far as proved might be declared void and the transferree if solvent made to refund and in the case of evil consciousness or temerity punished and in the three other cases the then maleficent debtor might be punished and by the apprehension of the punishment in these cases the maleficent act would be prevented in a large proportion of the number of the instances in which in the present state of things it has place and that delay would be saved which at present is created for the sake of the sinister profit and thereby a loss by the interest added to the loss by the principal but whatsoever be the amount of it no otherwise can this good effect be produced than on condition of substituting the herebyproposed system of procedure with the contemplated judicial establishment to those which are at present in existence the judicial establishment because indispensable requisites are a multitude of judges though each acting singly and these sitting without intermission—sitting with as little intermission as the keeper of the gaol and the keeper of the spunginghouse—the procedure system for necessary are on the part of the pursuer initiatory examination—on the part of the defendant obligation of answer viz vivâ voce by questions arising out of answers and under a sanction equivalent to that of an oath now as to proceedings in case of insolvency incidentally discovered   relative or say particular   absolute or say general—into these two cases taken together allcomprehensive the case of insolvency requires to be distinguished in the most ordinary case the sort of insolvency which by the demandant is supposed to have place on the part of the supposed defendant is no other than relative or say particular by some cause or other compliance on the part of the proposed defendant with the demand made by the demandant is prevented but what that cause is is not by the demandant matter of knowledge or belief in particular it is not known that inability to comply with the demands of other demandants actual or probable or say future contingent is the cause or among the causes of noncompliance with relation to this same demand of his but of that summary mode of procedure which under the proposed system is the only mode employable in every instance in which on the part of a defendant absolute insolvency has place one effect will in every case be this—if with the demand made by the demandant compliance at the hands of the defendant is desired compliance on the spot if the subjectmatter of the demand be money will be ordered for this he will by the original hithercome mandate have been prepared if then if at that same sitting the money is not produced by him he will be provisionally consigned to some person for custody for the purpose of compulsory compliance such will be the result unless on his part relative inability or say insolvency is alleged then will the defendant have to say to the judge—this is what you have ordered me to do—to pay to the demandant this sum of money but to do this is what i am not able thereupon comes of course a dialogue to the effect following— judge to defendant—you see how the matter stands before you quit this justice chamber you must pay this money or state to me that you labour under an inability so to do and what are the circumstances which this inability has for its cause defendant to the judge—sir i am not able to pay this money judge—how happens this defendant—sir at the moment your attendancerequiring mandate reached my hands i had due to me divers debts from so many different debtors and in this interval i have not been able to obtain from them money in sufficient amount to satisfy this demand judge—on what day if on any do you expect to be able to obtain from them or otherwise the requisite and sufficient sum are there any and what persons besides this demandant to whom you owe money if yes if on that day you have money sufficient   0 to satisfy the demand of this demandant shall you also have money sufficient to satisfy the demands of all such your other creditors such are the questions by which in the case in question it will be the duty of the judge to elicit satisfactory answers for if by law he is bound to obtain satisfaction for this one just demand not less is he to obtain equal satisfaction for all others into the state of the defendants affairs the judge will accordingly at this same hearing proceed to examine and by questions arising out of answers he obtains an insight into that same state which if not particular in a degree sufficient to afford a warrant for proceeding definitively in relation to any other debt is at any rate as particular as the circumstances of the case admit of its being made to supply the deficiency then at this same time comes the order requiring the examinee on a day appointed to reappear with a written list of debts and effects—debts due to him included—in a word with what in insolvency court language is called a schedule in this way at the earliest moment possible the bloody flux is stopt the judge proceeds convening as far as needful all the defendants other creditors and debtors in amount proportioned to each ones need if he sees reason he respites payment payment from the defendant to his creditor from the defendants debtors to their creditor the defendant on this same occasion if he sees need he puts questions having for their object the ascertaining whether in contemplation of insolvency undue favour has not been shown by the defendant to this or that creditor to the detriment of the rest if yes he causes the excess to be refunded great will be the efficiency of this arrangement and this not merely in making reparation for the wrong but in the prevention of it true it is that for this arrangement machinery will be necessary but to how prodigiously less an amount than that of the bankruptcy and the insolvency system put together all this over and above the diminution produced by the substitution of this same summary mode to the procedure before the master in a case of accounts between parties who on all sides are in a state of solvency what now does the existing system the provision made in the case of insolvency it splits into two branches two branches vying with each other in inaptitude—in inefficiency for all purposes but those of the lawyer brotherhood now for a result average amount of the dividend under the bankruptcy system  in the pound under the insolvency system not so much as a shilling in the pound as for the causes of this waste the development of them requires too much of detail thence too much of time and letterpress to be performed

 plan of parliamentary reform in the form of a catechism with reasons for each article with an introduction showing the necessity of radical and the inadequacy of moderate reform by jeremy bentham esq originally published in              parliamentary reform catechism introduction section i history of the ensuing tract—alarming state of the country and the constitution the following little tract was written as long ago as in the year   0  it was offered at the time to one of the timeserving daily prints in which other papers on the same subject had already found admittance no name was sent with it and the weathercock being at that time upon the turn insertion was declined from that time to the present despair of use kept this together with so many other papers upon the shelf in a state of things such as the present if in any they possess a chance of finding readers—sad condition of human nature—until the cup of calamity mixed up by misrule has been drunk to the very dregs never has the man a chance of being heard who would keep it from mens lips for a long time past had the necessity—and not only the necessity but supposing it attainable the undangerousness—of a parliamentary reform and that a radical one presented itself to my mind if not in a light as yet sufficiently clear for communication at any rate in the strongest colours long had this sole possible remedy against the otherwise mortal disease of misrule been regarded by me as the countrys only hope long had i beheld and not long after did i delineate the road to national ruin in the economy of edmund burke adopted and enforced under william pitt by the pen of his confidential adviser mr rose the first of these sketches is already before the public the other will soon be so drawn on in the road to that gulf from those times down to the present—the country if my eyes do not deceive me is already at the very brink—reform or convulsion such is the alternative how faint soever the hope of its being attainable—i for one under the disease under which i see the country lingering cannot discover any other than this one possible remedy of the composition of it—such as in my conception it must be to be productive of any effect—some conception was and is now endeavoured to be given in the ensuing little tract on the subject of the necessity more than a few introductory pages cannot at this time and in this place be spared to give any adequate conception of it would require a much larger work for the destruction of everything by which the constitution of this country has ever been distinguished to its advantage no additional measures need be employed let but the principles already avowed continue to be avowed—let but the course of action dictated by those principles be persevered in—the consummation is effected gagging bills—suspension of the habeas corpus act—interdiction of all communication between man and man for any such purpose as that of complaint or remedy—all these have already become precedent—all these are in preparation—all these are regarded as things of course the pit is already dug one after another or all together the securities called english liberties will be cast into it with the sacred name of reform on their lips and nothing better than riot or pillage in their hearts let but a dozen or a score of obscure desperadoes concert mischief in a garret or an alehouse fear will be pretended—prudence and wisdom mimicked—honest cowards will be made to acquiesce and to cooperate by feigned cowardice—for the transgression of the dozen or the score the million will be punished and from the subjects of a disguised despotism will be made such under a despotism in form to which disguise is no longer necessary—such is the state of things for which it is time for every man to prepare himself as for the habeas corpus act better the statutebook were rid of it standing or lying as it does up one day down another—it serves but to swell the list of shamsecurities with which to keep up the delusion the pages of our law books are defiled when no man has need of it then it is that it stands comes a time when it might be of use and then it is suspended     section ii most prominent present grievance gareisoning france the plains or heights or whatsoever they are of waterloo—will one day be pointed to by the historian as the grave—not only of french but of english liberties not of france alone but of britain with her was the conquest consummated in the netherlands whatsoever has been done and is doing in france will soon be done in britain reader would you wish to know the lot designed for you look to france there you may behold it in france on the subject of their common interests no longer can any information be received through the channel of any newspaper other than those which are not only instruments but avowed instruments in the hands of the ruling despotism no longer from any source any information that has not for its object deception—constant and universal deception information in which with a degree of anxiety proportionate to its importance truth is suppressed and by which pernicious error is circulated and inculcated a newspaper into which any expression can find its way by which the feelings of great characters in their high situations can in any degree be hurt—and is it possible they should not be hurt as often as any misdeeds of theirs are exposed—any such source of instruction is in that country a no longer tolerable nuisance the same causes will produce the same effects the same great characters by which the monster of anarchy has so happily been crushed in france—by these same exalted persons will the same monster be crushed in britain there they are—our fifty thousand men with the conqueror of french and english liberties—the protector of the bourbons—the worthy vanquisher and successor to bonaparte at the head of them they are—and until every idea of good government—every idea of anything better than the most absolute despotism—has been weeded out—once more as thoroughly weeded out by the bourbons as ever it had been by bonaparte—there it is that the whole of them or whatsoever part may be deemed sufficient for the purpose are destined to continue there they are and for what is it that they were planted there—for security for the security of britons for the security of frenchmen for the security of germans for the security of netherlanders for the security of any other race of men under the sun impossible had the security of anything but the universal despotism which produced it been the object of that new holy league by which all france is put under a garrison—the means of security were as obvious as the efficacy of them was certain—and in comparison with the existing ones the modes and forms lenient to the vanquished blow up all their fortifications without exception carry off all their cannon destroy all their arsenals and their founderies destroy all their manufactories of arms of every kind leave them not a fowlingpiece mark out for predicted vengeance every attempt to set up another foundery—parcel out half the country among the allies or should any such partition be too dangerous to christian charity among the crowned and newlychristianized christians divide the whole into any number of lots yes though the whole country were parcelled out into lots—still if in each lot men were left to take their own measures for the preservation of what was left to them—all these inflictions put together would have been mercy in comparison of that of fastening upon their shoulders the old man of the woods with his   0000 foreign guards for the moment in respect of subjection and absence of everything that ever went under the name of liberty france is but what she was exit the old weathercock enter the ultras and then spain will be to france the model of good government then under the protection of the waterloo conqueror and his employers the wardrobe of the holy virgin will be supplied with a new gown and every prison in the country with a new set of tortureboots and thumbscrews let him who thinks himself able figure to himself a case in which there would not be a demand—an adequate demand—for the system of garrisoning france—on the supposition that the existence of any such demand has place at present the demand is composed of possibilities—converted it is alleged into practical certainties by past facts there have been septembrians and anarchists—ergo no sooner does france cease to be garrisoned by us than the reign of those miscreants will recommence there has been one napoleon bonaparte—ergo no sooner does france cease to be garrisoned by us than in comes either the selfsame or exactly such another well these past events who is there that can cause them not to have had place nobody well then never never can it cease—the necessity of garrisoning france with english armies once more—for what then is it that france has been is now and by the blessing of god is destined to be forever garrisoned is it for security—is it for the keeping out anarchy—is it for the keeping out bad government alas no to any such object never never has any real fear attached itself the healing—the moderately monarchical—constitution on which at their entrance the     despots set their perfidious foot would that have been bad government no it was not for keeping out bad—it was for keeping out good government under whatsoever form it might have been established—constitutional monarchy or upon the model of the american united states democracy—there was the real object of terror to all the newly rechristianized crowned heads—and to their loyal and correspondently pious—coroneted and not yet coroneted advisers there they are—but happily with the atlantic between us and them—the neversufficientlyaccursed united states there they are—living and oh horror flourishing—and so flourishing flourishing under a government so essentially illegitimate oh what a reproach to legitimacy oh what a reproach a nevertobeexpunged reproach to our own matchless constitution—matchless in rotten boroughs and sinecures oh had they but one neck—these miscreants ten times twenty times any number of times the blood spilt at waterloo would be well spent in cutting it there they are with their prosperity the effect there they are with their good government—their matchless good government—the cause of it there they are—but happily with two thousand leagues of sea between us and them—the ten millions of twolegged swine with the illegitimacy and the unincumbered and undisturbed prosperity in which they wallow but now—suppose the same or a similar accursed government with the accursed prosperity transplanted from that blessed distance—planted under our very noses planted with no more than oneandtwenty miles of sea to dilute the stench of it without so much as a single useless place needless place overpaid place unmerited pension—not to speak of sinecures—no not so much as a peerage to settle a borough or buy off a country gentleman—suppose these miscreants—not one of them rechristianized—not one of them occupied in embroidering a robe for the holy virgin—debating and resolving and enacting—without so much as a single bayonet to secure good order to their deliberations—resolving and enacting and like their accursed preceptors and forerunners paying off public debt faster than we are contracting it—suppose all this state of things brought into existence—brought into existence and not more than halfaguinea or a crown for a place in a passageboat—not more than three hours row in a wherry—necessary to enable a man to see it in this case by what possibility could the eye the head or the heart be shut against the spectacle of the united nuisances—prosperity and good government to what use deny their existence with as much effect might a man deny the existence of the dome of st pauls in the face of those who are viewing it from st jamess park here then is one use for the fifty thousand britons who in france with the hundred thousand men of other nations are preying at one and the same time upon the vitals of france and britain here is one use—behold now another the other use—need it here be mentioned exists there that reader who has not already told it to himself yes it is to return to all plans of reform to all petitions for reform—to all groans—to all complaints—to all cries for mercy—the proper and properly and already proposed answer the bayonet the bayonet yes by the blessing of god the bayonet but is it altogether so sure that should matters come to the push the direction that will be prescribed by legitimacy is exactly the direction in which the bayonets will move the men by whom they will be to be pushed of what class are they are they of the blood royal—are they of the peerage are they not of the swinish multitude—are they not as perfect swine as we are is it possible they should ever forget it and when in a direction that is not pleasing to him the swine is driven is he not apt to retrograde an army in france necessary for the security of britain yes if an army in china is so too—not otherwise propose anything good the answer is at hand—wild theoretical visionary utopian impracticable dangerous destructive ruinous anarchical subversive of all governments—there you have it well but in america there it is and no such evil consequences—nothing but what is good results from it aha and so the united states government is your government is it—you are a republican then are you—what you want is to subvert this constitution of ours the envy of nations the pride of ages—matchless in rotten boroughs and sinecures—very well begin and set up your republic and in the meantime you who are so ready to talk of feelings think what yours will be when after a few nights lodging in the tower the knife of the hangman after having rubbed off its rust upon the spenceans is doing its office in your bowels propose anything that would put any power into the hands of those of whose obedience all power is composed you propose democracy and if any such epithet as democratical is applicable to it there you have a reason and that a conclusive one for casting it out without further thought casting it off as if it were a viper and trampling upon it and for this reason—for there needs no other—is eternity to be given to every thing that is corrupt and mischievous what according to these men is the use     of the constitution to make the people happy make them happy—curse on the swinish multitude what then why to make the one man happy the one object of legitimate idolatry—with the small number of others to whom it accords with his high pleasure to impart any of the means of happiness now by this bugbear word democracy are the people of this country to be frightened out of their senses—frightened by gwelphs any more than by stuarts into passive obedience and nonresistance section iii causes of the above and all other mischiefs—particular interests monarchical and aristocratical adverse to the universal—their ascendency goaded to the task by the groans of all around me of late—with an attention which the nature of the objects that were continually forcing themselves upon all eyes and upon all ears rendered more and more painful to me—i have been looking more closely than ever into the constitution—i mean the present state of it—and in as few words as possible of this most appalling of all examinations what follows is the result as early as the year   0  and i forget how much earlier it had seemed to me it has been already hinted that in the principle which by those in whose hands the fate of the country rested had not only been acted upon but avowed the road to national ruin might be but too clearly traced this principle was—that in the hands of the trustees of the people the substance of the people was a fund out of which without breach of trust and without just reproach in any shape—fortunes—as the phrase is—by those who without exposing themselves to punishment could contrive to lay their hands on the means might be—nay—and it being matter of necessity at any price and to an amount absolutely unlimited ought to be—made in this principle i saw the two domineering interests—the monarchical and the aristocratical—which in our mixed constitution—for such at least it was at one time—antagonizing with the every now and then struggling but always vainly and feebly struggling democratical completely agreed—and without concert because without need of concert cooperating with each other—in the dissemination and in the inculcation of it the party out of power as well as the party in power inculcating it in theory the party in power by theory and practice that on the part of both these interests this principle together with the practice that belonged to it was but too natural—was abundantly evident that for its adoption it had any such plea as that of necessity was a notion which when once taken in hand vanished at the slightest touch power money factitious dignity—by an attractive force the existence of which and the omnipotence is as indisputable as that by which the course of the heavenly bodies is determined—each of these elements of the matter of good—that precious matter the whole mass of which in so far as at the hands of the monarch it is sought by a member of either of the two other branches of the efficient sovereignty operates in the character of matter of corruptive influence—attracts and draws to it the two others the greater the quantity a man has of any one of them the greater the facility he finds in his endeavours to obtain for himself the two others each in a quantity proportioned to his desires—those desires which in human nature have no bounds the more he has of any one of them the more therefore it is his wish to have of that and all of them but the more he has of any one of them the more is it right also that he should have of them all of them at the expense of the people—the poor people at whose expense whatsoever is enjoyed by their rulers is enjoyed oh gross oh flagitious absurdity the more no but on the contrary the less whatsoever be the quantity of the matter of reward which in any shape whatsoever may be necessary to obtain at a mans hands the requisite service the more he has of it in any one shape—the less the need he has of it in any other shape in the case of the poorest individual—in the character of a guardian by any man has any such immoral notion ever been started as that in the substance of his ward any proper source of enrichment to himself is to be found power over a single individual and his little property a sufficient payment for the labour and power over twenty millions and their property together with all that mass of patronage—lucrative of necessity a great part of it—shall it not be sufficient those who either have no property or have it not in sufficient quantity for their maintenance—such men must indeed either be paid or not employed—but among men who not only have property but have it in sufficiency is it supposable that there can ever be a deficiency in the number of those in whom the pleasure of possessing such power will be sufficient compensation for all the pain attached to the exercise of it look at the country magistracy see we not there—not only an example but a host of examples yes and in those examples a host of proofs unfortunately—in the breasts of all who have power merit being as they all agree and certify—to one another and to the people infinite—so must be the reward of the demand for the matter of reward—viz     money power and factitious dignity—these are its principal shapes—the infinity and absolute irresistibility being thus established then and thereupon comes the demand for the supply—and that supply a proportionable one here however to a first view comes somewhat of a difficulty from the body of the people—how habitually soever blind and passive—money in infinite quantity cannot be demanded all at once they would become desperate they would rise better they would say to themselves better be shot or hanged at once than starved a set of drains must therefore be established and set to work drains by and through which by degrees—those degrees ever in the eyes of the devourers but too slow—under colour either of use or what is so much better of necessity—money may be drawn out of the pockets of the blinded deluded unsuspicious uninquisitive and ever too patient people—  wars   distant and proportionably burthensome dependencies all over the habitable globe—and note that in prosecution of these views every such dependency without exception has been made a source of net expense—net expense the amount of which is destined to perpetual and unlimited increase   penal colonies   claims of universal dominion over the universal waterway of nations with a determination to destroy the shipping of all nations by whom those claims shall be contested   annexation of hanover to hampshire and that to the end that not a hostile gun may be fired anywhere on the continent but that we may be in readiness to interfere subsidizing one of the contending parties and helping to oppress the other   splendour of the crown that effulgence with the increase of which—and in exact proportion to that increase—will increase the respect and with it the submission and with it the happiness of the people   erection of hanover into a kingdom for that purpose and that the hanoverians may the less grudge the increase of taxes that will be necessitated by the increase of dignity here though not yet a complete one is a list of these productive drains—and are they not efficient ones as for war—never can a pretence for it be wanting—a pretence not yielding to any in which at any time in the course of the present reign it has ever been made—no never can a pretence be wanting so long as that nation exists anywhere against which war can be made the nation—the nation to be warred upon—is either formidably strong or providentially weak—if formidably strong too long have we delayed the necessary task of obtaining at the expense of it indemnity for the past and security for the future—if providentially weak now is the favourable time for taking advantage of its weakness and preventing it from becoming formidable—now has the lord of hosts—as the archbishops prayer will not fail to inform us—delivered the enemy into our hands thus if there be nothing past for which to obtain indemnity security for the future will at any rate be an easy purchase the french people for example—already have they had one set of septembrizers—and—so happy were they under them—by the first favourable opportunity they would give themselves another and no sooner had they septembrized france than they would cross over and with the assistance of the travelling orator and the spenceans septembrize us in the same way the french have already had one bonaparte—so happy were they under him—leave them to themselves—immediately they would give themselves another in his scheme for invading and conquering this country the first bonaparte failed—the second bonaparte by whom such another plan would immediately be formed would succeed in his from these two considerations put together or indeed from either of them follows the necessity of garrisoning france and keeping possession of the country till the danger is at an end—yes till the danger is at an end which it is impossible it ever should be yes wars would be invaluable were it only for the merit of which they are the neverfailing sources when a battle is fought—unless it be a drawn one which does not often happen—it must be gained by somebody gained on one side it must be in what degree soever the generals on the respective sides are fit or unfit for their work the greater the number that fight the greater the number of those who are capable of being killed a battle is gained—the number of the killed is great—and half a million is scarce enough to reward the merit which from one single bosom has been displayed in it in regard to all these drains of money and all these sources of merit and reward—the great misfortune is this for every shilling which by means of any one of these drains unless it be the last the men of merit—and all placemen without exception are ex officio men of merit—for every shilling which the men of merit thus put into their pockets some score or some dozen at least must come out of the pockets of the poor people a man who sets his neighbours house on fire that he may roast an egg for himself—is the emblem by which a certain sort of man is pictured by lord bacon would you see a man of this sort you need not look far so you look high enough for these fiveandtwenty   0 years or thereabouts—to go no further back—has this poor nation been kept on fire lest the emblematic eggs in sufficient quantity should be wanting to its rulers money is it wanting and it always is wanting for the support of the splendour of the crown—for the support of royal dignity money supplied by parliament—supplied in a direct way and without a burthen more than correspondent to the supply being deficient—and it always is deficient—droits of admiralty are sent by almighty providence to feed but never to fill up—for nothing can ever fill up—the deficiency the persons for the reward of whose merit more and more of that object of universal desire is everlastingly wanted—these persons join with one another not only in commencing groundless war but in commencing that groundless war in a piratical manner—in a manner in which the monarch and his instruments may add millions to the conjunct splendour—not only the foreigners who thus and for this purpose have been converted into enemies are plundered but the men by whose hands the plunder is got in deprived of that which had the war been commenced otherwise than in the way of piracy would have been their due thus do these on whom it depends bribe one another to commit piracy—piracy which has been made legitimate because by their power and for their own benefit it has been made unpunishable money power factitious dignity—among the modifications of the matter of good—among the good things of this wicked world—these as it is the interest so has it ever been the study—as it has been the study so has it been the endeavour—of the monarch—as it has been so will it and where the monarch is a human being so must it be everywhere—to draw to himself in the greatest quantity possible and here we have one partial one separate one sinister interest the monarchical—the interest of the ruling one—with which the universal the democratical interest has to antagonize and to which that allcomprehensive interest has all along been—and unless the only possible remedy—even parliamentary reform and that a radical one should be applied—is destined to be for ever made a sacrifice—a sacrifice yes and by the blessing of god upon the legitimate and pious labours of his vicegerent and the express image of his person here upon earth a still unresisting sacrifice omnipresence immortality impeccability—equal as he is to god as touching all these attributes ask blackstone else i   0   0        —who is there that without adding impiety to disloyalty can repine at seeing anything or everything he might otherwise call his own included in the sacrifice meantime the money which in an endless and boundless stream is thus to keep flowing into the monarchical coffers—this one thing needful cannot find its way into those sacred receptacles without instruments and conduitpipes upon and out of the pockets of the people it cannot be raised but through the forms of parliament—not but through the forms of parliament nor therefore without the concurrence of the richest men in the country in their various situations—in the situation of peers great landholding and as yet uncoroneted commoners styled country gentlemen—and others in those men is the chief property of the country and with it—for in the language of the aristocratic school property and virtue are synonymous terms—the virtue of the country and here we have another partial separate and sinister interest—the aristocratical interest—with which the democratical interest has also to antagonize—another overbearing and essentially and immutably hostile interest—against which and under which the universal interest has to struggle and as far as possible to defend itself such is the state in which the country lies—the universal interest crouching under the conjunct yoke of two partial and adverse interests to which to a greater or less extent it ever has been made—and to the greatest extent possible as far as depends upon them cannot in the nature of man and things ever cease to be made a continual sacrifice for the consummation of this sacrifice adequate inclination—such is the nature of man—never could have been wanting—but as to the power—the effective power—never at any former period could it have been seen swelled to a pitch approaching to that at which it stands at this moment well such being the swell of voracious power what are the means—what the instrument—by which it has been effected what but the precious matter already mentioned—yes the very matter of good—for such in itself it is but by reason of the two relative situations—the situation of the hands by which it is possessed and that of the hands which the very nature of man keeps ever open to receive it operating—and by the whole amount of it—in the character of matter of evil—matter of corruptive influence ever upon the increase is the quantity of this essentially good this accidentally but alas how extensively pernicious matter—ever upon the increase the pernicious effect of it in an endless series of alternating and reciprocating operations this matter is itself both effect and cause waste begets corruption corruption waste fed through the already enumerated drains—viz useless places needless places overpay of needful places groundless pensions and sinecures some number of times more richly endowed than the most richly endowed efficient offices—these together with peerages     and baronetages and ribbons—for peeragehunters baronetagehunters and ribbonhunters—these by their bare existence and without need of their being either asked or offered—always with the fullest effect never with the personal danger or so much as the imputation attached to the word bribery—operate in the character and produce the effect of matter of coruptive influence that pestilential matter against the infection of which not a household in the country can be said to be secure from the archiepiscopal palace down to the hovel by the road side what not the ducal mansion oh no that full as little as any other the duke who if there were no such thing as a ribbon nor any such place as a gaminghouse nor     but there is no end to the et cæteras—might of himself be independent is dependent by his dependents and the more enormous the mass of his property the more numerous as well as the higher the list of his alliances—the wider and the more craving is the circle of his dependents laud his virtue party orator party scribe—laud that virtue which is composed of rank and property and consists of nothing else laud him today while he is yet yours—come tomorrow he has crossed over and his place is on the other side a duke has a borough and in it a brace of seats sincere or insincere quoth the duke to one of his agents whose attachment to the cause of the people was well known to him cast your eyes around you and find me out the two honestest and ablest men you can lay your hands on to fill those seats the agent bestirs himself and reports but ere the report reaches its destination the coroneted patriot has found money wanting and the borough the seats with the patriotism that would have filled them are all sold yes in this country—under this constitution—may be seen an official person who by his station is for ever ex officio c—r† general it is his situation makes him so it suffices for the purpose to produce the effect and let this be well observed no overt act—no nor so much as a thought—is on his part necessary—were it possible for him to have the will scarcely in his situation would it be in his power to avoid being so well this attribute which blackstone has forgot to add to the other attributes of the god of his idolatry—this attribute of c—rgeneralship which after all could not have place if there were not a parliament to c——this inseparable attribute disastrous as it is does it in this our country form any peremptory objection to monarchy not it indeed but why not even because in democratic ascendency—such as it would be constituted by radical reform—the corruption would have its antidote—its constantly operating antidote—and that antidote an effectual one extinguish monarchy—suppress extirpate the peerage—oh not i indeed nothing would i extinguish nothing would i extirpate uti possidetis—that which you have continue to have—and god bless you with it—this in all matters of reform—this in so far as is not inconsistent with the very essence of the reform is—and so long as i have had any has ever been—with me a ruling principle leaving with all my heart the full benefit of it to monarchy and aristocracy—to the ruling few my aim my wishes confine themselves to the securing if it be possible a participation in that same benefit to democracy—to the subjectmany—to the poor suffering and starving people monarchy a property not it indeed monarchy is a trust is it not prince regent—have you not said it is peerage a property not it indeed peerage is a trust is it not my lord anybody if it is not what business have you to be what you are and where you are     ascendency ascendency—that is what is sufficient this therefore is all that should be asked for in ireland we have protestant ascendency well and what is the effect in ireland the catholics—the great majority—are not yet it is true quite so well circumstanced as could be wished still however they exist still they are not extirpated for the seduction of his fellowtraveller what was the course taken by the ingenuity of ferdinand count fathom ask his biographer—ask smollet he will inform you he began with picking her pocket her purse and with it her virtue was then at his command by mere existence on the throne on which he is sitting without need of stirring a finger uttering a word or giving a nod in the character of that ferdinand and with the same disastrous success may the monarch of these realms act accomplices—the hero of smollets history had none he needed none the official s—of britannias virtue—the c—rgeneral of this country—may have as many as there are men in whose breasts exists an effective demand for any of the good things which he has at command and in regard to this effective demand—as adam smith would call it—the difficulty would be to find—not the bosom in which it does but the bosom in which it does not display itself in this state of things c—rgeneral being the proper style and title of the headmanager of the concern taken by himself—add the aristocracy—the corrupted and corrupting aristocracy—c—rgeneral  co is the proper firm of the partnership as to the business of it it consists but too plainly like that of the bank of england in draining the contents of all pockets into its own and the more intolerable the indigence thus produced the more craving the demand for that corruptive supply by the hope of which men are engaged to concur in the continually repeated measures from which the indigence receives its continually repeated aggravation now of this almost universal corruption what is the effect a mere moral spot—a mere ideal imperfection alas no but a somewhat more palpable and sensible one what the real the sensible mischief consists in is—the sacrifice made as above of the interest and comfort of the subjectmany to the overgrown felicity of the ruling few the effect of the corruption being—to engage all whom it has corrupted to bear their respective parts in the perpetual accomplishment of their perpetual sacrifice is not this sufficiently intelligible well if that expression be not perhaps this may be viz that the subjectmany long have been and but for the only remedy may with but too much reason for ever expect to be continually more and more grievously oppressed that the ruling few may be more and more profusely pampered now suppose an army of frenchmen garrisoning england as an army of englishmen oh pretenceless and inhuman tyranny are garrisoning france in that case what would the description of our condition be what but that the dominion we were groaning under was the dominion of a set of men whose interest was opposite to our own by whom that oppositeness was understood and felt and by whom our interest was made a continual sacrifice to that separate and hostile interest well that and but too indisputably is it not the description—the too just description—of the dominion under which we live discarding the case of public—of national—subjection under a foreign yoke take the case of private—of domestic subjection—take the case of negro slavery the description of the case is it not still the same the slaveholder it may be said—for it is continually said—has an interest in common with that of his slaves true and so has the mailcoach contractor in common with that of his horses while working them and so long as they appear able to work he accordingly allows them food yet somehow or other notwithstanding this community of interest so it is that but too often negro as well as horse are worked to the very death how happens this how but because in the same breast with the conjunct interest is lodged a separate and sinister interest which is too strong for it even so is it in the case of c—rgeneral and co under whose management the condition of the poor people is day by day approaching nearer and nearer to the condition of the negro and the horse i can have no interest but that of my people says the royal parrot—i can have no interest but that of my people with these words in his mouth he gives the touch of the sceptre to a bill for establishing a nest of sinecures     under the constitution as it stands—under the administration as it is carried on—in what state as towards the one and the other are the affections of the people take the answer from lord castlereagh morn chron feb        in the year just ended   000 were the number of firelocks indispensably necessary to aid the civil power in the discharge of its duty in other words to keep the people from the endeavour to substitute a better to the government as it stands now indeed at this season of forced retrenchment  000 is the number of men to be struck off from the desired complement of   000 struck off why because they are regarded as superfluous oh no for of those means of coercion which require no money boundless is the supply which at this very moment is providing why then even because—as under the most perfectly undisguised despotism so under a disguised one—in so far as supplies cannot be had—the revenue having in the compass of a single year fallen off for example by any such amount as that of onesixth—retrenchment must be made in this time not only of peace but of triumph—no     pretender in existence—france instead of a cause of fear an object of compassion—threeandfifty thousand men necessary to be kept up to prevent a second revolution in the same year of the last century as this is of the present one our greatgrandfathers—what would they have said to such a number—our greatgrandfathers—in whose days a pretender continually threatening from abroad and at home a strong party even after a defeat were still strong enough to keep on foot matter for another rebellion which in twentyeight years from that time actually broke out in the same year of the last as this is of the present century what was the whole number demanded and provided for this same service answer   000 and no more not so much as onethird of the number actually in demand as above walpole then in opposition opposing even that number on the ground of alleged excess well then by a standing army it is that we are governed and a standing army—a     standing army of the magnitude which has been seen—this this is the sort of instrument without which it is said we could not be governed and by which—so long as the constitution in the form into which it has been moulded lasts—it is the intention of those that govern us that we shall be governed and this is that constitution—that matchless constitution—in the praises of which those whose opulence or power have been produced by or are dependent on the abuses of it never tire and in this constitution we have a parliament—and in this parliament a house of commons—and in this house of commons a mask for a military government of its own erection—and this mask so transparent an one and under this military government so long as the mask remains—under this military government are we to lie down now and for ever prostrate and contented well the united states—the seat of representative democracy alias anarchy—what plots real or pretended have they or have they ever had in their bosom what standing army is it that they have on the subject of those concerns which are the concerns of every man what laws have they to prevent each man from communicating with every other—on pain of death to prevent every man who is not from speaking his mind to any one who is a soldier oh but the fault whatever it is it is always the fault of the people—behaving continually worse and worse they must continually be treated with more and more just severity—the sinners for their own sins—the nonsinners for the sins of the sinners—so long as any of them are left alive     no at this time—at any time on the part of the people any extensive discontent that has ever manifested itself never has it been the fault of the people discontent no patience—too much patience—in that has been their fault—their only fault a sad fault that—and unhappily under every government but an adequately representative government—under which alone the concerns which are those of every man are left without restraint to the discourse of every man—an incurable one the people what interest have they in being governed badly—in having their universal interest sacrificed to any separate and adverse interest but the men by whom they have been governed—the interest which these men have had in governing badly—in governing as they have governed—this interest has here been made manifest or nothing can be section iv sole remedy in principle—democratic ascendency such being the disease behold now the remedy—the only remedy he for whose nerves it is too strong let him as soon as the irritation pains him—take warning and shut his eyes against it let him shut his eyes and prepare his neck for a yoke the pressure of which will continue on the increase till     either convulsion breaks it or existence sinks under it this remedy—two words viz democratical ascendency will in principle suffice for the expression of it taking this for the general description of the end—parliamentary reform will next make its appearance in the character of a means parliamentary reform in general as a proposed means radical parliamentary reform as the only means by which either that immediate end or the ultimate end—political salvation can in the nature of the case be accomplished without any outward and visible change in the forms of the constitution—by the means already indicated by the mere instrumentality of the everincreasing mass of the matter of good operating in the hands of the crown in the character of matter of corruptive influence—have the two separate partial and sinister interests—viz the monarchical and the aristocratical—obtained over the democratical interest which is no other than the universal interest not only an ascendency—but an ascendency so complete that under the outside show of a mixed and limited monarchy a monarchy virtually and substantially absolute is the result without any outward and visible change in the forms of the constitution—though waste already committed cannot be caused not to have been committed—though past misrule cannot be caused not to have reigned—yet may the plague be stayed to the democratical to the universal interest give—one might almost say restore—that ascendency which by the confederated partial and sinister interest has been so deplorably abused and so long as it continues will continue to be abused—thus you have the remedy this is what parliamentary reform will do if it does anything this is what parliamentary reform means if it means anything this in the year    0 and again in      was the declared wish—the accomplishment of it the avowed the official the parliamentary endeavour of the late duke of richmond a duke—and with royal blood though from a sinister channel flowing in his veins already even at the earliest of those two periods a veteran a veteran—not only in the army but in parliament in office and of course in high office his declared object was—the restoring to the people what by him were regarded as their unalienable rights and what—taking the word right in a certain altogether usual sense though assuredly not in a legal sense may with indisputable propriety be said to be so—his object—giving to the people those rights his declared and principal means—universal suffrage and an annually renewed house of commons—now this peer—this duke—what object less good than this could have been his object—what his expectation could it have been anarchy—could it have been so much as democracy but read his plan—one of the few schemes of legislation to which the authors have been at the same time able and willing to give the support of reasons read his plan and with it read his reasons they are contained in a letter dated august         and addressed to lieutenantcolonel sharman commander of the volunteers ireland some ipsedixitism in it about rights might in point of reasoning though perhaps not in point of power of persuasion have been spared but setting aside the ipsedixitism—better and sounder and closer reasoning is not often to be found never yet has that man been found who durst grapple with it men shut their eyes against it and write and talk as if it had never been in existence now in this change—for unless the plague continues and spreads a change there must be—in this change is there any innovation no in substance there is not so much as an innovation the one thing needful is—that the power of the purse should be actually and effectively in the hands of the real representatives the freely chosen deputies of the body of the people the power of the purse that being the power by the exercise of which for the defence of the people against stuart tyranny all other needful powers were acquired now at various periods in the history of this country this allproductive power was actually in the hands of the people witness statute after statute witness in one reign viz the splendid and unhappily conquering reign of edward iii and at thirtytwo years interval two statutes by each of which the annual holding of a parliament—and in those days parliaments annually holden were annually changed—was declared to be the legitimate state and condition of the government now if in those days—in those days in which the press was unknown—in which scarce any man but a priest could so much as     read—and in which there was nothing worth the reading—no—not so much as the bible—to be read—if in those days in which standing armies were unknown the people could without danger to themselves or anybody else possess and exercise the power of the purse—if in those days of ignorance and barbarism all this could be—in these our days under the protection of such a forest of bayonets—in these our days in which every man either reads or hears his newspaper—and in which everything that in this part of the field at least man can need for his instruction may be to be found in newspapers—in these days shall blind cowardice or tyranny in the skin of cowardice find in pretended universal ignorance a pretext for scorning universal suffrage but of this more in an ensuing section but enough and already too much of the endlessly mischievous absurdity involved in the word innovation what is evil converted into good by being old—good into evil by being new what is experience worth nothing in toothless infancy is there more wisdom than in grey hairs from selfcontradictory nonsense let us come to common sense from long past and widely dissimilar let us come to the present state of things in the ascendency of the democratic interest—to anything but the continuance of unconstitutionally usurped and most perniciously abused power is there any the slightest show of danger—in any determinate and assignable shape any the smallest ground for apprehension what shall decide shall it be experience well by experience and that as well in its negative as its positive shape the decision is pronounced look to positive experience behold it in the american united states there you have—not merely democratic ascendency—democratic ascendency in a mixed government—but democracy—pure democracy and nothing else there you have—not one democracy only but a whole cluster of democracies there all is democracy all is regularity tranquillity prosperity security continual security and with it continually increasing though with practical equality divided opulence all all is democracy no aristocracy no monarchy all that dross evaporated as for us we need no such purity we could not brook it the dross has a glitter on it our eyes are used to it—that glitter we cannot part with it with us so far as consists with national salvation possession not only of property but of power even though that power be but a trust is a sacred thing the uti possidetis principle as in international law a well known and frequently applied so in internal government a sacred principle well let us keep it then—the whole of it not pure democracy do we want nor anything like it what we want is under the existing forms of subjection the ascendency—the virtual and effective ascendency—of the democratic interest this is all we are absolutely in need of with this we should be content with less than this it is in vain to speak of content for less than this cannot save us look to negative experience while in the language of legitimacy and tyranny and of the venal slavery that crawls under them democracy and anarchy are synonymous terms—see whether on the whole surface of the globe there is or ever has been anywhere so much as a single example from which this abuse of words can receive countenance look once more at the united states and see whether on the habitable globe there exists anywhere so regular so wellregulated a government look not to greece or italy look not to ancient or to middle ages look not to any selfacting democracy compared with the democracy here in question—compared with a representative democracy—a democracy in which the sole power exercised by the people is that of choosing their deputies and in those deputies their rulers—whatever else has been called democracy has had nothing of democracy but the name well then forasmuch as in democracy though it be american democracy a total democracy—forasmuch as in a democracy standing by itself without support from anything but itself there be no such thing as danger—no diminution of security for person property reputation condition in life religious worship—in a word for anything on which man sets a value—what ground can the nature of the case afford for any apprehension of danger—in a partial democracy with monarchy and aristocracy by the side and at the head of it for its support for its support and for keeping it in order a standing army—a conquering—an irresistible standing army—that grand instrument of order—all around it well then such being in general terms the instrument—and the only possible instrument—of political salvation now as to the principles by which the application made of it requires to be guided at present the cause of the misrule is this viz the rule is completely in the hands of those whose interest it is—their interest and thence of necessity their desire and as far as depends upon them the determination—that the misrule should continue—the thing required is—leaving the executive part of the government where it is—so to order matters that the controuling part of the government shall be in the hands of those whose interest it is that good government shall take place of misrule of misrule in every shape and more particularly in the two most intimately     connected and mutually fostering shapes—waste and corruption corruption and waste now these are the whole body of the people two classes alone excepted viz those by whom a loss in the shape of money and those by whom a loss in the shape of power not to speak of factitious dignity would be sustained or apprehended from the change as to what regards money the uti possidetis principle being received and acted upon—supposing delinquency out of the question the only loss that could befal anybody would be loss of the chance of increase as to what regards power in this shape it cannot be denied that of any change—by which misrule could on the whole or any considerable part be made to cease—loss of power actually in possession—and that to no inconsiderable amount—would be an altogether inevitable consequence loss of money yes but of what money of money at present expected to be received as the wages of corruption loss of power yes but of what power of that power which at present for the purchase of the wages of corruption in the shape of money as well as other shapes is perpetually on sale before proceeding any farther up comes it must be confessed a question the title of which to an answer cannot admit of dispute in the case of so vast a multitude of individuals of the vast majority of whom it were too much to suppose that they had any tolerable acquaintance with the business of government—how is it that there can be any adequate probability of their concurring in the making a tolerably apt choice in regard to the persons by whom it shall thus be carried on the short answer is—that as the matter stands the question is but a question of curiosity and theory that for the purpose in question a choice sufficiently apt can be made—is habitually made—and with entire confidence may be reasonably depended upon—is by the american examples above referred to put altogether out of doubt the question is then reduced to this viz in what among the circumstances belonging to the case are we to look for the cause of a state of things of the existence of which there cannot be a doubt—but which in a distant and abstract view of it presents itself as thus improbable for giving immediate facility to the answer a distinction no less familiar in itself than important in its consequences may here be brought to view this is—the distinction between a selfformed and a derivative judgment on the ground of any selfformed judgment few indeed could in a case such as that in question be expected to act with any tolerable degree of wisdom or felicity—true but neither is it less so that on the ground of derivative judgment there exists not nor in this country is ever likely to exist any such large and miscellaneous body of men of whom the majority may not even in such a case as this be expected and with reason to act with a degree of felicity adequate to the purpose for in respect of those concerns which to each individual taken by himself are of still superior importance—viz physic law and religion for example—every man who is not in his own eyes competent to make on the ground of his own selfformed judgment the choice of an agent or assistant does he not feel himself reduced to the necessity of acting on the ground of derivative judgment—in a word on the ground of public opinion—and under the yoke of this as well as so many other necessities the business of life—of private of domestic life—goes on in the way we see of private life well and why not also of public life of the business of each well and why not then the business of all and     note that on this occasion the probability of making any such choice as shall be not only foolish but mischievous—and in so far as it is not practically mischievous no matter how foolish it is is not only circumscribed but circumscribed within very narrow limits by the nature and number of the individuals who on an occasion such as that in question can offer themselves with any the least prospect of finding acceptance at the hands of the majority of so large a multitude as that in question say at least several thousands true it is that were the electors for example the parishioners of a small parish—many might be the instances in which it might happen that foolish and ignorant men might in considerable and those preponderant numbers agree in the choice of some artful and profligate man of their own level and their own set—by whom to his own private and sinister purposes their confidence would be abused but when—whether it be in respect of territory as well as population or in respect of population alone—the electoral circle is of any such large dimensions as those in question all such individual and private causes of seduction and deception are altogether out of the question no man can either propose himself or be reasonably expected to be proposed but upon the ground of some reputed qualification of his possession of which supposing him to possess it the whole population of the electoral district will be in some sort in the possession of the means of judging but of all qualifications real or imaginable the qualification such as it is which consists in the possession of property to such an amount as to draw attention is at the same time the very qualification concerning the possession of which men in general are best satisfied with their competence to form a right judgment—and that on which in proportion to its real virtue in the character of presumptive evidence of appropriate aptitude the greatest reliance is—by men in general and in particular by the most uninformed classes—wont to be placed the men who at present determine the course of election by the influence of will on will—these same men in the event of the proposed change—these same men and in a proportion much more likely to outstrip than to fall short of their deserts—would they not by the influence of understanding real or imputed on understanding exercise for the most part the same effective power—produce for the most part—so far as concerns possession of the seats—the same effects as now possession of the seats—yes viz in the case of those in whose eyes after the necessary change on the only terms on which they would be to be had these seats would be worth having but among those by whom the office is at present possessed—possessed and on each occasion at each mans pleasure the functions that belong to it either exercised or neglected—how many are there in whose eyes it would be worth possessing if at all times the functions could not be left neglected except when under the spur of sinister interest the power of it came of course to be abused well—and suppose among     members—for the supposition that number may do as well as another—among the     members returned under a system of democratic ascendency ten knaves should be found plotting and confederating with one another though what in that case could they be gainers by any such plotting—and fourscore and ten fools foolish enough to be led by them in such a case what is the mischief they would be able to do alas how happy would not the state of things be in comparison of what it is if there were not more than thrice ten knaves occupied without ceasing not only in the plotting of mischief but in the doing it and carrying it into effect—more than thrice ten such knaves—or if it be but once the once is but too sufficient—and more than thrice fourscore and ten—in whom in a proportion altogether indeterminable—the knavery of following with eyes wide open at the tail of the knaves—and the folly of suffering themselves to be led with winking or halfclosed or carelessly or purposely averted eyes—are combined   0 ascendency yes ascendency it must be nothing less will serve talk of mixture yes this may serve and must serve but then the intrinsically noxious ingredients—the ingredients which must be kept in though for no better reason than that we are used to them—and being so used to them could not bear—for who is there that could bear—to part with them—these ingredients of which the greatest praise would be that they were inoperative must not be in any such proportion of force as to destroy or materially to impair the efficiency of the only essentially useful one talk of balance never will it do leave that to mother goose and mother blackstone balance balance politicians upon roses—to whom to save the toil of thinking—on questions most wide in extent and most high in importance—an allusion—an emblem—an anything—so as it has been accepted by others is accepted as conclusive evidence—what mean ye by this your balance know ye not that in a machine of any kind when forces balance each other the machine is at a stand well and in the machine of government immobility—the perpetual absence of all motion—is that the thing which is wanted know ye not that—since an emblem you must have—since you can neither talk nor attempt to think but in hieroglyphics—know you not that as in the case of the body natural so in the case of the body politic when motion ceases the body dies so much for the balance now for the mixture—the mixture to which as such such virtue is wont to be ascribed here is a form of government in which the power is divided among three interests—the interest of the great body of the people—of the many—and two separate interests—the interest of the one and the interest of the few—both of which are adverse to it—two separate and narrow interests neither of which is kept on foot—but at the expense to the loss and by the sacrifice of the broader interest this form of government say you has its advantages its advantages—compared with what—compared with those forms of government in which the people have no power at all or in which if they have any they have not so much oh yes with any such form of government for an object of comparison its excellence is unquestionable but compare it with a form of government in which the interest of the people is the only interest that is looked to—in which neither a single man with a separate and adverse interest of his own nor a knot of men with a separate and adverse interest of their own are to be found—where no interest is kept up at the expense to the loss by the sacrifice of the universal interest to it—where is then the excellence nay but says somebody in the form of government in question what the supreme—the universal power is—is a compound—a mixture of the three powers corresponding to the three interests what the excellence produced by it is in is—not any one of the three ingredients taken by itself no—it is the mixture take away any one of the three masses of power the mixture is changed     the excellence is diminished—take away any two of them mixture has place no longer—the excellence vanishes good—this notion about mixture oh yes good enough so long as the respective natures of the several interests are kept out of sight look at them and then see whether it be possible that taking the power of the people for the simple substance—by the adding to it either or both of the two other powers and thus making a mixture—any such quality as excellence with reference to what belongs to the simple substance taken by itself can be produced a form of government in which the interest of the whole is the only interest provided for—in which the only power is a power having for its object the support of that interest—in this form of government behold the simple substance to this simple substance add separately or conjunctively a power employed in the support of the interest of one single person and a power employed in the support of the interest of a comparatively small knot of persons—in either of these cases you have a mixture—well compared then with the simple substance when and where can be the advantages of this mixture what—what could man ever find to say in behalf of monarchy but that monarchy is legitimacy—or in behalf of aristocracy but that property is virtue fair questions these—should any man feel disposed to answer them let the answers be so too and let them not—oh let them not be either imprisonment or death go to the flourmill get a sack of flour in which there is flour and nothing else—make bread of it—there you have the simple substance in making your bread add now to the flour some powder of chalk with or without some powder of burnt bones in either case you have a mixture well in either case so long as you do not add to the flour too much of that which is not flour your bread may afford nourishment it may give to your constitution—to the constitution of your natural body—a support but from either of these two new ingredients does this body of yours derive any nourishment the

can undertake to measure it section v remedy in detail radical parliamentary reform elementary arrangements in this edition of it—their necessity immediate cause of the mischief—on the part of the men acting as representatives of the people coupled with adequate power a sinister interest productive of a constant sacrifice made of the interest of the people     causes of the above cause—in the breasts of these same agents—undue independence coupled with undue dependence independence as towards their principles dependence as towards the c—rgeneral by whose co—tive influence the abovementioned sacrifice is produced here in the above elements—here in a nutshell may be seen the mischief and its causes—against this mischief revolution apart behold in parliamentary reform the name of the only possible remedy in these elements when developed may be seen—what radical reform is—what the sort of reform termed moderate is thence what and where the difference the reform sketched out in the ensuing plan being of the radical kind—the advantages by the consideration of which the several elementary arrangements contained in it were suggested will there be found but on the present occasion what is required is—from all the several arrangements in question to show—this having been the result of the inquiry—that while by radical reform a remedy and that an adequate one would be applied—by moderate reform no remedy would be applied or next to none in brief the undue independence would remain and with it the undue dependence thus far in generals now for development— first point to be considered—situations in and to both which to be effectual the remedy must apply itself these are—   situation of parliamentary electors   situation of parliamentary representatives   first as to the situation of parliamentary electors take for the description of the ultimate end advancement of the universal interest in the description of this end is included—comprehension of all distinguishable particular interests viz in such sort that such of them between which no repugnancy has place may be provided for in conjunction and without defalcation—while in regard to such of them between which any such repugnancy has place such defalcations and such alone shall be made as when taken all together shall leave in the state of a maximum whatsoever residuum of comfort and security may be the result—with exceptions to as small an extent as possible interests all to be advanced without any exception all to be considered   in the character of a means in this same description is moreover included—if it be not rather the same thing in other words—virtual universality of suffrage   in this same description is moreover included—if it be not the same thing again in other words—practical equality of representation or suffrage applied to the name of the quality universality the use of the adjunct virtual is—by the limitation of which it gives intimation to distinguish it from unlimited universality of suffrage unlimited or absolute being the degree of universality which but for the application of some limitative adjunct would according to the correct import of the word be to be understood of absolute universality if admitted the effect would be—to admit to the exercise of the franchise in question persons of various descriptions none of whom would be capable of exercising it to the advantage either of others or of themselves idiots and infants in leadingstrings may serve for examples by virtually universal suffrage what i mean is—that which will remain of absolutely universal suffrage when from the number of individuals designated by the word universal all such defalcations shall have been made as by specific considerations shall have been shown to be productive each of them of a benefit in some special shape that benefit being at the same time preponderant over every inconvenience if any such there be resulting from the limitation thus applied—a limitation viz to the operation of the principle by which the comprehension of all interests as far as practicable is prescribed if in the instance of any one individual of the whole body of the people it be right that the faculty of contributing to the choice of a representative—to the choice of a person by whom in the representative assembly his interest shall be advocated be possessed and exercised—how can it be otherwise than right in the instance of any one other such person in this question viz in the impossibility of finding an answer to it unless it be in the case and to the extent of the several defalcations above alluded to—will it is believed be found contained the substance of the argument in support of universality of suffrage if in the instance of any one individual it be right that he should possess a share of a certain degree of magnitude in the choice of a person to form one in the aggregate body of the representatives of the people—how can it be right that in the instance of any other individual the share should be either less or greater in this question is contained the substance of the argument in support of practical equality of representation that which universality of suffrage has for its limit is—need of defalcation for divers special causes or reasons to give intimation of this limit is the use of the adjunct virtual that which equality of representation has for its limit is—in the first place the inconvenience which in the shape of delay vexation and expense could not fail to be the result of any endeavour employed at any     assignable point of time to give existence to absolute equality in the next place the impossibility resulting from the diversities of which in respect of increase and decrease the quantity of the population is everywhere susceptible viz the impossibility of keeping on foot—for any length of time any such absolute equality—supposing it to have in the first instance been established   in the same description is moreover included freedom of suffrage freedom to which in the present instance may be considered as equivalent terms—genuineness and nonspuriousness to say that a suffrage ought to be free what is it but to say—that the will expressed by it ought to be the very will of the person by whom it is so expressed—the will of that person and of that person only his selfformed will—the product of his own judgment selfformed or derivative as the case may be—not produced by the knowledge or belief of the existence of any will or wish considered as entertained by any other person at whose hands the voter entertains an eventual expectation of receiving good or evil in any shape good or evil according as by him the said voter the wishes of such other person in relation to the matter in question shall or shall not have been conformed to in so far as in the instance of any voter the vote which is given is according to this explanation and in this sense not free it is manifestly not genuine it is spurious—under the guise and disguise of the expression of the will of the voter it is the will—not of the voter but of some other person in so far as it is given as and for the will of the voter the giving it is it any thing better than an act of imposture   or   secresy of suffrage short reason its necessity to secure freedom i e to secure genuineness—to prevent spuriousness extensive and important as is the result of the whole body of electoral suffrages given in the aggregate number of the electoral districts yet under any scheme of representation in which any approach were made to virtual universality and practical equality of suffrage—the value even in his own eyes of the interest which any one man can have in the choice of any one candidate in contradistinction to any other will generally speaking—and unless in so far as it may happen to it to be swelled by affections and passions produced by accidental circumstances—he extremely minute so minute that barring such accidental causes of augmentation scarcely can there be that private and separate interest so small as not to be capable of prevailing against it of prevailing against it in such sort as to give to the vote a direction opposite to that which would be the result of the regard entertained by the voter for such his share in the universal interest—always supposed that in the case of such selfregarding interest the advantage corresponding to it is regarded as certain of being received which in the case of a bribe for example it always is in the case of the vast majority of the number of voters that would be produced by the principle of universal suffrage—halfaguines for example or any interest equivalent to the interest corresponding to that sum may under a certainty of its being received be stated as abundantly sufficient for the purpose but setting aside the case of an interest created by expectation of eventual good or evil—expected as in that case at the hands of some other person or persons according to the direction known to have been given to the vote—it is not in the nature of the case that from a vote given by a single one out of any such large number of electors as is in question—say for example three or four thousand—any assurance or operative expectation whatsoever of any effective advancement of selfregarding interest to any such amount—no not so much as to any such amount as the value of a single shilling—should be entertained by any man by himself nothing could the candidate in question supposing him chosen do for the advancement of any such individual selfregarding interest on the part of the voting elector much less could the elector himself by any disposition given by him to a vote by which no effect whatsoever could be produced without the concurrence of a thousand or two of other votes thus it appears that by no indigenous—by no inbred—selfregarding interest could any quantity of seductive or corruptive force adequate to the purpose of effectual corruption be created not so in the case of such selfregarding interest as in so many various circumstances is capable of being created by seductive or corruptive force operating from without in the present state of things four thousand guineas for example more or less is said to be the average price of a venal seat on this supposition four thousand minus one being supposed to be the number of voting electors two thousand guineas would suffice to carry the election and on any other election supposing four thousand guineas the price paid—here would be a couple of guineas which any man and every man would have it in his power to receive by the selling of his vote here then is a quantity of corruptive force amply sufficient halfaguinea per vote or some such matter has been spoken of as the price habitually paid—and by whom paid by a member eminent for probity as well     in public as in private life and this in a borough in which his probity—lying more within knowledge than elsewhere—cannot but be held in at least as high estimation as it can be anywhere else but if thus operating ab extra an interest corresponding to the sure receipt of halfaguinea suffices to determine the conduct of each one of a two or three thousand of electors much more will four times that sum true it is that in any such state of things as that which is here proposed—at no such sum as four thousand guineas or anything approaching to it could the value of a seat remain but no such seat could remain without possessing some value and so long as the seat possessed a venal value so long would each one of the number of the votes on which the possession of it depended thus minute is the portion of corruptive force which ought to be regarded as generally adequate to the production of the corruptive effect—on the supposition that as in the present state of things the direction taken by the vote is in each instance known or knowable on the other hand let but this direction be to a certainty unknown to every individual but the voter himself—the freedom—the complete freedom—of his suffrage is the necessary result in vain—at the instance or for the satisfaction of any other person at whose hands eventual good or evil is expected—in vain would he disclose though it be ever so truly the direction taken by his vote apprized as every voter would be that in such a case not veracity but falsehood would be the course prescribed by a sense of moral obligation—under the uncertainty produced by the diffusion of a maxim to this effect and by the universal declaration by which the observance of it might be enforced—by no elector could any adequate inducement be found for putting in any such case any real restraint upon the freedom of his suffrage by no other person in the character of tempter would be seen any adequate prospect of advantage—advantage even from simple solicitation still less from pecuniary expense employed in the endeavour to divest the suffrage of the freedom so essential to the utility of it true it is that it is only on the supposition that on the part of the majority of the voters there exists in the breast of each either from selfformed or from derivative judgment a practically adequate conception of the course dictated by his share in the universal interest—true it is that only in so far as this supposition is in conformity to fact will the freedom in question supposing it secured be subservient to the great ends proposed but of the propriety of a supposition to this effect proof sufficient for practice has already it is presumed been afforded nor as yet is the subject closed freedom of suffrage being taken for the end—it will soon it is hoped be generally seen and recognised how essential in every instance to the accomplishment of this end secresy of suffrage is in the character of a means in what different ways freedom of suffrage is capable of being taken away—to what extent and by the influence of what descriptions of persons it actually and constantly is taken away—these are among the topics under which the state of the case will presently be brought to view so much as to the situation of elector now as to the situation of representative for the purpose of this part of the argument the situation of elector must be supposed to have been properly marked out and established and for the marking out and establishment of it the fulfilment of the above condition—the investing of the suffrage with the abovementioned desirable qualities—viz virtual universality practical equality freedom and secresy must be regarded as effected   due dependence—i e dependence as towards constituents   due independence—i e independence as towards every other person—these together with universal constancy of attendance present themselves as occupying in relation to this situation—as occupying and on the same line—the first rank in the scale of ends and means   dependence as towards constituents—understand dependence to this effect viz that in the event of a mans becoming in the eyes of the acting majority of his constituents to a certain degree deficient in respect of any of the elements of appropriate aptitude viz appropriate probity appropriate intellectual aptitude or appropriate active talent—it may before he has had time by means of such deficiency to produce in any considerable quantity any irremediable mischief—be in the power of his constituents by means of a fresh election to remove him from his seat   independence—understand as towards all other persons at large but more particularly as towards c—rgeneral and co by whose influence alone the nature of the case considered dependence as towards himself can ever—in the instance of any proportion     approaching to a majority of the whole population of the house—have place   as to due dependence—i e dependence in relation to electors according to another supposition the truth of which has it is presumed been proved—on the part of the electors—at any rate on the part of the great majority of them—there does exist the disposition to contribute towards the advancement of the universal interest whatsoever can be contributed by their votes by those votes by the aggregate of which—that is by the majority of that aggregate—will be determined the individuality of the several persons on whom in the character of their representatives will be incumbent the duty of acting their parts respectively towards the accomplishment of that same ultimate and comprehensive end unfortunately by the essential and unchangeable nature of the two situations—viz that of c—rgeneral and co with the immense mass of the matter of good—not to speak of a less but still very considerable mass of the matter of evil—both matters not only capable of being made to operate but by reason of these same relative situations at all times—without need of any active and purposely directed operation on the part of anybody to that end—actually and with prodigious effect operating in the character of matter of corruption—the representatives of the people are one and all exposed to the action and that an altogether intense one of this same baneful matter in this state of things that which in the very nature of the case is altogether impracticable is—the keeping them in any such state as that in which no such sinister interest would be capable of being in any sensible degree productive of any sinister effect towards preserving a man then in such a situation from being thus corrupted all that the nature of the case admits of is—so to order matters that in the event of his becoming obsequious to the influence of the matter of corruption and thereupon manifesting a deficiency in the element of appropriate probity his power of doing mischief may receive a termination as speedy as the other exigencies bearing upon the case may admit   as to due independence independence as towards c—rgeneral and co in regard to this endowment what is manifest is—that by any direct means—by any means other than that which consists in the rendering the representative dependent by reason of his seat—dependent therefore in a degree which cannot be greater than that whatsoever it be which corresponds to whatsoever may in his eyes be the value of that seat—nothing towards securing to him the possession of this endowment can be done this being the case this endowment resolves itself into the beforementioned one—viz due dependence nor in addition to the antiseptic power possessed by the due dependence does it appear that by any circumstance referable to the head of independence—due independence—any ulterior security can be afforded that which monarch and lords remaining no reform in the commons could prevent the monarch from doing is—the giving to any member of the commons house or to any person in any way connected with him a useful and needful place a needless place a useless place an overpaid place a ribbon or other badge of factitious dignity a baronetcy a peerage and so in the case of any number of the members—in this state stands the mischief but that which a reform in the commons so it be a radical one can do is—so to order matters as that on the occasion of the next general election that has place the electors if in their eyes the appointment wears the character of a bribe shall have it in their power to rid themselves of the supposed betrayer of his trust—in this state stands the remedy in the way of punishment not to be inflicted but on legal evidence true it is that against the bestowing of the matter of corruption not on the member himself but only on a person connected with him nothing does the nature of the case admit of in the way of remedy but so far as concerns the withdrawing their confidence for this purpose no legal evidence is necessary such being the primary or principal securities follow now two secondary or instrumental ones   impermanence of the situation viz to the degree in which it is secured by annuality of reelection—by the annual recurrence of the elective process in two distinguishable ways does this species of instrumental security contribute to the two principal ones—  in proportion to the shortlivedness of the power diminishes both to purchasers and thence to sellers the venal value of it—the profit capable of being reaped by c—rgeneral and co by corrupting the representative in question and engaging him to betray his trust   the profit to c—r and thence in the shape of money or moneys worth the price which he will be willing to pay and thence the corruptible representative be able to receive in the same proportion moreover increases the power of the antiseptic—the corruptionopposing—remedy placed in the hands of his constituents the sooner the time for reelection comes the earlier will that remedy be applicable     to reduce to its minimum the quantity of time during which it shall be in the power of the representative to continue in the supposed course of mischievous conduct what would be requisite is—that immediately on the supposed commission of any such breach of trust it should be in the power of his principals that is to say of the majority of his constituents to divest him at any time of such his trust but to produce any such effect might require the keeping of the body of the electors in such a state of almost continual attention and activity as would be incompatible with that degree of attention to their means of procuring and insuring to themselves in their respective productive occupations those means of subsistence without which the requisite quantity would to a more or less considerable extent fail—and thereby mischief be produced in a degree far more extensive than could reasonably be expected to be produced by the difference between a possession capable of being revoked at any time and upon the shortest notice—and a possession the termination of which could not be effected oftener than at the recurrence of some determinate and short period such as that of a single year in which last case the maximum of the average duration of the supposed disposition to pursue a mischievous course would vacations considered be reduced to considerably less than the half of the year on this occasion two inconveniences present themselves as requiring to be guarded against viz general want of preparedness and particular and incidental fraudulent surprise when—for a judgment to be passed by the several bodies of electors on the conduct of their respective representatives a determinate and universally foreknown day is appointed—the time capable of being occupied in the consideration of that conduct will in every instance be the same—in every instance allowing of more time and opportunity for appropriate and universal preparation than could have place upon any other plan thus much as to general preparation now as to particular surprise in this one word surprise may be seen a species of fraud to which all public bodies stand exposed by a particular knot of confederates whose object is to carry some measure which in case of a full attendance would not in their apprehension be approved—a day is appointed—the earlier in general the more favourable to the fraud—two connected objects being of course aimed at—the one respecting attendance—to get in those from whom they expect support—the other to keep out those from whom they expect opposition—in both cases in as great numbers as possible the other respecting preparation—in such sort that supporters may be as well prepared—adversaries such as cannot be prevented from attending as illprepared—as possible these objects are accordingly in each case pursued—pursued by such particular means as the particular nature of the case happens to afford and admits of by the fixation of a determinate and universally foreknown day both these inconveniences stand excluded but for such fixation the door to both lies open   exclusion of placemen from the faculty of voting in the house the mischief against which impermanence of the situation is calculated to operate as a security is contingent receipt of the matter of corruption he who to his seat in the house adds the possession of any other office with benefit in a pecuniary or any other shape annexed to it—every such man is actually harbouring in his bosom a correspondent portion of that pestilential matter and is actually under the dominion of its baneful influence in the plan may be seen the reasons by which the utility of the attendance of placemen in the house with faculty of speech and even of motion is brought to view and in the same place is shown the inapplicability of those reasons to the faculty of voting—and the sufficiency of this unnatural and baneful union to brand with the just imputation of imbecility whatsoever confidence can be placed in any assembly in which a so certainly efficient cause of habitual improbity breach of trust and misrule is harboured and suffered to operate true it is that to the case of the holders of places and pensions at pleasure—to them and them alone does the demand for the exclusion in question present itself in its utmost force but to the case of the holders of places during good behaviour as the phrase is—a tenure to the purpose in question not substantially different from tenure for life—the demand though not in equal presents itself as having place in sufficient force a place or pension of this description may be and it should seem ought to be considered as a sort of retaining fee gratitude—private gratitude—as towards the patron—this     motive though in comparison of selfregarding interest a social and laudable motive yet in comparison especially when acting in opposition to patriotism—a motive equally social and operating upon the more enlarged and important scale—it operates in the character of an instrument of corruption—gratitude viz even when it is genuine and stands alone but to whom is it unknown that in whatever breast fear or ambitious hope looking to the future has place—gratitude looking or pretending to look solely to the past—gratitude wherever the past presents a pretence is a cloak—a cloak put on by the selfregarding motive—a cloak presented by decency and prudence   universal constancy of attendance be the place what it will in which if at all the function be it what it may must be performed—that function cannot be performed by a man who is not there a maxim to this effect seems not to be very open to dispute beneficial effects of such universal constancy—mischiefs resulting from the want of it—these together with the means of effectually securing such attendance may be seen in the plan itself the additional character in which on the present occasion it seems necessary to bring it more particularly to view is—that of an additional security against undue dependence in the only case in which it can be productive of practical mischief viz the case in which a majority and that a permanent one have been brought under the dominion of the corruptive influence by absentation every man who in the case of a pernicious measure is in his real judgment against it but who by the sinister influence of c—rgeneral and co is prevented from acting in consequence at the same time that were it not for such influence he would attend and vote in favour of it—by mere absentation does every such man do exactly one half of the utmost quantity of the mischief that he could do by attending and voting in favour of the pernicious measure and so vice versa in the case of a beneficent measure on the other hand—by supposition the man being one who on the occasion of the vote he gives is in the main induced to be determined by consideration of public good—then so it is that if the mischievousness of it be to a certain degree palpable if he were in attendance shame would suffice to prevent him from giving his vote on the sinister side but to the case of mere absentation the cause of it not being known shame cannot attach itself here then in so far as attendance and nonattendance are left optional the half of every mans effective influence in the assembly is left in the condition of a saleable commodity capable of being sold to c—rgeneral and co without earthly restraint of any kind—not only without fear of punishment under the name of punishment—but without fear of reproach or shame and thus it appears that after everything which for the securing of probity—appropriate probity—in the breasts of the individual members each in his separate capacity against the assaults of corruptive influence can be done has been done—universal constancy of attendance remains in the character of a supplement necessary to the securing on the part of the aggregate body the same indispensable element of official aptitude now then if of an assembly constituted by a system of deputation in which suffrage was at once virtually universal practically equal and completely free—and that assembly composed of persons each of whom was removable at the earliest in a week or two—at the latest in less than a year—so it were that by the means of corruptive influence always remaining in the hands of c—rgeneral and co even under a system of constantly universal attendance a permanent majority could be bought—then on this supposition the due and requisite dependence viz dependence on constituents could not have place but that any such open corruption should readily have place seems morally impossible even under the present system spite of all its corruption here and there a case has been seen in which the corrupt will of c—rgeneral and co has experienced effectual resistance yes even under the present system how then could it ever be otherwise under a pure one that even in so much as a single instance or so much as any one occasion any such general corruption should in such a state of things have place seems altogether out of the sphere of human probability but to produce any permanent and unremedied bad effect it would require that such corrupt majority should be a permanent one—for suppose it ever to cease the majority of a single day would suffice to unravel the web of corruption and devote the corruptionists if not to punishment under the forms of law at any rate to universal indignation and abhorrence with a certainty of never more being reappointed to the trust which by the supposition they had thus abused thus far as to the points of most prominent importance remain for consideration the arrangements necessary to the simplification of the mode of election and thence to the exclusion of mischief in so many various shapes such as delay vexation expense drunkenness and tumult at elections—and litigation in consequence of and even antecedently and with a view to election—mischiefs that have place and to a certain degree are even fostered under the existing mode but in regard     to these reference to the plan itself may here suffice section vi differences between this and the original editions of radical reform so much for absolute views now for a comparative one in the above explained list of principal arrangements—taking ten for the number—i find in the original editions of radical reform these following viz— i applying to the situation of elector these three viz—  comprehension of all interests   virtual universality of suffrage   practical equality of suffrage—these three—unless the first and second should be regarded as the same object under two different names but in these same original plans neither secresy of suffrage nor therefore as it seems to me freedom of suffrage are included ii applying to the situation of representative these three viz—  operating in the character of an instrumental security impermanence of the situation viz by means of annuality and—in so far as this suffices—the two principal securities viz due dependence and to the extent of its operation due independence   due dependence as towards electors   due independence as towards c—rgeneral and co but referable to this last head in this same original plan two other securities which i do not find—but which in the character of instrumental securities with reference to those principal ones have presented themselves to my view as indispensable—are—  exclusion of placemen from the right of voting   universal constancy of attendance here then are four additional securities two of them applying to the one situation two of them to the other—four additional securities in respect of which i hold myself more particularly responsible taking the other edition—or in case of difference those other editions—of radical reform for the original edition or editions—the edition composed of these same securities with the addition of the four others which in the character of instrumental and indeed indispensable securities i have thus ventured to propose may be distinguished by the name of my edition of radical parliamentary reform by anybody that pleases arrangements for the simplification of the process of election—and thereby for the diminution of delay vexation expense drunkenness and disturbance—are to be found not only in the radical reform system but moreover in principle at least in some of the moderate reform plans in so far as they are in this case they belong not to the present head of the radical reform plan—so far as concerns annuality of election—the unknown member of the house of commons at whose instance the rest of the house joined in that petition—such in those days was the form—to which edward the third twice in the shape of a law gave his sanction—may be considered as the original inventor in the late reign viz as above mentioned in      it found in thomas carew a parliamentary reviver and in him and sir john phillipps not to mention others two most powerful advocates on which occasion as hath been seen it did not want much of being carried within the compass of the present reign has this same arrangement found in the lords an advocate in the person of the late duke of richmond and since his death viz anno   0  in the commons† in the person of sir francis burdett but of the degree of extension insisted upon by the duke of richmond no inconsiderable part appears to have been given up by sir francis burdett finding that limitation already proposed and from a quarter so respectable finding it already proposed and regarding it as promising—at any rate in a degree sufficient for a first proposal—to be effectually conducive to the purpose—finding it already thus proposed—and preferring on every occasion in which a regard for the end in view will admit of such preference union to dissension—hence it was that in the annexed plan drawn up anno   0 —and word for word as it stands at present—i adopted this same limitation with the arrangement in that same state i should after the closer consideration recently bestowed upon the subject be to a considerable degree satisfied at the same time after maturer consideration on the one hand not seeing in it any source of danger even though it were in a state of extension still more ample than that in which it was prescribed by the duke of richmond—on the other hand beholding in a limitation which i have ventured to propose a specific one—and that in my eyes a very important one which will be brought to view under the appropriate head—hence it is that to give a general intimation of the difference the name which in this my edition is given to universal suffrage is virtually universal suffrage     section vii virtual universality of suffrage further considered now as to universal suffrage subject to defalcation each for special reason—in all eyes but those to which tyranny is the only endurable form of government—what principle can be more impregnable   who is there that is not susceptible of discomfort and comfort—of pain and pleasure   of what is human happiness felicity wellbeing welfare—call it what you please—composed but comfort and absence of discomfort—pleasure and exemption from pain   the happiness and unhappiness of any one member of the community—high or low rich or poor—what greater or less part is it of the universal happiness and unhappiness than that of any other   who is there by whom unhappiness is not avoided—happiness pursued   who is there by whom unhappiness ought not to be avoided—happiness ought not to be pursued   who is there that in avoidance of unhappiness and pursuit of happiness has not a course of conduct to maintain—which in some way or other he does maintain—throughout life   who is there whose conduct does not in its course take on each occasion its direction from a judgment of the one kind or the other—from a selfformed or a derivative one   who is there whose conduct is never on any occasion directed by any other than a selfformed judgment who is there that in relation to the most momentous of the private concerns of his life does not frequently find himself under the obligation of taking for his guidance a judgment of the derivative kind—a judgment of no firmer texture   how many are there in whose instance the part taken by a man in relation to his own private affairs considered all together is not of greater importance to himself not to speak of the whole community than any part could be which in relation to the whole number of public affairs taken together could even under a system of universal suffrage ever come under his cognizance  0 in so far as between the interests of the subjectmany and those of the ruling few any such relation as that of incompatibility has place—suppose on the part of the ruling few the prevalent—or though it were the exclusive—possession of appropriate intellectual aptitude suited to the nature of the case—in what way or degree would the interest—would the welfare—of the subjectmany be benefited so long as in those ruling bosoms instead of appropriate probity the opposite improbity had place†   0 security—general security—against misrule—in this are we to behold the only use and advantage resulting to the community from the utmost amplitude of extent which     subject to the necessary defalcations can be given to the right of suffrage answer the main use and advantage yes but assuredly not the only one another is—for is it not—the extent given to the pleasure—the pleasure of power—derivable from the exercise of it by the first english monarch of the stuart race the pleasure of scratching where it itches was pronounced too great a pleasure for a subject on the same principle in the eyes of many an aristocrat of the present day so will the pleasure attached to the exercise of a power so furiously and indignantly grasped by the monopolizing hand yes in the eyes of the aristocrat but so will it be in the eyes of a lover of his country or of a lover of mankind so much for the comfort of the elector come now the social virtues—probity—benevolence—beneficence—considered as not being wholly without hope of finding place one day in the breast of the representative in this breast virtue thence in both breasts comfort for its fruit a third use and advantage attendant on the maximization of the extent given to this right will it not accordingly be to be found     in the proportionable extent which will so naturally be given to the demand and thence to the supply of those precious virtues—considered as exercisable by men of high on the occasion of their intercourse with men of low degree see on this head the plan itself the art and habit of affording in the shape suited to each occasion in the general intercourse of life pleasure—in which is necessarily included the negative art and habit of avoiding to produce displeasure—courtesy in a word—the word as well as the thing derived from court—in common account the diffusion of virtue in this shape has it not been regarded as a use and advantage attached to monarchy yes—nor surely without reason but when for its headquarters it has the palace in what way does it propagate itself to the level of the lowest ranks it descends not but as it were by accident by slow degrees and through an indefinite number and variety of channels but in the case here in question reaching the lowest level at one step it fills the whole atmosphere of society with its balmy influence   third collateral use—security afforded against vice in all its shapes and for virtue in all its shapes   by the same tie by which in this case the candidate is restrained from giving the reins to misconduct in the particular shape above mentioned viz insolence towards individuals in the particular situation in question—by this same tie with more or less good effect is he restrained from misconduct in all other shapes in general—public as well as private by the same spur by which he is urged to the making of the comparatively small sacrifices necessary to the attainment of the reputation of urbanity within the limited circle in question by this same spur is he continually urged to the making of those greater sacrifices—those continually recurring and perseveringly reiterated sacrifices by which throughout the whole field of a mans influence in public as in private life preeminence in virtue is attained—sacrifices of smaller present to greater future interest sacrifices of selfregarding to social interest sacrifices of social interest on a less extensive to social interest on a more extensive scale iii now as to defalcations—so far as concerns extension the main object being comprehension of all interests—suppose the defalcation in question capable of having place without prejudice to that object slight may be the advantage that will suffice to warrant it first comes the principle by which saving always the rightful supremacy of the universalinterestcomprehension principle intimation is given of the propriety of defalcation considered as applied to the extent capable of being given to the right of suffrage call this for shortness the legitimatedefalcation principle next come an exception or exceptions that may be found to present themselves as proper to be made to the application of this principle this principle is—that if in the instance of any class of persons it be sufficiently clear that they neither are nor can be in such a state of mind as to be in a sufficient degree endowed with the appropriate intellectual aptitude—then so it is that in the instance of such particular class of persons a defalcation may be made made viz without prejudice to anything that is useful in the interestcomprehension principle the consideration by which the principle is itself suggested and the application of it directed is the regard due to the quality of appropriate intellectual aptitude in the case of this or that class of persons suppose it clear that no such aptitude can in any degree sufficient for practice be reasonably expected to be found—what follows is—that from the extent given to the right in question a defalcation may be made correspondent to the extent occupied in the field of population by this class and thus without prejudice to the extent given to the universalinterestcomprehension principle take now a few examples— i minors by the word minors is immediately brought to view one vast class of persons to which without prejudice to the interestcomprehension principle the legitimatedefalcation principle promises to be found applicable on this occasion for forming a limit to the extent to be given to this class what is evident is—that with full assurance an age may be taken such as that from the extent belonging to the dominion of the universalinterestcomprehension principle no defalcation shall be made by the application of the legitimatedefalcation principle and even let the age fixed upon for this purpose be supposed to be too early an age still one great advantage remains untouched—which is—that in its application to individuals the defalcation is not permanent not permanent but temporary only and the utmost duration of it limited as to the age most proper to be fixed upon for this purpose—in this may be seen a topic neither unsusceptible nor undeserving of a separate consideration but for anything like a full consideration of it neither time nor space can be allowed here under british law in relation to private concerns at large viz in respect of the sole and separate management of those concerns taken in the aggregate oneandtwenty is the age at which     the right commences but at a much earlier age does this and that particular right commence such as the right of making a last will and what is more to the purpose the right of choosing a guardian and note that though the concerns here in question are in respect of extent the public and universal concerns and the importance of them proportioned to that extent yet on the other hand—instead of being as in the present case integral—the right here in question is but a minute fraction of the integral or entire right of choosing the fraction of a guardian for the management of those great common concerns for what remains see the next head ii females as to persons of this sex the sex in which the half more or less of the whole species is contained—usually if not constantly have they on this occasion been passed over without notice an omission which under a mahometan government might have place with rather less prejudice to consistency than under a christian one the great leading considerations above brought to view—viz the universalinterestcomprehension principle the quality of appropriate probity and appropriate intellectual aptitude—these guides to decision if they apply not with propriety to both sexes it seems not easy to say with what propriety they can be applicable to either as to the interestcomprehension principle—a task which to the purpose of making application of it on competent grounds presents itself as indispensable is—the taking a survey of the state of the laws by which at present the share between the two sexes is determined thereupon a sort of preliminary question presents itself as likely enough to be put—suppose—for arguments sake suppose—the result to be that on this part of the field of law due justice has not hitherto been done to the weaker sex on this supposition can any such expectation exist as that in the formation of a plan in relation to suffrage any better justice will be done the answer is—that barring the intervention of this or that special obstacle there seems no sufficient reason why any such justice should be despaired of for upon a spurt upon the spur of the occasion even against the general bent of permanent interest—are now and then seen to be made such sacrifices as under the permanent and habitual and tranquil operation of particular interest are never seen to be made as to appropriate intellectual aptitude—in the case of monarchy—in the case of integral possession of supreme and allcomprehensive power—by no man perhaps unless it be by john knox has physical weakness been brought forward in the character of an objection to the practice of vesting political power in the softer sex by no man even in the case of the electoral function where as in the instance of the east india direction the active or selfacting including the imperative power is in the hands of an aristocracy an aristocracy itself in england subject to the mixed monarchy but exercising the electoral function in relation to the sort of local monarchy by which under the guise of a council under the presidence of a governor in british india so many millions are ruled although in all these several instances the propriety of the arrangement were confessedly established—yet in the case of the democratic species of election in question the propriety of it could not be stated as presenting itself in any such character as that of a necessary consequence as to anything approaching to a decided opinion—anything of that sort—any attempt towards it—would in this place be altogether premature of the few observations here hazarded what then it may be asked is the use the use i answer—the design at least is—to show in what way and with a degree of attention suited to its importance the subject is capable of being treated in respect to principle of two modes of treatment which may be the more proper one—on the one hand the mode here exemplified or on the other this or a horselaugh a sneer an expression of scorn or a commonplace witticism the reader will determine†     iii soldiers and sailors if of these classes mention must here be made scarcely can it be for any other purpose than to show that they have not been out of mind from participating in the exercise of this franchise all those who are out on foreign service stand excluded by physical by absolutely insurmountable obstacles this being constantly and unavoidably the case with many and incidentally with all—those in whose instance the bar is not applied by physical obstacles need the less repine should the necessity arise of excluding them by legal ones individually considered no tenable objection could surely be opposed to the suffrage of any individual of this so extensive and eminently meritorious a class of public servants but collected in a mass under the command of c—rgeneral and co they might in any part of the country or in many parts of the country at once be set arolling like an avalanche overwhelming as they rolled the settled population of who can say how many electoral districts here is a mischief but a mischief to which by a few regulations no less obvious than the mischief there could be no difficulty in opposing an effectual bar to the above perfectly obvious grounds of defalcation add for consideration this one more which will perhaps be found not quite so obvious iv nonreaders for shortness let this be the name of the class also for shortness take the following compressed intimation of the ground of the thus proposed defalcation with the political and moral institution attached to it and of the mode proposed for fixing the termination of it principle not at variance with the universalinterestcomprehension principle duration of the exclusion—not only temporary but to an indefinite degree capable of being shortened by the exertions of the individual excluded—proof of the cessation of the cause of exclusion public matter taken for the subject of the proof—in the first place the law by which the elections in question shall in the here supposed state of things have been regulated to which might be added regard being had to matter and applicable space this or that portion of other appropriate matter—but for any such details the present is no place for the collateral effects moral and intellectual—of such an institution inquire of the national society—inquire of anybody—those excepted whose wish—for alas some such are there not whose undissembled wish has been to keep us of the swinish multitude—to keep us for ever in our state of swine defeasible as it is at all times at the pleasure of the excluded party—if by this exclusion the exercise of the right may in the instance of some person of full age be suspended—in the instance of minors might not on proof given as above of possession obtained of appropriate intellectual aptitude—might not the acquisition of it be accelerated so much for defalcation considered as applicable to the extent to be given to this franchise behold now a principle of exception operating as a bar to a little swarm of other defalcations—such as but for this consideration would on grounds more or less cogent be apt to present a call—some of them a peremptory call—for acceptance this principle is the simplification principle on the ground of deficiency in one or other or both of the elements of the appropriate aptitude in question—viz appropriate probity and appropriate intellectual aptitude—various are the classes that might be proposed for exclusion foreigners in amity foreigners in enmity but at large outlaws convicts vagrants insolvents bankrupts lunatics—these may serve as examples o rare simplicity handmaid of beauty wisdom virtue—of everything that is excellent—simplicity—applied to every subject to which without preponderant inconvenience it can be applied—simplicity though but a sort of negative good is not the less a good to the exclusion of sensible which are the only real evils may it without scruple be applied where the only evils that can result from the application are but as it were nascent and insensible evils for example which—though if they existed in a certain quantity they might or even would be felt—yet in the greatest quantity in question cannot be felt—evils in a word which—though but for the operation of counter causes they would or might be productive of actual sensible sufferance or loss of comfort—yet by the operation of such counter causes will be prevented from carrying that capacity into act     so much for principle now for application even at the place of election much more in a judicatory of appeal constituted for the purpose—among the accompaniments of every such investigation are the intimately connected mischiefs with which all judicature is so liable to be infested viz delay vexation and expense in all these may be seen real and sensible—acutely sensible evils but in the case of a right which how important soever when taken in its integrality is to all really effective purposes such as the establishment of laws and the execution of measures of administration itself but the fraction of a fraction—suppose that by the exceptionable classes all of them taken together—that is by the admission given to them be they ever so exceptionable no sensible change for the worse can ever in all human probability be made in the conduct of public affairs—the consequence is that the supposed inconvenience is ideal and theoretical merely not actual and practical the simplification principle thus explained—apply it to the question as between the extent indicated by the word householders and the extent here marked out as designated by the words virtuallyuniversal suffrage in the plan itself on the occasion of which the attention was confined to householders an expedient may be seen proposed having for its object the maximization of simplicity—the minimization of the triple yoke of inconvenience—the trinoda necessitas—composed of delay vexation and expense which by nature in a certain proportion by sinister art commonly in a much greater proportion has been made to press upon the neck of so many sorts of public but most intolerably of all upon the neck of almost all judicial proceedings look at what is said in mr cobbetts letter on this subject to earl grosvenor cobbetts register february         and in respect of simplicity and its consequences as above explained judge whether compared with the householder plan even with the benefit of the aboveproposed instrument of simplification the virtuallyuniversal plan has not the advantage in this same view note a principle of precaution having regard to relative time the evidence on the ground of which a claimants title to the franchise is provisionally to be allowed—let it be—not of the oral but as proposed in the plan of the written kind—a document suppose a card—suppose a ticket—penned and authenticated and allowed at a time anterior to that of the election by this means all discussion is excluded from that time in the instance of each voter the operation of voting may as in the case of holding up of hands be instantaneous forgery and fraudulent personation are the only causes of deceit left possible and forasmuch as by small numbers no promise of effect would be afforded while among large numbers the larger the number the fuller the assurance of detection—no probability can this possibility have for its accompaniment section viii virtual universality of suffrage—its undangerousness on the topic of supposed or imputed dangerousness after what has been seen already accept the following observations compressed to that degree of compression which time and place necessitate objection—universal suffrage universal hostility and anarchy—answer no not the smallest approach to any such evils hostility—under what provocation and against what object provocation now alas but too abundant in that case absolutely none provocation say you—say instead of it its exact opposite yes in place of provocation and that inveterate—fresh and never before experienced beneficence provocation—where should it find its object in a branch of government now for the first time at the instance of the people themselves repaired and improved for their benefit and then placed in their own hands suppose mischievous activity on what occasion or in what shape should it exert itself the sort of power which they would be called upon to exercise what is it is it—as in legislation and command as well civil as military—directly immediately imperatively impressively and coercively acting power—no but a mere exercise of the unimperative faculty of deputation—an exercise performed under the veil of the most tranquil and silent and absolutely impenetrable and imperturbable secresy—performed by a mere turn of the hand—and in the instance of each individual in the same moment begun and ended—a power which if such it must be called is but the fraction of a fraction the power of making one of a vast multitude the majority of which must join ere they can seat so much as one man in an assembly—one man with whom another large majority must join and with that large majority the majority of another assembly ere he can give effect to any power by which command is issued and obedience produced be the mischief what it may—suppose the people in any considerable number inclined to effect it in their eyes or in any eyes what sort of prospect of accomplishing the supposed obnoxious purpose could the nature of the case afford how deep as well as at the same time how hollow must not the scheme of speculation be supposed to be     that is thus supposed to be entertained by the supposed precipitate and unthinking multitude of himself not one of them could so much as in expectation have any the least part in it if accomplished the persons by whom it is accomplished must be the majority of a set of persons all different from these voters yet this majority composed of individuals all of them without exception bent upon the execution of this same pernicious scheme—and what could they hope to get by it when by the passions of a populace mischief has been perpetrated or aimed at is it by any such telescopic and deeplaid schemes that it has ever been aimed at no it is not in the dangerousness and mischievousness—it is in the undangerousness and beneficialness of this and the other elements of reform that in the minds of the ruling and influential few the opposition made to it has its real ground not in the want of light—pure and instructive light—in the political hemisphere—not in the want of it but in the abundance of it look for the true object of their fears the increase of light—were that any part of their object how to compass that object is no secret to them confined to the quarter in which when it is of use to them—applied to the accomplishment of the grand object—the openly avowed object—the prostration of understanding and will at the feet of a priesthood itself by original institution prostrate—and so lately so much more profoundly prostrated—at the feet of a prelacy itself in a state of everlasting prostration at the foot of the throne—applied to this object never can there be any want of anxiously directed activity in regard to appropriate intellectual aptitude what is the real the everlasting fear—lest it be deficient no but lest it be abundant yes on the hemisphere of religion to delude them with false and political lights—on the political hemisphere to keep them plunged in the thickest darkness such in their high situation is the policy of great characters such in the very nature of things it is ever destined to be when vouchsafing to determine the lot of the swinish multitude of this supposed dangerous and mischievous right by what mode and form of instruction would the exercise be prefaced and prepared on the one part would it be as now by haranguing—by haranguing—loud and till the present state of things be replaced by a better how can it be other than impassioned—on the other part by thronging by thronging if not actually tumultuous continually by the naturally and incessantly increasing tyranny expected or pretended to be expected to be found—and for the sake of the thus manufactured pretext always wished to be found—tumultuous oh no on the one part by a course of writing on the other part by a corresponding course of reading oh yes—the pen in hand—behold in this the true organ for administering sound dispassionate and undelusive information—in the eye—in the stillness and leisure of the closet applied to the silent paper behold in this the true organ for the reception of the matchless blessing lips on the one part ears on the other part—behold in these the so imperfectly adapted—the only originally employable organs in the fugitive the ever questionable the ever delusive information—the only information capable of being communicated and received by such organs—the sole and sadly imperfect resource of immature unlettered and unenlightened times† as to speechifying and writing—and the comparative beneficialness and innoxiousness of the sort of information to be respectively looked for to the two sources by speeches many an assembly has been driven into precipitate and mischievous resolves by writings much fewer not to say none by speeches followed on the spot by resolutions taken on the spot falsehoods are asserted—means of detection excluded in writings scarce can falsehood be brought forward on one side but time for detecting and refuting it has place on the other—by speeches imagination is fascinated—passion in excess excited—time for comprehensive conception and cool judgment denied—substitute writing no advantage can in any of these shapes be gained by any side to the injury of any other when tongues and ears are the organs of converse—in an assembly congregated under the notion of hearing speeches—by its own clamours and with what unhappy frequency is not this mischief exemplified by its own clamours—that is by the clamours of a few impatient tongues—on both sides of the question—or what is so much worse on one side only—may not only all documents but all argument be excluded whereas in so far as pens and eyes are the organs—by no power but that of a tyrant—of a tyrant about the throne or on a bench—can any minds be deprived of the knowledge of whatsoever has been said or can be said on both sides thus not only in the first instance but so     long as the subject continued to be viewed no otherwise than at a distance—that in this state of mind by the vastness and indeterminateness of the compound idea produced by the combination of annuality of election with universality of suffrage—conception should be at first bewildered and the passion of fear kept in a state of excitation—in this there is nothing strange the strange thing would rather be if the case were otherwise note here a little operation—an operation which may be performed by anybody who has leisure turn to the history of boroughs pick out the most open ones those in which the right has the extension indicated by the word householders or by the word potwallers—go back as far as recollection—recollection about individual character—can carry you—say to the commencement of the present reign under the head of each such borough look over the     list of the representatives who from that time to this have sat for it—this done then it is that you may be in a condition to pronounce—whether when compared with the seats filled in the most generally approved and lauded mode viz the county seats of which in the next section any distinctlymarked deficiency in respect of any one of the three elements of appropriate aptitude be to be found appropriate aptitude as divided into its nevertobeforgotten three branches viz appropriate probity appropriate intellectual aptitude and appropriate active talent aptitude elements cries a voice from bond street d—you and your three elements no no property property thats our sort thats the only element we know of—worth all yours and a hundred such put together     oh no d—e cries another from a fourinhand interrupting himself while in the establishment of a raw—oh no youve forgot one—and thats blood d—e look there pointing to the horses shoulder look there—there you have it d—e to be sure to sit comfortably a man should have both—no doubt of that but where one fails tother must serve instead of it after all bloods our surest card vingtun runs off with property now and then—blood it cant run off with that sticks by us come if you must have three elements heres an amendment for you—blood property connexion these are our three elements—blood and property in ourselves connexion in the good fellow we put in to think and speak for us there now you old fellow off with your three elements—off with them to utopia twas there you got em from d—e well good gentlemen look over the list i am speaking about—look it well over—look at the seats—look at the sittingparts they have been filled by—look at them well—and as little will you find any deficiency in the stock of your own legitimate elements—man and horse elements together—as of my swinish ones look to the most populous of all populous boroughs look to westminster number of electors even many years back not fewer than   000 swine not all of them indeed—the dean and chapter being of the number—not to speak of right honourables and honourables—swines flesh however predominant—abundantly predominant swinish the character of the vast majority of that vast multitude well then look to westminster—look first to time present—see now what you have there see you not lord cochrane what do you see there see you not blood and property in one—blood from ancestors—property from the source most prized—the source from whence all your oldest property sprung—enemies blood with plunder for the fruit of it—see you not sir francis burdett—have not you there blood enough and property enough look now a little back—before you had either cochrane or burdett had not you charles fox had you him not as long as the country had him even within this twelvemonth when a vacancy was apprehended what sort of man was it that was looked to for the filling of it was it a man of and from the people was it the cobbett with his penmanship his  0000 purchasers and his ten times  0000 readers was it the henry hunt with his oratory was it not cartwright of the cartwrights of northamptonshire—was it not brougham of brougham—and howsoever by these men the plea of ulysses might be put in—neve mihi noceat quod vobis semper achivi profuit ingenium not the less were there the genus et proavi†—and whether sitting for westminster or looked to for westminster the case of a man who had neither the blood element nor the property element remains still without example look at bristol the next most populous city when a man was looked for who should if possible stem the tide of corruption—that tide which so naturally flows so strong in maritime and commercial cities—who is it that was looked for was it the spa fields orator—did he not try and fail there was it not sir samuel romilly—and though from an irregularity for which by some country gentleman or other whose aptitude was in his acres—a mr eyre or a mr frankland which was it—he was so consistently called to order the blood he had came from the wrong side of the channel and with a something in it too nearly allied to puritanism to be relished by legitimacy—yet not to speak of the swinish elements which are of no value but in utopia—blood such as it was there was in him—blood—yes and property too—though whether then as now savouring of the realty let others who know say—to sanction it look to the most populous among boroughs look to liverpool when the same pestilential tide was hoped to be stemmed at liverpool who is it that great commercial port and borough called in to stem it was it the cobbett—was it the spa fields orator here too was it not brougham of brougham propensity to look wide of the true mark—to look to and to accept in lieu of the only true and direct elements of appropriate aptitude those supposed circumstantially but deceptiously evidentiary ones—blood—property—add if you please connexion—this is not peculiar to english it is common to human nature yes to human nature and till that nature be transformed never will the propensity—be it useful be it mischievous—be rooted out of it look to ancient look to republican rome to protect them against the aristocracy the people obtained a representative—a single representative—a representative whose   0 style and title was tribune of the people in the breast of this one individual was contained their commons house well—this man—who to them was a host and their only host—from what men from what caste of men did they take him from among themselves not they indeed from whence then even from their oppressors—their very oppressors themselves—from the patricians such it has been observed by somebody was it not montesquieu such was their choice for hundreds of years together well—in thus advocating virtuallyuniversal suffrage—and as to absolutelyuniversal suffrage though preferably to the other i do not nor ever should advocate it—i should nevertheless as earl grey did once prefer it to the present system—in thus advocating virtually or though it were absolutely universal suffrage—what is given as above is it all mere theory—is it not practice to boot—practice or somewhat not very easily distinguishable from it—is it not experience oh but says somebody this which you call practice—this in support of which you are calling in experience—this is not any universalsuffrage plan—this is not even your own virtually universalsuffrage plan this is but the householder plan yes to be sure in name it is but the householder plan though where a pot constitutes a house how much narrower soever the ground of the right is the right itself must be admitted to be a little more extensive but be that as it may if so it be that what you insist on is that in the field of political arrangement nothing should ever be tried but what in the selfsame shape has been tried already then so it is that on this part of the question my pen is stopped but upon this principle here or anywhere—at this time or at any other time—well or ill—can or could government ever be carried on on your side for the future not to speak of the past—for the future will you take it up and steadily and to the last adhere to it vast as it is and poisonous as it is vast will you so much as pledge yourselves to be content with your existing stock of panaceas—with your universalpersonalsecuritydestroying acts—with your universal gagging acts—with your libertyofthepressdestroying statutes and judgemade expostfacto laws—with your universalpopularcommunicationdestroying acts—with your acts for stopping up the ears of soldiers and for engaging them in the character of informers to imbrue their hands in the blood of their brothers their sisters their fathers and their mothers—with your petitionrejecting and hopeextinguishing decisions and orders and resolutions—with your resolves for rejecting petitions unheard because in aid of the pen the press had been employed in giving the circulation to the matter of them—with your sham precedents brought forward for a colour to such liberticide resolves well if you shrink at this remains still a possibility of your forbearing to insist here upon individual identity—of your listening to identity in principle and specie but if identity of principle will satisfy you how so long as you admit the householder plan how can you be at a loss for principle in support of virtuallyuniversal suffrage take in hand the fellowship of householders take in hand the fellowship of universalsuffrage men apply to each of the two fellowships the two tests of appropriate aptitude—the tests of appropriate aptitude in those two of its three branches which apply to the case in question—the case of electors apply to them the appropriateprobity test say have you a sufficiency of it in your householders well then on what grounds can you look for any want of such sufficiency in my universalsuffrage men—of universalsuffrage men although instead of being as here proposed virtual the universality were absolute your householders—is it their interest to possess to retain and upon occasion acquire property—to acquire it which to do would not unless they could retain it be of any great use to them well then—among my universalsuffrage men how many will you find who would fail in any respect of being partakers in that same interest apply to them next the appropriate intellectual aptitude test your householders—the interest which they possess in regard to property—the interest they have in possessing acquiring and retaining of it—that source that sole and indispensable source of subsistence and continuation of existence—are they in a sufficient degree sensible of its existence then in what less degree think you would my universalsuffrage men be sensible to a matter of fact to which infants in arms and persons insane excepted no human being sensible to anything ever failed of being sensible in your eyes and with reference to your habits and your means the all of the sort of men to which the great majority of them belong is as nothing think you that therefore in their eyes it is no more the all of a how much less is it in the eye of a than the all of b in the eye of b when you have solved this problem—then and not before say that universal confusion and universal destruction of property would be the results of universal suffrage for its success true it is that this reasoning supposes with reference to the formation of a judgment on the subject of it the existence of a competent qualification in the shape of appropriate intellectual aptitude unfortunately just at this moment—such of you as are honest—you have no such aptitude     spectres have stalked in and planted terror and confusion in your minds cobbett in the character of apollyon the destroyer—cobbett with a universallevelling machine in his hand—cobbett with the spafields orator at his heels—these are your bugbears from the contemplation of these hobgoblins comes the spirit of wisdom with which you are inspired well then take them up—to give your theory its finish take them up and plant them in the house of commons chosen by the swinish multitude behold them seated on the treasury bench—in that situation in which anything may be done there is nothing they would not be ready to do so long as in any shape they saw anything they could get by it yes of course they would yes but according to this theory of yours they are to level all property and of course by levelling it destroy it now by so doing what is it they could get either of them some property they have each of them that one of them that has least some number of times the amount of the utmost that could be expected to be put into his pocket by the operation of the universallevelling machine oh but these men even these are not the worst the worst to be sure they are that we as yet know of but what you perhaps dont see and we do see is—the mob which is still behind them this mob which would begin with pushing them on do you think it would end there oh no no sooner were they seated than after them it would be continually pouring in others that would be worse and worse for with the exception of us and ours this is the way with all men their object—their constant object is—to do in every imaginable shape as much mischief as they can continually contrive to do—such is their end and for their means and their instruments how can they do otherwise than take up and employ and be perpetually upon the lookout for the most mischievous agents that are to be found such being their constant study and endeavour—the constant study and endeavour of this mob of yours—this mob that you and all that think with you want to set upon us and destroy us—what will be the consequence the men they will be finding out and pouring into the house will be—each of them worse than every other—men the least mischievous of whom will be mischievous enough to outhunt hunt and to outcobbett cobbett the universalsuffrage plan being considered in the character of a cause—for the effect on the monarchicoaristocratical theory behold in the above scheme of universal mischief and its consequence universal destruction given—given not merely as a probable effect but as one that in a practical sense ought to be regarded as certain and for the accomplishment—not to speak of the commencement—of this same scheme what are the sort of beings that are to have existence human beings oh no so far from it a set of creatures such as no man ever saw a set of beings in respect of the features essentially requisite for so much as the commencement of any such scheme as opposite to all known human beings as can be conceived without one of the motives that are known of and against the bent of all the motives that are known of—such is to be their course of action of no such motive as social interest are they to have any the smallest spark as little are they to have of that sort of motive selfregarding interest on which the human species is in a more especial and necessary manner dependent for its existence on this career of theirs are they to set out bent upon destruction—upon destruction of all property—and with it or before it of all that derive support from it ending or beginning with themselves in the words wild and wildness seems to be condensed the substance of all the talk—to call it reason or argument would be misrepresentation—say then the talk—by which universal suffrage has been opposed wildness oh yes and but too much of it but in what place is it that it will be found—in the universalsuffrage plan with the practice and experience on which it is grounded or in the theory with which against all practice and experience it has been opposed true it is—but too true—as matters stand at present they have not all of them means so sufficient as could be wished to inform and qualify themselves they have not—so much as the majority of them—any such sufficient means to inform and qualify themselves they have not—the majority of them—means so sufficient as could be wished to inform themselves aright as to what good government is or what the value of it they have not—the majority of them—sufficient means of access to the documents on which the acquisition of this necessary knowledge depends they have not any such sufficient means in any regular way to read the newspapers they have not—many of them—nay even the majority of them—they have not as yet so much as the requisite skill in the elementary art of reading true but these their deficiences—whatsoever they may be—is it in these deficiencies that we are to look for the consideration—the sole the chiefly prevalent consideration or so much as any part of the consideration—by which your anxiety and your determination to exclude them from the right of suffrage is produced alas alas no—these deficiencies—there is not any one of them that it would not be little less difficult     to you actually to supply than to will or wish to do so there is not any one of them which they could not supply without any assistance of yours which they would not supply to themselves of themselves if left to themselves which they could not to themselves supply—if instead of aiding them in your wishes and endeavours were not employed in the preventing them from the receiving of such supplies of these same supplies there is not one of them that in the american states is not actually and abundantly received received yes and of the supply thus received what is the fruit what is it anarchy no but instead of it the best government that is or ever has been—that with which yours forms so strong not to say so complete a contrast look on this occasion—if by any means you can endure to look that way—look once more to the american united states behold there democracy—behold there pure representative democracy in the shape in question any more than in any other shape what mischief do you see there in the american united states is there no property has it ever been destroyed since the establishment of independence—has it ever been destroyed there as it was here in    0 by your antipopery mob and—not to speak of luddites and so many other nonreligious—in      by your church of england antisectarian mobs with orthodox and loyal justices of the peace see huttons life to encourage them in any one of these commonwealths has any so much as the slightest shock been ever given to it all this while since that auspicious day—these supposed destroyers of all property and all government—the great body of the people has there ever been anywhere that day in which they have not had full swing—has there ever been that day on which for the keeping of them quiet any one of your panaceas has been applied—applied or so much as thought of—yet has there at any time been that day in which the door of that immense country has not stood wide open to the scum of the earth as you would call it and amongst others to your own wild irish—to those wild irish who by your misrule and by the fear of your torturemongers have been driven into banishment oh but says somebody what they have in america is—not the universalsuffrage plan it is more like the householder plan only still less popular—it is actually the property plan true in individuality as above it is not the universalsuffrage plan but in principle look once more and say once more—where and in what if in anything consists the difference the property—the income there acquired from landed property—there even as here—consider even where largest how small it is compared with the least amount of what is necessary for and actually expended on the means of sustenance well but—will you then give us the householder plan—will you give us the american plan with either of those plans we for our parts—i for one—i for my part at least should be contented oh no for opposition indeed—for refusal—this or anything may serve but for agreement—for consent—thats quite a different affair—no in the way of concession nothing after all what need can there be for looking to any such distance intellectual aptitude sufficiency of appropriate intellectual aptitude—is that the question look at home once more look at home turn your eyes to westminster by the hand of virtue in that great metropolis of reform behold democracy—already for these ten years past—though with the mass of corruption as it were a millstone still overhanging and threatening yet still seated on her throne—westminster a field of contention on which till that auspicious moment monarchy and aristocracy—the everlastingly leagued yet everlastingly bickering adversaries of good government—had from the commencement of the dynasty been tearing one another and the country to pieces—impoverishing one another poisoning the morals of the people instead of this system of abuse behold freedom of election—perfect and unexampled freedom—yes freedom and with it sobriety temperance tranquillity security and this under what system of representation even under the householder plan—the same which mr grey proposed—which earl grey is so much afraid of—the householder plan—the almost equivalent of virtuallyuniversal suffrage no exaggeration here nothing but simple truth in proof take in the most compressed state possible the following facts—within a certain circle—were that a very small one—all of them notorious—all of them everywhere uncontrovertible†     the americans—they impose no tax upon the means of political information you impose an almost prohibitory one why impose so enormous an one is it for the sake of the     money in some degree of course yes for where money is to be had in what place and at what price is it not raked for it is raked for in the courts that should be courts of justice to the destruction of justice it is raked for in the stores of medicine to the destruction of health and life yes surely in some degree for the money but in a still greater degree for the sake of the darkness the same transparent cunning which in the teeth of all argument and without the shadow of a pretence has so recently yet repeatedly engaged you to deprive them of the use of the press for giving expression to their desires engages you in relation to all these affairs which while they are yours are at the same time so much their own to keep them in the state of the profoundest ignorance possible that in the existence of that ignorance you may have a plea for the perpetuation of it oh but the information they get it is all of it from cobbett—misinformation all of it—mischievous information—a great deal worse than none well be it so what of that the information you could give—yes and would give too if you gave any—that is good information is it not well then what is it that hinders you from giving it have you not money enough—enough at any rate for such a purpose know you not of writers enough who—all of them as touching righteousness and piety inferior to nobody but yourselves—would—though none of them any more than yourselves for the sake of the money have any objection to the taking of it have you not your champions with and without names and with names worse than none—names with which paper such as this ought not to be defiled the same hands which circulate your substitutes to the bible would they not serve yea and suffice to circulate whatsoever writings it might seem good to you to circulate for the purpose of serving as antidotes and by divine blessing as substitutes to all such others by the influence of which good government might in the fulness of time be substituted to misrule oh but to contend with jacobins and atheists—with jacobins who would substitute the habeas corpus act to the abolition of it—atheists who would substitute the bible to creeds and catechisms—to think of contending with such wretches on anything like equal terms—to think of arguing with miscreants for whom annihilation would be too mild a destiny aye—theres the rub ever under a monarchy—whether pure and absolute or mixed and corrupt—ever under a monarchy—everywhere but in that seat of licentiousness a representative democracy—does excess in force employ itself in the filling up of all deficiencies in the articles of reason and argument and the more palpable the deficiency the more excessive the more grinding the more prostrative the more irresistible the force so much for us of the swinish multitude so much for us and our ignorance but you—honourables and right honourables—how is it with you you tolerate publication of debates but is it for the sake of general information and the diffusion of it oh no it is for individual vanity and the gratification of it he who is at the head of you—the ablest head you ever had—after he had fired off his speech against corruption—his furious speech with the doubleheaded shot in it from top to bottom—his speech in which all that is least mischievous in corrupt influence is fired upon with red hot shot while all that is most mischievous in it is spared—did he not send it himself to cobbett—to the cobbett whom you would all crush what they are in want of is not so much the time as the liberty to inform themselves what you are in want of—you who have time as much as you choose to have—you     who so many of you have time so much more of it than you know what to do with—what you want what you want is inclination—the inclination to inform yourselves thus deficiency—the evil of it be it what it may is a removable one from you it came by you it is kept up at your pleasure it lies to remove it leave them but the liberty by their knowledge will your ignorance be put to shame your deficiency—the evil of your deficiency—is that evil a removable one yes establish reform and that a radical one you will then—and i will presently show you how—have removed it but upon any other terms it is absolutely without remedy it is fixed to your freehold it sticks to property to your only element of aptitude the only element you either possess or acknowledge from property—from that plethory of the good things of this world in all their shapes under which the man who is gorged with property is condemned to suffer—from that surfeit comes love of ease love of ease—that appetite which existing in excess—in that degree of excess in which in your situation it does so generally and so necessarily exist—is indolence but be the field of action what it may indolence and information are exclusive of each other labour of the body—labour of the mind—in his spare time will the man who being used to labour loves labour—in his spare time—be it ever so small—will he do more than will the man who being unused to labour hates labour do in his whole time opulence indolence intellectual weakness cowardice tyranny oh yes these five are naturally in one from opulence proceeds indolence—from indolence intellectual weakness—from intellectual weakness cowardice—from cowardice tyranny a phantom of danger presents itself could he but fix his attention upon it and look steadily at it the phantom would vanish but being unexercised his mind is weak he has no such command over it the phantom haunts him it continues terrifying him it plants an ague in his mind—in his delirium he catches at every straw that presents to his eyes the image of a chance for stopping his fall into the gulf which he sees yawning for him his bowels if amidst his entrails he ever had any wither to his sick mind no feelings but his own present any tokens of existence—no barbarity—no wickedness—so it but afford the glimmering of an addition to the stock of accumulated securities with which he has overlaid himself comes amiss to him frantic at the thoughts of the danger to himself with or without thinking of any exterior objects he gives his fiat to the cluster of tyrannies by which the security of the whole people—his own along with it—is destroyed trembling with terror and terrorsprung rage he lends his hand to the opening of the pandoras box and pours forth the contents of it upon the heads of the whole people and thus it is and by this course—and even without the aid of sinister interest in any other shape—thus it is that by the very fear—the groundless fear—of its destruction security may be destroyed may be yes and by that and sinister interest in all its shapes together if it be not already is while this pen is moving on the very point of being destroyed yes—you pillage them you oppress them you leave them nothing that you can help leaving them you grant them nothing not even the semblance of sympathy you scorn them you insult them for the transgression of scores or dozens or units you punish them by millions you trample on them you defame them you libel them having by all you can do or say wound up to its highest pitch of tension the springs of provocation and irritation you make out of that imputed and where in any degree real always exaggerated irritation a ground and the only ground you can make for the assumption that supposing them treated with kindness—all their grievances redressed—relief substituted to oppression they would find in the very relief so experienced an incitement—an incitement to insurrection to outrage to anarchy to the destruction of the supposed new and neveryetexperienced blessing together with every other which they ever possessed or fancied levelling—destruction of all property whence is it they are to learn it—what is there they can get by it—who is there that ever taught it them—whose interest is it—whose ever can it be—to teach it them how many of them are there who would each of them be so eager to lose his all the all of a peasant—to the proprietor how much less is it than the all of a prince—the all of him whose means of livelihood are in his labour than the all of him whose means of livelihood are in his land who again is it that in your notion at least they are at this moment so abundantly looking to for instruction is it not cobbett with all his eccentricities his variations and his inconsistencies did he ever attempt to teach them any such lesson as that of equal division of property—in other words annihilation of it in the whole mass of the now existing and suffering multitude think ye that one in a score or in a hundred not to say a thousand could be found so stupid so foolish as either of himself or from others to fancy that if without other means of living he had his equal share in the whole of the land today he would not twenty to one be starved upon it before the month were out oh if the     men in whom—truly or erroneously—they behold their friends were not better instructors as well as better friends to them than you are or than it is in your nature to be long ere this would the imputation you are thus so eager to cast on them have been as substantially grounded as it now is frivolous no no—it is not anarchy ye are afraid of what ye are afraid of is good government more and more uncontrovertibly shall this fear be proved upon you—proved upon you from the sequel of these pages even to the very end section ix freedom of suffrage further explained—seductive influence—its forms instruments c subtopics proposed to be brought to view under this head opposite of freedom of suffrage spuriousness—efficient cause by which—motives by which—influential persons by whom—modes in which—situations in and by which—instruments by or with which—it is produced—in respect of mischievousness differences as between instrument and instrument—seattraffic as between proprietor and purchaser how far mischievous—penal laws for prevention of spuriousness how far useful for the more effectual explanation of these several particulars—distinctions and points of agreement not all of them it is believed as yet sufficiently noticed—and for giving expression to these distinctions here and there a word or phrase not as yet in general use—must unavoidably be brought to view i efficient cause—as in the case of election at large so in the case of parliamentary election in particular—the efficient cause by the operation of which freedom of suffrage is or may be excluded—spuriousness to that same extent substituted—may with reference to the person operated upon be termed seductive influence—it being understood that the sort of influence here in question is—according to a distinction already noted the influence—not of understanding on understanding but of will on will ii motives—as to the sort of motive through which seductive influence operates it may be either of the nature of hope or of the nature of fear—in the first case it may be termed pleasurablyoperating or in one word pleasurable or alluring—in the other painfullyoperating painful terrific or in so far as it operates with effect coercive in general when seduction is the word employed the pleasurable is the sort most apt to be brought to view by it but of the two as everybody feels the painful—the terrific—is in its general nature the sort by much the more powerful in its operation and in the particular case here in question it is by that that by far the greatest part of the mischief it will be seen is produced     iii modes—by seductive influence—in whichsoever of the above two shapes it operates—freedom of election may be excluded—spuriousness of suffrage in that same     proportion produced and introduced—introduced viz in either of two modes the one direct the other indirect—direct in so far as the situation of the persons to whom the force applies itself in the first instance is that of the electors themselves indirect in so far as the situation thus applied to is that of persons at large considered in the capacity of candidates—candidates actual or proposable proprietor proprietory seat proprietorship sole proprietor coproprietor landholding proprietor officebearing proprietor—terrorist terrorism votecompelling† terrorist competitionrepelling competitionquelling or subduing competitionexcluding terrorist landbestriding pursebrandishing terrorist—bribeoffering bribegiving seducer or seductionist corruptor or corruptionist—bribe in the pecuniary or money shape bribe in the quasipecuniary shape ordinary bribe briberoyal‡—reference being had to the operative motive viz fear or hope and to the situation operated upon of the objects meant to be respectively presented to view by these terms—of these objects together with their mental relations—a general conception will it is believed present itself at the first mention and by the occasions on which they will come to be employed whatsoever may be wanting to clearness or correctness will presently it is hoped be supplied iv instruments—free suffrage proprietorship terrorism bribery—behold in these the instruments by one or other of which every vote given by an elector is produced by which taken all together the     seats in the house taken altogether are filled     as to the votes—the number of those which on the occasion of each election are really free is the residuum of the number of those which by any one or other of the above three instruments or modifications of the efficient cause of spuriousness have been rendered spurious small indeed will probably appear to be the proportion of those in the filling of which free suffrage performs commonly the greater part scarce one perhaps in which it constantly performs the whole as to free suffrage of this instrument the nature is sufficiently explained by its being said to be the result of the absence or nonoperation of the several other instruments in regard to votes and the seats filled by them the proprietor is already in possession of that which antecedently to success the terrorist and the corruptionist does but aim at proprietorship has for its effect the effect of terrorism or corruption consummated and perpetuated freedom of suffrage excluded in perpetuity in relation to any seat or pair of seats suppose amongst coproprietors a disagreement as to the choice in this case a competition may have place and room is made for employment to be given to the two remaining instruments either or both of them viz terrorism and bribery so much as to the instruments themselves now as to the field and the different parts of the field in which they respectively operate as to proprietorship the field of its operation is composed of and confined to the proprietory seats that being said all is said as to terrorism the county seats present themselves as constituting that part of the field in which its operation is at the same time most conspicuous and most extensive subjects of the oppression exercised by it in the direct mode electors alone in the indirect mode as above candidates actual and proposable—candidates—and through them electors again viz by the exclusion put upon the countless multitude of those persons the worthiest of whom might otherwise have been taken for the objects of their choice the shape in which in this case it operates in preference is that of the landbestriding terrorism in this shape and this alone it operates where there is no competition electors being driven to the polling booth by the votecompelling influence of the oppressive instrument—rival candidates driven from it by its competitionexcluding influence comes a competition—then it is that in aid of landbestriding terrorism bribery and pursebrandishing terrorism are called in the selfsame money while operating on electors in the shape of bribery operates upon rival candidates in the shape of terrorism thus stands the matter in the case where the votecompelling power of the instrument is or is deemed to be strong enough to operate upon the situation of candidate with such a degree of efficiency as gives it the character not merely of a competitionrepelling but of a competitionexcluding instrument by the opposite case a demand is presented for a supplemental one in the bribery shape in this case while it is in the alluring shape that the influence operates on the situation of elector it is in the terrific shape that it operates on the situation of candidate in truth it is only by the prospect of the quantity of force likely to be exerted by the instrument in its alluring shape upon the situation of elector in the event of a competition that it can operate upon the situation of candidate with any such force as that which is indicated by the appellation of competitionexcluding terrorism in the case of these county seats if we look for the persons on whom in the character of electors it is in the shape of terrorism that the seductive influence operates we shall find them—in the first place tenants in the next place tradesmen shopkeepers artificers and other persons of all sorts in whose instance by hope of custom for goods or labour or by hope from any other source or by a motive of a more irresistible nature from the same sources viz fear of loss—fear having for its object loss of any such profit or benefit as in those or any other shapes had already been in use to be derived from the rich mans expenditure—not to speak of any interest which he may have or be supposed to have with the superior givers of good gifts—consider themselves as more or less dependent on his good will and those good offices which may be among the expected fruits of it in this case the instrument of force by which the voter is compelled and the vote extorted is on the part of the dependent elector the fear of giving offence to and thereby losing the good offices and perhaps suffering under the ill offices of the terrorinspiring candidate in so far as—consideration had of the amount of the apprehended loss and of the electors ability in respect of his pecuniary circumstances to preserve himself from it—the force is sufficient to engage the elector to take upon himself the expense of journeys to and from and demurrage at the election town—in so far terror—as being a force which in this case costs nothing to the person by whom it is applied—is the seductive force called into action in so far as in respect of its quantity the force which in this shape is at the disposal of the candidate is regarded by him as not sufficient—seductive influence in the opposite shape viz bribery—seductive influence in this acceptable and alluring shape—is called in and employed in aid of that which operates in   0 the terrific shape—indemnification viz against the expense of journeys and demurrage is the cloak in which in this case the bribery is enveloped thus much as to the situation of elector look upwards—look to the situation of candidate and the instrument which you have just been seeing operate upon electors in the shape of an instrument of alluring seductive influence—viz the money spent in bribery—this same instrument you may now see in the shape of an instrument of terror operating—and this too of itself and without need of any hand to work it—operating upon the situation of candidate operating according to the degree of its efficiency with the effect of a competitionencounterrepelling a competitionquelling or a competitionexcluding instrument in the election town itself—and within that circle within which by reason of vicinity to the town all demand for expense of journey and demurrage and consequently all cause and pretence for indemnification on that score stands excluded—the terrorism in the above viz the pursebrandishing shape finds not any place in which it can operate and as to rival candidates actual and proposable—the greater the distances between this central spot and the abodes of the respective voters thus purchasable the more strongly coercive will be the force of the rival and terrorinspiring purse of terrorism considered in respect of both the situations on which and thence in respect     of both the modes and directions in which it operates—but more particularly in respect of the competitionexcluding mode the effect seems as yet in comparison of its mischievousness to have attracted but little notice in brief so far as regards the competitionexcluding mode it may be thus expressed—the reducing the quantity of appropriate official aptitude in the honourable house from that maximum to which a regard for the welfare of the community would seek to raise it to that slender alas how slender scantling which experience has brought to view—a proprietorship in land or a mass of property sufficient to operate with effect either in the way of terrorism or in the way of bribery—in the latter case a surplus of ready money to the amount of from £ 000 to £ 000 over and above what is necessary for habitual expenditure and ready to be employed in the purchase of power in this shape—an appropriate     connexion with some person who is himself in possession of an appropriate qualification in one or other of those shapes—in these behold the conditions one or other of which is indispensably necessary and at the same time altogether sufficient to the purpose of a mans being chosen to fill this most important of all offices so as the purse be but full enough no matter how empty the head note well the persons to whom in this instance the exclusionary force is in an immediate way applied note well that they are not the electors themselves but persons at large considered in the character of proposable candidates note well the hand by which that same force is applied note well that it is not the hand of any individual human being but the hand of the invisible nature of things—the offspring of the election system taken in its whole compages now then all these circumstances considered pregnant as is this state of things with a mass of mischief so immense but at the same time so incalculable and inscrutable great need not be the wonder at its having in so great a degree escaped notice the case of the county seats being thus explained no further details can it is supposed be necessary for conveying a correspondent conception of the case of the borough seats in so far as by terrorism applied to the electors the effect can be produced—in this shape of course as being free of expense to the seductionist—in this shape it is that the seductive influence is applied at the same time—in so far as the number of those to whom in this unexpensive shape seduction can be applied with effect being regarded as insufficient to carry the election the assistance of bribery is regarded as necessary—bribery is the shape in which it is accordingly applied and here too in so far as bribery is the force applied to the situation of elector—pursebrandishing and competitionexcluding terror is the instrument which as above applies itself to the situation of rival candidate actual and proposable section x bribery and terrorism compared bribery and terrorism—mischiefs compared in both instances what is it that forms the character of the case is it not the spuriousness of the will to which the effect is given in both cases is it not that the will to which the effect is given is the will—not of the person whose will it appears to be and in pretence is intended to be and in reality said to be—but that of some other person whose will it does not appear to be and in pretence is intended not to be and accordingly is not said to be well so much for the general nature and character of the effect produced supposing it produced now as to the degree of probability as a mathematician would say—is the degree of certainty as other men say—that belongs to this important and mischievous effect the quantity of interest at stake—for conceptions sake be it money or moneys worth for it comes to the same thing—say the sum at stake this sum being in the two cases the same—say for example £ —for one instance in which you would find it producing this effect in the way of bribery in ten instances perhaps you would find it producing that same effect in the way of terrorism situations in which the effect depends—two that of the elector to be operated upon and that of the proposed representative by whom or to whose use the other is to be operated upon look in the first place to the first for unless it be with a prospect of accomplishment an object is not aimed at here if bribery is to be the instrument employed behold the obstacles—the opposing motives—which the seductionist—the proposed representatives or his supporters—have to overcome fear of punishment at the hand of the law—fear of reproach from without—and in so far as conscience may be regarded as concerned in the matter fear of reproach from within in this same case if terrorism is the instrument—and the only sinister instrument in the way to operate—by no one of the above obstacles does the power of the instrument find itself opposed in the case of bribery the operation has an external tangible instrument viz the money or moneys worth and the application of the instrument is rendered determinate by the circumstances of place and time and by the necessary acts of intercourse betwixt man and man for the purpose to the case of terrorism belongs not any one of all these exterior and determinate accompaniments—no such tangible instrument does it admit of of no such intercourse is there any need in it—no external and determinate object does it present to which any such inward sentiment as fear of reproach can attach in this state of things the two first of the three restraining motives cannot and the other generally speaking will not operate look now to the situation of the person—the proposed representative—by whom or to whose use the effect is to be produced to the production of it by bribery special application is on every occasion necessary special application and that attended with hazard in various shapes to him by whom or to whose use it is made—hazard of scorn and reproach instead of acceptance at the time in case of engagement hazard of nonfulfilment in either case hazard of disclosure followed     or not followed by prosecution to the production of the effect by terrorism no special application is with any such constancy necessary in many instances it assuredly has place—perhaps in most but there is no saying to what extent it may be produced by the mere notoriety of the wishes of the person in whose power is the source of terror—by this general indication with or without the assistance of any of those particular indications of which in infinite variety the case is susceptible to the application and operation of the matter of seduction in the shape of bribery the matter of wealth in the shape of ready money is necessary and in proportion as the desired effect is produced—or rather as the endeavour successful or unsuccessful to produce the effect is exerted—loss equal in amount to the expenditure is sustained in the case where it is in the shape of terrorism that this same naturally useful but accidentally misapplied and pernicious matter operates—though in this case as in the other the quantity of matter capable of operating towards the effect has its limits—still without loss in any shape to him by whom the profit is reaped does it perform its seductive office in a word so far as bribery is the instrument loss is certain profit precarious so far as terrorism is the instrument loss none effect if any profit without loss in the case of bribery the danger of punishment at the hands of law together with the less uncertain though less intense suffering at the hands of general disrepute—these together may be seen composing no slight obstacle to the procurement of agents such as to the requisite disposition shall add the ability necessary to the production of the effect desired on the other hand in the case of terrorism operating in the way in question—while as above what may very well happen is—that no application of any kind whether made on the part of the terrorist himself or on the part of any person in the character of an agent shall be necessary—yet in that same character scarcely will there exist that wellwisher to his cause in whose instance any aversion to the task of conveying the appropriate intimation will have place thus much as between bribery and terrorism—now as to the two contrasted cases in both which the force is supposed to be applied in the shape of terrorism—in the one case by the power of the law in the other case without the power of the law suppose an act passed—many a worse law has been passed is passing and will be passed—suppose an act passed imposing a penalty of £  on every man who being tenant of the duke marquis or earl of mickleland viz to his estate at fearham in the county therein mentioned—and having moreover a right of voting at all elections in and for the said county—shall at any election of a knight to serve in parliament in and for the said county—refuse or omit to give such his vote in favour of any such person whom for that purpose it shall please such his grace or such his lordship to nominate suppose for this purpose a bill moved for—here would be an occasion for whig eloquence—here would be fretting and fuming and vociferation even now supposing any such bill moved for—not that—considering the more convenient shape in which the same effect is produced for the benefit of both parties—not that in either there exists any the smallest interest exciting any one to move it—highly questionably it might be—nay even now while everything that is most atrocious and most fatally destructive of what little remains good in the constitution is passing every day—questionable it might be whether a bill to any such effect would make its way through the two houses well—but in a law to such an effect in point of efficiency and thence of mischievousness would there be anything comparable to what has place in this behalf in the existing and everlastingly lauded state of things sums the same of the thus legitimated influence of property would the force be equal to the already legitimate influence possessed by that same representative of and substitute to probity and intellectual aptitude in the present state of things no a dead letter or not much stronger would be the fivepound penalty by the profit of it even if levied and received would be covered but a small part of the expense instead of the lordly and angry hand—by this or that friendly and commissioned hand such are the powers of appropriate legal arrangements might the profit be received by an appropriate microscope a flaw—such as all proceedings are kept exposed to—might peradventure be discovered but before this by the very attempt as indicated by the purchase of the first piece of parchment by which the proceedings were commenced might such a storm of odium be raised as the nerves of his grace or his lordship—though he had been a sir james lowther—would not be able to stand so much for the case in which—neither by him whose endeavour it is to impose it nor by him whose endeavour it is to avoid it—the loss is any otherwise to be looked for than through the everwavering and perpetuallydelusive hand of the man of law contrast it now with the case in which the source from which it is looked for is a force which without need of any such treacherous and inadequate instrument may be applied at pleasure in the former case odium maximized vexation and expense certain execution distant and uncertain—in this case execution     at pleasure odium covered up no vexation no expense in the instance of votecompelling terrorism the establishing it by law is as above as yet but a supposition in the instance of competitionexcluding terrorism it has as everybody knows now for above this century past been matter of fact year    0 act   anne c   § i £ 00 landed property—and that too in a particular shape—the minimum £ 00 ayear going as far as a thousand ayear at least money of the present time at that time the monied interest being particularly strong among the whigs the landed interest among the tories—tories strong in the house of commons—so it was that on the occasion of the exclusion thus endeavoured to be put upon the genuine elements of appropriate aptitude in favour of the spurious ones monarchy and aristocracy acted with conjunct force in both creeds property is probity was then a fundamental article well—after all triumphing over sinister theory experience forced upon men the conviction that with the birmingham article employed to the exclusion of the genuine one business could not go on so completely had the absurdity of the idea been demonstrated—anno      and thenceforward that of the two great leaders of the opposite parties pitt the second and charles fox—each in his day a minister—a situation in which if any the demand for appropriate probity should have been at the highest pitch—the one had from the first no more than a minimum—and that to the last drowned in debt the other not even that minimum well neither of them having on principle—one of them not having even by law—a right so much as to sit in the house how come they to be there answer oh—by the usual instruments—houseofcommons craft and lawyercraft—the difficulty had been removed lawyers had been to work and set up a manufactory of sham qualifications lawyers got their fees disqualified men their seats—the work which should have been performed by sincerity was bungled out by the more acceptable hand of fraud and thus in the blackstone phrase everything was as it should be thus much for the comparison between the case of the seductionist whose instrument is bribery and that of him whose instrument is terror the situation in both cases being that of an individual the same representative of the source of the power being in this case as in the two former still the same compare now the situation of the individual operating in the character of terrorist with that of the universal seductionist the seductionist by whose hand though by no means unpractised in the use of terror the instrument of seduction most extensively and conspicuously employed is—the instrument mostly known by the name of bribery or corruption—the instrument of alluring influence by both seductionists—the individual terrorist and the universal seductionist—in whichsoever of his two shapes the latter may on the occasion in question be found operating—the same mighty mass of advantage is possessed—in the one case as in the other without personal application—without application so much as by agents—yet with the sure assistance of agents and these unpaid—in abundance—may the desired effect be purchased no expense—not so much as of thought no exposure to rebuff and scorn—no exposure to that sort of disappointment which in case of engagement is produced by the breach of it on the other side—no exposure to legal punishment—to public reproach—nor so much as to reproach of conscience—all these so many millstones hanging over the head of the venal and comparatively at least innoxious sinner whose sin has taken upon itself the nature of bribery but in all these cases the less efficient the restraint in these and all other imaginable shapes opposed to the pernicious effect—the greater in each instance the probability of its taking place the greater in each instance the probability of its taking place the greater the extent to which upon the whole it will take place and thence upon the whole the greater the mischievousness of it in each instance in which it is efficient—the result being in both cases of one and the same nature viz the giving effect to the will of some other man instead of that of the voter by whom the vote is given as the expression of his own free will—the comparative aggregate mischievousness of the two practices is great in proportion to the extent in which they respectively have place yes compared with the system of terrorism the system of bribery is virtue under the system of bribery both parties are pleased the giver of the bribe gets what he most desires the receiver of it what he most desires both parties are gratified both parties are contented in both situations you see smiling faces indexes of contented hearts under the system of terrorism whatsoever feeling of satisfaction can have place look for it on one side only and even on that side scarcely can it have place without having for its alloy the apprehension of odium and that odium just—frowns above gloom below—sympathy satisfaction nowhere turn back now to what is said on the extent of the right of suffrage note once more the collateral uses attached to the amplitude of that extent apply these considerations to the present case in comparison of what has place under terrorism—urbanity though under     the system of bribery not so much cherished as under the system of freedom finds a door naturally open to receive it not so under terrorism whence the difference—the answer has been already given of the benefit that may be acquired by the receipt of a bribe a man has no need equal to what he has of that of which—he having already the habitual possession or fixed expectation of it—terrorism threatens him with the loss whatsoever be the magnitude of his bribes yet suppose him to a certain degree obnoxious whether it be in public or in private life—and in particular if it be for instance the man whose sole trust is in those means of sinister influence he may to an extent more or less considerable experience the mortification of seeing them refused repression of insolence is therefore in his situation prescribed by considerations and urged by motives which in the case of the secure terrorist or the possessor of a proprietory seat have no place thus it is that—each being considered separately—bribery if not absolutely compared with terrorism at least is a useful practice terrorism having place on one side place bribery on the other—the lesser evil if evil it be now to be called becomes positively useful by the check it is capable of giving to the greater evil by the terrors inspired by a full purse brandished on the other side the votecompelling terrorist may himself be either driven out of his seat or so wrought upon as in respect of it to bear his faculties more meekly than he would otherwise himself incapacitated—by peerage for example—or disinctined—the nominee to whom under the influence of this check he has recourse may it may thus happen be a person less unpopular—in any or every respect less unapt—than the person who but for this salutary restraint would have been the object of his choice of one mischief with which terrorism is pregnant while bribery is altogether pure from it no more than a slight hint can in this place be afforded producing with so much more disastrous an efficiency the same common disease viz spuriousness of suffrage—the force of terrorism operates at the same time towards the suppression of the only remedy by the same tyranny by which the demand for reform is created the petition system in which alone it can originate is endeavoured to be crushed desperateness is thus another symptom added to the malignity of the disease and to this symptom the influence of bribery is happily inapplicable by mere situation—no expense in any shape not so much as in the shape of thought—does the bare image of the frowning terrorist repel from the paper—repel in countless numbers—the hands by which if free it would have been signed while strong as is the interest by which in so many places the disbursement of the money necessary to the purchase of votes is produced—on no occasion is any interest strong enough to produce any such disbursement in the quantity necessary to the purchase of signatures to petitions to be found interested alike in the preservation and increase of abuse and misrule in all its forms—monarchy and the aristocracy that crouches under its feet operate—with united force operate—as in case of votes—even without exertion—still more powerfully of course if with exertion—towards the keeping the door as closely shut as possible against the only remedy the situation in this case operated upon is that of the aggrieved subject who—but for the frown of inexorable tyranny—would have become a petitioner but who by the spectacle of the united thunderbolts suspended over his head finds his hand arrested and the complaining paper prevented from receiving his signature not satisfied with operating in the quiet and negative form of restraint—coercion is at this moment busying itself in the positive and more galling form of constraint—under the guise of declarations of loyalty circulating or stationing declarations of abhorrence as towards the only remedy—under the g—s as under the stuarts woe be to petitioners—grace and favour to abhorrers section xi purchase of seats—in what cases mischievous—in what beneficial in comparison of purely gratuitous—nomination for what in law language is called valuable consideration—is it upon the whole a pernicious a beneficial practice or a matter of indifference answer in each instance which of the three qualities belongs to it will in this as in all other cases depend upon the manner in which the universal interest is affected by it in comparison of the person who but for the sale would have been seated in the way of gratuitous nomination—the course taken by the possessor by purchase will it be more beneficial less beneficial or neither more nor less beneficial to the public interest in this question may be seen the answer to the last preceding one for this last question from no other source can any answer be deduced than from the consideration of the quality and quantity of the effective influence exercised by the individual in question in all shapes taken together during his continuance in the seat individuals being unknown as to the quantity nothing can here be said quantity being supposed the same—as to the quality     which depends on the direction taken by it thus much and thus much only can be said—viz that for ascertaining it in so far as it is capable of being ascertained the only criterion which the nature of the case affords is—the consideration of the situation occupied by him with reference to party tories whigs peoples men neutrals—taking him during the whole of his career together with which of all the several classes thus denominated has he acted in the course of this inquiry the persuasion which the author has all along found pressing upon his mind with irresistible force is—that to the disposition the tories or kings men add already not only the power but the practice of driving the country down headlong in the descent that terminates in the gulf of pure despotism—that—such is the state of interests—the whigs whether in or out of office are driving and would continue to drive on in that same course though in both situations with a degree of force and velocity more or less inferior to that which belongs to the nature of their naturally and almost constantly successful rivals—that if it be among the decrees of destiny that in its way to that abyss the country shall at any point be stopped—it can only be by the energy of the people headed and led by the few peoples men by whom any place shall have been found in the house reinforced by such of the whigs if any in whose view as the prospect of perdition comes nearer and nearer the shares they respectively possess in the universal interest may come to present itself as exceeding in value their respective shares in the particular and separate interests possessed by them in virtue of their connexion with the party to which they belong in this view of the matter—barring the application of the only remedy as above—the arrival of unmitigated despotism being sooner or later a result altogether certain—the only effect of which in this respect the practice in question or any other can be productive is that which respects the predicament of time the causing it to take place a little sooner or a little later than it would otherwise of the practice of venal contrasted with that of gratuitous nominations is the acceleration or the retardation of this catastrophe most likely to be the effect i answer—the acceleration and for these reasons— it being the property of money and moneys worth when applied to the accomplishment of any object to apply to the minds on which that accomplishment depends a quantity of influencing force over and above whatsoever would otherwise be acting on those same subjects in that same direction—the effect of the venality i e of the purchases made by means of it will in this case be—to give to the party whichsoever it be by whom they are made an accession of strength beyond what it would possess otherwise the accession of strength whatever it be which may be derivable from this source—by which of the several denominations is it likely to be devived in the greatest quantity—answer by the tories—by that party headed as they are and supported by c—rgeneral and their interest and their affections identified with his as it is the number of members belonging to this denomination—not to speak of persons without doors—corruptioneaters and corruptionhunters and blindcustomled men and indifferentists taken together—seems at present to be far greater than that of all the other denominations put together and as despotism advances—and while this sentence is writing it is advancing in sevenleagued boots—the number will be receiving continual increase proportioned to their number will be the aggregate amount of the quantity of ready money in their hands applicable to this convenient purpose and—quantity of money in hand the same—of him whose prospect of appropriate return is nearest the biddings will naturally be higher than of him whose prospect is more distant thus much as to the general tendency of the practice but from this general tendency supposing it admitted does any such proposition follow as that to the character of a true peoples man it belongs to lay down to himself any such rule as that of abstaining from it no surely but exactly the reverse the greater the velocity of the disastrous descent the more strenuous are the exertions by which it should be endeavoured to be retarded for my own part had i some ten or twenty millions of money at my disposal—i would though to an opposite purpose effect the very monopoly the mischievousness of which reference being made to the at present established practice has just been represented as being in the direct ratio of the extent of it instead of buying land with the money for my own kindred i would buy liberty with it for the people with that money not only should i buy up all the existing venal borough seats and county seats as they came to market but i should raise to the rank of venal ones many others which now are not so with that money in hand i could and would open honourable eyes in sufficient abundance i would enable them even to see—oh the astonishing sight—that liberty is better than slavery sincerity than imposture good government than misrule the absence of waste and corruption than the presence dependence on the people than dependence on an essentially insatiable shark with his subsharks—the     love and respect of the people than their merited abhorrence section xii secresy of suffrage—its importance further developed in the situation of election voters—in the character of a security for freedom of suffrage and against spuriousness of suffrage not only the utility but to a great extent the necessity of secresy—in the character of a security against all seductive influence operating from without whether in the shape of terrorism or in the shape of bribery that is in every shape whatever gratitude of the purely social kind excepted its necessity—in a preceding section section v and in the plan itself all these tutelary properties have been brought to view turn back to section x—behold once more the troop of dependents driven to the pollbooth with stewards in front and rear to prevent desertion by the protecting veil of secresy suppose now the direction given to the voter completely hidden—hidden from all tyrant eyes—say would any such trouble ever be given to stewards by terror may a man be driven to the place of election—true—but under the shield of secresy it is not by terror that when he is there the direction given to his vote can be determined but in this same case secresy as it excludes terrorism so does it exclude bribery for though by gratitude and sympathy alone what may happen is—that a bribe shall in this case be productive of the desired effect—yet such is the feebleness of the chance as to exclude it should seem all probability—all practical probability and thence all adequate expectation—of effecting by this means the desired purpose where the engagement is of such a nature that the act of contracting it is a transgression against the laws of morality and political probity who is there that can fail to acknowledge that the fulfilling of that same engagement is—not an atonement for that first sin but a repetition of it if this doctrine be just and true—nay whether it be so or not—in a case such as that in question endeavours to instil this antidote into the mind to which in the way in question the matter of corruption has been applied seem little in danger of being either deficient or ineffectual now suppose universal suffrage established     or suffrage to such an extent as not to exclude paupers let but the direction given to the vote be completely unknown to all but him who gives it—a pauper—having no prospect of gain in the event of his giving it in favour of the less fit candidate—nor of loss in the event of his giving it in favour of the more fit candidate—would if the delivery of his vote seemed to him worth the trouble—would naturally if in his own conception unable to form a judgment of his own—would of course among such persons as he beheld within his reach—look out for those whose reputation in respect of the joint qualities of appropriate probity and appropriate intellectual aptitude stood highest—from them endeavour to learn which of all the proposed candidates was in their opinion the fittest—and give his vote accordingly such would be the case under the system of secresy how would it be under the system of publicity his subsistence—his very existence—depends upon the pleasure of the local magistracy his vote would be as absolutely at their command as the voting ticket at the command of the hand by which it is dropped into the box think of the proportion borne by those who already are in a state of pauperism to those who are not yet fallen into that disastrous state this vast part of the democracy would be completely in the hands of the removable nominees of the crown yes—in the hands of titled country terrorists and corruptioneating and corruptionhunting court divines ready to join hand in hand with hubblebubble city corruptionists for the protection of a commissioned associate in the habit of exercising to his own use on condition of exercising other arts to the use of court and treasury the useful art of poisoning so long as it were upon such and such alone of his majestys subjects as it should please them to consign to contempt and torment by the appellation of aledrinkers and thus by the new instrumentality of universality of suffrage if unprotected by the necessary shield of secresy—thus without commotion or drop of blood shed the constitution would be changed changed from its present state of an impure but not yet to a certainty altogether unpurifiable mixture into a pure and ever unamendable despotism in correspondent obedience to one of those solemn ordinances which have been so often passed for show—with the exception of the metropolis at which it is kept collected in greatest quantity—all military force is at all parliamentary election times ordered at a distance from the place as if for a troop of dragoons by whose sabres the mask would be so effectually cut off and by any the smallest movement of which in this line of parliamentary service the whole country if by anything it could be would be thrown into a flame—as if for any such instruments of terror there could be any the slightest demand when without the stirring so much as of a finger or a tongue the object can be and is so effectually accomplished by the invisible and motionless spectre of terrorism thus are gnats strained at that camels may be swallowed such being the state of things by what strange accident—by what strange delusion—can it be that in the situation in which so vast a proportion of the whole body of the people are held down by the indissoluble bonds of civilized society—the necessity of secresy in the character of a shield to freedom in the character of a security against spuriousness of suffrage—at any rate under the joint yoke of monarchy and aristocracy—can have been made to conceal itself from any eye in such a case how is it that a man can avoid seeing that by publicity terror is armed by secresy disarmed a man ought—every man ought—to sacrifice in every case—to sacrifice in this case in particular—his own personal interest to the universal interest good—there we have an antecedent ergo so he will there we have the consequent well if in the consequent there be any truth here are we already in utopia no need of penal laws no nor so much as of sermons call a man names—hard to any degree of hardness—slave coward or if there be anything harder—by any such insult will he in any degree be disposed to practise the selfdenying lesson thus preached to him by a censor who himself is all the while sitting upon velvet on this occasion as on any other—if in any imaginable way without determinate and preponderant mischief means can be found for reconciling private with public interest and thus saving both from sacrifice—can any valid reason be given why such means should not be employed suppose that by any such expression of scorn ninetynine men out of a hundred or though it were but one out of the hundred could thus be engaged to devote themselves to ruin—to ruin or though it were but any the slightest inconvenience—how is it that while the useful and desired effect might as completely and surely be produced without inconvenience in any shape—how is it that by any such discipline the sum of happiness would be increased this shield without which all pretence to freedom is imposture—in what sort of situation could any objection to the use of it have found either origin or acceptance only in one or other of these two the one is—that of a man who—his whole dependence being in terrorism in bribery or in a mixture of both—beheld in the freedom secured by secresy     a bar to his designs the other that of a man to whom—that same situation exempting him from all such sensation as that of fear on any such score—no idea of any such sensation had ever presented itself as likely to have place among the multitude whom he saw at his feet or if it had had never otherwise presented itself than as a matter of indifference in conversation even and that a confidential one with a man now no more ballot being mentioned by me as a causa sine qua non of freedom he made wry faces muttered out the word nasty and turned off the discourse he was a patron of seats his votes wavering he was a great landholder and not the most popular among landholders cowardly dogs said an expert swimmer who having crossed a deep river at his ease looked back and beheld his companions some of whom could swim lingering on the other side—cowardly dogs are not ye ashamed of yourselves as to any supposed difficulty with regard to the accomplishment of the purpose altogether groundless would be any objection on that score with notorious and undisputed constancy is the effect accomplished for example at the india house in the sort of situation here in question should any inconvenience be found to attend the mode there employed others might and would be devised in plenty every one of them exempt from inconvenience no not in the invention of a mode by which the purpose shall be accomplished—but in the devising of a mode by which—to remotely situated as well as to conniving eyes—the purpose shall be made to appear to be intended and accomplished while in effect as well as design the opposite purpose is accomplished—in this lay the only difficulty turn now to honourable house and in that seat of selfproclaimed honour behold this difficulty after having during a course of ages been constantly surmounted at last by miracle rendered for ever unsurmountable turn to morning chronicle debates and therein you may see that on the  th of february     —the time of honourable house having already for a whole hour been occupied in the organization of a ballot for a committee of secresy—up from the opposite side of the house starts mr brougham and with the exception of one out of oneandtwenty reads the names of the members the choice of whom was to be the result of all this secresy comes the next day  th february      and in speaking of the ballot the noble lord at whose motion this timeconsuming process has been carrying on admits it to be open to the insinuations that had been conveyed still however says the report he did not think that the house would join      in reprobating a practice established by the usage of ages of no imposture which for the delusion of the public honourable house had been in use to practise—of no such imposture would even the most public detection afford to honourable house any inducement strong enough to engage honourable gentlemen to cease practising it in and to honourable house itself such is the portraiture given of the said honourable house by a noble lord who at that same moment is seen occupied in the giving direction to it and the intimacy of whose acquaintance with its true character could not without injustice and folly be contested not the less pertinaciously maintaining by argument the excellence of this usage of ages—even the principle of universal suffrage it had been contended he observed by many would not be productive of a fair representation of the people without it true but between the many and the one there was one difference the ballot thus advocated by the many was a real one the ballot advocated by the one was a sham one high in the tone of scorn and sarcasm was the epithet thereupon given to the authority by which the use of the instrument of freedom is thereupon stated as recommended high as who should say contemptible now if contempt there must be where will be the fittest object for it to be found—in the titled wouldbe impostor who knowing a practice to be a sham attempts to pass it off as genuine—or the untitled good man and true who holds up to view as sham that which he sees to be sham and as genuine that which he sees to be genuine for illustration—the effect of ballot as applied to other situations presents some claim to notice whatsoever be the situation and the ultimate effect—the effect which secresy has for its proximate result is—the enabling the voter to give effect to his own will to the exclusion of every other this being true in every case—in the situation of a public trustee consider it in the character of a security for appropriate probity—a security for the faithful execution of his trust in this situation whatsoever be the nature of this public trust and of the public interest for the support of which the trust has been instituted—in so far as in his own view of it his own individual interest coincides with such public interest secresy is the mode and the only mode that affords an adequate assurance of the fulfilment of the intended purpose on the other hand when   0 the situation in which he is acting being here likewise that of the holder of a public trust the danger is—that in his own view of it the tendency of his individual interest is on the point in question opposite to the public interest—to that public interest for which he is in trust—insomuch that he thereby stands exposed to the temptation of sacrificing such public to his own private interest—in any such situation the greater the publicity is that is given to his proceedings the stronger is the check such as it is the tendency of which is to restrain him from joining in such sacrifice consequently on the other hand the more entire and assured the secresy—the stronger the temptation and the greater the facility afforded to such sacrifice now transfer in idea the ballot to honourable house—adjourned suppose to utopia for the purpose of so ordering matters that on this one occasion the practice of honourable house shall not be tainted with imposture suppose at the same time a member in whose instance dependence and independence preserve both of them the customary relations independent as towards the swine who dare to style themselves his constituents he is dependent constitutionally dependent—as towards the emanuel of judge blackstone first let the case be one in which—whether in his individual capacity merely or in his capacity of partner in the universal interest or in both capacities together—he would in his own view of the matter be a sufferer by the proposed measure if carried say a bad or needless tax—at the same time were he to oppose it he would from the resentment of the said emanuel in his own view of the matter be in danger of becoming a sufferer to a greater amount in this case secresy will in his instance operate—and that with indisputable effect—as a shield to appropriate probity now let the case be one in which in the same capacities and in the same eyes as before he would be a gainer say that of any one of the swarm of bills for the extirpation of english liberties—any bill in a word for the fastening in a manner still more excruciating if possible the joint yoke of monarchy and aristocracy upon the neck of the swinish multitude in this case instead of being a shield to appropriate probity secresy would be a shield to the opposite improbity section xiii exclusion of placemen c from the right of voting—mischievousness and profligacy of the opposite arrangement on the topic here brought to view something has been said already in a preceding section § v something also in the plan itself in each of these places something and surely in either of them enough to satisfy any reasonable and unprejudiced mind in a word any mind whatever that is not led blindfold either by sinister interest or interestbegotten prejudice or by an undiscriminating regard to custom custom that blind guide to the guidance of which if to the rejection of reason none but the blind submit themselves placemen seated by the king with right of speech and even right of motion placemen from all the departments of government from which a demand for information can present itself—each of them with right of speech and motion—but in every case without vote—this is what is there proposed† decompose thus in idea the existing practice     though as yet it never has been decomposed in practice perform this operation for yourself gentle reader if so it be that your habits and faculties are suited to the task—suited to the performance of the operation or at any rate to the conception and remembrance of the result of it—if not turn at any rate from this section else nothing that you will see in it can be otherwise than misconceived let there be no mistake by nothing that has here been said or will be said is any such foolish insinuation meant to be conveyed—as that to the possession of an office under the crown—accompanied with any such mass of profit as shall be found adapted to the nature of it—to the possession of any such situation when considered by itself any mark of reprobation ought to be annexed to the case in which it operates with the effect of a bribe—a regularly repeated bribe—to this case and to this alone is everything which has been or will be said of offices in the character of masses of the matter of corruption meant from first to last to be applied no—considered in its own nature—considered even in any connexion other than that of the sort here in question—office is no more a bad thing than money is a bad thing censure passed on office thus connected is no more a censure passed on office at large than censure passed on a murder committed for the sake of money with a knife would be a censure on the use of money or on the use of knives considered in this point of view—and independently of the particular connexion here pleaded against—as it is with any one office so is it with every other—to no part of the official establishment—whether among those parts in which the office is in the gift of the monarch or among those of which the patronage is in any other hands—neither to any such part nor to the whole taken in the aggregate—has anything which is here said been ever meant to have any application if the sitting in perpetual judgment over the conduct of the several functionaries possessors of offices in all the several departments of government—if this be not of the number of the functions properly belonging to and in show at least exercised by the commons house—what other functions are there that can be said to belong to that same house if in so far as exercised with propriety and effect this function of the house has not its use—to what good use with what good effect can its other functions—all or any of them—be exercised in the situation of those functionaries who under the official name of judges are judges and nothing more—an incident which of necessity has sometimes happened is—that of a suit in which one of these judges has been a party being instituted and carried on in a judicatory in which his seat on the bench was situated—of course when the cause has come to be heard he has been anywhere but upon that bench what would his brethren—what would the bar—what would the audience—what would the public—have thought and said had he staid and voted there if in a word the judicateipsum principle—the principle brought to view by blackstone for the purpose of condemnation—and illustrated by the story of the sinning and repentant pope who in virtue of a sentence passed by himself upon himself was burnt alive—were on any of those seats which are called benches realized in the situation of any one of the twelve say rather of the fifteen superior judges—on the occasion though it were of but one single cause and that between individual and individual—suppose a man convicted of having received a bribe—by bench bar audience public—what would be thought and said of him as above by the very height of its improbability for assuredly few political suppositions can be more improbable the case serves but the better in the character of a case put in the way of supposition for the purpose of argument well—here in the commons house—in the instance of every member by whom a political situation of any other kind under the patronage of the crown is at the same time holden this judicateipsum principle as above explained is it not exemplified and realized in any such instance—on any occasion in which by any such member in case of a division a vote is given—the other situation having either money or moneys worth attached to it—the taint of bribery is it in any degree less strong upon the case of such member than if a bank note—say of a hundred pound—had but just before been received by him—received under an engagement implied or if mr speaker pleases express that such or such should be the direction given to his vote oh no it is abundantly more strong for in the section in which the comparison has been made between bribery and terrorism this has been shown already at any time at which a quarters salary is put into his hand the effect of it in the way of seductive influence—is it in any degree less than that which would be produced by money to the same amount put into his hand suppose him not in that or any other office under a stipulation—implied or express as before—that during the next ensuing quarter on every occasion on which a vote should come to be given by the cabinet ministers—such of them as were in the house—his vote should be on the same side with theirs less did i say not it indeed but much greater why answer because in the case of a bribe so called—the amount     of it being on each occasion fixed is on each occasion limited whereas in the case of the bribe not so called—of the bribe received under the name of salary attached to an office—though that one office and no other is in the mans possession yet in prospect—by the side of it beneath it and above it—each with its emoluments is a cluster of other offices—a cluster boundless in number and value—for self and friends in the highest—in the most comprehensive—in the in every way most important seat of judicature in existence—in the judicatory in which the lives and fortunes—the everything—not of a and b only but of all the inhabitants of the whole empire—not to speak of those of almost all other countries on this globe—are day by day—if not actually at stake—liable to be at stake in the exercise given to its powers—do the men in question—in a number on almost every occasion capable of deciding the part taken by the whole house and thence by the whole government—as often as the conduct of the partnership to which they belong is called in question sit and act each man as judge in his own cause each of them in respect of every vote he gives i speak of those who to their seats add offices of emolument from which they are removable at the pleasure of the crown each of them tainted with the matter of corruption and that as hath been shown in a form in comparison of which bribery is purity suppose this told of a foreign country—with what horror would not the state of government in that country be regarded with what commiseration that of the wretched people think then of the american united states—think of the sentiments with which on so many accounts—and on none more particularly than on this account—the condition to which we are doomed cannot but be regarded by a citizen of those happy states storm of indignation in the breast of honourable gentleman—at this page should his patience have lasted him thus long—down not improbably goes the page on the floor and then the foot upon it never but of one complexion—and that the purest—are his conduct his intentions or his motives selfregarding interest—the motive corresponding to that interest—the sort of motive on the general predominance of which over every other the whole species is continually dependent for its very existence—never for any such sordid motive can any place be ever found in so honourable a breast a hundred to one—for want of the habit of examination no tolerably clear conception has he on any occasion of the springs of action by which his own conduct is determined no tolerably clear conception of anything that is passing in his own mind on the present occasion—supposing him able to endure any such task as that of forming a comparative estimate of the degrees of mischievous efficiency as between corruption in the shape of bribery commonly so called on the one part and corruption in the shape of placeholding and placehunting on the other—in the following queries he may perhaps find some assistance while occupied in that more instructive than pleasant process   whether if on any occasion in effect or in intention the measure brought upon the carpet by the minister be mischievous or the measure opposed by him beneficial—in which case his opposition in so far as effectual is mischievous—whether in any such case—for securing as far as depends upon votes in that house the production of the mischief—any means more effectual than the sort of arrangement in question could be devised   whether in the case of punishable bribery—the bribe being either in possession or in prospect—the connexion between the desired end and the criminal and punishable means can in any degree be closer than—or even so close as—in the present case   whether by the impunity which in the bribery case has not place and in this case has place the strength of the temptation or the probability of its being yielded to is diminished   the like questions with regard to the ignominy and reproach which in the case of the bribery have place—and which in the present case find their place occupied by honour and respect—at any rate in the breasts of the customled and unreflecting multitude   whether in the case of the bribery the quantity of the matter of good—operating whether in the shape of money moneys worth or any other shape in the character of matter of corruption—is not fixed and by being fixed limited—and whether—to the quantity of that same precious matter in the shape of offices and so forth capable of being held by himself or by connexions of his of all sorts and sizes—relations friends dependents—in countless multitudes—held by the side of him underneath him and above him—his own situation being at the same time compared with the moment at which a bribe in the ordinary form is received a permanent one—and unless it should please him whose place is above all a perpetual one—whether to the quantity of this same seductive matter there be any determinate limits whether compared with that of a mass of the matter of corruption applied and received in the shape of a bribe commonly so called the seductive power of a mass of that same matter in the shape here in question—in the eye of imagination inflamed as it is by desire—be not as infinity to one       whether in the connexion which thus by positive institution has been established between the public mischief and the private benefit there be any the smallest public use—the smallest public use—or except the creation preservation or increase of the public mischief any other assignable intended use or effect than the production of the private benefit   whether if in any of the imputations here attached to the monstrous conjunction in question—the conjunction of the perpetually accountable situation with the situation to which account is perpetually rendered—whether if in any of these imputations there be anything really grievous to the feelings of any one to whom they apply there has ever been a time at which it has not been in his power to rid himself of it—and whether there has ever been a time at which it has not been in the power of the majority of those who find their profit in the monstrosity to rid the country of it   whether when in a case of imputed delinquency all other evidence and that sufficient is against a man—any other resource be left to him than the vehemence of the protestations by which he makes assertion of his own innocence—and whether from any such vehemence the probative force of such his evidence receives in the eye of reason any increase suppose a prize offered for him by the fertility of whose imagination that political arrangement should be proposed which with a view to justice and public utility should be most flagrantly flagitious—to any purpose but that of corruption and misrule the most grossly and palpably absurd—could any other be found capable of making a match for this oh no not although every man who ever gave himself to politics were to employ his whole life in the research suppose such a prize offered—would all the poetry added to all the oratory of the right honourable the president of the board of controul suffice him to win it—no not even though the quarterly review and british india were left to themselves and the whole mass of his powers concentrated upon this one object a constitution with this poison—slow but not the less sure—in the bowels of it rotten even from the time that this poison was injected into it must have been the matchless constitution—rotten at the core—and of such rottenness what we are now suffering is among the fruits as a match for utopia suppose a cacotopĩa discovered and described—would not filth in this shape be a fundamental feature in it for fear of the influence of the crown in a relatively subordinate sphere—judges forsooth in certain courts—though in certain courts only—judges in courts where four of them sit together though not in the court in which the powers of all four are condensed into one breast—judges in these relatively subordinate situations fixed firmly on their benches—while on the benches on which the fate of these men and all others depends—the judges on whom the whole of the business depends are thus kept—kept for ever—in a state—not only of dependency but corruptedness behold here another gnat strained at while camels and cameleopards are swallowed search the whole fabric through where will an end be found to this tissue of hypocrisy—to this mixture of sham securities and real mischiefs—of sham securities provided and real mischiefs fostered—efficiency to bad purposes coupled with inefficiency to good ones hypocrisy yes over and over can any hypocrisy be more shameless—more transparent—than that which is manifested     in marking bribetaking with punishment and as far as may be with infamy while in the person of a sostyled representative of the people placeholding under the crown is held in honour the placeholding held in honour—why even because the corruptors and the corrupted—the bestowers and the receivers of the matter of corruption—have need that so it should be bribetaking marked with punishment and with infamy—why even because the corruptionists—by whom the matter of corruption together with the impunity and the honour is given and received in that other—in that wholesale and so much more profitable shape—have no need of it in any such petty and retail shape by vituperating it in the shape in which it is of no use to them men think to earn—and if they do earn it is without expense—the praise of virtue of that virtue the vice opposite to which has taken such full and never disturbed possession of their practice and their hearts limit the number of those pretended representatives of the people of these real representatives of the monarch limit the number of those public trustees into whose hands as sure as quarterday comes the bribe by which they are hired shall be paid limit the number of those men who on the bench of justice as often as they become malefactors shall sit in judgment on their own conduct and that of their accomplices well when for the purpose of this limitation a bill is ready for passing tack on then to it a rider limiting the number of streetprostitutes that shall be employed as teachers in any boardingschool for young ladies once upon a time and once only—into one of the plans of moderate reform peeped it will be seen—and with congenial modesty—a proposition for a limitation to this effect once and once only nor does it appear that on that one occasion a proposition

this source—mischiefs individually seated—those of which the seat of them being in the character of the individual individually considered the nature may be understood from and exemplified in the effect produced by them in the case of any one such individual—mischiefs collectively seated—those of which the seat cannot be found in the state and condition of any individual individually considered but of which the source as well as the seat will be found in the state and condition into which the whole house taken in the aggregate will be seen to be put—put by the use made of the habit of individual delinquency in this shape in the character of an instrument of public mischief in a variety of shapes—an instrument of packing employed in the art and mystery of political packing as applied—to the securing on each particular occasion out of the mixed mass a predominant proportion of corrupt matter in the composition of the assembly—and to the use made of corrupt measures—not only of each of them individually taken considered as applied to its own particular corrupt purpose—but of all of them collectively     or separately considered as employed in serving as instruments of extension for the keeping out of uncorrupt ones confined to the individually seated part of the aggregate mass of mischief flowing from this source may be seen to be the slight view of it given in

particular interests of which his own personal interest is at the head behold in this state of things the mass of abuse to which it is the object of parliamentary reform to devise and to apply a remedy—an appropriate and adequate remedy among the requisites for the accomplishment of this object is the detecting and holding up to view in its true colours every particular abuse which shall have been found to enter into the composition of the aggregate mass—every arrangement every custom which in the character of a cooperating cause may be found contributing to the production of the disastrous effect in the instance of such of the component abuses as have as yet been brought to view notorious in general has been not only the existence and the nature of the abuse but to a considerable degree the extent to which it has place in the instance here in question the existence yes and in some measure the nature of it not however even this entirely—not assuredly in all their magnitude and variety the evil consequences and as to the extent to which it has place information on this head—information in any tolerable degree adequate—is a treasure that remains yet to be dived for in the ocean in which it lies drowned for the taking and presenting of a clear a correct and complete view of the state of the house in this respect during a given period—say from the commencement of the present reign—the following present themselves as the heads under which matter should be collected sources of information the journals of the house the votes of the house and such accounts as are extant of the debates accounts of the incorrectness of which supposing them in this or that instance incorrect—any more than of their incompleteness supposing them incomplete as unless by accident they always are—no member can have any moral right to make complaint until he has done whatsoever may be in his power towards the removing in the one only way the inconvenience in those its two

which business having been begun upon—the requisite number of members present therefore complete—so it was that by the departure of members a deficiency in the number present as compared with the

both sides on the occasion of the several divisions which on the several days took place the list of these divisions with the numbers being rendered as complete as may be—then will come to be made a selection of two contrasted classes of cases—one in which the importance of the question being in a remarkable degree high the numbers were in a remarkable degree low the other in which the importance of the question being in a remarkable degree low the numbers were in a remarkable degree high   calls of the house—numbers of them in each year with the numbers in the respective divisions if any which took place on the days respectively appointed     remain two other topics in relation to which any information supposing it attainable could not fail to afford additional instruction but of which so far at least as regards time past the attainment presents itself as hopeless unless possibly in a very small number of instances   on the occasion of each division numbers absolute and comparative of placeholders and nonplaceholders from a document of this sort what would be shown with certainty is—the number of the individuals belonging to one species of the genus corruptionist viz corruptioneaters but under the species corruptionhunters no precise number of individuals could ever be distinguished under the influence of the everattracting and scarcelyresistible cocagne above spoken of—the difficulty would be among the whole remainder of the numbers voting on this side to find so much as the single individual who did not appertain to this latter species and thence to the genus in which it is included   number of members present at the time of the division compared with the numbers present at different portions of the length of time employed in the debate in ordinary tribunals the two operations—oyer and terminer—being expressly included in the same commission and oyer being regarded as forming a useful not to say a necessary preparative to terminer—he who performs either of them performs both in this extraordinary tribunal not inconsiderable as everybody knows is the proportion of those distinguishing more than distinguished honourables who regarding oyer as a useless formality come to the terminer at once by which principle of dispatch a proportionable saving of time is effected quere on the occasion of each division the number of these economists and the quantity of the saving effected by each iii mischiefs from nonattendance—mischief   mischief in respect of moral aptitude only by regard for regularity is produced the mention made of this topic in this place in the plan itself may be seen how in the licence given to dereliction of duty in this shape is contained a sublicence—by which without danger of shame or reproach in any shape every man is empowered within any given space of time to produce exactly half the effect which within that same space of time could have been produced by an uninterrupted series of votes given by him in support of a series of measures not only corrupt but scandalous so scandalous and that to such a degree as that—whatsoever had been his wishes—had he been present he could not have prevailed with himself to abstain from voting in opposition to them in every instance iv mischief   intellectual mischief—deficiency in respect of appropriate intellectual aptitude and appropriate active talent probity being supposed not deficient principally upon appropriate intellectual aptitude depends the propriety of the direction given on the several occasions to a mans vote in the case where it is not with himself that the measure has originated principally upon appropriate active talent the aptness of the matter of which his speeches are composed in this case certain it is with himself that singly or in conjunction with others the measure has originated on intellectual aptitude as evidenced by the choice made of that same measure and of the more particular measures if any including the occasional penning of written instruments—for example motions resolutions and reports of committees—which as being subservient to it are included in it but upon appropriate active talent in another shape depends the matter of those several instruments that in respect of these two so intimately connected elements of aptitude a general and predominant state of inaptitude is among the natural and naturally unavoidable effects of the whole system taken together is a matter which in some sort has already been brought to view on the one hand necessity of hard labour in both these elementary shapes to aptitude in the aggregate shape in question     on the other hand exclusion put upon the hard labour and thence upon the aptitude viz by rank and opulence—of rank and opulence together the effect being to put a man already and even to a greater amount in possession of that sort of consideration which but for these unmerited advantages might in the character of an adequate reward have sufficed to extract from him the exertions necessary to furnish his mind and in sufficient quantity with those same endowments by rank opulence or connexion is a man put in possession of this office by the pride joined to the indolence derived from the same sources—is he in respect of the endowments here in question more or less disqualified from the exercising with any benefit to the universal interest the power attached to this most important of all offices of these three modes of entrance into a seat connexion is that by which the greatest chance for any tolerable stock of these endowments is left why because in the instance of a patron rendered such by proprietorship or by terrorism—what here and there will happen is—that on failure of all persons connected with him by natural relationship some person or other shall by the possession or reputed possession of the endowments in question in a degree more or less distinguished have been recommended to his choice in this state of things—to men seated by connexion with the addition of men seated by profession but in a more particular degree to the latter—of these two intellectual endowments will such stock as is to be found in honourable house be generally speaking almost confined at any rate small indeed in proportion to the whole number     will be the number of those in whose instance otherwise than in company with the one or the other of these two marks of distinction any tolerable stock of these endowments is found discernible in that house the term conntry gentleman is it not a sort of byword—is it not commonly regarded as presenting in one word the idea of a sort of character compounded of mental indolence mental vacuity and mental weakness in those two quarters then—connexion and profession—in these two quarters are the two intellectual endowments in question almost exclusively looked for well and in those same quarters suppose them found—what is the consequence the universal interest is it by this means benefited on the contrary much more probably is it injured only in so far as these two intellectual endowments are in the same breast united to the one moral one—only in so far as they are united to appropriate probity—will the universal interest receive from them any net benefit—only on the terms of this auspicious union will it so much as escape the being sacrificed but the higher the degree in which by the individual in question they are possessed the higher will be the price which at the constantly overt market of which c—rgeneral is clerk they will fetch the higher the price the higher the temptation and the less the probability of resistance in this state of things—the promiscuous multitude being by intellectual weakness prepared for the reception of mental poison—the select few by sinistrouslyderived strength for the injecting of it—observe what will be the effect of the cluster of arguments comprehendible under the common appellation of the argumentum à superficie ad superficiem—arguments from surface to surface—appositely employed gorged with public money obtained on false pretences out of the taxes—behold a man whose whole political life has been employed in helping to give increase to waste corruption and the consequent oppressions—summoning up when the time comes all his powers to the duty of guarding this complication of disorders against the only remedy and the history of any one such individual is the history of a class quicquid recipitur recipitur ad modum recipientis—says a maxim of the oldschool logic—a maxim in which more instruction is contained than can often be obtained from any such musty source of whatsoever is received correspondent to the constitution of that by which or him by whom it is received will be the effect on a mind prepared by sound and manly instruction for the resisting of it poison such as that would have no effect but those with which it has to deal are minds that by want of instruction or by such instruction as is worse than none have been prepared for yielding to it instruction by which the whole duty of man is summed up in the prostration of understanding and will at the feet of a set of men tied by every bond that corruption can devise to those habits of selfblinded partiality with which all prudence and all justice are equally and utterly incompatible the more attentively the stock of evidence which the nature of the case and the existing state of things affords is looked into—the more clearly will the operation of the above causes of inaptitude be seen exemplified and their efficiency demonstrated look at the debates yes and if to such a degree your patience will suffer you to draw upon it look into these same debates to so prodigious an extent not only no mark of active talent no mark of intellectual aptitude—but on the contrary proofs and how deplorably abundant—and that on the most important occasions—that of no such part of mans frame as the intellectual has any use been so much as attempted or endeavoured to be made in the volitional with     the passions and affections by which it is put in motion in the volitional and sensitive parts alone are any marks of exercise discernible vituperation—in the strongest as well as most unqualified terms that passion can supply—vituperation altogether unaccompanied by indication made of any specific grounds for the opinion or pretended opinion thus involved in and indirectly expressed by it—such with the addition of more or less of the matter of trivial fallacy in its several shapes of which a list might be made out—is the matter of which in general—and in a more particular degree on the occasion of the great topic here in question—speeches honourable and right honourable may be seen to be composed with a degree of energy proportioned to the dangerousness of the disease and the salutary efficiency of the proposed remedy wild visionary impracticable mischievous and so forth—are the imputations cast upon it—gross ignorance conjoined with mischievous madness the attributes ascribed to the authors and supporters of it by the barking of a dog—by the screaming of a parrot—might as much light be seen thrown upon the question as by this or that speech and by how sad a proportion of the whole number of speeches reported—and for the most part to no small advantage—as having issued from the lips of honourable gentlemen right honourable gentlemen noble lords—not to speak of noble and learned ones by the votes of those and other inferior animals is indication given of the state of the will and the affections by the speeches of so many unfeathered bipeds by whom such large draughts are drawn upon us for our respect and so much sufferance brandished over our heads in the character of punishment for the purpose of extorting from us that sentiment or at any rate the outward show of it—by these speeches is the state of that same faculty and of those same affections expressed and indicated affections as pure from all admixture of reason in this case as in those others let not what is thus said be misconceived not to any such effect as that of weakness in argument does the indication here afforded mean to point no it is merely to the utter absence of all argument—of everything which on the individual by whom it is uttered could have passed for argument opinion ungrounded opinion—this is what we have from them nor even that in its own shape but disguised in the garb of a mere expression of will mixed with that of the passion which produced it and this passion—with what sort of expectation is it manifested even with this and this only—such is the  00 height and weight of the authority of the orator that by the mere perception of his supposed selfformed judgment will the desired direction be given to the derivative judgments of all those by whom that perception has been obtained from what cause then this expectation oh from this cause not only probity but wisdom are among the appendages of rank and opulence—to him are known to belong these primary and only essential requisites—therefore so of course do those derivative appendages from the very causes of his inaptitude does he derive the assurance of his aptitude idiosyncrasies apart a man of twenty thousand ayear will accordingly speak with twice the persuasive force of a man of but ten thousand ayear a man who is everlastingly noble with some number of times the force of one who is but honourable such is the expectation of the man himself and unhappily—such is the force of inveterate prejudice—neither is that expectation by any means so groundless as it is to be wished it were v mischief   mischief by securing greater attendance on the corrupt side a matter which henceforward should be never out of mind is—it is only on the supposition of the existence of a number of members in whom—in a degree adequate to the placing of their votes on the several occasions on the proper side—the several elements of appropriate aptitude are combined—and these on each occasion in a number sufficient to the outnumbering of such of the members as by sinister interest by interestbegotten prejudice by indigenous weakness or by adoptive prejudice are stationed under the dominion of c—rgeneral and co—only on this supposition can any such copious attendance be anything better than an object of comparative indifference on this supposition here once for all brought to view—on this supposition as in the character of a necessary basis must be considered as grounded everything which in the course of the present section remains to be said in the present state of things—and in a word under any other than what is looked for from the proposed radical reform—the existence of any such majority on the side of uncorruption unless it be on this or that extraordinary occasion on which—in the minds of the several corruptionists in sufficient numbers—whether corruptioneaters or but corruptionhunters—it happens either to some particular interests of their own or to their share in the universal interest to operate with such a force as for the moment to overbalance the force of their partnership share in the corruption concern—any such superiority of numbers on the side of uncorruption presents itself as being—even on the supposition of the most perfect and universal constancy of attendance—altogether hopeless thence the demand for the other proposed articles in the system of reform—for supposing this single one adequate to the purpose of securing the effect desired the advantages expectable from reform would in so far as concerns virtual universality of suffrage be reduced to those above distinguished by the appellation of collateral and these and all the others put together might upon a fair account taken be found scarcely sufficient to compensate for the evils of change but when the state of interests comes to have been fully seen into what amongst other things will be seen is—that scarcely would the repugnance produced by all the other articles put together exceed that which this single one would of itself be sufficient to produce and that by no instrument of less cogency than that composed of the system of radical reform taken in all its parts could abuse in the one shape here in question be excluded another memento which in this place it may be of use to give is—that the state of things the existence of which is on the occasion and in the course of the ensuing observations all along assumed is—that the course of action to which on the part of the servants of the crown the particular mischief here in question—the established course of transgression—is rendered subservient is more or less mischievous why because the effect of it is—to secure to their measures be they what they may an undue advantage an advantage the property of which on each occasion is to be of no use but to the wrong side as such and not to be capable of being reaped but through the instrumentality of that mass of seductive influence which has been shown to be in their hands follows now an indication of the collectivelyseated portion of the mischief produced by the habit of nonattendance in its present shape and an indication of the sinister interest by which that habit is put to use and fostered too manifest to need explanation or comment is the sinister interest which the ministerial leaders have in the absence of members whose votes—together with their speeches if any—would have operated on the opposite side sinister interest of the day—sinister interest of the session—in the sinister interest here in question these two branches may be distinguished the sinister interest of the day is that which regards the business of the day the fewer the adversaries present not only is the victory the more assured beforehand and the more signal afterwards but the time consumed in making hearing and answering  0  speeches and the labour in making and prompting speeches is by so much the less in respect of neither of these sinister interests would the habit of absentation be of use to c—rgeneral and co if the number of absentees were as great in proportion on his side as on the opposite side but of this there is never any fear the means viz the sinister influence which they have in their hands being adequate—not only to the purpose of securing conformity in case of attendance—but for the purpose of such conformity adequate moreover to the more difficult purpose of securing attendance true it is that in this instance as in most others whatsoever the ministerial side for the time being has in possession the opposition side has in prospect but in this case between possession and prospect so mighty is the difference—that compared with so substantial an instrument of compulsion as that which the ministry have in their hands that which the opposition leaders have in theirs is but little better than a phantasmagoric image of it in the sinister interest of the session note moreover two distinguishable branches the efficient or effective and the preventive or defensive first as to the efficient or effective sinister interest it consists in the increased facility as well as certainty given to the adoption of all such measures as it may be the wish of the administration to see carried into effect as the session and along with it the season advances the attractions of the town diminish those of the country increase the motives or inducements by the force of which absentation is produced gain in strength and the number of the individuals in whose instance they are preponderant receives continual increase if the diminution of numerical strength produced by the operation of this cause were the same on both sides no such sinister interest as that in question would have place on the ministerial any more than on the opposition side but for a counterpoise to the force of this cause of absentation the ministerial side has a power of which their adversaries are destitute with the highest degree of efficiency as above shown the cabinet ministers command the attendance of the removable corruptioneaters of the inferior classes as also the corruptionhunters and this with a degree of efficiency proportioned to the estimated value of their respective possessions and prospects of the nature of the defensive or preventive interest some intimation is already given by the name thus employed for the designation of it by the same cause by which certainty and facility are given to their own enterprises certainty is given to the defeat of all adverse measures on the other side of all adverse measures good says somebody but what are they these measures which with reference to the side in question come under the denomination of adverse measures answer all measures whatsoever measures directly or specially adverse—measures indirectly in a general way adverse—by these two adjuncts stands expressed the only difference—by every measure carried into effect by the adversary—by every such measure—be it what it may if popular reputation is gained and whether popular or not power displayed there must not be two chancellors of the exchequer—is one of the few sayings remembered of pitt the second but whatsoever assurance of ultimate frustration may in this way be afforded—the same periodical cause of flight adds a further assurance from a still more advantageous source viz preventive anticipation or preoccupation of the house partly in virtue of the established rules of proceeding partly in virtue of the majorities on the habitual existence of which their continuance in their situation depends—the members of the cabinet possessing at all times an allcomprehensive command of the aggregate mass of the business of the house—a command by which are determined not only the choice of the elementary parts to be admitted into that mass but the order in which they shall respectively be admitted—admittance for the whole mass of their own measures is at all times of course secured admittance to the measures and therefore command of the quantity of time necessary for that purpose this portion being thus sure to them whatever portion might otherwise be occupied by business not originating in themselves it is therefore their interest to minimize for this purpose three expedients present themselves to their hands—  one which belongs not to this head is the deferring the commencement of the session to as late a point of time as possible in which way moreover the interest of the pillow is served at the same time with the general interest of corruption say staving off sessions   another is—the inserting into the whole length of the allotted period on as many pretences as can be found times of recess as many and each of them as long as possible say maximizing recess   a third is—the rendering as large as possible the number of the days in which by the original or incidental failure of the numbers made requisite to give validity to the proceedings the carrying on of the business is prevented say maximizing barren days now then on every day on which it suits their purpose that the number of members necessary to give validity should be present—by means of their official whippersin it is evidently in the power of the treasury to  0  secure and by circular letters and word of mouth applications they accordingly do secure the presence of that necessary number this object thus secured in the same hands being likewise the legal powers of giving to the whole session whatsoever length it may happen to their purposes to require—on every other day it is therefore their interest as above that this condition to validity should remain unfulfilled in such sort that nothing should be done from no barren day nor from any number of barren days can the sinister interest of c—rgeneral be subjected to any loss because for any day or number of days thus lost at an anterior part of the session it is in his power to add at the posterior part as many as he pleases at this posterior part that is at the part at which the ratio of the number on the opposite side to the number on his own side will be less and less by a conspiracy on the part of the opposition members to flock into the scene of action in numbers greater than usual on this or that particular day what might now and then happen is—the cabinet juntos being taken by surprise and in this way it is that this or that thing might happen to be done which could not by any succeeding majority be undone evidence for example procured and admission thus given to lights which could not afterwards be extinguished to obviate any such inconvenience a sort of rule of courtesy has with the concurrence of both parties been established viz that no motion of considerable importance shall be made without previous notice in this rule however it does not appear that motions having for their object the procurement of official evidence have in general been considered as included hence an accident which is said to have now and then happened is—that evidence which in case of an attendance sufficiently full would with the most inexorable effrontery have been refused has by surprise been extorted one mode of denying justice and by far the most effectual is the denial of the evidence necessary to the obtaining of it the most effectual—because by the mere production of the evidence justice in so far as depends upon the tribunal of public opinion will frequently be done rule—general not to say universal whenever to a motion for special evidence denial is opposed—that denial has selfconfessed delinquency at the bottom of it by the tribunal of public opinion it ought to be taken as and for confessional evidence and that evidence conclusive taken as conclusive evidence and judgment as for the utmost possible amount of the thus concealed guilt pronounced accordingly in this way—of the useful measures which otherwise might have been brought to maturity some are prevented from being brought forward so much as in the way of motion and thus far even conception is prevented others in the instance of which conception has not been prevented are prevented from being productive of the desirable and desired effect and in this case and in this way abortion is procured to the quantity of effect produced by those means of barrenness and abortion of which as above with more or less facility the manufacturing is in the hands of the minister—is added that of another set of means neither the existence nor the efficiency of which depend in any considerable degree in any direct way upon any exertion of his but the existence of which together with that of the system under which they are bred will of course find on his part a degree of protection proportioned to the service derived from them by his own sinister interest to this head may be referred— i the avocations produced by the separate and consequently with reference to the public service the sinister interests appertaining to the several professions viz those of—  lawyers—practising lawyers   army officers   navy officers   diplomatists   governors and other persons in office in any of the several distant dependencies ii the avocations specially incident to the situation of the members for ireland taken in the aggregate thus to each particular interest is the universal interest made to give way and by these particular interests not only is absentation produced on the part of the individuals but in many instances and to a no inconsiderable extent not only for the accommodation of individuals but for the accommodation of a whole professional class is this or that particular business or class of business put off thus by means of terms and arrests it having been originally contrived by and for the particular interest of the lawyerclass that during certain periodicallyrecurring portions of every year denial of justice should have place—so it is that for the incidental accommodation of this or that individual partner in that separate and sinister interest the whole business of the nation is moreover incidentally put off and forasmuch as in their situation of corruptioneaters among lawyers the crown lawyers—essentially acting partners in the firm of c—rgeneral and co—are constantly in the number of the members—while corruptionhunters are naturally more numerous on the prosperous than on the unprosperous side of the house—here may be seen another advantage which the great sinister interest of c—rgeneral and co draws to itself from the cluster of lesser interests with which it is surrounded  0  vi interests by the play of which the numbers of members present are determined as in the physical so in this part of the political world by the conflict and compressure between the centripetal and centrifugal forces is at each instant the locus of the several objects in question determined in the physical world have been observed physical attraction and repulsion to which by inference and supposition have been added primæval impulse in this part of the political world behold as analogous counterparts analogous to those of the physical world moral attraction and repulsion instrument of moral attraction and desire pleasure productive of a corresponding interest and operating in the character of a motive instrument of moral repulsion pain† productive also of a corresponding interest and desire and though in a direction opposite to that just mentioned operating also in the character of a motive and capable of operating with much greater force first as to centrifugal interests for as above such for shortness may be the term employed for the designation of that class of interests the force of which as applied to this part of the political world operates in a centrifugal direction as above explained interests the tendency of which is constantly and the effect but too frequently to reduce to the state of an exhausted receiver the condition of honourable house to produce a vacuum of which in the case of any receptacle of the physical kind it might not be altogether easy to produce so perfect an example on the one hand miscellaneous interests—on the other hand ministerial interest—interest peculiar to the ministerial side of the house but more particularly to the case of such of the leading members whose station is on that side of the first operation by which the class of centrifugal interests requires to be divided behold in the subclasses thus distinguished the two results among miscellaneous interests may be distinguished—on the one hand interests of universal operation—interests incident to all men as men—say for shortness universallyoperating interests—on the other hand interests peculiar to profession or office—say professional interests—interests of the professional purse in some cases interests of the countinghouse and so in the case of office official interests or interests of the office for the designation of all or any of these particular interests in so far as with reference to that portion of the visible business of which the house is the seat it happens to them to operate in the character of avocations may be employed the appellation of centrifugal or houseclearing interests to the head of interests common to all men as men may be referred—  interest created by the aversion to labour—say interest of the pillow   interest incidentally created by miscellaneous private business—say interest of the closet‡   interest created by the love of pleasure taken in the aggregate—the tendency of the sort of interest in question being in this case sinister say accordingly interest of the cup of circe next and lastly as to centripetal interests—housefilling interests they cannot be styled for so it is that on no one day was the house ever filled by them but for this or that particular interest operating in the character of a centripetal force—operating in a direction counter to that of the aboveindicated centrifugal force—operating in a direction opposite to that in which the force of the abovementioned confederacy of sinister interests acts as above—operating in a word in so far as they are effective in such sort as to produce attendance—the house would of course constantly as in fact and experience it is so frequently be a desert miscellaneous interests—ministerial interest—in this may be seen a division which as it has served for the cause of absentation may with like propriety and convenience be employed for the marshalling of those countercauses by which a limit is set to the operation of the above repulsive cause to the head of miscellaneous housepeopling causes may be referred—  the hope of strengthening a mans own interest i e preserving or raising the mans station in the scale of public repute of public repute whether on the ground of appropriate aptitude with reference to the situation or on the mere ground of the power and reputation dependent on it—  hope of serving a friend i e rendering good offices to the individual or class of men in question whether through sympathy or in hope of return in the like shape—  hope of serving the party viz to which if to any for the time being it happens to the individual in question to have attached himself—  hope of witnessing an  0  interesting debate say in this case interest of the amphitheatre well—and in the whole list of the official causes of attendance—in the whole of the entire list thus professed to be made out—is no place to be found for that cause which consists in a sense of duty candour what is become of candour charity what is become of christian charity answer by neither of these virtues is misrepresentation in any degree or shape prescribed if in any degree capable of being taken into account any such virtuous motive had place—    being the number of the members in whose instance the right in effect and in name the duty of attendance has place—no such phenomenon as that of the house in the state of a desert would on any day have place unhappily in fact and experience not a session perhaps was ever seen in which a number of such universallyassumed holidays were not seen to have had place in that high school of selflicensed truantism and indiscipline among the efficient causes of attendance remain those interests the operation of which is confined to the ministerial side of the house those interests of the operation of which one part of the effect has already been seen under the head of mischief  —mischief by securing greater attendance on and greater effect to the corrupt side by the subordinate as well as the superior official situations may be seen shared the interest of the sceptre in its three distinguishable forms viz   interest corresponding to the present pleasure of power—pleasure derived from the present possession and exercise of power   fear of losing it or seeing it decrease   hope of giving increase or at least stability to it in the instance of those by which the superior situations—say for greater distinctness the cabinet situations—are occupied this interest of the sceptre suffices for the most part—suffices without any such fear as that of eventual punishment in the shape of dismission—to secure in a state of tolerably habitual constancy the fulfilment of the duty of attendance in the inferior situations—but for the wholesome fear last mentioned insufficient to secure the bearing of this burthen with any tolerable degree of constancy would be all the sweets of office therefore it is that for securing the production of so indispensably necessary an effect—to the general fear of being deprived of these sweets by casualties applying to the whole party is and cannot but be added the special fear of being eventually deprived of them deprived of them even by the superior and regularlyprotecting hands should any inexcusable degree of weakness be manifested in respect of those exertions of selfdenial which are necessary to the opposing an effectual resistance to the attractions presented by the interest of circes cup—with or without those other interests which have been stated as operating in conjunction with it but if even in the case of actual corruptioneaters—of those in whose instance those sweets are already in possession thus faint and unsteady is the operation of those causes by which a tendency to attendance is produced—judge how much fainter and fainter it cannot but be in the several more and more remote situations—of corruptionhunters attached to corruptioneaters in possession and corruptionists who are such but in expectancy—considered in their several continually receding situations viz of those imaginary corruptioneaters in chief—of imaginary corruptioneaters in subordinate situations—and of those imaginary corruptionhunters whose melancholy station is at the furthest point of distance in the plan in question as in every other to the particular cluster of interests which spring out of his own particular situation in the instance of every man is added the share he has in the universal interest but by this interest alone unaided by any of these others would the house with any tolerable degree of regularity be supplied with a number sufficient for the carrying on of the business—for the carrying it on in any manner whatever good or bad the answer is already given not even with the aid of all these separate particular interests is the effect produced much less by the single power of the share thus possessed in the universal interest not that in default of all these other interests produced as they are by the existing causes—the machine of state would be in any great danger of falling to pieces kept together in some way or other no fear but that in that case it would be kept together but how for its immediately operating cause or causes the effect would have an interest or cluster of interests created for the purpose of such factitious interest or cluster of interests would you see an example look to the house of lords for the giving exercise to that branch of the supreme power—which is so useful not only to the high branch by which it is exercised but to one still higher—three is the number of persons that has been made necessary—three and no more the number that has been made sufficient now of what persons this triad is it composed answer of the lord chancellor of the noble chairman of committees and of a prelate—out of the thirty prelates right reverend and most reverend some one by whom the blessed comforts of religion have  0  just been administered to the congregation so composed and of the care thus taken by each of his own share in the universal interest what in these several cases is the immediate cause in the instance of the lord chancellor his office of speaker with the mass of emolument in the shape of salary fees and patronage attached to it—in the instance of the noble chairman of committees his salary with its et cæteras remains the prelate—the only person of the three for whose benefit to pay him for the care thus taken by himself of himself no special immediate interest is created—created in manner as above at the expense of swinish multitude obvious is here the contrast with the sort of injustice which it involves in excuse for such an irregularity all that can be pleaded is that the number of the right reverend and most reverend persons thus loaded—english and irish together—being thirty a thirtieth part of the time of the whole session measures the quantity of the load thus imposed upon any one of them without special recompence from the example thus exhibited in a sphere of superior dignity—learn as above the mode in which in the similar howsoever inferior sphere in question the immediate interest necessary to the preserving the machine from falling to pieces would in the hypothetical case in question be created power without obligation in the regions above—obligation without power in the regions below—such is the scheme of division and distribution appointed and carried into effect to the diveses the good things to the lazaruses the evil things propose that in any such his high situation noble lord or honourable gentleman should stand engaged thus to take care of his own interest without being paid for it—noble lord or honourable gentleman would stand aghast at the injustice vii inconsistency of the nonattendance ad libitum in this in comparison with the indispensable attendance in other offices this unless that of the monarch be excepted beyond comparison the most important of all offices—the very office under the eye of which the business of every other office without exception is liable to be brought for censure this—of all offices in virtue of which any business at all is done—for sinecures acknowledged in that character—sinecures whether profane or sacred are not here in question—this of all offices of business the office in which neglect of duty is at the same time more extensive—more habitual—more constant—more manifest—more manifestly mischievous—more scandalous than in any other a sort of riddle this but the solution comes along with it power supreme power unincumbered with obligation—situation irresponsible—in these few words and phrases behold the solution of it look at the situation of the twelve judges look at the situation of the eleven masters in chancery—look at the situation of the commissioners of the customs—look at the situation of the commissioners of the excise—look at the situation of commissioners of the navy—in all those offices so comparatively narrow in respect of their field of action—so inferior in respect of the extent and importance of their business—where will you see anything like it in the situation of member of the house of commons may a man remain for a whole parliament no efficient obligation for so much as a single days attendance—sees mp written after his name—swaggers and franks letters—throws upon the shoulders of the swinish multitude the burthen of payment for his private correspondence this and more is what in that public situation a man may do for his private benefit without rendering to the public in any shape whatever an atom of service call of the house—yes if so it be that he is within call and grudges the trouble of sending a false excuse but more on this head a little further on in one point of view more flagrant is this abuse even than sinecurism by sinecurist as such nothing at all is done nothing is there that so long as that title belongs to him can be done by him but if not anything at all so neither can any mischief be done by him thus as with sinecurist how is it with honourable gentleman for no one good purpose is he under any obligation whatever to bestow a single moment of attendance while for all bad purposes he may attend as often as he pleases sinecures professed being thus disposed of look through the whole scale of office—begin at the bottom end at the top see whether at any one point in it any such monstrosity is to be found look at the exciseman were but a small part of that truantism which is committed by honourable gentleman manifested by the exciseman dismission—unless he had good boroughinterest—dismission would be his portion nor that portion undeserved speak of me in the same breath with a fellow such as that cries honourable gentleman swelling strutting and making up to the glass to view himself—compare me to an exciseman—a man of my property—a  0  man of my influence and that influence all of it so legitimate chair chair look to the chair sir is it not legitimate have you not told us so oh yes sir—all of it legitimate—the influence of your property if so it be that you have any and that property of the right sort but this property of yours is it of the right sort—is it of any sort was it really by property that you forced your way in—was it not by connexion that you crept your way in—and whatsoever it was that brought you in are you now really worth a groat no nor yet half a groat if your name be sheridan or     but for proving the species here one name is enough an exciseman—compare you to an exciseman sir if your title to respect were as sure as that of an exciseman much surer would it be than it is of an exciseman two things are sure to be true   that in a shape appropriate with reference to the situation into which he has procured himself to be placed he possesses in some degree the connected qualifications of appropriate intellectual aptitude and appropriate active talent for without them he could not be what he is   that by means of these same endowments service to the public is—in a certain shape and a certain quantity actually rendered by him in his instance both these good things are sure to be true—in yours which of them sir neither the one nor the other no nor any other whatsoever up now to the opposite end of the scale lift up your eyes to the throne—behold the man that sits on it in principle or practice even in that situation is any such monstrosity to be found in that situation few assuredly if any who if asked would deny that in their everlegitimate situation the power belonging to it is a trust here in this country by our own monarch by our prince regent in so many words—while fox was the word of words—was it not declared so to be so much for principle but here in this case—what unhappily is not true in every case—we have not only acknowledged principle but in some degree even accordant practice to papers upon papers does the monarch give his signature to papers not for his own benefit merely but for the peoples likewise—to papers to which his signature must be given and is given or the machine of the state would fall to pieces to papers for everybodys use not like honourable gentlemans signature for his own use or that of his own connexions merely and to save them the expense of postage let there be no misconception mark well the point that is here in question not the quality not the goodness not the value of the service performed—but the fact—the mere fact—that service is performed not the propriety of that which in cases of attendance is done—but the fact—the mere fact—of the attendance viii individual delinquents blameless—who blameable of the view thus given of the state—not of the representation—not even of the misrepresentation but of the nonrepresentation—the habitual and established nonrepresentation—together with the causes by which it is produced what is the practical object that on individuals—considered in the character of persons in whose breasts on each or any one of the particular days appointed for business by sermons as from a pulpit—to any such effect as that of producing a strict fulfilment of the duty here in question—any such sense as what is called a sense of duty may on any reasonable ground be expected to operate no—no indeed as well to the deaf adder or to the congregation to which no minister but st anthony ever preached might any such sermon be addressed by any individual to whom anything in the way of reproach or so much as of exhortation having for its object the increasing the frequency of his attendance were addressed—the answer that would be given—nor that commonly an insufficient one—is altogether obvious by no vote of mine would he say—by no vote of mine unless accompanied by an adequate number of other votes on the same side would any adequate effect be produced but with the exception of the ministry of no such requisite number can any sufficiently grounded assurance be ever entertained in their hands is seen and felt a mass of power of which to a certain extent and that a sufficient extent the efficiency stands assured—power exercisable at all times—to the pack which they keep belongs an establishment of whippersin to whose voice all such dogs as have a certain collar about their necks are instinctively obedient to them it does belong to compel them to come in to them yes but to no one else in their hands is the already sensible and tangible whip to the opposition leaders nothing but the phantasmagoric image of it to no others so much as that image under circumstances such as these where is the individual ever to be found on whom reproach can ever find room to attach itself with any decided force everybodys business is nobodys business not less true than trivial is that familiar adage one case indeed may be assigned—in which on some better ground than as above blame might find spots to fix upon suppose an adequate remedy brought to view and endeavours used for the giving effect to it on that supposition what it would be difficult to find would be—not the person on whom  0  blame—just blame—would attach but the person on whom it would not attach in the event of his omitting to use any endeavour in his power towards the accomplishment of that end just blame—just reproach yes but to what effect any such reproach whatsoever were its justice answer to no effect at all supposing the stream of general and preponderant interest to run in opposition to it but of this further when the interests which occur in shutting the door against every efficient system of reform come to be brought to view ix honourable house incorrigible this disorder incurable the constitution subverted by it well now note what has been seen—  the nature of the species of delinquency in question   the vast—the undeniable mischievousness of it   the impossibility of the mischiefs ever finding a remedy in the exertions of individuals on individual occasions   the sinfulness of the sin in the breast of every individual who after proof seen of its sinfulness shall forbear to contribute his best endeavours by whatsoever sweeping measure may be most surely effectual to purge the house of it to cleanse the house from it and if so it be that he himself is of the number of the sinners thus to bring forth the only fruits meet for repentance all these things seen exists there that man in whose eyes the wish to behold the concurrence of the votes necessary to the substitution of appropriate probity in this shape to the opposite improbity brings with it any so much as the minutest chance for its accomplishment if so too plain indeed will be if it be not already his mistake on this occasion as on all others before you put yourself to any expense in the article of argument look first to the state of interests—think to overcome the force of interest by the force of argument think as well to take lisle or mantua by peas blown out of a peashooter the man who hastened to rome to convert the pope to protestantism—never let him be out of mind when the pope has put on protestantism look then to honourable house—then it is that your eyes shall behold honourable house putting on uncorruption in the room of that corruption which sits now so easy on it think then whether there be that imaginable shape in which uncorruption would sit upon honourable house more gallingly than in that of universal constancy of attendance—a shape under the pressure of which—unless they respectively gave up their seats—the landofficer the seaofficer the diplomatist would have to give up their commissions—the governor or other officebearer in the distant dependencies his office—the lawyer his practice—the official lawyer his office and his practice—the foxhunter for months together his dogs and horses—the operafancier his operas—the bondstreet lounger his lounges address yourself to the man who sits by proprietorship—address yourself to the man who has come in by terrorism—address yourself to the man who has come in by bribery—address yourself to the man who through proprietor terrorist or bribegiver has come in by purchase—with the exception of some halfhundred or thereabouts address yourself to any one of the    —tell him that his situation is a trust that to fulfil that trust is a duty—tell him that the situation of monarch is a trust—that the prince regent has declared it so to be—and that in the hands even of the prince regent it never has been nor ever can be a perfect sinecure—talk to him in any such strain—so you may if you please but first prepare yourself for a horselaugh in your face the prince regent indeed yes to him it is indeed a trust it is not for him to do nothing but what he pleases o yes duty and duty enough has he to do papers upon papers must he sign when the time comes it is for that that he is where he is sir my case—be pleased to understand—is quite a different one at this time and at all times i can do sir and i will do sir as i please when it is more pleasant to me to go in than to stay out i go in when it is more pleasant to me to stay out than to go in i stay out this sir it is to be independent this sir is the duty of an independent member of parliament this sir is the use of a mans being a member of parliament well now honest reader what you are supposing all the while is—that principles such as these are but the principles of individuals—principles which in so far as they are really harboured and acted upon are but the accidental result of individual profligacy and insolence principles too which in the representation thus given of them are in the beat of argument more or less exaggerated alas if such be really your thoughts in sad truth you are in an error—an error which you will be but too deplorably liable to fall into should any such expectation be entertained by you as that on that seat of selfproclaimed honour any real regard for duty—even for acknowledged duty—is to be found duty as to constituents—duty as towards swinish multitude oh no cries honourable house leave that duty to the swine duty to honourable house yes on this occasion at any rate that duty and no other is the duty honourable house knows of now in all this is there anything of misrepresentation—anything of exaggeration read now and judge honourable house has its rules and customs  0  behold now one of them unless forty members or more are present business cannot be begun upon—here you have a rule but when honourable house so pleases motion having been made and seconded for that purpose what is called a call of the house is made a day is named—always a more or less distant one—and on that one day attendance on the part of all and singular the members is commanded look once more at this rule—at this custom—whatsoever be its name constituted by this rule or custom here you have a duty—an obligation established established aye and as often as honourable house shall so please enforced for not a member is there who should he fail of paying duty and homage to honourable house either by attendance or excuse may not—would not peradventure—by order of honourable house be imprisoned imprisoned and squeezed for patronageswelling fees well then—in the obligation either to attend or send excuse—here you have not only an obligation but an obligation as often as it shall please the honourable house made perfect here you have indeed a duty a duty but towards whom even towards honourable house by whom and by whom alone it has been created—by whom and by whom alone when enforced it is enforced but in this very duty—a duty thus created and no otherwise enforced—in this very duty you have the abrogation of all duty as respecting the service at large—of all duty as towards the people in the character of constituents obligation confined to one particular occasion—what is it but licence as applied to all other occasions thus it is that of honourable house it is the law—the will—the pleasure—the constantlyentertained and frequentlydeclared pleasure—that in regard to attendance—except in obedience to command issued by honourable house—honourable members shall at all times do as they please and this is what was to be proved now in this is there anything misrepresented anything exaggerated as towards constituents—as towards swinish multitude of obligation not so much as the weight of a feather not so much as that sort of obligation the levity of which is recognised by moralists distinguishing it as they do by the name of an imperfect one proposing at the same time that all other things shall remain as they are and therefore as they should be in or out of the house—suppose then a man to stand up and propose that on the part of honourable gentlemen who risk nothing by it attendance—a duty not occupying half the year—should for and during so moderate a portion of each mans time be rendered as constant and universal as on the part of soldiers who the whole year and on every day in the year risk their lives by it—to any such effect any such proposal would it be endured the whole house would it not be in an uproar a voice crying make a stand make a stand aye and with echoes too—echoes from both sides—would it not once more be heard and from the reforming side of the house to the pious among honourable gentlemen would not the preacher of this part of the whole duty of man be as surely an atheist—to the political a jacobin—as if his motion had been for universal suffrage say how should it be otherwise—when by the one measure as by the other the best interests as the phrase is—the best interests on both sides—would alike be elbowed out and made to give place oh intolerable thought to the universal interest no assuredly not to honourable house are these arguments or any part of them addressed their interest is to remain as they are and what they are so long as the injured people and their brave defenders shall behold them sitting there no not to the deaf adder—not to that deaf adder whose deafness has been produced by the charms of sinister interest will any such charms as can be contained in argument be addressed the ears which by the voice of honest interest—of that interest the voice of which is in unison with universal interest—are prepared to listen to arguments pleading the cause of that interest—these and these alone are the ears to which with any the slightest expectation of their being listened to these arguments howsoever in form and by compulsion addressed to any other quarter are or in sincerity and reality can be addressed x abdication—more truly predicable of honourable house than of james ii—quere as to forfeiture think now of james the second how he governed every body knows think how he fled from his trust and how by honourable house he was declared to have abdicated it well then—this trust of his—by what sort of conduct on his part was it that he abdicated it till the moment when for the purpose of the moment it pleased honourable house to change the sense of it did not—in every other instance in which an office of any kind is mentioned does not—the word abdicate mean giving up intentionally and from choice and that tyrant—one of the most tenacious of all tyrants—would anything short of the most unsurmountable necessity have ever forced him to give up either the office or so much as a single atom of the power belonging to it so much for him whose name was king turn now to him or them whose name is legion see whether from that time to the present—or say for  0  shortness since the irish union—by the vast majority among the members of the house—the exercise of the whole trust belonging to the house has it not been deserted—deserted and if desertion be abdication abdicated if spite of all his endeavours to continue in the exercise of the functions belonging to a trust a man may thus legally be said to have abdicated it—and be dealt with as if he had abdicated it—how much more truly—how much more justly—where the forbearance to exercise them is most notoriously his own free—his own even licentiously free act—and of any one man to any number of men if for grounding a practical consequence in other places the word abdicated—the great parliamentary word which by the hand of lawyercraft by which this sense was forced into it honourable house forced upon the other house—if this word be not of itself yet strong enough take in hand the word forfeiture—take along with it the word nonuser—consult mr justice blackstone see whether—be the office what it may—private or public—and if public whether it concerns the administration of justice or the commonwealth—of two causes of forfeiture nonuser be not one—a cause yea and of itself a direct and immediate cause in all this is there anything of subversion anything of sedition be it so but on whom shall fall the punishment on me it is not i that have made the sedition all that i have done is to find it—to find it even where myriads upon myriads have found it before me i am not the delinquent—the seditionist—the enemy of government i am the informer—the servant of government—the unpaid as well as spontaneous informer—which is more than all informers are—judge blackstone—if you want the seditionist—in him you have the seditionist his body let lord sidmouth take up and set to rot along with the living ones—unseen and unseenable—in one of his bastilles yes if parliamentary doctrine is to be taken for authority and that authority decisive who is there—what lawyer at least is there—that does not see on how much better and truer ground than the power of the monarch in that day may the power of honourable house in these our days be deemed and taken to have been forfeited—forfeited to and for the use and benefit of the people let me not be mistaken what i mean here to say is—not that the honourable house is exactly speaking a corporation—not that to the kings bench—the judicatory by which corporations are purged and persons wrongfully acting as members of them ousted—it belongs to purge honourable house no if to the lot of honourable house it should ever fall to be purged the judicatory by which the purge is administered must be of a constitution and above all of a complexion somewhat different from that of the court of kings bench at present all i mean is—to point the attention of the proper judicatory whatever it be to the description as above of the case by which according to mr justice blackstone the demand for a purge of this sort is created xi the incurableness of the disorder—and the consequently incurable corruptness of honourable house—declared by hatsell chief clerk of the house is not this yet enough of misrepresentation—of exaggeration—of rash and ungrounded or insufficiently grounded inference—of any such imputed result of audacious hostility—after what has already been seen can any charge—any suspicion—still remain well then call in john hatsell—call in the man who while in his place the chief servant has long by his works descriptive of the practice of the house and published for the use of the members been looked up to as the oracle of honourable house to a man in his situation—will anything of hostility—and if of partiality partiality on the adverse side—be imputed hear then what is said by him of the nonattendance and its consequences it not being customary of late years says he vol ii p    to    to enforce the calls of the house by taking members who do not attend into the castody of the serjeant in the twenty years that i have attended at the table date of this second edition      there has not occurred a single instance although at the time of ordering the call there is always a resolution come to that such members as shall not attend at the time appointed be taken into custody it does not become me to determine how far this lenity of the house in admitting every trifling excuse that is offered conduces to the end proposed—or whether it would not be better not to order a call than to make it nugatory by not enforcing it such then in the thus honestly published as well as declared opinion of the most competent of all judges was at that time the state of the disorder itself behold now what in the same opinion are among the effects of it the controul which the independent members of the house ought to have over the conduct of the ministers is says he entirely lost well—if this be not a subversion of the constitution what else can be if it be not by this that what was best in the constitution of this country was distinguished from what was worst in the worst of other governments—by   0 this viz that a body of men chosen by the people—so chosen and so circumstanced as not to be in any state of dependence as towards the servants of the monarch chosen by the monarch—that this body of men so chosen and so circumstanced possessed a controul over those same servants of the monarch—by what else was it that this same constitution was ever thus distinguished well then—in the thus declared opinion of this official and intelligent as well as assiduous observer of the conduct of the house—already at the time when this was written by him—already in the year     —was this controul    entirely lost this said—this disastrous truth proclaimed—and this said—by whom by an adversary—a hostilely partial adversary no but by a most faithful zealously attached universally respected and not too sparingly rewarded howsoever richly deserving—servant—in what way too—in the way of speech spoken—spoken in the heat of debate and without time for reflection no but in a cool didactic and written treatise the result of the viginti annorum lucubrationes—the twenty years lucubrations he had just been speaking of—and this republished without alteration in a second edition after the opportunity taken of receiving any objections could any objections have been made to what he had thus been saying in the first if then even at that time—even in     —even before the pandoras box was opened upon it which was opened by pitt the second and now again and with additions reopened upon it—if even then the constitution was subverted in what sort of plight is it now but if the subversion—so full of horror in the eyes of mr speaker had at the very time when he was thus giving expression to these horrors already taken place—the subversion of such a subversion—is it not restitution is it not among the objects which by every safe and legal means every true lover of his country ought to contribute his utmost endeavours to the accomplishment of when subversion is the calamity that has taken place what better can happen to it than to be subverted—when captivity was the calamity that had taken place what better could have happened to it than to be led captive by a stronger suppose a weaker man set with his feet where his head should be what better could happen to him than to find himself set on his legs again of the declaration made by honourable house of the forced abdication of james the second the day is no secret of the declaration voluntarily made by the same honourable house of its own voluntary abdication as above the day is not more dubious thursday the  0th of may     —there it is—commons journals—report that day from committee appointed to consider of the most proper methods to enforce a more early and constant attendance of the members upon the service of the house    resolutions five in number whereof three and three alone on the subject of constancy—meaning of course on the part of every one as well as of every other of the members of these three—all of them together had they been carried into effect inadequate—the first and third put aside the only one agreed to never acted upon—never from that time till the present viz that no member do absent himself from the service of the house without special leave of the house† thus in the opinion of this faithful servant but not less intrepid and still unquestioned censor of the house—the constitution had even then been subverted—and in the disorder mentioned by him—viz nonattendance—in this free and generally prevailing abdication—the subversion had its cause well then in this same opinion this cause—was it of the number of those which are capable of being removed not it indeed for with the following note do these observations of his conclude—it appears from the report of may      how inadequate every measure has been that has been hitherto proposed to prevent the evil nothing can correct it entirely but a sincere desire in the members themselves to attend to that duty for which they were elected and sent to parliament nothing says he can correct it but—what a sort of desire the existence of which to any such extent as would be necessary would be an effect without a cause for in the situation in question of any such desire so long as man is man the existence has been shown to be impossible now of this dereliction of duty—this most deliberately determined—most perseveringly     maintained and still maintained—dereliction of duty—of acknowledged duty—is either the existence or the cause or the intended perpetuity open to dispute the existence you see it in the journals—the cause of it is it not in the nonexistence of due dependence coupled with the existence of that undue dependence which is the effect of it—the perpetuity is it not secured to the disorder by the nature of its cause this so determinately perpetual dereliction of acknowledged duty—does it not of itself afford an indisputable demand for a remedy from without by which the determination shall be put an end to—for a remedy by which the cause will be removed—for the only remedy by which in the very nature of the case it ever can be removed section xv representatives—impermanence of their situation—its importance—objections—their groundlessness on this part of the field into a comparatively small compass must be compressed whatever can here be said by the joint pressure of time and space no inconsiderable quantity of matter that had been collected for the purpose of this section has for the present at least of necessity been extruded utility and usage to one or other of these heads may be referred whatsoever matter can here find room for the reception of it utility as deducible from the unquestionable principles of human nature as manifested by universal experience usage a source of argument the demand for which will be seen to arise—partly out of the connexion it has with utility through the medium of experience partly out of the means of defence it will be seen to afford against adverse prejudices and fallacies i first as to utility in the plan itself from impermanence in general—and in the way of example from annuality in particular—four advantages—beneficial consequences—uses in a word—are stated as resulting whereof three having more particular respect to appropriate probity the fourth to appropriate intellectual aptitude and appropriate active talent i consider in the first place the case of each member taken individually   in the first place the shorter the term he has in his seat—the nearer in cases of imputed misconduct the term at which any mischief produced by such misconduct may be made to cease—and in the way of example to others the more impressive the sort of punishment involved in a removal produced by such a cause†   in the next place by lessening by the amount of the difference in the length of the term in the two opposite cases the inducement which a candidate could have to launch out into expenses too great for his circumstances—lessening thereby the danger of his coming into the house in a venal state   next consider the case of the whole house taken in the aggregate   the smaller the length given to that     service the smaller the length of sinister service which a corruptlydisposed member will have to sell the smaller consequently the length which it will be in the power of c—rgeneral and co to purchase   the greater the number of the parcels into which the present length of service is broken down the greater the number of those lengths of service which for the continuance of a given length of corrupt service at the hands of a majority of the members c—rgeneral and co will have to purchase and thence the greater the chance that the aggregate number of the masses of the matter of corruption at his disposal will prove insufficient for that pernicious purpose   of the utility of the proposed transitoriness in the character of a security for appropriate intellectual aptitude and appropriate active talent—the proof it is imagined will not be much in danger either of experiencing denial or so much as escaping spontaneous notice by discourses indicative of ignorance or intellectual weakness—by constant silence and inactivity—by absentation or slackness of attendance—by any one or more of these features of unfitness—in the instance of every member in which they respectively have place may his inaptitude absolute or comparative be betrayed and indication given of it to his constituents in this way partly by original exclusion produced by selfconscious inaptitude without trial—partly by subsequent exclusion produced after and by trial—produced in a word by the light of experience—may the house be cleared—cleared not as now of those natural and unpaid and necessary—yet alas how insufficient—guardians to its aptitude in all shapes and more especially to its probity—those constituents in whose faces it so frequently and always so needlessly shuts its door under the name of strangers—and whom as such it clears itself of as the phrase is in the character of incumbrances and nuisances—but of the multitudes of those real incumbrances and nuisances with which in the situation of members it is under the existing system to so great a degree infested viz emptyheaded idlers who in default of all other means of consuming time drop in now and then—and to save themselves from the trouble of thinking throw themselves into the everextended arms of c—rgeneral and co—thus giving their support to misrule—saying and perhaps fancying they are supporting government thus and even without need of being purchased contributing to the formation of the wasteandcorruptionandoppressionproducing majority and at the same time by the amount of what might have been their share of the spoil leaving undiminished and by so much the larger in the hands of the archcorruptionist the mass of the matter of corruption—in readiness to be employed in the purchase of such other of the members in whose instance on the one hand the demand for the matter of corruption is more importunate on the other hand the return they are capable of making for it in the shape of pernicious service more valuable under the existing system not only has c—rgeneral no interest—no positive interest—in the largeness of the number of members endowed with a more than ordinary share in these accomplishments but on the contrary he has a positive interest in the smallness of that number in addition to those measures which for keeping the machine from falling to pieces must be carried into effect the object he has to accomplish is—the carrying into effect—in number extent and value to the greatest extent practicable—such others as shall in the highest degree be conducive to the advancement of his separate interest now for this purpose true it is—that in a limited number men provided in the highest degree with these endowments—as well as at the same time prepared at all times to make the requisite sacrifice in the article of probity—are on the occasion of the use made of them—necessary at the same time for speech motion and occasional penmanship suppose this number whatever it be completed—this done every individual above this number is a nuisance the greater the value of his talents the higher are his pretensions raised the higher his pretensions raised—and the greater the danger lest by inadequacy of the quantity of the matter of corruption at command he should be disappointed and by discouragement driven to the other side and moreover the greater the number of these men of pretension the greater the danger lest by the quantity of time respectively employed by them in the display of their respective pretensions a greater quantity on the whole might be consumed than any demand he might have for delay on the score explained in the section on nonattendance could require in which case they would be proportionable sufferers—sufferers and to no use—in respect of the interest of the pillow annuality of election forsooth a wild—a visionary arrangement wild and visionary when within the view of those by whom it is thus denominated stands the vast metropolis—its population little less than the tenth part of all england—the great seat and example of representative democracy—in which for so many centuries past the vision has been realized realized and all the time with such illustrious good effect and without the shadow of inconvenience but here perhaps lest argument should be altogether wanting comes a sudden turn to the opposite side and now with an air     of triumph at the bottom of this potential impermanence is shown eventual permanence permanence—which should it ever be actual will be excessive cases may be shown it has been said—cases in which under annuality of election the same person has been seated for life here then it has been added where mutation has been the object thus aimed at not mutation but perpetuity has been the result be it so but by this result what is it that is proved that the potential impermanence is a bad arrangement by no means but rather that it is a good one why because under this instrument of good discippline so good has been the behaviour of the functionary that no fault has been to be found in him no hope of supplanting him conceived by anybody else and after all in the particular instance here in question—in the common council chosen by the liverymen of the city of london—of this potential impermanence is it so clear that any actual permanence in such sort and degree as to have become productive of mischief in any assignable shape has frequently if ever been the result in what character is it that impermanence is meant to be established—in that of an end an independent end no surely but in the mere character of a means—a means leading to an ulterior result in the character of an end leading in a word to good behaviour the result of appropriate aptitude in all shapes on the part of the functionary well then suppose the end fulfilled what signifies it how matters stand with regard to the means what from the circumstance of a mans being by the free suffrage of the undisputedly proper judges of his conduct repeatedly and uninterruptedly—each time by the light of an additional body of experience—pronounced fit for his trust—from this circumstance standing as it does alone will you infer him to be unfit grant that in some situations so it may be that by nothing better than mere negative merit on the one part and on the other part by the force of habit—by the property which habit has of superseding reflection—so it might happen that a man of inferior merit might by his continuance in the situation put an exclusion upon a man of positive and superior merit—still in a situation such as this—a situation covered with a lustre of which in its present sordid state it is not in the nature of the representation to afford an example—small surely is the danger but that by a swarm of competitors—no expense having place by the terror of which any man can be excluded—the attention of the electors will be sufficiently called and pointed to the probable degree of comparative aptitude on the part of the provisionally accepted object of their choice but should the case prove otherwise—or even for fear the case should prove otherwise—how easy would it be by a slight amendment to provide that after having without intermission sitten for such or such a number of years a member should for the space of one year—or if so it must be some greater number of years—cease to be eligible—and so toties quoties the argument which from potential impermanence infers probably excessive permanence—in what circumstance shall we find the source of it in great measure not improbably in the sort of paradoxicality that belongs to it and the ingenuity and depth of thought that present themselves as evidenced by it here as elsewhere dig a little way you get a paradox dig a little further you get the solution and exposure of it give to the observation the utmost credit that can be due to it—in the way of practice nothing more would result from it than a suspension—such as that proposed but a sort of misconception than which nothing is more common is—the taking up an observation the result of which supposing it ever so well grounded is but the need of a corresponding amendment to the proposed plan—and then without further thought swelling it out into the shape of a peremptory objection calling for the exclusion of the plan altogether ii next as to the question of usage supposing that from sufficient argument the question of utility has received its answer—and that decision in favour of the proposed impermanence—this being supposed not improperly may it surely be observed that to any such question as that about usage any endeavour to find an answer is but a work of supererogation that for centuries past no such impermanence has had place is altogether notorious to what use then it may be asked bring forward—even supposing it to have had place—an ancient usage which has had for its opposite a more recent usage—a usage bearing date in times more remote from and thence more dissimilar to our own—having for its opposite a usage less remote and less dissimilar to this question may be returned two answers—  one is—that howsoever in the eye of superior reason the argument grounded in utility may be more substantially probative—yet constituted as human nature is—at any rate at the stage beyond which the public mind is not yet advanced in this country—the argument from usage—and in particular from ancient usage—affords a promise of being more efficiently persuasive   another answer is—that on the present occasion the argument from usage may when considered in a certain point of view be seen to come under and in that way to     coincide with and operate in confirmation of the argument from utility against the proposed impermanence objections have been made on the ground of supposed confusion and instability and from words such as these proportioned to the vagueness—to the confusedness—of the ideas attached to them in the minds of those by whom they have been employed hath as usual been the portentousness of the eventual public calamities brought to view by heated passions and excited imaginations in the character of consequences—and the intensity of the confidence with which the eventual arrival of these same calamities has been predicted well then—as to these points such it will be seen as follows is the state of facts age after age—a degree of impermanence superior even to that which is here proposed had place and during all that time of this same impermanence what was the effect—confusion—instability—anything to the designation of which any such words could be employed no—but on the contrary the very result which in the here proposed plan is proposed as the proper end in view or object to be aimed at viz on the part of the representatives of the people dependence where due—dependence on the people thence independence where due—independence as towards the monarch—on the part of the monarch dependence where due dependence on the people—in a word democratic ascendency thus did matters continue until—by the civil wars produced by contested title as between the houses of york and lancaster—by the successive conquests and states of subjection—abject and universal subjection—to which those wars gave birth—by the final triumph of henry vii his almost unexampled rapacity coupled with a degree of frugality altogether unexampled—by the vast and altogether unexampled mass of treasure precipitated from that source into the coffers of his son and successor—by the still more enormous mass of treasure absorbed from the patrimony of the church—from a mass of landed property which so long before as the year      had been computed to amount to onethird part of the whole kingdom—absorbed in a word principally from the dissolved monasteries and at the same time with a correspondent profusion scattered abroad by that furious and sanguinary tyrant—so it was that by the united force of terrific and alluring influence every such sentiment as that of independence as towards the monarch wanted but little of being eradicated from every english breast in regard to the duration coupled with the frequency of parliaments—the following are in general terms the results already obtained from a not as yet quite completed search—now making by a friend on whose accuracy and judgment as well as candour i have a wellgrounded confidence into the several authentic sources of information already published with the addition of others as yet unpublished and some of them as yet unnoticed when the search has been completed i hope and believe it will be laid before the public in all its amplitude— i as to frequency   that from the year         h iii down to the year    0    c i c   the monarch in so far as he could be bound by an act of parliament stood bound to hold a parliament once ayear at the least thus far as to the law   that as to the usage that had place in pursuance of the law from the year         h iii down to the year        r iii beyond which date the search in question has not yet extended—being a period of upwards of two hundred years—small is the number of years in which a parliament does not from the documents appear to have been summoned and in those instances supposing no such summons to have had place the omission may with few or no exceptions be accounted for either by the absence of the monarch in a foreign country france or scotland or by the existence of a civil war in the heart of the kingdom thus much as to frequency ii now as to duration   that in all that time there is but one instance in which the same parliament appears to have continued for and during a portion of time so long as a year and that in that one instance the duration was not so long as thirteen months   that in that time it appears that in a number of instances within the compass of one and the same year two three and even as many as four different parliaments were held so that the clause and oftener if need be was not a mere random anticipation having no ground in experience   that of what is now understood by a prorogation the earliest instance that has been found is one which took place anno   0 —  h iv that in some few instances anterior to that time it appears as if during the christmas or the easter holidays something of an adjournment took place but that in some even of these instances the parliament that met was a fresh parliament fresh writs of summons having in these instances been issued   that however in regard to the question of impermanence—impermanence in any such degree as that indicated by the word annuality—none of these cases of prorogation are material inasmuch as whatsoever may have been the number of these prorogations in no instance does it appear that the same parliament continued in existence so long as a whole     year that one excepted in which the extra duration was not more than a few days speaking of the parliament that was held anno   0    h iv—this observe the authors of the parliamentary history vol i p  0  is the longest parliament we have yet met with—it was continued nearly a year which was an innovation on the ancient constitution taken notice of by several historians as a great blot on this reign—there—honourable gentlemen—behold in those grave and universally respected authors of the parliamentary history—the history so much lauded by the late judge barrington brother of the abovementioned existing bishop—behold in them another set of jacobins to be added by you to dean swift—and to those predecessors of yours who so lately as in the last reign were so near making a majority in favour of annuality—where in their view was the innovation of the body of proof thus promised and already in part afforded so small is the quantity that would suffice to repel—not to say to transfer—the imputation of ignorance and wildness—the charge which with such unfortunate and unfortunately groundless confidence has from so many quarters been thrown out now then when thus it will have been seen that no otherwise than by a course of unquestionable tyranny and misrule was that so much more felicitous though earlier state of government subverted—what is the consequence even that as for the benefit of a race of monarchs a reign of manifest usurpation is regarded as if blotted out of the line of usage—so and with no less propriety for the benefit of a nation may a like usurpation though committed by monarchs yet if committed to the manifest violation of the rights of the nation acknowledged as such by unrepealed laws in the formation of which monarchs have concurred—be considered as blotted out—a felicitous—and in that only rational sense a legitimate—course or line of government—obscured only but not blotted out by an infelicitous and thence an illegitimate one in this way if imagination be to be called in and why it may not with as much propriety be called in and employed in support of instead of in opposition to reason and utility let any one say who thinks himself able—if imagination be to be called in—imagination with its favourite instrument the word right used in a figurative and moral sense that insensibly it may be taken and employed in a legal sense—why should not usage—usage so long continued so extensive and so steady—be regarded as creative of right and that right suspended only in its exercise—suspended and not destroyed—by the intervening interval of wrong if so and supposing the facts to be what they are here stated to be—then so it is that for the claim made to the benefit of short parliaments to the ground of practical and manifest utility—as bottomed upon the relations between interest and interest—may be added the ground of constitutional right usage—is it consigned to disregard utility remains sole arbiter and annuality triumphant usage—is it regarded and consulted right is it considered as created by usage here then to the ground of utility is superadded the ground of right two or three centuries of right followed by two or three centuries of palpable wrong—is it not time—high time—that right should be restored—that subversion should be subverted legitimacy—monarchs legitimacy—does it stand upon ground so substantial in any case—as right—peoples right—in this case in regard to usage considered in the character of a circumstance by which on the field of government it is proposed that conduct should be directed or at any rate influenced—in what character for the purpose of any such application does it require to be considered—in that of a guide by whose course our course as by one sheep that of other sheep ought blindly to be determined determined—and that with a degree of deference more and more implicit the earlier the times—and thence the less experienced in     themselves as well as the more dissimilar to our own—the times in which this usage had place no assuredly but in the character of a source of instruction—of instruction to be derived from an attentive scrutiny into the relations of what nature soever observable as between the circumstances of the past time in question and the circumstances of the present time as a storehouse in which reason may find matter to work upon not as a pillow on which without prejudice to security indolence and imbecility may sleep on and take their rest a point which supposing it true is to be proved is—that in the primeval times in question not only was the degree of impermanence in question in a state of habitual existence—but that it had for its cause for its accompaniment and for its consequence that very state of things—that very democratic ascendency for the reestablishment of which it is here proposed in these latter times assuredly in the development of this proof no great difficulty will be found for what purpose was it that a parliament—including the assembly composed of representatives deputed by the people—in a word a commons house—was wont to be called together by the monarch answer to get money well and if without the trouble of calling together and treating with these deputies he could in his view of the matter have got the money he wanted would he at the same time have subjected himself to all that labour and to the risk of finding it to be—what it sometimes actually proved to be—labour in vain not he indeed that he should have done so is not in human nature well then so often and so long as he was at all this pains to prevail upon the people to supply him with money—so often and so long did he feel himself as towards the people—as towards the great body of the people—in a state of dependency and for centuries together this state of dependency was one uninterrupted state—a state of dependency—not as now as towards a comparatively small confederacy of men—the majority of them pretending and falsely pretending to be representatives freely chosen by the great body of the people and themselves acting in a state of corrupt dependency under himself well—this then and nothing more is what has been meant as above by democratic ascendency the sort and degree of democratic ascendency for the establishment of which it is that the system of arrangement here proposed under the name of radical parliamentary reform is contended for the establishment—for which the word reestablishment will it is hoped be seen to be the no less apposite appellative with relation to these our times to both those other portions of time the appellation of old times belongs without dispute the appellation of good old times—if to either to which then shall it be given shall it be to those later times when—sometimes for the gratification of the everlastingly conjunct and mutually inflaming and inflamed appetites—thirst for money and thirst for power—oppression was constant universal and unchecked—waste always unchecked and except in those reigns in which frugality was stained by oppression raging—and corruption if less abundant than at present rendered so no otherwise than by its being in respect of the demand for it in so great a degree superseded by the more surely efficient and to a tyrant hand the so much more pleasant instrument—viz terrorism shall it not rather be to those old times in which due dependence was so firmly established in both its indispensable branches—dependence of the monarch on the peoples representatives—dependence of the peoples representatives on the people their constituents due dependence everywhere corruption nowhere—unchecked waste unchecked oppression nowhere section xvi moderate reform—its arrangements—their inadequacy comprised or comprisable under the denomination of moderate reform what are the arrangements which at different times have been proposed the inadequacy and little less than uselessness of them even on the supposition of their being all of them brought forward together and comprised in one proposal and carried into effect— much more the inadequacy of them taken singly or in any number less than the whole— such are the subtopics destined for consideration in the present section supposing moderate reform in its most perfect shape thus inadequate—supposing radical reform as hereinabove described the only remedy that presents any tolerable chance of proving adequate—whence happens it that by a set of men professing themselves friends of the people and as such enemies     to corruption—to corruption—the radical disease for which reform has all along been looked to in the character of the only remedy—whence comes it that by these men the adequate remedy has all along been rejected—the inadequate one if any embraced and brought forward for a solution of this problem the source or principle referred to and employed will be the state of interests but to show in what particular way in the case here in question the state of interests thus operates—operates in such manner as to oppose an insuperable bar to every proposition for adequate reform from such a quarter will be the business of the ensuing section for a general conception of the aggregate mass of the distinguishable arrangements capable of presenting a title to a place in the system distinguished by the appellation of the moderate reform system—take in the first place the following analytical table of the several proposals for parliamentary reform brought forward in parliament since the commencement of the present reign—moderate and radical taken together— total number of the occasions on which reform has been advocated in parliament    deduct number of occasions on which no specific proposition has been brought forward†   remains the number of the occasions in—each of which specific propositions one or more have been brought forward    deduct number of the occasions on which the species of reform proposed has been radical‡   remains for the number of occasions on—which the species of reform proposed has been of the moderate cast  0 appendix—no            0            ∥ † app

formed anno      principally of whig members under the name of the friends of the people and reprinted i understand by mr evans in his parliamentary reform pamphlet just published on these occasions the following are the heads to which the several proposed arrangements that have been brought forward have presented themselves as referable— i proposed arrangements applying to the situation of elector i arrangements giving extension to the electoral franchise or right of suffrage and thus making advances more or less considerable towards virtual universal suffrage   in the case of a county seat admitting copyholders nos          in the case of a county seat admitting leaseholders no      in the case of the proposed number of additional borough seats or in all borough seats admitting householders at large nos        ii proposed arrangements applying to the situation of representative ii—giving increase to the number of seats regarded as not venal viz  —  county seats nos              —  countydivision or territorialdistrict seats viz seats formed by division of counties into such districts nos           —  populous town seats nos           iii—applying diminution to the number of seats regarded as venal viz  —  suppression without compensation proposed nos               —  suppression with compensation proposed no   iv—excluding from all seats a part—but a part only and that an indeterminate one—of the number of the members regarded as sold to the c—rgeneral by the circumstance of their holding situations of profit from which they are removable by him at pleasure   to the at present established septennial duration of the power conferred by a seat substituting triennial no    iii proposed arrangements applying to both situations or rather to that of elector and that of candidate v—diminishing the expenses and other inconveniences incident to elections  0—  by causing the poll to be taken in districts of small extent carved out of the electoral districts say votingdistricts or subdistricts nos            —  by causing the poll to be taken for all places on one and the same day nos         —  by inhibiting every elector from giving his vote in more places than one no        these six clusters of arrangements—consider them now in their respective bearings upon the state and condition of the two situations in question viz that of elector and that of representative including in the latter case that of candidate or proposed candidate i as to that of electors in the account given of radical reform taken according to the present edition of it see §   §   four expedients or arrangements were stated as essentially necessary and of the goodness of their title to that character some presumption it is hoped afforded these are—  virtual universality of suffrage   practical equality of suffrage—i e practical equality in respect of the quantum of the influence exercised by the several electors in virtue of their respective suffrages   freedom of suffrage   thence as an indispensable instrument of freedom inviolable secresy of suffrage consideration had of their mutual relation and relative importance with as much perhaps if not with greater propriety—this order might have been changed or even reversed   first then as to secresy of suffrage upon the effect given to the principle here in question depends as hath been so often observed freedom of suffrage—freedom viz in both its contrasted modes—freedom as against terrorism and freedom as against bribery in no individual scheme of reform capable of being designated by the generic term moderate reform is any such proposition in favour of secresy of suffrage to be found   consequently no such security as is afforded by that principle against nonfreedom alias spuriousness of suffrage in whichsoever of those two modes it is considered   as to virtual universality of suffrage originally by those advocates for reform who in      and      acted in a society under the title of the friends of the people—in the instances of what has hereinabove been designated by the name of the householder plan no inconsiderable advance was made but to the county seats it was not proposed that this extension should be applied and of the existing county seats it was proposed anno      that from    the number should be increased to    —increased by    a little more than a fourth moreover the leader of that eminently useful association having since put from him an arrangement so effectual—scarcely does it seem at present entitled to be numbered among the arrangements belonging to moderate reform from the system of moderate reform it seems to have been as it were expelled and driven for refuge into that of radical reform be this as it may—to the giving force and effect to the universal interest in the struggle which it has to maintain against all partial interests in general—and in particular against the hitherto irresistible separate and sinister interest of c—rgeneral and co—the efficiency of virtual universality would it has been shown §     be altogether precarious—without the assistance of freedom and thence of secresy of suffrage hence it is that without that shield to freedom—by whatsoever plan—whether the abovementioned householderplan or any other any advance were made towards virtual universality of suffrage—it would be matter of some uncertainty whether with reference to the universal interest service or disservice would be the effect of it   lastly as to practical equality of suffrage reference had to the existing state of things—towards the sort of equality here in question an advance—nor that an inconsiderable one—would be made by virtual universality of suffrage—on the supposition that full effect would be given to virtual universality even supposing that were it possible no separate attention to practical equality would be paid still however without such separate attention the most effectual provision that on that supposition could be made for practical equality would remain in a state very far from complete take for example new sarum and gatton by the application of the principle of virtual universality to those two boroughs respectively—those same two boroughs still continuing to fill each of them a parliamentary seat—the contrast which the state of those two seats of snug proprietorship would in respect of equality as between the effect of one right of suffrage and another—the contrast which the state of those two seats of snug proprietorship     would form with the state of yorkshire for example—would be no less striking than at present in any allcomprehensive advance made towards this species of equalization would evidently be included the breaking down of the several counties each into two or more less extensive electoral districts in no edition of moderate reform have i been able to observe any such decomposition advocated by mr brand—whose edition together with that which was once earl greys may be stated as being the two by which the advances made towards radical reform were most extensive—this decomposition is indeed distinctly brought to view—but no less distinctly is an exclusion put upon it but in the section §  0 in which bribery and terrorism are brought together and confronted—it has been shown how as well by the votecompelling as by the competitionexcluding operation of it the seductive force of terrorism is increased increased by and in proportion to the geographical extent possessed by an electoral district—in proportion to remoteness from the pollbook—expense and consumption of time by journeys and demurrage will have been seen to be increased thence to a proportionable extent exclusion put upon such electors in whose instance the repelling force of those inconveniences is not overcome by the compelling force of terrorism oppression and spuriousness in the case of all those in whose instance to the pressure produced by the expense and labour of the journey is added the obligation of contributing by their suffrages to the advancement of a candidate to whose advancement they are absolutely or comparatively averse out of the six abovestated clusters of proposed arrangements proposed by moderate reform—such then is the inefficiency of the three first—viz   those having for their object or professed object the giving extension to the electoral franchise   those having for their object or professed object the giving increase to the number of seats regarded as not venal   those having for their object or professed object the diminution in the number of seats regarded as venal and in these three groups will be found comprised all those which have immediate relation to the situation of elector ii next as to what regards the situation of the representative body and its members in relation to this part of the election system three in number are the arrangements which in the present edition of radical reform   0 are proposed as so many essential arrangements necessary to the establishing in that quarter the union of due independence with due dependence viz   exclusion of placemen from the right of voting leaving them always in possession of the right of speech and motion   measures such as shall be necessary for the securing on the part of each member a constant and punctual attendance on the service of the house   impermanence of the situations respectively occupied by the members in virtue of their respective seats viz that degree of impermanence which corresponds to and is produced by the annual recurrence of the election process observe on this occasion the object and use of these several proposed arrangements   by the first of them a correspondent degree of independence as towards c—rgeneral is produced on the part of the members individually considered   by the second of them—besides the additional sureties afforded for intellectual aptitude and active talent—a remedy in the nature of a check is provided provided against that disorder which in addition to the improbity it gives birth and assistance to on the part of members individually considered—gives birth and support to the various devices by which c—rgeneral and co contrive to give increase to the aggregate of the effect produced by the aggregate mass of the matter of corruption in their hands viz by keeping out of the house on the several particular occasions a number more or less considerable of the members by whom if present a check more or less efficacious might be opposed to their particular measures   the third has for its object—the giving the necessary strength to those ties by which the dependence of representatives on their constituents is established arrangements belonging to the general head in question three the two first for due independence the third for due dependence observe now what appears to be the habitude of moderate reform as towards these several lastmentioned proposed arrangements   in relation to the first it seems rather difficult to say whether in what has been proposed as above moderate reform considered in its present state ought or ought not to be considered as taking any part for the purpose of shutting the door of the house against actual corruptioneaters—persons actually sitting with the bread of corruption in their mouths—a proposition as above noticed viz in §    was indeed in one instance anno    0 brought forward but by the honourable gentleman mr brand by whom on that occasion it was brought forward it was on the next occasion viz anno      abandoned on this occasion supposing its title to a place in the budget of moderate reform admitted—a simple reference to what in §    has been said on the subject of its inadequateness may here suffice by the place it leaves to the domini among the corruptioneaters—while the acknowledged fures are excluded—the principle instead of being reprobated is approved and confirmed   as to the second point viz attendance of the disorder produced by the violation of this duty—the fulfilment of which forms a necessary preliminary to the performance of every other—in no one of all the several proposals included in the moderate reform system are any symptoms to be found indicative of any the slightest glance as having ever been directed towards this object to the disorder itself—nor consequently to any arrangement considered as presenting the prospect of a remedy on this subject moderate reform in every one of its editions maintains the most completely uninterrupted silence   as to the third point viz impermanence impermanence of the situation of representative as constituted by annuality of election as to this matter for the purpose of reducing to its minimum the length of the term and thence raising to a corresponding maximum the degree of due dependence—of dependence on the part of each representative as toward his constituents—under radical reform the comparatively short time indicated by the word annuality is insisted upon as above viz the reduction of the at present established long term indicated by the word septenniality to the dimensions of this short term on the other hand on the occasion of the reduction which in some degree or other both editions of particular reform concur in proposing—moderate reform insists at stopping at the stage indicated by the word trienniality triennial parliaments it admits of and calls for against annual parliaments it insists on shutting the door that in comparison of annuality the remedy indicated by trienniality is inadequate—and in what respects and degrees it is so—are questions the answers to which may afford matter for a separate section remain two proposed arrangements the utility of which as far as they go is here admitted but in relation to which the doubt is—whether having as far as appears been deserted by the men who at one time were their advocates and who still continue to belong to the denomination of reformists—viz moderate reformists—they can with propriety be at present regarded as having a place in the moderate reform system whether from having in former days been sound practical and necessary they may not in the eyes     of existing moderation have become wild and visionary these are—  the householder plan as above mentioned an article of the number of those which apply more especially to the situation of electors this as far as it goes is an advance made towards virtually universal suffrage and in that character has been mentioned as an arrangement which—though not completely adequate—might by radical reformists for the present at any rate be acceded to without much reluctance but by a radical reformist it could not be refused to any electoral district—to any part of the population whereas by no moderate reformist by whom it has ever been advocated does it appear that the application of it has been proposed—any further than to such town electoral districts as upon his plan were proposed to be established at any rate to some of the counties in their capacity of electoral districts lastly as to the plan for exclusion or reduction of the expense delay vexation and disorder at present attendant on or incident to the electionprocess—viz   voting by districts   carrying on the process in all places on the same day   arrangements to prevent the same person from giving his vote in or for places more than one neither of the second nor of the third of these proposed arrangements do i find any mention in my own plan drawn up anno   0  as herein printed regarding at that time their importance as being—howsoever in an absolute view considerable—inferior in a comparative sense viz as compared with the others herein brought to view—it has never yet happened to me to apply to either of them any considerable portion of attention useful and unexceptionable in so far as practicable—such is the character in which they have on each occasion presented themselves to a cursory glance in regard to voting by districts—in the ensuing plan of radical reform it may be seen presented in a shape rather more determinate it is believed than in any of the moderate reform plans nor in any one of them does it seem to present itself in a form sufficiently determinate for contrast and discussion section xvii trienniality inadequate—annuality necessary comes now what remains to be said on the subject of impermanence the conflict is between annuality of election and trienniality i compare then the two degrees of impermanence—in the first place with a view to appropriate probity   in the event of misconduct the remedy is by a better choice in the case of annuality behold here promptitude maximized in the case of trienniality degree of promptitude no more than onethird of what it is in the other case   so in respect of discontinuance of choice or in one word removal considered in the character of punishment operating in the way of example to others   in respect of expense whence in case of excess and consequent pressure temptation to venality in the case of annuality behold here the temptation to expense minimized in the case of trienniality the temptation thrice as great n b by the secresy of suffrage here proposed as an arrangement essential to the utility of radical reform the temptation to expense being altogether it is believed taken away—if this be admitted the advantage attached to annuality on this score will as to a considerable portion of it be to be left out of the account under annuality for the purpose of corruptionhunting scarcely would it be worth the while of a man deficient in probity to offer himself a second time to choice thereby exposing his character to scrutiny at any rate small as above is the price which c—rgeneral would be at the same time able and willing to give to him—prompt the time at which his power of doing mischief might be put to an end     under trienniality three years is the term for which every man may sell himself to anybody—three years the term for which his service may be bought by c—rgeneral—three years the time given to him to remain in a complete state of independence as towards constituents thence in a state of complete dependence and mischievous obsequiousness as at present as towards his purchaser trampling on his duty—doing the work of political uncleanness with greediness during the whole of the two first years with a part more or less considerable of the last—just at the close of the term—adequate active talent being supposed to be in his possession—by some dashing and momentary display in the exercise of the art of popularityhunting the corruptionhunter may have promised himself—and perhaps not altogether without success—the satisfaction of thus atoning for his past misconduct in the eyes of a neverwithsufficientuniversalityorconstancyattentive and thence for ever too indulgent people even under a system of radical reform—of reform in all other particulars such as here proposed—in all other particulars suppose perfect—such in here and there an instance may in this particular be the result of an unfortunate choice once made but in other particulars—for want of this or that other of the features essential to completely efficient reform—whether it be virtual universality of suffrage practical equality in respect of the effect of the right of suffrage or secresy and thence freedom of suffrage—suppose the system so constructed as that it shall be in the power of any individual to secure to himself the perpetual command of a seat—on this supposition—if by indolence by unpopularity or by any other cause it should happen to him to have become disinclined to occupy the seat in his own person any longer—there remains the seat which he may find himself in a condition to give or sell to this or that other honourable by whom the like pernicious use may be made of it and so—parliament after parliament—so long as the seat continues in his hands exactly in this case would the representation continue to be—supposing that mode of moderate reform adopted of which the reduction of septenniality to trienniality is the principal if not the only feature ii next as to appropriate intellectual aptitude and active talent in the case of annuality—in the event of deficiency—absolute or comparative—in respect of these endowments—both or either of them—in the case of annuality behold here as above promptitude of the remedy maximized in the case of trienniality promptitude no more than onethird here then is a three years term—during which a man whose appropriate talents are all of them with or without his probity either in his acres or his purse may fill a seat with useless matter as at present—matter at best useless and naturally prone to become worse than useless for generally speaking—though alas in one way exceptions are not altogether wanting—the more destitute a man is of natural dignity of character—of natural title to estimation and respect—the stronger his inducement to sell himself to c—rgeneral—purchasing in exchange factitious dignity in the shape of baronetcy or ribbon—for self or for relative friend or dependent in any one of those or of some other more substantial shapes and howsoever for no more than a single vote with whatsoever constancy and punctuality repeated the least valuable of these implements may be deemed too great a price—yet if by one such article bestowed upon one individual seats more than one should be to be commanded the bargain may here and there be by both parties found a convenient one referable to this head comes now an objection ascribed to mr brand under annuality the term not long enough for gaining the requisite stock of experience under trienniality the term long enough answer   in this respect during the whole of the first year annuality and trienniality are exactly upon a par under annuality—in the election of the second year every representative who has served the first year will in respect of presumable aptitude have in this respect the advantage of every candidate or proposed candidate who has not as yet served and by this consideration in default of determinate considerations pleading on the other side it seems natural that the choice of the electors should be determined but by the bye in either case of what avail is opportunity of acquiring aptitude any further than as the opportunity is improved and under the existing system unless it be on the part of a dozen or two where is the motive see above in various places and what accordingly the disposition and the habit see the section on attendance   the idea of detaching speech and motion on the one hand from vote on the other and by that means securing even on the part of the ministerial side a supply so much more to be depended upon than at present of appropriate aptitude in the shape of active talent—this idea not having entered into the design nor perhaps into the conception of the honourable gentleman—on this supposition     the comparative smallness of the quantum of intellectual aptitude possessed by such of the members as have votes will not have presented itself to his view on the supposition of radical reform the men for whose decision the arguments on both sides are presented will be a set of men who have no interest in a wrong decision and in default of selfformed judgment the opinion from which derivative judgment will in their instance be derived will in that state of things wherever in the balance of reason and argument the scales hang tolerably even be most naturally the opinion delivered by the members of administration—by those members to whom not only speech but motion is proposed to be so extensively and uniformly secured in the imputation meant to be conveyed by the words wild and visionary and so forth—for by honourable gentlemen the charge of finding sense for their eloquence has along with so many other burthens been left to us of the swinish multitude—in the number of these conjecturable imputations on this occasion likewise are we to place the charge of tendency to produce disorder but if to parliamentary elections of any sort a charge of this sort attaches it must assuredly be to elections of that sort which would have place under the system of virtually universal suffrage under that head see §   the proof it is hoped will be found tolerably sufficient that in no instance under that system of mischief—in any of the shapes in which the term disorder is ever employed for giving expression to it—would there be any reasonable ground for apprehension but if not even on the supposition that the widest possible extent were given to the right of suffrage still less on the supposition of any less narrow extent and if not in any one year then not in three successive elections for three successive years any more than in one such election having place in the first of these same three years if in either case—viz in case of annuality or in case of trienniality—under radical reform—or even to go no farther under virtually universal suffrage—tendency to disorder     were worth a thought—rather on the case of trienniality than on the case of annuality should the thought be bestowed why for this plain reason—because the longer the term in the seat the greater the value of the seat the greater the value of the seat the stronger the incitement in both situations—that of candidate and that of elector the stronger the excitement the greater the temptation to disorder in every shape on this occasion likewise if it be worth while look once more to experience during the ancient period above mentioned while parliaments were changed not merely every year but oftener—from impermanence even when carried to that degree—in any such shape as those which are included under the head of disorder—in what instances does inconvenience appear to have ever had place nay but it may be said no wonder during all that period parliamentary service was a service of burthen—not as now of profit the object was not to get into it but to keep out of it answer yes accidentally but not uniformly especially considering that in those days the servants were paid for the service and that by the proper hands—their masters and as to disinelination it was unless by accident disinclination—not on the part of servants as toward the service—burthen and pay together—but on the part of the masters as towards the expense of paying for it as to the statute of henry the sixth though by it great concourse is proved—great concourse the state of things competition the probable cause of it—disorder instead of being proved is disproved well if this ancient experience will not suffice—and small indeed to the present purpose must be confessed to be its value—look to ancient and modern experience combined in one—linked together in a long and uninterrupted chain having for its last link present time look to the metropolis—look to the city of london—look to the common council—electors the whole body of the liverymen in number several thousands—elections annual—districts in which the votes are taken subdistricts in what shape was disorder ever seen here nay but says the adversary this sample of yours is not a fair one your universalsuffrage men—or even your householders—speak of them in the same breath with the london liverymen men who are not only householders but such substantial householders i answer not in the poorest classes any more than in the richest will disorder in any shape have place where no cause of disorder in any shape has place and by the means so often brought to view every imaginable cause of disorder has been shown to be removed even in the present disastrous times—under the pressure of such unexampled cause of irritation—in the vain hope of obtaining mercy and relief at the hands of their oppressors—what multitudes have we not seen collected together—multitudes in ten times the number that would ever be present at any such elections as those here in question—and yet—to the sad disappointment of those tyrants by whom disorder below is so eagerly looked for as a pretence for and thence an instrument of tyranny above—not a spark of disorder visible will not that suffice look then to westminster—number of inhabitants    0   number of electors at least   000 voters not distributed among subdistricts but driven all together—all into one and the same pollbooth compared with the case of annuality existing interests rendered the more stimulating by the superior value of the object of competition and by the rareness of its recurrence freer from disorder in every shape is it possible for election to be than see p     in this great city—its population part and parcel of the contiguous population of more than a million—it has been for these ten years past well to secure and for ever the same undisturbed tranquility all over the three kingdoms—nothing on the part of honourable house but the will—so it be but sincere—is necessary on the ground of general principles were the advantages on the side of annuality ever so slight—or even altogether wanting—especially when it is considered that under the original system not only was it actually established but the good effects of it were even at that time so manifest and undeniable—on this ground ere with any colour of reason or pretence or any hope of the reputation of sincerity trienniality can continue to be set up in preference to it can it be otherwise than that some grounds—some specific and determinate grounds—must in support of such alleged preference be produced towards the close of the reign of charles the first    c i c   at the opening of the long parliament—the so often repeated and so long observed engagement for the annual holding of fresh parliaments having been so long and so continually violated as to have become in mens conceptions obsolete—trienniality was for the first time established by law instead of it trienniality and not annuality why because at the commencement of the struggle parliament did not feel itself strong enough to exact anything more to exact the restoration of the original and so thoroughly approved but unhappily so long despaired of state of things in charles the seconds time    c ii c   the legitimacy and despotism which led to the revolution having for four years been reseated on the throne—the provisions     extorted from the piety of the father being found too efficient were repealed these repealed others the merit of which consisted in their inefficiency substituted in williams time   w and m c   the inefficiency of the provisions dictated by charles the second having been so fully and so superfluously proved by experience others less inefficient were substituted here too however instead of being annual the duration was made triennial triennial why because by this time the value of a seat to the occupant was pretty fully understood and for the giving to it the utmost duration and thence the utmost value which at that time had ever presented itself as endurable the two abovementioned precedents furnished honourable gentlemen—the honourable gentlemen of those days—with a pretence comes the new dynasty of the gwelfs and now one of the first acts of the first of them   g i c   was to poison the constitution of the country of that country the voice of which had called him to the throne most probably the scheme was in the greater degree if not exclusively the scheme of the honourables among his advisers the benefit to them being as manifest as to the illadvised monarch it was problematical their constituents had seated them for three years they seated themselves for four years more an analogous retaliation would have been another gunpowder plot—not contrived only but executed how long shall principals continue bound by chains of iron—trustees by nothing but cobwebs according to these men to such a degree was the nation adverse to the new king—all the official establishment added to all the army and the majority of the peerage would not without the continued service of these honourables have sufficed for his support well then if it was so—not that it was so—what was he better than an usurper fenced about by this guard of petty tyrants the monarch was no usurper he was fairly seated not so honourable gentlemen what shall we say of their successors—successors seated by the original sin of their forefathers—seated by the same breach of trust remains one short observation by which much sad matter is brought to view in the situation in question only in proportion as it contributes to strengthen the ties of their dependence is impermanence and thence annuality in comparison of trienniality of any use only therefore in the case and to the extent of that portion of the whole population of honourable house who are in any degree dependent for their seats on the good opinion of the persons styled their constituents and how small that minority is which is composed of the persons whose presence is not a nuisance and an insult to the whole people of the united empire let them say to whose industry the melancholy secret has been revealed before the irish union anno      according to the

exclusion of radical tories—whigs—peoples men a sort of paradox—a sort of riddle—here presents itself behold it in the following train of conflicting circumstances of the function of the members of the commons house as such—representatives sent or supposed to be sent by the body of the people to officiate in the character of their trustees and agents sole use the securing on the part of the servants of the monarch a due dependence on the will—on the supposition that the will will be governed by the interest—of the whole body of the people seductive influence of the monarch and his servants a bar to that use removal of this bar the proper object of every change that under any such name as that of parliamentary reform can be proposed the mode of reform called radical as above explained—this the only change by which that removal can be effected moderate reform a change altogether inadequate such the state of things which not to speak of other eyes to the eyes of the set of men in question has been all along lying open now as to the line of conduct pursued by them under and in relation to this same state of things among the professed advocates for parliamentary reform on the part of the confederacy of leading men styling themselves for at the formation of the confederacy thus they actually did style themselves—styling themselves friends of the people—and at that time by one great preliminary service of unspeakable use really acting as such—on the part of these men and in particular     on the part of such of them as are or have been in possession of seats in that same house a declared hostility towards every adequate plan of reform—an exclusive preference given to that altogether inadequate one under the state of things thus described—in the repugnancy between profession and practice—professions so universally kept up by so vast a body composed of men of the most respectable characters in the highest walks of life—in this repugnancy—in this sort of inconsistency—lies the riddle here then we have the riddle in the state of interests on the part of the body of men in question—in this source and no other—will the solution of this riddle by any person whose curiosity may happen to have sent him in quest of it be to be found follow now the subtopics under which the matter of this section will be found— i sole clew to political conduct interest ii tories—whigs—peoples men—general coincidence of interests as between whigs and tories iii particular points of radical and efficient reform by which the joint interests would be affected iv reforms to which they would be equally irreconcilable though contributing nothing to democratic ascendency v country gentlemen—opposition of their particular interests to efficient reform and thereby to the universal interests vi options—compromises—experiments—postponements vii uses of this exposure i sole clew to political conduct interest in this public situation or in any other be the individual who he may have you any such wish as that of possessing either a clew to his conduct in time past or a means of foreknowing his conduct in time future look to the situation he is in in respect of interest have you any such wish in regard to an aggregate body look still to interests—look to the situation which the whole or the majority of that body are in in respect of interest in the case of an individual unknown it is your only clew in the case of a body—meaning the governing part of it—except in so far as by accident the view taken by it of its interests may have been rendered erroneous by weakness—it is a sure one yes in this one short phrase the state of interests every man has at hand a glass in which—when set up in the field of morals—and more particularly in that compartment of it which embraces politics—any man who is not afraid of seeing things as they are may at all times see what it will not at all times be equally agreeable to him to see where the object or objects which it presents to his view have something more or less of unpleasantness in them—where the effect of them is to check the vivacity of that swaggering and strutting pace which when in their vibrations before a lookingglass pride and vanity are so apt to assume—nothing is more natural than that the eyes should have a tendency to close themselves but on this occasion let a mans eyes be closed by him ever so fast in those same eyes at which it began will the compression terminate it will not communicate itself to any other in the case of a man by whom a public situation in any way efficient is occupied—the correctness of the conception which he himself has of what is passing and about to pass in his own mind—and in particular of the springs of action by which his own conduct has been and is in a way to be determined—is to the public at large a point as indifferent as it is unascertainable but to that same public a conception as correct as can be formed in regard to these same springs of action and the share they have respectively had and are in a way to have in the production of the several effects is frequently a matter of no inconsiderable importance in the view of giving what facility it may be in my power to give to an inquiry of this sort in the hands of any such persons by whom the need of engaging in it may happen to be felt i will accordingly in this place notwithstanding the repetition involved in them venture to submit two rules or directions the one positive the other negative   positive rule—to satisfy yourself beforehand what on a given occasion will be the course a man will take look to the state of interests look out for and take note of the several interests to the operation of which the situation he occupies stands exposed   negative rule—in your endeavour to satisfy yourself what on the occasion in question is the course he will take pay no regard whatever to professions or protestations—to protestations by whomsoever made whether by the man himself or by his adherents never to professions and protestations directly made in and that very shape still less to professions and protestations muffled up in any such disguise as that of a storm of indignation poured forth upon the malignant and audacious calumnistor by whom any such expectation is held up to view as that the conduct of the men in question will on that occasion or any other be in any degree likely to receive its direction from those springs of action on the predominant force and efficiency of which the preservation of every individual is every day of his life dependent a case—in which by the application of the above rules it may here and there happen     to a man to be led into a conclusion more or less erroneous—is that of an individual for in the case of an individual the most correctly framed general rules will every now and then find themselves put to fault by the unconjecturable play of individual idiosyncrasies far otherwise is it in the case of a body of men more particularly in the case of a body the motives of which are in so great a degree open to universal observation as those of a political party the larger the body the more unerring the indications afforded by those rules take for example the case of universal suffrage and the late duke of richmond by what tolerably intelligent mind knowing nothing of him but that he was a duke could any such expectation have been entertained as that of finding in this duke an advocate—a zealous and persevering advocate—for universal suffrage yet by this or that incident in the interior of his life—some temporary heartburning for example between this great aristocrat and his monarchical cousin—the apparent mystery might perhaps have been—may still perhaps one day be explained—the paradox removed the riddle solved accordingly that there shall never again be a duke in whose instance universal suffrage shall find a zealous advocate—is a prediction which the observation of that one case should suffice to prevent a man from being forward to utter and so in regard to each of the several features essential to radical i e to efficient—parliamentary reform but that there never will be a time in which all dukes or so much as a majority of the fellowship of dukes will under any other impulse than that of fear join in the advocating of any such arrangement may without danger of error be pronounced with unhesitating confidence so in the case of the whigs considered with a view to radical parliamentary reform that among those members of parliament who at present on the occasion of a partyquestion are in the habit of voting in and with the party so denominated there are not any who at any time will be found advocating this only efficient bulwark against the ocean of ulterior misery with which the country is threatened—is a prediction happily no less improbable than it would be uncomfortable but that by any other impulse than that of fear—by any impulse other than that by which the conduct of their more prosperous antagonists the tories will be directed—neither the whole body nor so much as the majority of the numbers of the party in question will ever be engaged in any such selfdenying course—is a prediction which by a short glance at the state of the interests bearing upon the situation in which they stand any man may feel himself compelled inwardly to join in as well as warranted in uttering with an unhesitating howsoever melancholy confidence that by an absolute monarch—not only under him but even in the place of him—a representative democracy should be established—this even this is upon the cards by no other means could so heroic an act of beneficence be exercised—by no other means could so vast and unperishable a treasure of love and admiration be collected and laid up—by no other means could so novel and striking a manifestation of talent and genius be displayed—by no other means could even so vast a mass of power be exercised power exercised and for ever over posterity a power with reference to which the vainest and most selfish of despots—lewis the fourteenth—recognised and foretold what those who came immediately after him experienced—his impotence of voluntary surrenders of monarchy—surrenders made into the hands of expectant and monarchical successors there is no want of examples not even in modern—not even in european history—charles the fifth of germany monarch of so many vast monarchies—christina of sweden—victor amádeus of savoy—philip the fifth of spain—here in so many different nations we have already four examples but on the part of an aristocratical body of the surrender of any the minutest particle of power which they were able to retain where is there as much as any one example to be found ii tories—whigs—peoples men—general coincidence of interests as between whigs and tories to this purpose at least all—and to every other purpose almost all—in whom in all its several forms parliamentary reform finds opposers may be considered as belonging to the class of tories to this same purpose all by whom to the exclusion of radical reform moderate reform is advocated or supported may be considered as belonging to the class of whigs in respect of all the several elements belonging to the system of radical reform—and in particular according to the edition here ventured to be given of it it has been seen what—with the exception of a certain confederacy of particular and sinister interests—are the exigencies and demands of the universal interest—of the interest of the whole people those by whom that universal interest is advocated may for distinctions sake be termed peoples men now then so it is that in respect of these same matters tories and whigs—both parties it will be seen acting under the dominion of the same seductive and corruptive     influence—will be seen to possess the same separate and sinister interest—an interest completely and unchangeably opposite to that of the whole uncorrupt portion of the people that which the tories have in possession—viz the matter of good—the object of universal desire in all its shapes—the matter of good—the whole of it by the relative situation of c—rgeneral and co on the one part and the members of both houses on the other part converted into matter of corruptive influence—the whigs have before them in prospect and expectancy in the first place as to waste and corruption corruption and waste of the tories it ever has been and ever will be the interest—to keep that portion of the substance of the people which is expended in waste and corruption as great as possible so of the whigs likewise under nonreform this quantity will be left untouched under moderate reform the reduction in it if any would be minimized under radical reform it would be maximized in the next place as to seats of the tories it is the interest—that the power belonging to the seats which they have at their disposal—that therefore in number as well as value the seats themselves—should remain undiminished on the part of the whigs so far as concerns the seats at their disposal behold the selfsame interest partly to proprietorship partly to terrorism—not to speak of bribery—to terrorism as well of the competitionexcluding as of the votecompelling species—are the tories in the greater proportion indebted for their seats to the same instrument of subjection—to the same extinguisher of freedom—without any ascertainable difference in respect of proportions—are the whigs indebted for their seats of the tories in respect of their seats it is the interest to be absentees ad libitum absentees for the purpose of half the effect of corruption as above explained absentees—for the purpose of private interest dissipation and idleness on the part of the whigs with the exception of that corrupt purpose in which none but those in power can be partakers—still the same sinister interest among the tories it is the interest of all persons who have seats at command to enjoy clear of obligation the full private benefit of those situations and of the power they confer clear of obligation in every shape and in particular clear of all such obligation as that of possessing any the smallest grain of appropriate aptitude in respect of interest the whigs if taken individually will be seen to be in that same case not having in possession nor in any tolerably probable and near expectancy any share in the existing mass of the matter of corruption—no public money at their disposal—no peerages no factitious dignities—hence so it is that—setting aside their respective masses of private property—in the power attached to the seats they possess in the two houses—but more particularly in the most efficient of the two—they behold the sole efficient cause of whatever preeminence they can hope as a party to possess in the scale of influence in the eyes of the people at large the sort of corporate union they have been wont to maintain among themselves presents itself to them as securing to them a sort of chance of entering once more on some unknown occasion be it for ever so short a time into the possession of efficient and profitable power in that auction at which by greater and greater manifestations of obsequiousness the favour of c—rgeneral must by all competitors be at all times bid for—impossible as it is for them—incompatible with their distinctive character—to outbid or so much as to come up to the present occupants—it is not in the nature of things that any possession which it may be supposed possible for them to attain should be of any considerable continuance of any continuance beyond that of the longest of those shortlived ones which past experience has brought to view but if ever as a body the tories go out altogether the whigs as a body being the only formed body in existence must come in come in—and being a body come in together here then such as it is is a chance and the thing of which it is a chance being so long as it lasts a mass of power never much less and now not at all less than absolute—thus it is—especially to those of them who elsewhere have nothing but this chance—thus it is that being their everything were it even much less than it is it could not be prized at anything less than the full value and the smaller the portion which is thus left to them it being their all the more rather than the less pertinacious will be their determination to preserve it undiminished thus without any need of concert—most probably therefore without any assistance of actual concert—has a sort of tacit cooperation been kept up between the two contending parties an alliance in form but defensive but in effect but too offensive against the people and their interests iii particular points of radical and efficient reform by which the joint interests would be affected in regard to seats by the interest of the tories it is required that as well in respect of the number of seats in their possession or within their grasp—as also in respect of the     value of those several seats—taken in all the elements of which in such a case value is susceptible—things if in the sense of particular and sinister interest they cannot be made better should at any rate continue as they are without any the smallest difference all this may it not be predicated of the interest of the whigs i as to the number of these seats of the particulars above brought to view in the character of arrangements included in the present edition of radical reform the following will be seen to concur in lessening the number of the seats in the possession of the present possessors meaning by present possessors not merely the existing individuals but moreover all others whose possession will be the result of the same causes these are—  virtual universality of suffrage   practical equality of suffrage—i e practical equalization of the quantities of population and territory respectively comprised in the two proposed sorts of electoral districts viz population and territorial districts   secresy of suffrage thence   freedom of suffrage as to the particular means by which this general effect will be produced they will not be far to seek by the virtual universality in conjunction with the practical equality the present possessors together with those who would have been their successors would be excluded from the proprietory seats by the same causes—with the addition of the secresy and its fruit the freedom—all those to whose possession either terrorism or bribery would be necessary would in like manner stand excluded—excluded as well from such seats as they are now in the habit of filling as from all such other seats to the acquisition of which those same modes of seduction would be found necessary all seats being thus laid open to all candidates selfproposed and proposable—whatsoever advantage would remain to the existing occupants would be the result—either of habit on the part of electors or of good reputation already acquired in respect of the several elements of appropriate aptitude so often brought to view of which reputation the evidentiary cause might be either of a direct nature consisting of service already performed in this same line of public service or of a circumstantial and presumptive nature the presumption derived from virtue manifested or supposed to have been manifested in other parts of the field of action public or private among which that negative sort of virtue which consists in the innoxious and unoffensive application of the matter of opulence to the use of the possessor and his particular connexions is in little danger of being overlooked or undervalued ii as to the value of these same seats impermanence of the situation—necessity of constant attendance—exclusion from official situations unless on condition of losing the right of voting—by the conjunct operation of these several arrangements would the value of all seats be reduced reduced in the instance of all seats without exception by whomsoever occupied the reduction therefore attended with a correspondent sensation of loss in the instance of all existing occupants of such seats as to those members who in the existing state of things add to the profitable possession of official situations the not altogether useless though not additionally profitable right of exercising controul over and sitting in judgment on themselves and one another in the character of representatives of the people—the effect which the change would have in their instance would be the obligation of making their option between the assurable possession of the profitable office and whatsoever chance they might respectively have of obtaining the unprofitable vote   virtual universality of suffrage   practical equality of suffrage   freedom of suffrage   secresy of suffrage under the head of arrangements applying more immediately to the situation of elector have these four articles been conjunctly brought to view under the head of arrangements applying more immediately to the situation of representative the three following—viz   impermanence of situation—say as particularized by the word annuality   efficient obligation to constancy of attendance   exclusion of placemen from the right of voting—though not from the right of speech or that of motion by the set of arrangements thus applying to the situation of elector—by these would the existing seats be slipt from under the individuals by whom when not otherwise more profitably or pleasantly occupied they are at present filled by the set of arrangements thus applying to the situation of representative would be stript off a great part—who shall say in what sad proportion the greater part—of the value which but for so merciless a defalcation might have been found attached to such newly furnished seats as by the operation of the firstmentioned set of arrangements would be substituted to the existing ones annoying—lamentably annoying—would all these several innovations be to the tories—little less so would they be to the whigs sole difference—the difference between possession and expectancy—and that confined to the option which in so far as office is concerned would be to be made as above between vote

suffrage is considerable enough to operate as an antidote more or less efficacious to the poison of corruptive influence two arrangements might be mentioned by which taken together more—much more—would be done than by annuality taken by itself viz   exclusion of placemens votes—speech and motion as proposed reserved   universal constancy of attendance supposing it really effected by neither of these arrangements would any the slightest ground be afforded for the imputation of jacobinism by neither of them would any the slightest advance be made towards the restoration of democratic ascendency by neither of them would any extension be given to the right of suffrage still however in whatsoever degree efficient—deplorably short of adequate would be the above pair of remedies without the addition of that other which in a late reign was so near being applied viz the limitation to the prerogative in respect of the right of creating peers part and parcel of the legitimate influence of property when swollen to a certain bulk is that of conferring on the possessor a sort of right to a peerage a sort of constitutional customary halflegal right subject of course to the universal condition of being in league with the party in power at the time being thus it is that on one side or the other all the families in the three kingdoms within whose field of vision this highest lot in the inventory of corruption is included are everlastingly enlisted in a state of irreconcilable hostility with the universal interest if neither pulteney nor pitt the first—each the first man of his time—could withstand the temptation of this bait think how it must be with the herd of foxhunters within the circle thus marked out suppose one man proof against the force of the enchantment—suppose this one miracle comes the next generation the miracle is at an end and while the as yet uncoroneted class of seatowners and irresistible terrorists—proprietors of seats by descent or conquest—are thus held in corrupt thraldom by a coronet with no more than four balls on it—the already coroneted proprietors of the same fractions of the integer of despotism are kept in the same state of fascination by coronets of superior brilliancy in the last reign but one a never renewable concurrence of circumstances gave to reform in this shape the concurrence of two out of the three branches of the legislature in the minds of the peers of those days the consideration of the defalcation to which the value of the honour would be subjected by every increase given to the numbers of the sharers—this interest minute as it was obtained by the advantage of proximity the prevalence over the remote but so much more valuable interest in respect of which that order of men are sharers with the whole body of the ruling few in the profit of corrupt misrule taught by so long a course of intervening experience the peers of present time are better calculators by the lords temporal jacobinism—by the lords spiritual atheism—would be descried in any attempt to defalcate any the smallest atom from that part of the mass of corruptive influence which operates in this shape as to the exclusion of placemens votes—scarcely more fully entitled to its name was the celebrated selfdenying ordinance by which—with the exception of cromwell—the members of charles the firsts long parliament were reduced to the same sad dilemma of making each of them his option between two incompatible offices in that way was corruption at that time rooted out because there existed a cromwell and there existed puritans neither in that way—nor much it is to be feared without convulsion in any way—will corruption at this time be rooted out for we have now no cromwell we have now no puritans oh but this is nothing but your own surmise—your own ungenerous and groundless surmise—one of the fruits of your own selfish and wild and visionary and jacobinical and atheistical theory good gentlemen—if i am indeed so ungenerous as to behold men as the almighty made them—and as they must be on pain of ceasing to exist—if such is indeed my theory—it is neither in any respect without its sufficient warrant in the universally and necessarily and undeniably prevalent principles of human action—nor yet for so it happens without its grounds in the shape of special evidence applying to this particular case to the whigs—these securities against corruption—securities as far as they went so efficient—to the whigs would they any one of them be endurable not they indeed annuality—with all its wildness and visionariness—annuality would be far less intolerable how should it be otherwise by exclusion of placemens votes prospects would be destroyed by obligation of attendance ease would be transformed into hard labour by limitation applied to the number of the peerages the triumph of property over probity would be arrested in its course     exclusion of placemens votes might be submitted to by such of them by whom indolence or want of talent would be recognised as excluding in their own instances respectively the slender portion of endowment necessary and—in the case of all but the few leaders—sufficient to the earning of the pay thus to be earned but in every eye without exception the most visionary of all imaginable visions would be that by which the fulfilment of incontestable duty—though in the field of time not covering near so much as half the year—see report   th march      p  0 were to be regarded as either practicable or desirable as to what regards constancy of attendance—the proof as shown already under that head stands upon your own journals as to what regards the exclusion of placemens votes i call in mr brand to the nerves not only of whigs but of whigreformists of course altogether moderate reformists so intolerable was found to be the odour of this instrument of purification that on the only one of the two occasions on which mr brand executed the originally announced design of an annual reproduction of his proposition for parliamentary reform he found himself obliged to leave out this most efficient and unobjectionable of his proposed arrangements and even then—such had been the offence taken at the injury done to the party by propositions admitted on the former occasion in favour of the people—from     against     his numbers were reduced to    against    † on this same occasion another too efficient proposition omitted by the same honourable reformist was—that for the taking of the votes in parochial or other such small districts on this same second and last occasion in a word everything that had been before proposed was reduced or altered to that for the abolishing in some way not mentioned the proprietory seats and the giving an increase to the number of the county seats to the number of the sources of that terrorism by the consideration of which the mind of charles fox had as above §   been repelled from the idea of that measure note that from their giving in the first instance the support of their votes to a proposed arrangement of reform it follows not by any means that honourable gentlemen have any the smallest liking to it or any the slightest intention to continue their support to it even from speeches—nay even from motions—in support of it neither can conclusions in affirmance of inward favour and intentions be drawn with any certainty for by maturer reflection operating upon intervening experience—further and true lights showing the falsity of the lights by which they had at first been guided—original deviations from the path of consummate wisdom lie at all times open to correction witness earl grey and lord erskine and mr tierney with et cæteras upon et cæteras on these occasions—as on all occasions—one object at least if not the only object is to make display of numbers and thus strike terror into ministerial bosoms that object accomplished or abandoned—the expedient has well or ill performed its office and like a sucked orange is ripe for being cast aside not in any such degree exposed to error are the conclusions that present themselves from the opposite course when upon any measure of reform an honourable back has been turned—expect ye good men and true to whom disappointment is a treat—expect to see turned again with a smile towards reform in that or any other shape the honourable visage that belongs to it v country gentlemen—opposition of their particular interests to efficient reform and thereby to the universal interest to the interest of the great landholders—whether in the situation of country gentlemen employing their influence in the providing of seats for themselves or their connexions—or in the situation of peers conferring in the character of patrons seats on any but themselves—radical reform would it not be generally and undeniably prejudicial in a variety of ways   of the circle—filled by those in whose eyes the perpetual vision of a coronet suspended over their head in the aërostatic region occupies the place of the labarum or the new jerusalem—mention has just been made   in virtue of the principle of practical equality of suffrage the counties in the character of territorial election districts would—most if not all of them—require to be broken down and divided to the class of persons in question what in this respect would be the consequence that a gentleman who in an entire county beholds at present an edom over which he may cast forth his shoe would find this integer reduced to a fraction—a fraction corresponding to the number of the electoral districts into which the county would be divided say that for procuring to him as before a seat—the fraction in which the greatest part of his territorial property is situated would suffice so far so good his station in the     house would remain unchanged but the county—from his importance in the county—from every part of his influence but that immediately and exclusively attached to his seat in the house—a defalcation proportioned to the number of the fractions would be produced of the electoral districts into which the county is divided let four suppose be the number from each of them one seat to be filled on this supposition—in the field of his present dominion instead of one jointpotentate he would have three to share with him instead of one pompey each cæsar would have three pompeys   even in that one of the four supposed fractions in which his territorial demesnes were principally or exclusively situated—his possession even of the one seat in question might lose much of its present security once more in the force of terrorism—of competitionexcluding terrorism—does not a knight of the shire behold his surest dependence if yes then proportioned as above shown §    —proportioned to the extent of that same shire—is the pressure of that force vi options—compromises—experiments—postponements for my part if it depended upon me gladly would i give up annuality—if at that price even though it were confined to the population districts i could obtain the householderplan accompanied with secresy of suffrage—compensation given for proprietory seats and even for close boroughs i feel as sensibly as any one of them can do for any other the plague which it would be to honourable gentlemen—year after year as regularly as the year comes—to set each of them his stewards to drive to the pollbooth his portion of the swinish multitude—i feel still more sensibly the plague which it cannot but be to be so driven—in no instance by the idea of uneasiness considered as having place in any human breast—honourable any more than swinish—and not outweighed by greater satisfaction elsewhere—is any such sensation as that of satisfaction ever produced in mine quantity of corrupt matter the same in both cases—by the reproduction of it every year instead of once in every three years much would be lost to individual comfort nothing gained to public security—security against oppression and legalized pillage nothing will i conceal—nothing will i exaggerate even by the exclusion of the whole number of corruptioncaters—supposing their places filled by an equal number of corruptionhunters nothing more than the difference in effect between fear of loss and hope of gain would be gained no nothing more than that difference but whether that difference would be slight and inefficient let any one judge after making the case his own and asking himself which would be the greater—his grief on losing his all or his joy on doubling it always at the expense of the least suffering possible would i obtain the good i look for many men deserve reward—no man deserves punishment when a surgeon cuts into a limb is it because the patient has deserved the smart no but that the limb may be healed reward is—punishment is not—a thing to be deserved for my own part—not much should i want of being satisfied for and during the short remainder of my own life—could i but see the quondam friends of the people repent of their repentance repent of it and no more said it would be too hard upon them to ask them for the reasons of it but freedom—freedom—wheresoever given—by whomsoever given—all suffrages must be free—or they are worse than none for and with the people the thing might surely be done with the friends of the people—and those not friends in name only—for their leaders vii uses of this exposure of this display of the state of interests—of this exposure melancholy as it is—melancholy and inauspicious but not the less necessary—what now is the practical use answer—  that those who on looking into themselves have the satisfaction of beholding in themselves merit sufficient for the purchase of a stock of popularity of the true and everlasting fabric ample enough to afford adequate compensation not only for the supposed lost seats but for the reduction in the vulgarly estimated value of those new ones to which they might look with such wellgrounded confidence—that these men if any men there be that can behold themselves in this description—happy enough as they would be not to need the adding to the stock     of their other merits the merit of selfdenial—may come forward—come forward and instead of sitting with folded hands to see us crushed or lending their hands to the work of crushing us condescend to head us and lead us—us of the swinish multitude   that those who to a stock of merits in other less assured shapes add a supplement of sufficient strength in the rarest of all shapes selfdenial—pure and genuine selfdenial—may join those others in the same generous course yes peradventure here and there at one time or other may be found a few such superior minds such was the duke of richmonds he did not scoff at universal suffrage he advocated it he himself framed—he himself made public—a plan of reform—and that plan was founded on it yes—in this or that house—nay even in each house today or tomorrow—may be found here and there a few such eccentrically generous minds and these the people will have for their leaders and these their leaders will be adored—in lifetime they will be worshipped and after death passing through death to immortality they will be immortalized but to be thus immortalized they must have been transfigured into peoples men—whigs they would be no longer but renegadoes   that when these refined spirits are thus drawn off and lodged in their proper receptacle the heart of an adoring people the power of the caput mortuum which they will have left behind—the weight of it at any rate in the scale of authority—may find itself reduced to its true and proper amount as to these last—whatsoever arguments grounded on the principle of general utility—on the respective relations of the two rival modes the moderate and the radical to the universal interest—whatsoever arguments of this only genuine stamp it shall have been their good fortune to have found—will on this occasion as on others like all other arguments drawn from the same clear fountain operate and tell with their due and proper weight but the argument in the shape of authority—the argument which being composed of the alleged selfformed judgment of the supposed closely thinking few seeks to supply as it were from an inexhaustible fountain matter for the derivative judgment of the loosely thinking many—of this argument in proportion as the state of their interests being laid open the direction in which the prevalent mass of interest operates is seen to be adverse to the only efficient mode of reform—of this instrument of delusion the force and efficiency will evaporate arguments of that only genuine stamp being inacessible to them—none such on their side of the case being afforded by the nature of the case—what then will be their resource answer henceforward as till now silence storm or fallacy but of the stock of such arms as the arsenal of fallacy offers to their hands a part not altogether inconsiderable—and that among the readiest at hand—has already been brought out—brought out preexposed to a damping atmosphere and thus rendered unfit for use in all this truth unwelcome as it cannot but be mark well—there is nothing of vituperation employed on this occasion vituperation would be as illgrounded as it would be useless man is a compound of nature and situation such is the force of situation here no probity of nature can ever have power to resist it if these men were to be stoned how many are there among us who upon trial would be found entitled to cast the stones that which in this behalf these men do and forbear to do—what is there in it which those who are most angry with them would not—with few exceptions indeed—do and forbear to do in their place thus sad—and but for the silently increasing strength of their own minds hopeless—is the condition of the people everything that in any shape has power at its back is either whig or tory the tories are the peoples avowed enemies man must change his nature ere to any radically remedial purpose the whigs—the great body of the whigs—can be their friends in so far as to the receiving on any occasion protecting assistance at their hands real sympathy is necessary—it may now be imagined whether by the great body of the people any such affection can ever be reasonably looked for from the body of the whigs happily to the receipt of such assistance to a certain degree on most parts of the field of government except this allembracing one no such feeling it will be seen is in that quarter necessary between that aristocratical confederacy and the great body of the people in respect of most matters of detail separately taken the community of interests may be stated as being commonly to a certain degree sufficient for their purpose on no occasion under the everincreasing weight of the yoke of oppression and misrule from any hand other than that of the parliamentary whigs can the people receive any the slightest chance—talk not of relief—for that is at all times out of the question but for retardation of increase as to liberty of speech—to all such purposes everywhere out of the house it is already gone in the house the whigs still have—and probably for some time longer will continue to have—possession of that instrument without which no resistance can be made in the sort of struggle faint as it is which from time to     time the whigs contrive to summon up strength enough to maintain against the ever overbearing force of their antagonists—scarcely any way without serving in some way or other the interest of the people can they so much as endeavour to serve themselves not that by such hands abuse in any shape can be eradicated for the benefit of the eventually succeeding nurserymen each stool must be preserved meantime however even by such hands there is scarce an abuse but may be clipped the time will it ever come in which on the one hand so intolerable will have become the system of misrule—so grievous the yoke of despotism—on the other hand in the eyes of the whigs so plainly hopeless the chance of their ever being though it were but for a moment taken into power—that in their calculation the value of their share in the partial and sinister interest will no longer be greater than that of their share in the universal interest the time will it ever come in which in each mans estimate the system of misrule and oppression will have swollen to such a pitch that on the occasion of the sacrifice made of the universal interest on the altar of despotism he has more to fear in the character of a victim than to hope for in the character of priest this will depend—partly on the degree of precipitation or caution with which the system of despotism proceeds on in its course—partly on the joint degree of discernment and public feeling which shall have place on the part of the whigs but the great fear is—lest for their saving themselves and the country together the time may not already be too late already a lewis g—will before that time have been made a ferdinand individuals or bodies—without means of communication nothing effectual can be done by any two parties for mutual defence between mind and mind sole instruments of communication these three—the tongue the pen and the press by the pen without the aid of the press nothing effectual can in these days be ever done of what will be done and that without delay for the depriving the people of the use of the press an earnest has been already given given in the here several times alluded to but elsewhere too little noticed decision of the house of commons as to the tongue under one of the late liberticide acts two london aldermen sitting at guildhall have sufficed to put an end to all public use of that instrument on this or on any other part of the field of politics in this state is civil liberty in liverpool already has the arm of persecution been raised against the unitarians in this state is religious liberty the heart is pierced through and through with the melancholy truth yes all that rule—all that even think to rule—are against the people causes will have their effects sooner or later unless a change takes place the people—the people in their own defance—will be against all that rule a parting word or two respecting the pamphlet lately published by mr evans—time forbidding all examination of it with my own eyes the following is the result of a report made to me by an intelligent friend with little or no exception—historical facts authorities arguments nay even proposals—in favour of radical reform conclusions—conclusions alone—in favour of moderate historical facts and authorities many and important ones many which could i have found time for the gleaning of them i should not have failed to add to the number of the notes above distinguished by the name of shield notes i say shield notes the others—for want of room—and with much more of satisfaction than regret—being omitted under these circumstances it cannot but be my wish that every person into whose hands this too long work may fall may yet add to it the pamphlet of mr evans another word or two on the mode of treating the subject in the section on impermanence—to the duration expressed by the word annuality the objection made by mr brand on the score of want of experience will have been seen of the argument so employed on that occasion by the honourable gentleman the source being the same viz the principle of general utility as that from which on every part of the field of politics my own arguments are drawn on all occasions—to that argument so far as regards the legitimacy of the source it was accordingly impossible that any objection could be entertained by me the sort of business in question be it what it may—in the choice of a functionary for the performance of it appropriate aptitude—aptitude with reference to that same business—being the term by which the end properly belonging to the subject—the proper and allcomprehensive end—is brought to view—appropriate probity appropriate intellectual aptitude and appropriate active talent—each of them with reference to that same end—are on all occasions the terms employed by me as capable of serving when taken together and as serving accordingly for giving expression to all the several constituent parts or elements so often mentioned of that fictitious whole endowments by the possession or nonpossession of which in so far as in each instance the matter of fact is capable of being ascertained—whatsoever be the function in question—and whosoever the person chosen for the exercise of it—the propriety or impropriety of the choice may be and ought to be determined in the setting up of this particular     standard as the standard suited to the nature of the particular subject may be seen one instance of the application made of the abovementioned leading principle—the principle of general utility in the standard of comparison thus set up may be seen the basis of the annexed plan and on the occasion in question to this same standard it may be seen did the discernment and judgment of the honourable gentleman in question conduct him likewise—the case being such that in the position in which he stood not only did the subject but the side in which in relation to that subject his position was admit of his drawing his argument from that same clear and quiet source from that same source—as on all occasions so on this—were of course drawn the arguments which it fell to my lot to find on the other side between the one and the other the reader the state of whose mind in respect of interest leaves him at liberty to form an unseduced and unbiassed judgment will have had to decide to find so much as a single instance in which the question was argued upon such ground as well as with such temper—all logic no rhetoric—was a real treat to me had all the arguments from that as well as other quarters i speak of the assembly not of the individual been of the same temper as well as from the same source—the ensuing plan shows not only the source from which but the sort of temper in which and in which alone everything which came from me on the subject would have come in preserving while thus occupied that same cool and quiet temper—in preserving it from beginning to end—not any the smallest difficulty did i ever experience as little should i experience in discussing with any person that same question point by point so that the arguments were on both sides drawn from that same source in that same temper from that same source in that same course of argument by that one honourable gentleman was that one step made but in any sort of temper on that same ground in that same course of argument and on that same side to take another—at any rate to take many such other steps—so it were upon terra firma and not in the region of air and clouds—would not i am inclined to think by any honourable gentleman on that same side be found an altogether easy task not even by the honourable gentleman in question who of all moderatists in so far as he seems to be at liberty to give expression to his own sentiments for it has been seen under what a yoke he has been working seems to be least remote from radicalism in respect of temper is there a reader to whom the cause of the difference observable between the plan itself and the introduction to it is an object of any the least curiosity i will answer him without disguise for any eyes that could find patience to look at it was the plan itself designed a few exceptions excepted—and those—alas how few—for swinish eyes alone this melancholy introduction—not for honourable ones against interest—against a host of confederated interests—what can argument do exactly as much as against a line of musketry a last word on the new oppression to which we are now doomed viz the suppression of petitions—the closing up of that channel through which under the protection of the bill of rights from that time down to that of the present session we possessed all over the kingdom the means of knowing one anothers thoughts on the subject of our common interests framed by that masterly hand which is so consummately adequate to every work it undertakes—ah would the times were such as might allow it to undertake none but good ones—framed by this exquisite hand i see just come out a set of arrangements admirable as they are new for giving the most efficient and timely the most in every way commodious publicity to the proceedings of the house the first specimen has just reached my hand but from amidst these flowers a snake—how can i help seeing it—lifts up its head and threatens me—any petitions or other proceedings which may occasionally be printed by special order might follow as a supplement or appendix to the votes not impeding their daily delivery and be printed and circulated afterwards with due diligence according to their length any petitions yes and therefore any petitions even for parliamentary reform—even for radical reform—even for the wild and visionary reform—may henceforward be printed so it be by special order but for dissemination of any such visionary matter in its whole extent or in any considerable portion of its extent any such special order will it be generally obtained—was there any design that it should till now even of those visions was the substance in use to be inserted in the votes and thus on so easy a condition as that of putting on the uniform of prescribed respect petitioners in all parts of the united kingdom might without fear of adding to the troubles of mr attorneygeneral have had the possibility of coming to the knowledge of one anothers minds by a former decision—so perfectly pretenceless and here more than once alluded to—seeing the use of the press interdicted to petitions for reform—seeing that clause of the bill of rights which regards petitions thus in part already repealed by a decision of the house of commons—how can any eye how averse soever avoid seeing another wound and that a still more desperate one now given to the liberties which by that so much celebrated     but alas how vague and imperfect law were in part professed—in part intended—to be secured so far as concerns the new matter added admirable as these new arrangements are—since the day on which in addition to the power the talent requisite to the making of them found its way into the chair from which they issued has there ever been a time in which the demand for them did not exist no but not till now has the demand been so imperative for this—the final—suppression of all pernicious visions addition—compression—acceleration—to whatsoever has been done in any one of these ways never was applause more sincere than that which has here been paid as to postponement—so far as necessary to the acceleration of the essence postponement of the mass at large is a small price paid for a great benefit but suppression—saving special order or special motion—suppression thus final—and among the matters suppressed the matter of all petitions—and among these petitions all petitions for reform—here lies the evil and a more protentous one where shall it be found economy forsooth the motive o rare economy from the suppression of the whole quantity of matter proposed to be suppressed the greatest quantum of expense upon and out of which a saving to a greater or less amount can by possibility be made £ 000 ayear and out of this aggregate mass what would be the greatest amount of saving that could be made by the suppression of petitions alone a few hundreds ayear or perhaps only a few score but the sum thus to be saved by the suppression of petitions—suppose it to amount to the whole of the £ 000—which however is impossible for this £ 000 would any man who was not an enemy to english liberties be content to sell so valuable a portion of them as this to sell this—now that so many others have so lately been torn from us—this on the preservation of which depends perhaps the only chance yet left to us for the recovery or the preservation of any of the others if of all places imaginable the place chosen for the seat of economy—and such economy—must be the chapel of st stephen—once the great sanctuary of english liberties—might not even there some more proper source or object for it be found suppose for example under the head of expense the saving made were made of or upon the money so regularly consumed in that same place in the periodical pampering performed at the expense of the people upon their selfstyled representatives—upon these sometimes selfstyled servants of the people while so many of their masters are perishing every day for want of necessaries by the first glance at the first specimen of the new arrangement in company with the report by which it was explained was the suspicion in question awakened—within the compass of ten days behold the confirmation it has already received from experience since this beautifully and in every part but this irreproachably commodious regulation has been acted upon—five instances of petition for reform have occurred in one of them alone has the printing been ordered in every other of the four instances suppression has been the result in the one instance in which the printing was ordered how came it to be ordered because on the part of the member by whom it was presented there was a real desire that no such suppression should take place in the four other instances how happened it that the petitions were thus suppressed because in the instance of the honourable members by whom they were respectively presented either there was an opposite desire or whether the petition was circulated or suppressed was a matter of indifference last date of the first number viz    of the paper printed upon the new plan under the title of votes and proceedings of the house of commons—  th april      in this number p     follow two articles in the words and figures following—    reform in parliament c petition of wolverhampton presented    reform in parliament c petition of persons residing in andover presented that this was the first paper

instance—in which after presenting the petition the member moved that it be printed this member was sir francis burdett the only inducement which honourable house can have to submit to any such measure as this of its own reform—this sole inducement being composed of the desires of the people as made known to one another as well as to honourable house—which reform never can take place but in proportion as the particular interest of honourable house is made to give way to the universal interest—is it now in human nature that by honourable house anything should be omitted which in the eyes of honourable house can consistently with the rules of human prudence be done towards the prevention of so unpleasant an effect that in this or that instance for some time after the introduction of the new arrangement no resistance should be made to a motion for giving to these applications how unwelcome soever the beforeaccustomed circulation is altogether natural especially when by any such resistance such a pressure as that which it would be in the power of sir francis burdett to apply would have to be encountered yet even already out of five petitions is the extinguisher dropped upon four this under the green tree—judge how it will be in the dry why load the parliamentary press with any such useless trash these petitions—either they agree with one another or they disagree do they agree from some one manufactory do they all come do they disagree the greater the disagreement the more conclusive the proof of wildness—of visionariness—of the impossibility of doing anything that shall be generally satisfactory to the swinish multitude behold here an argument ready to serve and to prevail—and at all times—for the suppression of that which is to be suppressed has no such plan of suppression been ever formed—or one having been formed will honourable gentlemen prevail upon themselves to relinquish it nothing can be more simple or unobjectionable than the remedy—standing order that every petition that has been received shall be printed of course and in due course on motion duly made suppose an order to this effect refused—of the justness of those suspicions which consistently with any regard for the public welfare could not be suppressed would any such refusal fall anything short of the most conclusive proof that which in each instance is given as and for the petition of such and such persons might it not be proper that by some of those tokens which everywhere else are in use—for example the insertion or omission of inverted commas—information should be given whether the matter so printed be the very tenor of the petition in question or only the purport—the petition at length or an abridgment—an abridgment compressed to any degree of compression from the minimum to the maximum inclusive—the discourse in a word of the exactly ascertainable persons whose discourse it purports to be or the discourse of some other person neither ascertained nor by any person except those who are in the secret ascertainable good sir francis through this channel i now address you it being the only channel through which it is in my power to reach you—good sir francis look at the appendix to the votes  st may      p  —look at the paper no   in which may be seen enveloped in the abovedescribed cloud the account of the st ives petition printed at your instance tell us on your approaching commemoration day to which of all the abovedescribed descriptions we are to refer it—  th may          catechism of parliamentary reform or outline of a plan of parliamentary reform in the form of question and answer with reasons to each article section i ends to be aimed at on the occasion of parliamentary reform question   what are the ends to the attainment of which a system of parliamentary representation and parliamentary practice ought to be directed answer many might here be mentioned but whatever be their number they may be brought all of them under one or another of three expressions viz—   securing in the highest possible degree on the part of members that is to say on the part of the greatest possible proportion of the whole number the several endowments or elements of aptitude necessary to fit them for the due discharge of such their trust   removing or reducing to the smallest possible amount the inconveniences attendant on elections   removing or reducing to the smallest possible amount the inconveniences attendant on election judicature question   what are these endowments or elements of aptitude answer they may be comprehended all of them under one or other of three expressions viz   appropriate probity   appropriate intellectual aptitude   appropriate active talent question   what is to be understood by appropriate applied as here to endowments answer in the case of each such endowment that modification of it which is in a particular manner suitable to the particular situation here in question to wit that of a representative of the people—deputed by a part to fill in the character of a trustee or agent for the whole—a seat in that assembly to which belongs one out of three shares in the legislative department of government together with the right and duty of watching over the exercise of the two others viz the administrative and the judicial question   what is to be understood of appropriate as applied to probity answer on each occasion whether in speaking or delivering his vote—on the part of a representative of the people appropriate probity consists in his pursuing that line of conduct which in his own sincere opinion being not inconsistent with the rules of morality or the law of the land is most conducive to the general good of the whole community for which he serves that is to say of the whole of the british empire—forbearing on each occasion at the expense either of such general good or of his duty in any shape either to accept or to seek to obtain or preserve in any shape whatsoever for himself or for any person or persons particularly connected with him any advantage whatsoever from whatsoever hands obtainable and in particular from those hands in which by the very frame of the constitution the greatest mass of the matter of temptation is necessarily and unavoidably lodged viz those of the king and the other members of the executive branch of the government—the kings ministers question   what is to be understood here by appropriate as applied to the endowment of intellectual aptitude answer forming a right judgment on the several propositions which either in parliament or out of parliament but if out of parliament with a view to parliament are liable to come before him and to that end in parliament forming a right conception as well of the nature of each proposition considered in itself as of the evidence adduced or capable of being adduced whether in support of it or in opposition to it and the observations thereon made or capable of being made in the way of argument for it or against it as above   0 question   what is to be understood here by appropriate as applied to active talent answer talents suited to the due performance of the several operations which in the course of his service in or out of the house but more particularly in the house it may happen to a member to be duly called upon to perform or bear a part in—for example introducing or endeavouring to introduce by way of motion any proposed law or measure which he approves delivering a speech in support of any proposition which he altogether approves or in opposition to one which he altogether disapproves proposing an amendment to any proposed law or measure which he approves in part only drawing up or helping to draw up a report concerning such or such matters of fact for the inquiring into which it has happened to him to have been appointed to act as chairman or other member of a committee putting relevant questions concerning matters of fact to persons examined before the house or any committee of the house in the character of witnesses section ii means conducive towards these ends question   what are the means that promise to be most effectually conducive to the accomplishment of the above several ends answer i in the first place come those which have for their end or object the securing in the highest degree of perfection the several endowments or elements of aptitude requisite on the part of members as above these are—   exclusion of placemen in general from the right of sitting in the house in the quality of members entitled to vote   seating in the house official persons named by the king from each department without right of voting but with right of speech and motion subject at all times to restriction or interdiction by the house   elections frequently viz annually renewed with power to the king to ordain a fresh election at any time   speeches made in the house correctly completely and authentically taken down and regularly and promptly published   constancy punctuality and universality of attendance secured answer ii next comes the means which have for their end the removing or reducing to their least possible dimensions the inconveniences attendant on elections and election judicature for shortness that which is proposed let it be stated as done   in each electoral district the number of the voters is uniformly large   each electors title payment made to a certain amount to certain taxes—the evidence of such title a duplicate of the collectors receipt the paper call it the votingpaper delivered or else transmitted for example by post to the returning officer in case of transmission the elector having first written upon it according to directions printed on the votingpaper itself the name of the candidate for whom he means to vote   when performed by delivery the voting is secret to establish the genuineness of the collectors signature and the sufficiency of the same the voter presents his votingpaper to the returning officer in presence of the agents of the candidates the shortest glance suffices its admission is signified by marking it with a stamp the voter is thereupon presented with a ticket which out of the sight of every person he drops through a slit into a box marked with the name of the candidate for whom he means to give his vote penalty on forging the signature of a collector or personating a voter to enforce it each votingpaper is retained delivery not to be performed by proxy for in that case a known friend of one of the candidates might require to be the proxy and thus the design of secresy would be frustrated   to insure secresy as well in the case where the voting is performed by transmission viz by post as where it is performed by delivery the votingpaper contains a promise of secresy signed by the voter and conceived in terms of such strength that without offering an affront to him neither a candidate nor any one on his behalf can request the breach of it not that even by this means the assurance of secresy can be rendered altogether so perfect in the case of transmission as in the case of delivery as above marks in lieu of names are not admitted they would be incompatible with secresy a vote is of little value to him who not being as yet able to write grudges the trouble necessary to the learning to write his name  0 members seats say for example  00 whereof for example twothirds—say  00—seats for territory and the remainder—say  00—seats for population    to form the territorial electoral districts the whole soil of great britain and ireland is divided into say  00 districts as nearly equal as is consistent with convenience resulting from local circumstances one member is chosen for each not that with reference to the end in view if by accident here and there one should be found not above half the size of an average district and here and there another as much as twice the size the inequality would be material parishes     compose the elementary portions no parish is divided    the population electoral districts are composed of certain towns the population of which amounts to a certain number of souls or upwards say merely for illustration  0000—precision might be given on examination of the population returns each of these towns fills one or more seats in proportion to its numbers but in such sort that the whole number of seats thus filled does not exceed the  00 such inequalities as in this case would be unavoidable would here also be to every practical purpose immaterial but such as they are once every  0 or    years they might receive their correction the principle of equality has not any claim to anxious regard any otherwise than in as far as by a departure from it the degree of perfection with which the grand end in view is attained—viz appropriate aptitude on the part of such portion of the house as carries with it the power of the whole—would on this or that occasion receive a sensible diminution for local interests the provision made is on this occasion sufficient if whatever inequality has place to the prejudice of any such particular interest is the result—not of design but accident the three capitals london dublin and edinburgh would thus possess that ascendency which is their due due to them not merely on the score of population but also on the score of appropriate information and intelligence    for the seats corresponding to these population electoral districts voting otherwise than in the most surely secret mode—viz delivery—need not be admitted    on the part of persons possessing the one qualification required as above such circumstances as would be apt to present themselves in the character of grounds of disqualification need not be regarded aliens for example would be admitted but to such a degree would they be outnumbered that though they were all enemies no sensible practical mischief could ensue females might even be admitted and perhaps with as little impropriety or danger as they are in the election of directors for the government of the  0 or  0 millions of souls in british india by all the inequalities and other untoward results put together that could have place in the above plan no practical mischief could be produced equal to that which on the present plan a single pocket borough is sufficient to produce on such occasions as the demarcation of the territorial districts and the fixation of the population districts or their respective numbers of seats—human reason would in many instances have no application in those instances the decision might be made by lot section iii means—their uses with reference to their respective ends question   these several means in what way are they conducive to their respective ends answer for greater distinctness—in the instance of each one of these means ask rather in the first place to which of those ends it is conducive and then in what way or ways it tends to be productive of that effect by understanding in the instance of each means in what way or ways it is conducive to this or that end it will be understood in what way or ways it is of use with reference to such end and thus far what are the uses or good effects of the particular arrangement thus operating in relation to that end in the character of a means question   so then the several arrangements in question have each of them for its object neither more nor less than this viz the being in the character of a means conducive in some way or ways to the accomplishment of one or more of those ends answer such is indeed in every instance their direct and primary object and their principal use but in the instance of most of them further—and as they may be termed collateral—uses or good effects and those of no mean importance may be seen resulting from them as of course question  0 what are these collateral uses or good effects answer for greater clearness it seems better to defer this statement till after the principal and direct uses of these same means have been brought to view question    and so to be satisfied and justly satisfied with the several proposed arrangements nothing more is necessary than to see in the instance of each in what way or ways it is conducive to this or that one of those ends answer assuredly unless from the employment given to each or any of them such or such bad effects should be shown to be likely to take place bad effects the amount of which taken all together would be so great as to outweigh the sum total of the good effects above spoken of section iv means conducive to aptitude in members i placemen not to vote nor to be seated by election question    the exclusion proposed to be put upon the votes of placemen—to which of the above ends does it promise to be conducive answer to probity—appropriate probity     question    in what way answer in this way by keeping the right of voting out of the hands of persons possessing other situations to which—in the shape of money power reputation and in other shapes—advantage in large masses is attached—together with expectation of further and further advantage in the same and other shapes—all liable to be taken from them without reason assigned and at the kings pleasure—persons thereby so situated that speaking of the generality of them it is not in the nature of man that they should not on all ordinary occasions be in the habit of sacrificing and continue disposed to sacrifice in so far as depends upon each mans vote the general interest of the empire and their public duty in every shape to the desire of preserving such advantageous situations to that desire and thence to the desire and necessity of conforming themselves to the will of the person or persons be they who they may on whom their continuance in such situations depends nor should any such disposition appear wonderful when it is considered that even the worst king and the worst minister having on many points the same interest with the body of the people it is not in the nature of man that they should harbour any such intention or any such wish as that of doing on any occasion any act that may be in any degree productive of injury to the general interest except in so far as it may happen to this or that particular interest of their own to be served by such act and that—so long as they content themselves with doing no other sort of mischief than what has been commonly done already—they stand assured of support not only from each other but from the multitude of those in whose eyes the standard of right and wrong is composed of nothing more than the practice of great characters that is of any characters whatsoever in high situations section v means c continued—ii placemen seated by the king with speech and motion without vote question    seating official persons from the official departments without votes but with the right of speech and motion subject to restriction or interdiction by the house—to which of the ends does this arrangement promise to be conducive answer to intellectual aptitude—appropriate intellectual aptitude question    in what way answer in this way on the part of the king and his ministers it being all along matter of necessity to secure for their measures either the cooperation or at least the acquiescence of the house it will be all along their interest and therefore naturally their endeavour to find out and station in the house such persons as being furnished with the requisite degree of obsequiousness as towards his will are in an eminent degree distinguished by the talent of persuasion including that sort and degree of appropriate intellectual aptitude which is necessary to it this intelligence be it what it may the house may at all times be thus made to have the full benefit of and at the same time without having its decisions perpetually exposed to be turned aside into a sinister course by the weight of so many dependent votes expressive—not of any will of the voters guided by any opinion of their own concerning the general interest but of the will guided by the particular and thence sinister interest of the king or of some minister or of some private and unknown favourite of the kings by this means the king and his ministers would possess at all times what at least in their own view of the matter is the best chance for obtaining and maintaining in the house the only honest kind of influence viz the influence of understanding on understanding and that purified viz by the preceding and following proposed arrangements taken together from that dishonest kind of influence—the exercise of which is on both sides in the relative situations in question inconsistent with appropriate probity—viz the influence of will over will question    but is it not necessary that every man who proposes a law or measure in the house should have a vote to give in support of it answer no more than that every advocate who makes a motion in the court of kings bench should have a vote to give in support of it on the bench in the business of judicature to the giving to the justice of the case the benefit of such appropriate intelligence and active talent as may be afforded by the advocates on both sides it has never yet been thought necessary or so much as conducive that the advocates on either side should take their seats on the bench each of them with a vote equal in its effect to that of any of the judges section vi means c continued—iii elections frequent—annual question    the proposed frequent renewal of elections—to which of the above ends does it promise to be conducive answer to all three and in the first place to probity     question    in what way answer in divers ways—   on the part of each member taken individually viz in case of transgression by the prospect of eventual exclusion and that speedy to wit at the next election—at furthest within a twelvemonth   on the part of the whole house taken collectively viz by reducing to so small a quantity the length of sinister service which it would be in the power of the king or his ministers to purchase at the hands of any one member and increasing at the same time the number of such lengths of service as ere they could secure the commencement or continuance of any sinister course of government they would find themselves under the continually recurring necessity of purchasing out of the whole number of members   by reducing in so great a degree whatever inducement a candidate would have on the occasion of a contest to launch out into any such expense as by straitening his circumstances might in the hope of obtaining an indemnification engage him to place himself in a state of dependence on the king or this or that set of ministers whether ministers in possession or ministers in expectancy making in this respect no difference question    in what way does this means promise to be conducive to intellectual aptitude and active talent answer by perpetually holding up to the view of each successful candidate now become a member the near prospect of a fresh election on the occasion of which it may happen to his constituents to have the choice of the same or any additional number of rival candidates for all whom the encouragement will be greater and greater in proportion as on his part any feature of unfitness absolute or comparative has in either of these two shapes been manifested viz whether by discourses indicative of ignorance or weakness by constant silence and inactivity or by absentation or slackness of attendance section vii means c continued—iv speeches authentically and promptly published question  0 to which of the above ends does the correct complete authentic and constant taking down and regular publication of all speeches made in the house promise to be conducive answer to all three question    in what way does it promise to be conducive to probity answer   by impressing upon each mans mind the assurance that by the public in general and by his own constituents in particular he will thenceforward and then for the first time be judged of and in the only way in which in his situation a man can be rightly and justly judged of according to his works held up according to his deserts to esteem or disesteem for everything which he has said and not as happens but too often at present for saying that which he had not said   in so far as concerns veracity and sincerity by operating as a check upon those misrepresentations which for the purpose of the moment are so apt to be hazarded under favour of the at present indispensable rule which precludes reference to anterior debates misrepresentations respecting the speakers own opinion misrepresentation respecting facts at large misrepresentations respecting the speeches of other members misrepresentations sometimes resulting from carelessness and temerity sometimes accompanied with insincerity or in other words with wilful falsehood question    in what way does it promise to be conducive to intellectual aptitude answer in the several ways following viz   by furnishing to each member on the occasion of each motion a correct and complete view of whatsoever evidences and arguments have on the occasion of the same motion—or any other past motion so connected with it as to afford either evidences or arguments justly applicable to it—been brought forward thereby so far as they go furnishing him with better and safer grounds on which to found his opinion his speeches if any and his vote than can be furnished by any other means   by impressing upon each mans mind that assurance of being judged of according to his words which has just been brought to view in the character of a security for appropriate probity for the more correct the judgment which he is assured will be passed upon that part of his works the stronger the motive which he has for making whatsoever exertions shall appear to him to be necessary to save him from the dishonour of being found wanting in point of appropriate intellectual aptitude   by furnishing the only completely efficient means for detecting and pointing out the existence and successfully counteracting the influence as well of the misrepresentations above mentioned as of those rhetorical     fallacies and devices the efficiency of which depends partly on the irremediable uncertainty—in which in the case of wordofmouth discourse the identity of the words in which they are conveyed remains involved—partly on the want of the time requisite for searching out and bringing to light the errors and false judgments which they serve to propagate and inculcate   by keeping out of the house such persons as on the ground of experience shall either in their own judgment or that of their constitutional judges have been found unable to abide this test section viii means c continued—v attendance punctual and general secured question    constancy and punctuality of attendance on the part of each member and thence of the whole house—to which of the ends does it promise to be conducive answer to all three ends question    in what way to probity answer in sundry ways as follows viz—   in relation to this point whatsoever indication can be afforded by the correct and complete taking down and publishing a mans speeches as above it is only through the medium of his attendance and in proportion to the constancy of his attendance—to wit in the only place in which they can be spoken—that any such speeches are or can be afforded   when on this head such is the state of law and custom as on each occasion with the exception of such of the members whose constant obsequiousness to the will of the archtempter—not to say the c—g— together with the whole of their support on every occasion is secured by the dependence of their situations leaves it altogether at a mans option whether he will attend or not in this case by simply forbearing to attend at the place where in point of moral duty his attendance is due it is on every occasion in the power of any man and every man to afford to the archtempter and that without either shame or danger exactly half the support which without such shame and danger as he could not perhaps have brought himself to expose himself to he could not have afforded by attending and voting on that side—and so in the case of any particular improper and pernicious measure to which on the score of any particular sinister interest whether of a party or altogether private nature he finds himself exposed to the temptation of showing undue favour thus whether it be by leaving unopposed what he ought to have opposed or by leaving unsupported what he ought to have supported—doing effectually by his absence exactly half the mischief which howsoever desirous he durst not have done in case of his presence question    in what way to intellectual aptitude answer the more frequent a mans attendance the greater his experience and the greater his experience the more perfect is that branch of his intellectual aptitude which consists in an acquaintance with the nature of his business whatsoever it may be question    in what way to active talent answer the more frequent a mans attendance the greater will be his experience and be the business what it may the greater his experience in the examination and management of it is the greater will be his expertness at it—that expertness which is at the same time the effect of active talent and the cause of it question    considering how thin except on extraordinary occasions the attendance is at present what reasonable expectation can there be of anything like an habitually universal attendance and by what means can it be secured answer on the part of a trustee or an agent whose duty cannot be performed but at a certain place absentation from that place is a neglect which involves in it every other and against which forfeiture of the trust is as soon as it takes place an effectual as well as gentle remedy let but the operation of election recur with the proposed degree of frequency it brings with it of course this remedy together with a time of trial sure to recur at a stated and never long distant period for insuring the efficacy of this remedy in the instance of every such member to whom     the continuance in his seat is an object of desire—and thereby for securing in every such instance a degree of constancy and punctuality of attendance equal at least to what is seen in any of the offices there can need but one thing more which is—an equally sure and effectual notification of every such act of transgression as it takes place to this purpose a regular and authentic publication of two tables of the following descriptions would obviously suffice— table i dailygeneralattendance table exhibiting for each day the name of every member present at any time of the sitting together with the part taken by each on each question on which there has been a division n b—if to the present tedious inconvenient and inadequate mode of division were substituted the prompt convenient adequate and obvious mode of giving in names each man giving in his name for instance on a card without stirring from his place divisions would of course be much more frequent than at present and the knowledge obtained by the constituent of the political conduct and character of his representative proportionally more complete table ii annualindividualattendance table exhibiting on every day of sitting throughout the year for the instruction of his constituents the conduct of each representative in respect of attendance vote and speech with the grounds of excuse if any for each default in case of nonattendance n b—on extraordinary occasions for party purposes instances have now and then been known on which tables of the nature of the abovementioned generalattendance table have without authority been printed and disseminated by individual hands if the security thus afforded were found not sufficient—punishment in the pecuniary shape combinable with reward in the same shape might in the most simple and effectual manner without need of prosecution or intervention of lawyers and lawyercraft be employed to strengthen it employed—viz by a law framed upon the principle of that class of laws which are said to execute themselves on his election each member deposits with the clerk a sum of money say merely for illustration £ 00 a computation is made of the greatest number of days in the year during which it is probable the house will sit say as before  00 each day of attendance on entrance the member receives back from the hands of a clerk appointed for that purpose £  and at the end of the year if the number of days of sitting has fallen short of the computed number £  is returned for each day whereby it has so fallen short if the aggregate of the sums thus forfeited on each day were divided among the members attendant on that day the force of reward would thus be added to that of punishment of the many opulent and thence idle incapables who at present while the house is left empty crowd the list some would probably even on the proposed plan of representation obtain by means of the illustration shed around them by their opulence a probationary year with little or no intention or at any rate without any persevering habit of regular attendance the superfluity of these idle favourites of fortune would in this way afford a not altogether unwilling supply to the exigencies of the more assiduous and less opulent and here would be emolument without corruption pay for and in proportion to honest service in this way the penalty for nonattendance with or without the reward for attendance might by the light of experience be increased or reduced at pleasure question    the arrangements above proposed—are they to be considered as being when taken together sufficient to insure on the part of the population of the house a degree of probity—appropriate probity—sufficient for all occasions answer against so vast and perpetuallyincreasing a mass of the matter of temptation and corruption constantly and indispensably lodged in a single hand no remedy that promises to act as a preservative can safely be considered as superfluous suppose the plan established and that to its utmost extent it would still be necessary to watch over the matter of corruption in whatsoever part of the system it is lodged—to purge the system of it where it is useless and needless by the whole amount of it—and to restrict the quantity of it in cases where—although in a certain quantity it may for such and such a specific purpose be found necessary—yet in any greater quantity not being necessary it is purely and simply mischievous whatsoever is either good in itself or thought to be so is capable of being employed in the character of matter of reward and whatsoever is employed in the character of matter of reward becomes matter of corruption when applied to a sinister purpose when applied to a man in such manner as to direct his endeavours to the doing good to the one or to the few at the expense of preponderant evil to the many of the matter of reward with or without title to reward nothing ever is or can be bestowed by the king that is not bestowed at the expense of the people title to reward is—adequate service rendered or in some shape or other about to be     rendered to the public and of the matter of reward whatsoever is bestowed without such title established by such proof of title as the nature of the service is susceptible of is bestowed as matter of favour and besides being bestowed in waste whatever is bestowed as matter of mere favour operates as matter of corruption by the expectation of it of the matter of corruption applied to the purpose of corruption—peerages bestowed not only without extraordinary public service but without public service in any shape or so much as the pretence for it constitute a conspicuous example in the shape of a peerage the matter of corruption is capable of being employed to the corrupting of those whose opulence suffices to preserve them from being corrupted by it in any other shape county members and borough members together—the occupiers of no inconsiderable part of the whole number of seats are held by the king in a state of—invisible perhaps but not the less corrupt less constant or less efficient—dependence in one house by peerages in the other by advancements in the peerage the pretended independence of judges is converted into dependence in the reign of george i a bill for restraining the employment of the matter of corruption in this shape passed the house of lords since that time the quantity thus employed has received a prodigious increase the reign in which the bill was thrown out of the commons was the same in which a set of representatives who had been elected by their constituents for three years were engaged and enabled to elect themselves for seven years thus vitiating the constitution by a poison of new invention under the effects of which it has been labouring and lingering ever since section ix inconveniences incident to elections and election judicature question    what are the inconveniences attendant on elections answer they are so various—and dependent many of them on such various contingencies—that it seems scarce possible to make a complete enumeration of them the principal of them will however it is supposed be found comprehended under two heads—viz   to candidates expense and vexation   on the part of electors and persons at large loss of time a loss which is of itself equivalent to so much expense idleness drunkenness quarrels mischief to person and property on the occasion of riots question  0 what are the sources of the expense answer these will vary according as the expenditure of money in such or such a way is permitted or prohibited by law and in case of prohibition according as the prohibition is followed or not followed by compliance here follow some of the principal items—   given with a view to the election though antecedently to a vacancy and thence penaltyproof—entertainments instruments of corruption defying all limitation as well in point of number as in point of expense   previously to the election expense of drawing up and publishing advertisements in newspapers and handbills   at previous meetings—and on the election day at the place of election—expense of engaging persons to attend as clerks and make minutes of proceedings   in the case of distant votes expense of conveyance with or without refreshment during the journey to and from the place of election   money or moneys worth given for votes whether directly in the way of bribery to the voters themselves or indirectly to other persons having the command of votes in the way of influence   in the case of a scrutiny expenses of counsel attorneys and other agents employed in the attack and defence of the disputed votes   occasional lawsuits produced by the uncertainties which to so great an extent hang over the titles to election right and the intrigues employed for the creation preservation or destruction of such rights question    what are the inconveniences attendant on election judicature answer expenses vexations and delays question    wherein consist the expenses answer   in fees to counsel—viz for opinions and in case of a trial before an electioncommittee of the house of commons for attendances day after day at the committee   in money paid to witnesses for expense of journeys and loss of time   in fees to attorneys and other agents for carrying on the cause as above   occasionally in the expenses of suits at law concerning such offices as in the case of seats for boroughs confer the right of voting on the election of members or in some way or other the means of influencing such elections question    wherein consist the vexations answer   in that burthen of attendance which falls upon the members fifteen in number of whom the judicatory is composed—  in those vexations which on that occasion in the shape of anxiety candidates     experience or are liable to experience—  and in those which fall upon such witnesses in whose instance such compensation money as happens to be allowed to them as above is or is thought to be more or less inadequate question    wherein consist the delays answer in the stop so frequently put to the business of the house by the anxiety of members to avoid serving on these judicatories on the occasion of the sort of lottery by which the fifteen who are to serve on each cause are determined—to avoid being thus impounded they have frequently been known to absent themselves in such numbers as not to leave in attendance the number necessary to constitute a house   in the length of time during which in case of an undue return the electors instead of the person who in their eyes is most fit see their share of power exercised by one who in their eyes may be to any degree unfit and the candidate whose right it was to be returned loses the benefit of that right section x election inconveniences—means for their removal question    in what way do the abovementioned means promise to be conducive to the removal of the inconveniences attendant as above on elections and electionjudicature answer as to expense—by striking off at one stroke all expenses whatsoever except such as are comparatively inconsiderable—such as those incurred in the publication of advertisements by the candidates and those incurred incidentally on the occasion of previous meetings to render this effect apparent the slightest glance at the abovementioned sources of expense will suffice   loss of time idleness drunkenness and riots have for their cause large concourses of people with entertainments given to electors by candidates or their friends but any such large concourse of people will have no object nor votes being secret will any man be at any such expense in giving entertainments the receivers of which may for aught he can know be composed in as large a proportion of his adversaries as of his friends   the expense of conveyance and refreshment in the case of distant voters will be struck off altogether for there cannot be any pretence either for offering or receiving money on that score when the utmost effect that could be expected from the longest journey may equally be produced by a paper put into the post   as to lawyers clerks and other agents neither on the occasion of the collecting the votes at the place of election nor on any such occasion as that of an electioncommittee of the house can there be any use or room for any such assistance all that the returning officer will have to do is—out of the boxes denominated from the several candidates to count the number of votingpapers that have been put into each box observing only whether the sum mentioned by the collector as received be really in each instance either equal to or greater than the minimum required by the law to constitute a qualification as to vexations—such as those from the obligation of serving on election judicatories and from the delays attendant on such judicature—there would be no such vexation because there would be no such judicature and there would be no such judicature because there could be nothing to try—unless by possibility and that without probability any such offence should be committed as by the collector a refusal to sign and deliver the duplicate receipt on the votingpaper—or by a postmaster a suppression of a multitude of such papers at the postoffice or by a returning officer a false return—respecting this or that one out of a small number of matters of fact all of them simple and in their nature either of themselves notorious or easily made notorious for the purpose of punishment prosecutions for any such offences would of course be left to the established dilatoriness of the technical mode of procedure pursued in the ordinary courts but for the purpose of applying an immediate parliamentary remedy to a false return a single days sitting of a grenvilleact committee of the house of commons would suffice question    if in the instance of each elector the disposition made by him of his vote were thus to be placed altogether out of the reach of the public eye—so that a vote may be refused to the most worthy given to the most unworthy of all candidates and that without danger and consequently without fear of shame—might there not be too much reason to apprehend that considerations of a purely selfish nature would become generally predominant answer no not to any such effect as that of seating a candidate really and generally deemed less worthy to the exclusion of a candidate really and generally deemed more worthy which effect is the only practical bad effect the case admits of if indeed matters were so circumstanced that by voting in favour of a candidate deemed by themselves comparatively unworthy—or     to cut the matter short in favour of any candidate whatsoever—it were possible for the majority of the electors in any district to obtain each of them for himself any considerable private advantage which by the open mode of voting he would be deterred from aiming at—were this really the case it were certainly too much to expect that they should the greater part of them commonly forego any such advantage and—if such sacrifice of public interest to private were accordingly repeated in a considerable proportion of the whole number of electoral district—the inconvenience to the public service might be found sensible and considerable but when by the shortness of a mans time in his seat and the multitude of the persons to each of whom at the hazard of being betrayed by any one of them and this without any tolerable assurance of his giving his vote in favour of the briber the bribe would be to be offered—when by all these means together the obtainment of a seat by bribery is rendered as it would be to so unprecedented a degree improbable—it does not seem possible to divine by what means a candidate generally deemed the less worthy should obtain an effectual preference to the exclusion of one generally deemed the more worthy on the other hand in the case of the open method hitherto in use the effect of it is on every occasion to force electors—and that in a number to which there are no limits—to give their vote in favour of the less worthy to the exclusion of the more worthy candidate—on pain of suffering each of them some personal inconvenience to the magnitude of which there are no limits and this power—which by means of some such relation as those between landlord and tenant between customer and dealer between employer and person employed in a word between patron and dependent men of overswaying opulence possess and exercise over men less favoured by the gifts of fortune—this power of forcing men to vote against their consciences has been termed the legitimate influence of property and spoken of as that foundationstone by the removal of which the subversion of the constitution would be effected if in the event of his voting in favour of him who in his estimation is the less worthy candidate in preference to him who in his opinion is the more worthy candidate a man sees no prospect of advantage to himself nor of disadvantage in the contrary event—it seems not too much to hope and expect that his vote will most commonly be in favour of that candidate who in his opinion is the more worthy candidate if conscience will not do this it will do nothing but assuredly the less deeply men are led or lead themselves into temptation the more likely they will be to be delivered or to deliver themselves from evil the less it is that the law expects from every man the less it will expose itself to disappointment less than the disposition to do good—so far as it is to be done by serving the public in such cases and in such cases only in which it can be done without an atom of loss or other inconvenience to himself—cannot surely from any man be expected question    any such mode of voting by a mixture of writing and printing—is it not—in comparison of the good old mode of voting practised by the wisdom of our ancestors viz voting by word of mouth—an innovation and that a signal one answer in one point of view it is an innovation—in another not considered as an art in general use the art of writing must—to whatsoever purpose applied and consequently when applied to any such purpose as this—be acknowledged to be an innovation and that a very signal one then comes the art of printing which especially when considered as an art in general use is a still more sweeping one these arts being innovations it cannot but be an innovation to apply them—whether to the purpose in question or to any other purpose but if these be innovations they will not it is hoped be placed in the class of mischievous ones on the other hand—if in this as in other matters the wisdom of our ancestors be considered as consisting in the employing for each purpose at each point of time the best and most convenient method in their time known and practicable—there is not in the mode of voting here proposed any innovation at all much less a mischievous one our ancestors employed the most convenient mode practicable in employing the wordofmouth mode we their posterity employ the most convenient mode practicable in employing the written and printed mode thus doing we may therefore be said and with truth to take the wisdom of our ancestors for our guide section xi collateral advantages referable to the situations of electors placemen lords c question    these that have been mentioned—are they all the advantages resulting or all the uses derivable from the means above proposed to be employed for securing the several elements of aptitude on the part of members answer far from it various collateral advantages may be seen resulting in case of the employing of these means     question    what are the classes of persons by or through whom these collateral advantages would be received answer they are various and in particular five descriptions of persons may be mentioned in this view viz—   parliamentary electors by whom under whatsoever denomination viz by their votes members of the house of commons would be seated   members of the house of lords   kings men whether in or out of the house that is to say the persons occupying under the king the principal public offices   the higher classes of the people taken at large   the lower classes of the people taken at large question  0 in what particular ways does the employment of these means promise to be serviceable in the instance of these several descriptions of persons answer   to parliamentary electors as such it promises increase of appropriate intellectual aptitude—  to kings men in the house and to their respective subordinates in or out of the house increase of appropriate aptitude in all the several points of aptitude viz probity intellectual aptitude and active talent—  to members of the house of lords increase of intellectual aptitude and at the same time increased security for probity—  to the higher classes at large increase of probity and intellectual aptitude—  to the lower classes at large increase of comfort viz by increase of kindness and courtesy towards them on the part of the higher classes—and on their own part increase of appropriate intellectual aptitude from the habit of appropriate discussion question    what are the several parts of the plan by which those several advantages promise to be produced answer   that which seats placemen in the house from the several departments with every right but that of voting—  that which provides for the correct and complete taking down and immediate and regular publication of all speeches made in the house—  and that which gives uniformly extended numbers to the voters in the several electoral districts—liberty to all their votes—and regularly frequent recurrence to the elections question    in the case of electors in what way do the promised collateral advantages promise to take place and from what means answer from the correct and complete publication of all speeches made in the house the electors would as well as the member be gainers by so much as each man pleased—as many of them as pleased—in the article of intellectual aptitude—appropriate intellectual aptitude of the probity of his representative so far as indicated by his attendance—and in case of his attendance of his probity and intellectual aptitude in so far as indicated by his vote—and in case of his speaking of his probity intellectual aptitude and active talent so far as indicated by his speeches—every elector that pleased would on every occasion on which he pleased possess the most complete and correct evidence that the nature of the case admitted of question    in the case of placemen—in what shapes and by what means do the promised collateral advantages promise to take place answer by the tendency which such a situation would have to raise to a maximum in their respective breasts the several endowments or elements of aptitude above mentioned relation being had to the business of their respective offices the beneficial influence of the arrangement would not confine itself to the case of those superordinates in office who in virtue of it would be seated in the house it would extend to their respective subordinates out of the house take first the case of the superordinates—seated in the house and by official duty and the proposed attendancetables rendered constant in their attendance there   probity appropriate probity will in their instance have for its aid the continual scrutiny actual or impending to which they will remain subject—subject with full power of giving to themselves and to one another whatsoever support can be afforded by speeches—that is by evidence and by argument—but without that power of selfsupport deserved or undeserved which a confederated body of men—linked together by one common interest and that a sinister one—afford to themselves and one another by their votes men who while they are copartners and codefendants by their offices are fellowjudges over each other by their votes   to intellectual aptitude—appropriate intellectual aptitude—on the part of official persons of the same descriptions the arrangement promises increase—viz by rendering it to them matter of increased necessity to obtain and retain correct and complete information respecting the whole mass of business habitually transacted in their respective offices lest—by want of correctness completeness or promptness in the answers given by them to questions put to them in the house from time to time in relation to such business—any deficiency on their part in point of appropriate official intellectual aptitude should stand exposed   0 take next the case of the several subordinates not having seats in the house probity—appropriate probity increase in this endowment will in their instance have as will be seen for its immediate cause the increase of both endowments viz probity and intellectual aptitude as above on the part of their respective superordinates having seats in the house   as to probity—be the office what it may the more correctly completely and generally the business of it is understood the more difficult will it be for improbity in any shape on the part of a subordinate to profit by any undue protection which any superordinate in the office might happen to be disposed to give to it and the more correct and complete the information is which the superordinate possesses in relation to the business of his subordinates the more effectual will be the degree of vigilance be it what it may with which it may happen to him to be disposed to look into their conduct in this view   again as to intellectual aptitude—appropriate intellectual aptitude—be the species of information what it may the more frequently any such superordinate in office is liable to be called upon in the house to furnish it the more frequently will he thereby be obliged to address himself to this or that subordinate for information in relation to such parts of the business as happen to be more immediately within the sphere of action of such subordinate and the more frequently and suddenly any such subordinate is liable to be thus called upon the more cogent will be the motives by which he will find himself urged to obtain and retain the most complete mastery which it is in his power to possess of the business in question lest in respect of this element of official aptitude any deficiency should eventually come to be exposed   as to active talent—appropriate active talent—by whatsoever means in these several situations the arrangement in question promises to be conducive to the increase of appropriate intellectual aptitude—by the same means and in the same proportion it promises to be conducive to this more immediately efficient element of official aptitude on the part of official men of both descriptions it moreover promises to secure in another way a more and more ample measure of appropriate active talent as well as intellectual aptitude—viz by keeping out of the respective offices all such unfit persons as—either in their own opinion or in the opinion of those to whom it belongs to judge—are unable to abide such close and continually impending scrutiny question    in the present state of things are not the business and conduct of official men in the several departments open in this same way to this same sort of scrutiny—and such information as comes to be wanted is it not continually called for and obtained from them in and by the house answer to a certain degree yes but not upon a plan approaching in any degree to the character of a complete and adequate one in the superior departments—such as the treasury—the several offices of principal secretary of state for home affairs—of ditto for colonial and foreign affairs—and of ditto for the conduct of the war—in the military department the admiralty and the ordnance—it is matter of accident whether the persons responsible in the first instance shall be in the house of commons in the house of lords or in neither while in several of the subordinate departments—such as the excise and customs the stamp office the assessed tax office the navy office the victualling office and others—so it is that in pursuance of the partial insincere and reluctant system of purification that has been employed—it has by positive law been made impossible for any person acquainted with any part of the business to occupy a seat in the only house of parliament that would otherwise have been accessible to him as if there were anything either pernicious or inconvenient or so much as unusual in a mans having a seat in an assembly in which he has not a vote question    in the instance of any one of these departments is there then ever any ultimate deficiency in respect of such information as in the judgment of the house is proper to be collected and brought to view answer not much perhaps if compared with that which is actually called for but much if compared with that which ought to be called for and would be called for if the means of obtaining and calling for it were thus prompt easy and complete—in the degree in which on the proposed plan they would be in this or that department that might be mentioned—the navyoffice for instance—the business of the office is a chaos inclosed in a dark laybrinth of which no clear and comprehensive view has ever yet been taken so much as by any of the persons habitually at work in it and even in the case of such information as on such points on which it is called for comes to be actually given the degree of promptitude with which it is at present furnished is apt to fall very short of that with which it might and would be furnished if the persons by whom or under whose direction it were to be furnished were constantly under the eye and at the command of the house and many are the instances in which that which does not come promptly and almost at the moment at which it is called for might for     any use that is or can be made of it as well not have come at all and though to answer its proper and intended purposes it is altogether necessary that the matter of such information should be put in a written form—yet to every one to whom jurytrial is known it is manifest how uninstructive and unsatisfactory a dead mass of written evidence frequently is in comparison of what it would be if the import of it were upon occasion explained and elucidated and the correctness and completeness of it secured by apposite questions put on the spot by word of mouth followed by immediate and unpremeditated answers and with further questions in case of need suggested by those answers and so on till every obscure point were made clear—exactly in the same way as for the conducting of his own private business in the bosom of his own family every head of a family obtains such information as he happens to stand in need of from his own children or his own servants question    in the case of the house of lords by what means do the promised advantages promise to take place answer by means of that article which provides for the correct and complete taking down and immediate publishing of all speeches made in the house of commons question    in what way does it promise to be productive of those advantages answer   in case of a bill or other measure sent up from the commons to the lords house—it promises to be productive of a degree of appropriate intellectual aptitude as yet unexampled by furnishing the members of that house—upon whose decision the fate of every proposed law not to speak of other incidental and miscellaneous measures depends—a correct complete and authentic representation of the several arguments by which it has been supported and opposed   in the same way it tends to secure in the same superior quarter an increased degree of appropriate probity—for when all the several arguments which in the case for example of a proposed law have been adduced in favour of it—when all these arguments have been consigned to determinate words and those words committed to writing together with all the arguments that could be found capable of being urged against it on the other side—in this case the more satisfactory and cogent the arguments in favour of it appear the more difficult will it be for any member of the upper house to find out and set in opposition to it any arguments that will bear the test of the public eye or for the whole house without any warrant afforded on the ground of reason to venture howsoever uncongenial it may be to particular interests or favourite prejudices to reject it question    in the case of the higher classes at large by what means do the promised advantages promise to take place answer by means of that article which provides for the frequent recurrence of elections—in conjunction with that which prescribes in relation to the several seats an increased and nearly uniform extent to the numbers of the persons sharing in the election franchise question    in what way answer in both ways—viz in the way of intellectual aptitude and in the way of probity   in the way of intellectual aptitude—appropriate intellectual aptitude it promises to improve the texture of their minds by bringing within the reach of a much greater number of them than at present the prospect of a place in the most efficient seat of government such place being at the same time tenable not absolutely but only upon such terms as after the first year will leave to each man little hope of his being continued in it in any other event than that of his having made manifestation of distinguished active talent or at least intellectual aptitude and by thus giving increase to the number of competitors giving proportional increase to the exertions made by each in the hope of manifesting his superiority over the rest   in the way of probity—appropriate probity—by rendering it the interest of every man—who sets before his eyes any such prospect at whatsoever period of his life it may be his hope to see it realized—to lay a foundation for such hope by an uniform and constant course of kindness and courtesy as well as of justice towards all persons on whom the success of his exertions may be in any degree dependent and in particular as towards the lower classes which of necessity are everywhere the most populous ones in the present state of things—a boroughholder or a man of firstrate opulence who by weight of metal is looked upon as able to sink every bark that should dare to steer the same course commands the seat without need of paying any such price for it question  0 in the case of the lower classes by what means do the promised advantages promise to take place answer by means of the article last above mentioned it being to so considerable an additional extent as above the interest of the higher classes to maintain in their intercourse with the lower classes an uniform and constant course of justice kindness and courtesy—hence by each individual of those higher classes in proportion as his conduct is fashioned by that interest the feelings of the lower classes will be respected and their interest consulted and treated with regard     out of the virtue of the higher classes thus cometh forth the comfort of the lower question    these collateral advantages—are they all that can be stated as likely to result from the plan in case of its being adopted and in proportion as it is adopted answer if the question be confined to the plan itself meaning the arrangements of which it is composed—then so it is that to one or other of the above five heads whatsoever beneficial results can be stated as likely to be produced by the plan would it is supposed be found referable but if the principles by which these have been suggested are found to be those which belong to the nature of the case—if in the list of objects brought to view in the character of ends proper to be aimed at none are included but such as have a just title to a place in it and all are included that have any such just title—let this be supposed and by means of these principles the plan will in this case be found capable of being applied to an additional and perfectly distinguishable use—to wit the serving as a test or touchstone by which the eligibility of every other plan that has been or that can ever be brought forward may be tried in the persons of members—in the persons of the representatives of the people—is it conducive—and if so by which of the several arrangements contained in it is it conducive—to probity to intelligence to active talent by all of them put together is it thus conducive in a sufficient degree the same questions with regard to the several classes of placemen belonging to the executive branch of government the same questions with regard to the lords—without whose concurrence nothing in the way of legislation can on any occasion be done the same questions with regard to the several inconveniences attached in the existing state of things to elections and election judicature such are the questions by the application of which the eligibility absolute and comparative of any and every other plan would it is supposed be rendered pretty clearly apparent strong and sound may that plan be pronounced that shall have stood examination upon these interrogatories selfconvicted of insufficiency the plan that shall have shrunk from the test which they afford the arrangements themselves can no farther be of use than in proportion as they are adopted but—although they should not any one of them be adopted—yet the principles on which they are grounded and by which they were suggested might still in this way be found to be not altogether without their use     a sketch of the various proposals for a constitutional reform in the representation of the people introduced into the parliament of great britain from    0 to      advertisement the information contained in the ensuing paper is in so high a degree apposite and instructive that the temptation to reprint it in this place could not be resisted the hand by which it was drawn up was that of mr mcadly author of the memoirs of the life of dr paley and other works to the favour of that gentleman the author of the present tract was some years ago indebted for a few copies and by the want of acquaintance with his present address is precluded from the faculty of requesting his consent no booksellers

that instead of depriving a county of its representative alluding to the case of mr wilkes one or more members ought to be added to the representation of the counties in order to operate as a balance

the natural relation between the constitution and the elected i have publicly expressed my earnest wishes for a more full and equal representation by the addition of one knight of the shire in the county as a farther balance to the mercenary boroughs i have thrown out this idea with the just diffidence of a private man when he presumes to suggest anything new in a high matter animated by your approbation i shall continue humbly to submit it to the public wisdom as an object to be most deliberately weighed accurately examined and maturely digested and again in a letter to earl temple april

my wish be represented in parliament that the metropolis which contains in itself a ninth part of the people and the counties of middlesex york and others which so greatly abound with inhabitants

june  d    0—the duke of richmond was introducing his bill to restore annual parliaments to procure a more equal representation and to regulate the election of scotch peers when he was prevented from proceeding by the alarming riots in palaceyard by his graces bill it was intended to enact and declare that every commoner of this realm excepting infants persons of insane mind and criminals incapacitated by law hath a natural unalienable and equal right to vote in the election of his representative in parliament that the election of members to serve in the house of commons ought to be

effectual and practicable measures ought to be taken for the better preventing both bribery and expense in the election of members to serve in parliament   that whenever it shall be proved before a select committee of the house of commons duly appointed to try and determine the merits of any election or return for any place in the kingdom that the majority of the electors had been guilty of corrupt practices in such election it will be proper in all such cases that such place shall from thenceforth be disabled from sending representatives to parliament and that such electors as shall not

they were both gradual the first was calculated to produce an early if not an immediate change in the constitution of the boroughs and the second was intended to establish a rule by which the representation should change with the changes of the country it was therefore his intention to provide in the first instance that the representation of thirtysix of the most decayed boroughs which should be disfranchised on their voluntary application to parliament for an adequate consideration should be distributed among the counties and that afterwards any which might still remain of a

resident householders in every county—resident because such persons must be best acquainted with every local circumstance and can attend at the place of election with the least inconvenience or expense to themselves or the candidate and householders because being masters or fathers of families they must be sufficiently responsible to be entitled to the franchise they are the natural

commits the choice of representatives to select bodies of men of such limited numbers as renders them an easy prey to the artful or a ready purchase to the wealthy to regulate the right of voting upon an uniform and equitable principle and finally to shorten the duration of parliaments and by removing the causes of that confusion litigation and expense with which they are at this day conducted to

take into consideration the necessity of a reform in the representation mr madocks seconded the motion and the house divided—ayes   —noes   —majority    my plan said sir francis burdett consists in a very few and very simple regulations and as the disease we labour under has been caused by the disunion of property and political right which reason and the constitution say should never be separated the remedy which i shall propose will consist in reuniting them again for this purpose i shall propose— ∥that the freeholders householders and others subject to direct taxation in support of the poor the church and the state be required to elect members to serve in parliament     that each county be subdivided according to the taxed male population and each subdivision required to elect one representative that the votes be taken in each parish by the parish officers and all elections finished in one and the same day that the parish officers make the returns to the sheriffs court to be held for that purpose at stated periods and that parliaments be brought back to a constitutional duration    house of commons monday may   st    0—the hon thomas brand moved that a committee be appointed to inquire into the state of the representation of the people in parliament and of the most efficacious means of rendering it more complete and to report the same with their observations thereupon to the house he was seconded by  and on a division there were—ayes    —noes    —majority     mr brand said that he did not mean to touch the right of voting for county members except by letting in copyholders and assimilating the mode of voting in scotland to the practice of this country but that whilst he left the right of voting so far untouched he should propose to disfranchise the boroughs in which the members were returned upon the nomination of individuals and as the numbers of the house would be diminished in that proportion to transfer the right of returning such members to populous towns and to apply any surplus to the more populous counties that he would recommend the duration of parliament to be made triennial together with a concurrent arrangement for collecting the votes by districts and parishes and that with a view to the independence of parliament persons holding offices without responsibility should not be suffered to have seats in that house†    house of commons friday may  th     —the hon thomas brand moved for leave to bring in a bill to repeal the act    geo ii c    and to entitle copyholders to vote for knights of the shire the marquis of tavistock seconded the motion and the house divided—ayes   —noes    —majority     mr brand said he would also propose to get rid of nomination and to throw the representation of the close boroughs into an enlarged representation of the more populous counties one part therefore of the plan which he had in view was to bring in a bill for the abolition of those boroughs and the consequent appropriation of a more extensive suffrage to the more populous counties from whence an equalization of members to the different parts of the empire would arise he did not wish to make any innovation but rather to restore to the constitution what the great innovator time had taken from it‡     radical reform bill with extracts from the reasons bill intituled parliamentary reform act being an act for the more adequate representation of the people in the commons house of parliament preliminary explanations universal suffrage annual parliaments and election by ballot—at public meetings these are the words commonly it is believed employed for expressing the essential features of radical reform another expression however there is which in some respects seems to afford a promise of being more apposite this is—secret universal equal and annual suffrage or say—secresy universality equality and annuality of suffrage suffrage is the common subject to which all these qualities are referable it presents a bond of union by which all these elements may in our conception be knit together into one whole i secresy is of the very first importance because where there is no secresy there can be no assurance of genuineness the vote may be bribed or forced and whether bribed or forced the vote is the expression of the wish—not of the voter but of him by whom he is either bribed or forced so far as this state of things has place the wishes by which the choice is determined will be—not the wishes of the many governed by the interests of the many but the wishes of the few governed by the interests of the few—by that comparatively narrow body of interest which is in a state of continual opposition to the universal interest and to which in so far as the opposition has place or by the ruling few is thought to have place the universal happiness will be made a constant sacrifice so at all times it has been and till the many have at all times the choice of those by whom their affairs are managed so at all times from the very nature of man it will be sure to be in this bill in its largest shape when published with the accompanying reasons on which it has been grounded the following will in a more particular manner be shown to be the distinguishable evils to the avoidance of which secresy of suffrage is indispensable—   miselection nonelection or nullelection—positive miselection has place in so far as the representative returned is positively unfit comparative miselection has place in so far as if the representative actually returned had not been returned another more fit would have been returned   oppression this has place in so far as by fear of evil at the hands of an individual a person entitled to vote is induced to vote contrarily to what would otherwise have been his wishes or prevented from voting according to what would otherwise have been his wishes   corruption this has place in so far as by hope or in consideration of some good at the hands of an individual a person is induced to vote contrarily to what would otherwise have been his wishes or is prevented from voting according to what would otherwise have been his wishes   insincerity this has place in so far as whether by oppression or by corruption a man is induced to give his vote contrarily to what would otherwise have been his wishes—to give as the expression of a mans unbiassed wishes a vote which is not so is imposture   vexation and expense by journeys to and from the place of election or demurrage at that place under the yoke of the oppression   needless discord and eventual illwill between man and man the consequence of forced declaration of sentiments or pretended sentiments   injuries to person and property by means of tumults from forced or bribed declarations of pretended sentiments       injuries to reputation by election calumnies   vexation and expense by litigation  0 needless expense from other causes by secresy of suffrage even without the aid of any other remedy almost all these evils are either completely done away or at least lessened the only exceptions are—nonelection and nullelection this will be shown at length in the work at large without secresy all those other elements of reform put together would be worse than useless not to speak of tradesmen dependent on the opulent for custom—labourers and household servants and journeymen manufacturers—all dependent on masters for employment—and paupers dependent on magistrates for existence the last class but too little distinguishable from the others—all these would have to give their votes according to the declared or presumed wishes of those on whom they are dependent in despite of their own wishes and their own consciences but of these is composed the great majority of the people thus would the supposed remedy be but an aggravation of the disease the votes of the majority of the electors and thence of the whole number of the representatives would thus be at the command of magistrates—of magistrates such as the manchester magistrates and through them of ministers such as lord sidmouth and monarchs such as his prince regent but magistrates such as are not already like the manchester magistrates may all of them but for radicalism be so at any time for they are all of them placed by the monarch—all of them removable at his pleasure in the state of new york the members of the house of representatives are all of them elected by secret suffrage it was declaredly as a measure of experiment that in      secresy was in this case appointed in the first instance by the experience of fortytwo years it stands confirmed yet in that country the demand for secresy as a security against intimidation and corruption is as nothing compared to what it is in this secresy at the hustings it has been said is of no avail for a man who has given his vote in secret may always it is said be made to tell how he has given it to tell how he has given it the deception lies in the word tell what matters it what a man has told when by nothing that a man has told or ever can tell can he cause any other man to know when by no man but the voter himself the vote given by him has been perceived not only may he avoid letting any person know what the vote has been but for him to communicate to any other person any such knowledge is absolutely impossible i say to colonel lowther or mr lamb—sir i have given you my vote in so saying suppose i have said true good but how can the honourable gentleman know that in so saying i have said true he can no more know that what i have said is true than he could have known it to be true if it had been false before the day has closed mr such a one suppose has said a score of times the thing which is not the same mr such a one goes to bed in the persuasion that for a fact to be said to be so and really to be so is exactly the same thing—oh ye of little thought ii universality we say for shortness instead of virtual universality no man means that children that can but just speak should vote no man appears to mean that females should vote to some it has appeared necessary to exclude from voting persons insane and criminals to exclude them by special exception no wonder—yet nothing can be more needless such as are lawfully under confinement would no more be let out to vote than for any other purpose as to those who are not under confinement—criminality if it means anything to the purpose means mischievousness but the most mischievous among criminals adjudged and denominated such after legal conviction could not set his foot in either house without finding himself in company with men in numbers—not to say in a vast majority—more mischievous than himself men whose principal differences from himself consists in impunity derived from situation and confederacy—in impunity added to greater mischievousness men whose mischievousness was acting on the largest scale while his was acting on a petty scale exclude criminals how will you exclude criminals exclude criminals convict yes that you may but even in this class in which mischievousness is not secured from the imputation of criminality by highhanded impunity—of those convicted how small is the proportion to those not convicted look to the effect look to the effect—to look out for grounds for exclusion is mere lost labour where if all that are proposed to be excluded are admitted without exception no practical bad effect can be produced but by a lasting majority of the house   0 members might be sent from the hulks by scores and yet no lasting mischief done all the persons put together whom for any other cause than want of property it has ever been proposed to exclude would nowhere under universality and equality of suffrage suffice to return so much as a single member to the house all itineration of voters from pollingplace to pollingplace is by this bill section   excluded this considered take to this purpose foreigners in amity—even foreigners at enmity—outlaws bankrupts insolvents—yes and peers into the bargain—not by voting do peers do the mischief that they do—not by voting but by bribing and above all by forcing votes—the truth of the position will not be disproved by annoyance to the members and thus by disturbance in an unlimited degree to the business of the assembly mischief without bounds might indeed be done done by any single member whether from the hulks or from the drawingroom but against all such mischief provision is made in this bill more effectual than has ever yet been in the house see section    it is for want of considering the subject on a sufficiently large scale that objections deduced from the unfitness of individuals without considering whether the number of them could ever swell so as to produce any mischievous effect have in a case of this sort been considered as applicable exclusion in so far as unnecessary is by no means innoxious out of it grow contestation litigation miselection nullelection these are the reasons and are they not sufficient ones—for excluding it yes exclusion is in all such cases fit for nothing but to be excluded look once more to america to united america in some of the states the pecuniary qualification exacted is real in others it is no more than nominal and where qualification is but nominal suffrage is virtually universal payment of a tax which every man is admitted to pay and which the poorest can afford to pay is a qualification purely nominal if in the admission of universalsuffragemen there were any mischief—any so much as the least danger—it could not in that country fail to be seen—seen by the difference in point of social order and prosperity between those states in which the pecuniary qualification is highest and those in which it amounts to nothing in pennsylvania it amounts to nothing number of free inhabitants of all conditions ages and sexes  00000 number of voters at a late election  0 000 these numbers were lately given me by an authority above dispute pennsylvania is of all the state among the most flourishing and the most orderly if in this respect there be any difference under radicalism all property it is said would be destroyed so says mr deputy jacks all property destroyed the monarchy and the aristocracy notwithstanding mr deputy jacks—has he ever heard of such a place as pennsylvania in pennsylvania for these forty years radicalism has been supreme radicalism without monarchy or aristocracy radicalism without controul and not any the slightest shock has property there ever received property it is continually said is the only bond and pledge of attachment to country—not it indeed want of property is a much stronger one he who has property can change the shape of it and carry it with him to another country whenever he pleases he who has no property can do no such thing in the eyes of those who live by the labour of others the existence of those by whose labour they live is indeed of no value not so in the eyes of the labourers themselves life is not worth more to yawners than to labourers and their own country is the only country in which they can so much as hope to live among a hundred of them not ten exceptions to this will you find now as to the qualification by reading—at first blush it seems to involve exclusion—it does no such thing in effect from two to three months social pastime at the hours of repose from work would give it to all adults in whose eyes the privilege were worth that price and he in whose eyes it were not worth that price could not with much justice complain at the not having it qualification by householdership does involve exclusion for it is not in every mans power to pay rent and taxes for a house householdership is evidence of property it is for this cause that it is required by those who stipulate for it qualification by payment of taxes—that too involves exclusion if by payment of taxes be meant that which is anything to the purpose qualification by payment to indirect taxes if those be the taxes meant is universality of suffrage for where is the human being that pays not to taxes on consumption to the taxes called indirect taxes payment to direct taxes—to assessed taxes for example—is householdership under another name qualification by reading involves no exclusion for every man who chose could give it to himself he could do so before a bill such as this could go through the forms even supposing honourable house ever so well disposed to it an elector is a trustee a trustee ought not to be unfit for his trust it is to reading that the people owe all their strength that strength at which even thus early tyrants tremble     iii by equality of suffrage is meant equality of effect and value as between the suffrage of one man and the suffrage of another the greater the number of the votes to each seat the smaller is the effect of each vote   of practicable equality as between district and district the principal use is to secure even in the least populous district a number of votes sufficient to render bribery and corruption in other shapes impracticable and upon this plan such will be the number if the utmost inequality as between the number of votes to one seat and that to another is confined within the limits here proposed see section   what should never be out of mind is—that without the reduction universally made in the marketable value of votes by this equality as between suffrage and suffrage—without the reduction made in the value of a seat by annuality of suffrage—without the defalcation made from the effective force of corruption by the greatest practicable reduction made by the exclusion of placemen in the quantity of money and moneys worth applicable to the purpose of corruption—without these aids secresy of suffrage would not suffice to insure exclusion of effective corruption for to an extent more or less considerable—without discoverable and punishable bribery—money moneys worth or benefits in various other shapes might be made receivable by a voter in the event of the success of this or that candidate and not otherwise and thus without hazard of prosecution the ends of bribery might be obtained still so long as the majority of the members are not kept in a constant state of sinister obsequiousness by the monarch or the minister corruption among the voters to this or that seat—nay even corruption on the seats themselves—is but an evil in tendency not a sensible one   in the case of the county seats—from inequality of suffrage that is to say from inequality of distance from the polling place as between some residences and others—comes inordinate distance in the case of the largest polling districts thence either undue exclusion or unduly oppressive burthen by expense and loss of time in journeys to and fro and demurrage   supposing inequality between district and district so great as to afford a ground for the supposition of partiality on the part of the carvers here would be a sense of injustice evil in this shape the provision made in section   will it is hoped be found effectually to exclude suppose for instance that by local circumstances reason should be afforded for allotting to this or that election district not more than half the average number of votes to this or that other not fewer than double the average number by inequality to no greater amount than this supposing good local grounds assigned no considerable cause for suspicion would it is believed be produced iv of annuality of suffrage the main uses seem to be as follows—   the faculty of divesting of their power all unfit representatives before they have had time to produce any lasting mischief   the keeping them out of the way of temptation by rendering their breach of trust not worth purchasing by the corruptorgeneral at any price for which it would be worth the while of a man in his situation to sacrifice his good name to this frequency of recurrence objections have been made one is composed of the proportionably frequent repetition of the election evils but those evils arise solely out of the existing system and they will be seen to be completely excluded by the system here proposed at present they are carefully preserved or even increased—increased to the utmost by the rich and worthless in order to keep off all competitors that would be fitter men than themselves   another objection is—that under annuality of suffrage the changes of hands would not in fact be so frequent as they now are under septenniality reelection it is said would grow into a habit and there would be no particular time for breaking it the answer is—change oftener than once in seven years would not then be as it is now impossible impossible how strong soever the reason for it may be unless indeed it should happen to be regarded as called for by the particular interest of the monarch and the minister and then it may be made with every imaginable degree of frequency under annuality with the degree of frequency thus expressed the change will actually take place as often as in the judgment of the only persons who have before them the means of judging right there is a sufficient reason for it rendering a thing impossible is but an awkward contrivance for rendering it more frequent means more refined could scarcely be found means more effectual could without much difficulty   another objection is—that under annuality there would not be time enough for going through a business of any considerable length by the same hands the short answer is—that if fit for the business the same hands will be continued if not fit the sooner they give place to such as are fit the better under the existing system interruption of all business that by being beneficial to the universal interest would be prejudicial to the separate and sinister interest of the ruling few does and to an enormous degree constantly take place and so long as the existing system continues the evil thus produced by it     will continue interruption and not only that but what is so much worse prevention see parl reform cat introd §    under the proposed system it would not take place see this bill §    on the other hand no business that is brought on in pursuance of the sinister interest of the rulers ever can suffer interruption for theirs is the choice of times time there always is for depredation and oppression time there never is for remedy against either just so as at manchester time there was enough for killing or hacking men women and children no time for receiving proof of it methods there are and most effectual ones for keeping off whatever it is that right honourable gentlemen choose to keep off and this without so much as the trouble of a debate for hundreds of years in times of the greatest prosperity—of as great prosperity as the ferocity the ignorance and the superstitions of the times admitted of—suffrages were given and representatives renewed not only annually but oftener the result much good no preponderant evil assigned or assignable if lord holland will indemnify the bookseller the proof shall be printed at large from the records a careful and honest hand i know of has made large progress in the collection of it how happy would his lordship be to find that as to this matter he has been under mistake how prompt to declare it the states in the north american union are by this time twentytwo and in every one of them suffrage is annual one excepted in which it is or was halfyearly in the congress alone it is biennial in this case manifestly by reason of the length of journeys between the place of meeting and some of the states from the frequency in question no inconvenience was ever so much as alleged but to eyes determinately shut nothing is ever visible annuality is incompatible it is said with any government so say whigs and tories yet in united america government is in a better state than in england even whigs may be seen declaring this in republican america there are no dungeoning acts no gagging acts no riot acts accordingly there are no riots in republican america there is no punishment for free inquiry on pretence of punishing seditious meetings and blasphemy there is therefore no sedition there and there is more religion than in england the english constitution has its good points and it has its bad points the good points are—those which have been preserved in america with improvement and increase the bad points are—those which it has in common with turkey with russia with spain with austria with prussia with that country from which the guelphs came and to which they may perhaps return the bad points cannot very easily be defended one by one they may with perfect ease be defended all together and this is what is always done although not always meant as often as a man joins in the parrot cry of constitution glorious constitution matchless constitution those whose sinister interest attaches them to the bad points call of course for our attachment to the whole and thus it is that in the name of loyalty our attachment is called for to whatever is most mischievous and vile a work is in the press from which a judgment may in some measure be formed whether among so many seats of misrule as there are in germany there is any other state in which it is carried so near to perfection as in hanover whether the scraps of liberty which had been left by the bonapartes have not already been destroyed there under the guelphs in what is there effected read what is here intended the principles of charles the first were read in the sermons of doctors sibthorpe and manwaring and in the judgments and opinions of the judges of that time the principles of george the fourth may be read in the sermons of the courier and in the charges of lord chiefjustice anybody secresy universality equality and annuality—behold in them the four cardinal points of the constitutional compass secresy is the polar star without secresy of suffrage universality equality and annuality altogether would be worse than nothing even without universality without equality without annuality secresy would of itself do much nor against it even by those who suffered most by it could so much as a shadow of objection be raised secresy would be a strong pledge for complete reform and of itself no inconsiderable step to it it would of itself be a great part of the reform and might engage men to wait with thankfulness and patience for the rest in what multitudes would the galling chains of terrorism be broken by it—what a downfal to the white slavetrade—what a body of private prudence rescued from oppression—what a body of genuine patriotism rescued from selfsacrifice mr brougham would second the motion or a laugh would run through westmoreland as often as his eloquence ventured to indulge itself in a complaint of lowther influence all cry of danger—danger to property—would here be without pretext if in radicalism there were any real danger it might be excluded by graduality yes by graduality but by what graduality not assuredly by that which lord erskine and his clients have so plainly shown they mean—a gradual progress in doing nothing no but a gradual introduction of members really chosen by those by whom they pretend to be chosen—really chosen by those whose     interest is the universal interest the proportion—say a fourth at a time say a fifth say a sixth france which under its newly simplified and improved mode of election lets in a fifth at a time has in that particular shown us an example i mention this—not as necessary—not as eligible—but as that which a whig if there were any sincerity in him could not object to against radicalism where anything better than bellowing or barking has been brought forward it has been in the shape of a prediction of the destruction of property as a result to be apprehended whether for this apprehension there be any substantial ground may be seen in a paper with which this will ere long be followed under the title of radicalism not dangerous title of

that nothing within the box shall at that time be visible to any other person   lest by the place of the hands while selecting it should be known or guessed from what proposed members box a voter has selected his card the boxes are so disposed that no name can be reached on either side till the arm has been considerably advanced within the box   in this view the space destined for each proposed members voting cards is distributed into different boxes and in situation the different boxes allotted to different members are made to alternate one with another  0 or else the whole number of cards together may be lodged promiscuously in one and the same receptacle    the receptacles may be either separate boxes or compartments made in the same box    in the boxes the cards are placed with the inscribed sides uppermost    each selection box is made to contain namecards for six proposed members and no more    should the number of the proposed members ever exceed this number each successive proposed member or his recommenders must at the production of the recommendatory certificate furnish at their own expense a selectionbox capable of containing nameboxes equal in number to the whole

into which it fits in such sort that when sealing wax being dropt on it has been impressed with a seal the lid cannot be opened unless the seal is broken   in this lid is a slit into which at the time of voting the cards are successively dropped near this slit rises a pin on which slides a metallic plate by which the slit is occasionally closed   in form and dimensions the slit is so ordered as to receive the cards with ease without exposing the name to view as they are dropt in or afterwards art vii here follows the description of a distinction ticket—   place where worn the front of the hat

electiondistrict as soon as the general recommendatory certificate paper has been completed and as per articles iv and v the number of placardingplaces ascertained—the districtclerk shall cause to be printed in the placard form a number of such certificates equal to that of the said placardingplaces with a surplus sufficient for incidental demand having so done he shall by post as per article iii transmit to each of the several polling offices within his district a number correspondent to that of the several placardingplaces within that polling district with a competent surplus as above art

with costs art xii of the three original definitive recommendatory certificates delivered in favour of each proposed member at the electiondistrict office as per section   article iii the clerk shall by the next post transmit one to the national election office section  — voters titles preestablished art i the following are the evils for the avoidance of which the arrangements in this section are ordained—   vexation and consumption of time in the proof of claims to the right of suffrage and in contestations respecting it   in case of disagreement eventual litigation with the vexation and expense attached to it   consumption of time in such sort as incidentally to produce nonelection or nullelection or at least the excluding of persons in number more or less considerable from the exercise of their rights of suffrage   in case householders votes alone are by law admitted intrusion of inmates votes for the avoidance of these evils it has been thought good that antecedently to the day of voting the title of each voter shall have been established art ii for this purpose at each polling office three several register books are to be kept namely—   the application book in this book entries are made of applications made for blank votemaking certificates   the voters book in this book persons by or for whom application is made as voters are set down in the alphabetical order of their surnames   the filledup certificate book this book is composed of the duplicates of the votemaking certificates in the state they are in when filled up they are kept in the office to form a standard of comparison for the corresponding duplicates when produced     on the polling day in support of each persons claim to be admitted to vote art iii   days at the least before the appointed polling day to enable himself to give a vote the proposed voter must take out two copies of a blank form of a votemaking certificate as per section   the place at which he applies for this purpose is the polling office of the polling district within which the habitation in respect of which he proposes to vote is situated he may apply in person or by any person appearing for him as agent for this purpose in the application book before the blank certificates are delivered entry is made of the name and habitation of the proposed voter on whose behalf the application is made the description given of his name is that which is prescribed in section   the description given of the habitation is that which is prescribed in section  0 if the applicant is the proposed voter himself note of his being so is taken by entering under the word application with which one column of each page in the book is headed the word personal adding as per sections   and  0 the description as given by him of the habitation in respect of which he claims to vote also whether as householder or as inmate if he be any other person then under the words application by agent with which another column in the same page is headed are inserted the name and habitation of the proposed voter as also the name and abode of the agent to each such entry is prefixed an indication of the year month and day of the month on which the application was made also the name of the applicant signed by him this done on payment of  d for each the blank certificates are delivered art iv the use of the voters book is to exhibit the names of voters in alphabetical order that being the only order in which reference can at all times without loss of time be made whenever a pair of blank certificates has been delivered and entry has accordingly been made in the application book as per article iii—the name of the proposed ovter is entered in this book according to the situation of his surname in the alphabet in a line with it are written the words certificate delivered together with the month and day of the month and the page in the application book for each of these indications a column headed accordingly is provided art v the instruments being thus delivered   days at the least before the day of election the proposed voter must come in and produce them at the polling office by himself or agent filled up as per section   these the clerk examines and if he finds the duplicates sufficiently conformable to each other and to the directions contained in the tenor of them as per section   he returns one of them forthwith to the person by whom it was produced but first he writes or stamps on it the words examined and found correct and redelivered to be used in giving the vote together with the month the day of the month and his signature the other he retains for the use of the office it constitutes a page in the book called the filledup certificate book he attests it in like manner and instead of the words examined and found correct and redelivered c he writes or stamps on it the words the duplicate hereof was examined found correct and redelivered to be produced on giving the vote art vi for remedy against misconception error or fraud in the composition of votemaking certificates it is thus ordained— if in either duplicate of a pair of filledup certificates any error is observed by the clerk intimation of such error and of the alteration necessary for correction is afforded by him it is expressed by entries briefly made in the margin of the instrument and authenticated with signature and date as per article v if the correction thus required be of such a sort as that for the prevention of fraud it is in his judgment necessary that a fresh meeting of the votemakers should have place—he thereupon after entry made of the errors and of the alterations requisite gives intimation of such necessity and of the cause thereof to the person applying and writes or stamps upon the paper the words a fresh meeting is required if in his judgment such fresh meeting is not necessary he stamps or writes the words a fresh meeting is not required if in his judgment consideration being had of the state of the errors and the situation quantity and quality of the corrections requisite the same instrument cannot conveniently be made to serve—he delivers a fresh blank instrument having first written or stamped on the corrected instrument the words returned for returned for incorrectness as     above explained fresh pair of blank certificates at the same time delivered—with date and attestation as above if in one only of the duplicates error requiring correction is observed he retains for the filledup certificate book the correct duplicate but for the memorandums instead of the words duplicate hereof found correct and redelivered to be produced on giving the vote he inserts the words this duplicate found correct the other found incorrect and redelivered for correction if in both duplicates error requiring correction is observed he returns them both noted as above in this case he delivers blank certificates or not as the case may require art vii for remedy against accidental loss or defacement of votemaking certificates before or after filling up it is thus provided— suppose any such accident to have happened the proposed voter by himself or agent makes application at the office for a fresh certificate or fresh certificates as the case may be he declares the nature of the accident for example—lost by accident destroyed by accident defaced by accident if defaced and not lost he produces it of this declaration entry is made in the application book in the same manner as in the case of an original application for such entry the same fee is paid such application may be made more than once but if from the number of successive applications already made by or in behalf of the same proposed voter it should appear to the clerk that it was through sinister design or wantonness that they were made delivery may be and ought to be refused by him in this case entry shall be made by him noting the number of the times and adding delivery refused on suspicion of sinister design or wantonness so likewise if it be suspected by him that a person applying in the name and character of a proposed voter is not such proposed voter but an impostor or that a person applying in the name and behalf of a proposed voter was not authorised by him in all these cases he shall in the application book make entry of the ground on which as above delivery was refused art viii on payment of a fee of  d for the whole these and all other books of the office are in officehours open to the inspection of all persons so far as may be without hindrance to the more material parts of the business section  — election how art i for the periodical day of the first meeting of a parliament see section      days before that day the election process everywhere commences it commences at the subdistrict office where there is one it is completed at the districtoffice— art ii here follows the mode of proceeding at the pollingoffice— at the time of voting the station of the pollclerk is separated by a rail or other sufficient partition from that of the multitude voters and others near to him is the secretselection box described in section   within reach of this box is the station of a votereceiving clerk by whom the voting card immediately as it is selected by the voter is received from him and dropped into the votereceiving box—both described in section       that the state which at the time of the delivery the voting card is in may be perfectly seen by the whole company present the station of the receiving clerk is though at some distance and by a rail separated from the spot occupied by the voter at the selectionbox yet within reach of it and at the same time elevated a little above it in such sort that the card cannot be delivered by the voter without his raising his arm to deliver it nor received by the receivingclerk without his lowering his arm to receive it art iii the hustings are more or less raised above and by a sufficient partition separated from the attendant multitude included therein are—  the station of the pollclerk   the station of the proposed members or of any such agents of theirs as are in attendance   the station of the voters secretselection box   the station of a votereceiving clerk with his votereceiving box to prevent confusion interposed between the station of the attendant multitude and the hustings is a passage in width sufficient to afford a convenient station to one man in length suppose six eight or ten feet formed by a sufficient partition with a bar at each end to give admission to a voter the bar at the end furthest from the hustings is lifted up he presents himself with his distinctionticket on his hat on his admittance into the passage—for the information of all concerned and in particular of the pollclerk the voters surname first and then the first letter of it are audibly pronounced and at the same time the voters copy of his votemaking certificate is handed up by him to the pollclerk on receiving the voters copy the pollclerk being informed as above turns to the corresponding copy as it stands in the filledup certificatebook a short glance enables him to see whether the copy thus prescribed is the duplicate of it as soon as he is satisfied of its being so the bar opens and the voter repairs to the secretselection box within which he chooses the card that bears the name of the proposed member for whom he means to vote art iv in the secretselection box the voter looking through the pane of glass in the top introduces his hand or hands at the side apertures and having taken up the card that bears the name of the proposed member for whom he means to vote closes it while yet in the box by applying together the two white surfaces with the name leaving on the outside the two black ones in this closed state he takes it out and holding it aloft delivers it to the votereceiving clerk the votereceiving clerk without opening it instantly drops it into the receivingbox if the two plates of which this card is composed are not clapped together as above by means of the hinges on which they turn the name on one or both of them may be visible in that case the card is torn and he who presents it loses his vote so if they are folded together with the two black surfaces on the inside in this case the name will be on the outside of each of them and thus be visible if the proposed voter takes out more cards than one they are replaced in the box and he loses his vote if having received the card closed with the two black surfaces on the outside the receivingclerk before he drops it into the receivingbox opens it in such sort that the name or any part of it is visible—he is by the pollclerk dismissed from his office and divested of his distinctionticket on the spot art v as soon as the voter hath as above delivered up his card he is let out through a bar which to prevent stoppages is different from the one through which he was let in as he passes out his copy of his votemaking certificate by which admission to the selectionbox was procured to him is returned to him for the purpose of its being eventually employed by him on succeeding elections see art xii art vi for dispatch two or more secretselection boxes may be employed one receivingclerk may serve for two or more boxes art vii as soon as the time appointed for the admission of voters is expired the pollclerk closes the votereceiving box by sliding the plate over the slit as per section   art vi he then applies his seal to the junctures in such manner that without breaking it the lid cannot be opened nor the slit uncovered he then admits the election agents in like manner and for the like security to apply their seals lastly he covers the whole by a covering of cloth without seam the junctures are secured by seals as above the box is in this state delivered by the pollclerk to a messenger by whom it is taken to and deposited in the electiondistrict office art viii regard being had to the respective distances the electionmastergeneral appoints the time or times of the day at or before which the votereceiving boxes shall from the several pollingoffices have been received at the districtelection office art ix here follows the mode of proceeding at the districtelection office—   at this office are provided boxes marked with the names of the several proposed members   as soon as the votereceiving boxes from     the several pollingdistricts are come in or the time allowed for their coming in is elapsed—they are opened by the districtclerk in presence of the several proposed members or their agents or such of them as choose to attend   in presence of the whole company the votingcards are thereupon taken out and sorted the cards respectively appertaining to the several proposed members being dropped into their respective boxes art x the numbers being immediately summed up the name of the proposed member in whose favour the comparative majority of the whole number of votes is found to have been given is openly declared the instrument of return drawn up by means of a blank form provided by the electionmastergeneral the same for every district is attested by the districtclerk the agents of the several proposed members add their respective attestations or their declining so to do is noted on the instrument of return are entered the numbers of the votes for the several proposed members at the several polling districts the instrument is that same day transmitted by post to the nationalelection office art xi if and as often as by tempestuous weather or other accident the free resort of the voters to the pollingoffice within the ordinarily appointed time has been rendered impracticable the pollclerk within his district has power to prolong the time in such case he shall give the earliest possible notice to the voters in general to the districtelection office and to the nationalelection office art xii follow the conditions on which to save time and trouble each voters certificate after having been employed in any voting district may be employed at each succeeding election without need of fresh signatures by cocertifiers— at the first election at which it is employed the pollclerk before the voters departure from the hustings redelivers to him his certificate having first stamped or caused to be stamped upon it the words following together with the date and his signature—redelivered to be employed at succeeding elections on each succeeding election if at the time of its exhibition at the office there has not on the part of the voter been any change of name or abode it is again as per section   marked with the words—found correct and redelivered for further use together with other words and figures to the effect in that section described if there has been any change of name entry thereof shall be made introduced by the words—present name if there has been any change of abode in that case are to be added words and figures designative of the fresh abode preceded by the stamped words—present abode a votemaking certificate once employed in any one polling district may on these conditions be thereafter employed in any other polling districts in the united kingdom art xiii for the more effectual prevention of disturbance every person officiating as clerk of a pollingoffice shall within his subdistrict and every subdistrict immediately continguous to it—during the continuance of the whole of the election process possess and exercise so far as shall be necessary for this special purpose the powers belonging to the office of justice of the peace in particular the power of appointing special constables upon occasion all instruments signed by him shall by all justices of the peace within their respective fields of jurisdiction be backed backed as the same instruments might be if signed by any regularly appointed justice of the peace section   election districts and polling districts how marked out art i in this section provision is made for determining the limits of the several election districts with the polling districts therein respectively contained in the following section for determining the mode in which the several votemaking households shall be ascertained registered denominated and marked art ii for these purposes commissioners in such number as to his majesty shall seem meet will by his majesty at the recommendation and with the advice of the electionmastergeneral be appointed their numbers may from time to time be augmented or reduced as occasion may require of these commissioners the official name is—commissioners of survey and demarcation and enumeration for parliamentary election purposes or commissioners of survey and demarcation or demarcation commissioners art iii for great britain one set of such commissioners shall be appointed for ireland a different one art iv no election district or subdistrict shall be composed partly of land in great britain partly of land in ireland art v as between england and scotland no such separation as per article iii need have place art vi the surveys to be performed are two—  the preliminary or ordinary geographical   the appropriate art vii the preliminary operation is that by which the geographical divisions—expressed   0 by degrees minutes and if need be seconds of longitude and latitude—will as in ordinary maps be determined and marked out by physical and mathematical observations measurements calculations and delineations with the addition of the physical distinction between land and water with or without the distinction between plain land and elevated together with the existing political divisions into kingdoms provinces counties hundreds and so forth art viii the appropriate operation is that by which the new and appropriate division into electiondistricts and subdistricts will be performed it will have for its basis the ordinary geographical operation art ix the appropriate operation in its several parts may either be performed at nearly the same time with the ordinary operation or at any greater intervals according as the electionmastergeneral shall from time to time appoint in so doing let him have regard to convenience in respect of delay and expense and in each instrument of appointment particularise his reasons art x for the preliminary and the appropriate operations the same set of commissioners may serve out of the general set particular sets or particular individuals may from time to time be appointed by him to particular portions of the business he will throughout have regard to presumable appropriate aptitude as indicated by profession known experience or otherwise art xi of the preliminary operation the maps constituting the geographical result will be upon two different scales—namely the country scale and the town scale art xii the country scale is that upon which the general or allcomprehensive map is to be constructed of this general map let the scale be large enough for inserting in every space allotted to a country parish the name of the parish also in every space allotted to a town parish a number referring to its name in the margin of the map as likewise in a manner more or less conspicuous an indication of the site of every the smallest dwellinghouse art xiii from this map shall be copied or constructed on the same scale—or on a scale as much larger as local convenience in the judgment of the electionmastergeneral may require—separate parish maps exhibiting the several parishes—namely either on the original country scale or on an enlarged country scale in some instances—for example to the purpose of the poorrates—the parish by reason of its largeness stands already divided into sections named tythings or townships or by some other appropriate name in every case of this sort at the discretion of the commissioners may be constructed instead of one map of the whole parish a map for each one of these sections or so as the whole parish be exhibited any two or more of them may be comprised in one and the same map an extraparochial place may either have a map to itself or be comprised in the map belonging to some adjacent parish or section of a parish art xiv on the town scale shall be constructed maps and portions of maps large enough to exhibit to view in a more distinct manner the sites of the several habitations according to the density of the population in some parishes the whole of the territory will require to be laid down upon the town scale in other parishes no part of it in others again the whole of the territory being laid down upon the country scale namely on the original scale—or as per article xiii on the enlarged scale—particular portions one or more will require to be laid down likewise upon the town scale these will be to be exhibited either in the margin or upon a separate sheet as convenience may require art xv here follows the description of the mode of indication which for facility of reference shall be employed in every such map—       by parallel vertical lines crossed at right angles by horizontal lines the whole surface of the engraved part of the paper or parchment is divided into a certain number of compartments   to the left of the lefthand one of the vertical columns thus formed is attached a correspondent vertical column composed of the letters of the alphabet with any such number of additional marks of the same nature as may be necessary for the designation of the total number of the compartments in that column as a b c a a a b c b a b b c   over the highest horizontal line runs a line of numbers in numerical order one over each vertical column   by means of a letter or pair of letters with a number added to it each compartment in the map will thus have its distinctive name the letter will show the place of the compartment in the horizontal line the number will show the place of the compartment in the vertical line   thus the first compartment on the left at top will be a   the next to it in the horizontal line at top will be a   the next below it in the vertical line b     the several places mentioned in the map are set down in the margin of it in the alphabetical order of their names immediately after the name of each place comes the letter and number of the compartment within which it will be found   as for example—abingdon d   if that be the compartment within which that town is placed in the map   of this series of names with such their respective accompaniments entered as above on the margin is composed an index to the map it is called the marginal index   the lines by which the boundaries of the compartments are expressed are called indicative lines index lines lines of reference or reference lines  0 these lines of reference are to be expressed in such manner as to be as clearly distinguished as possible from the ordinary geographical lines expressive of longitude and latitude for example by difference of colour or by their being the one undiscontinued in the manner of an ordinary line the other composed of dots art xvi here follows the mode in which the districts are to be marked out— in the operation the commissioners will have for their object the rendering these portions of territory as nearly equal to one another in respect of population as the necessarily and continually changeable condition of every portion of country in respect of population and the regard due to local convenience will allow as they proceed in their survey they will note and set down the several habitations in each parish or other such place in each habitation they will inquire out and set down the numbers of the inhabitants under the distinctions of sex and age of the male inhabitants the age will be to be noted of the female inhabitants not to this purpose habitations are to be distinguished into simple and compound a simple habitation is a habitation inhabited by one householder and no more and thus containing but one household a compound habitation is a habitation containing householders and thus households more than one instances of compound habitation are—   an ordinary house when it happens to be inhabited by more householders than one       an edifice designed to contain and accordingly containing divers habitations as a college an alms house an hospital an inn of court   an edifice which though not principally designed for habitation yet incidentally affords lodging to householders one or more as the treasury the east india house a town hall or any other public office art xvii for these purposes it will be necessary that not only each habitation but in each compound habitation each household shall have its distinctive name these names will be constituted by words and figures for which see section  0 the name of the habitation will be composed of the name of the approach to it with a number to wit the name of an arithmetical number annexed of what is meant by approach the words edgeware road hounslow heath kew green putney common parliament street chancery lane grosvenor square palace yard will serve for the present as examples see section  0 art xviii as the population comes thus to have been ascertained the numbers expressive of it will be set down in the map with reference to the division into parishes so likewise with reference to the compartments in the map as per article xv in each parish section of a parish or extraparochial place as the case may be males so many females so many males of such and such ages so in each compartment art xix when the united kingdom has thus been laid down in the general map and the several habitations with their inhabitants noted down in it then and not before will be the time for determining and marking out the division into districts and subdistricts always with a view to equality of population as between every one and every other art xx in the marking out of districts and subdistricts the commissioners are to be guided by the division into parishes sections of parishes and extraparochial places on this occasion they are not to divide a parish or section or extraparochial place in such sort as to allot one part to one district or subdistrict and another part to another unless for want of such division the inconvenience should be in an adequate degree considerable—   in respect of length of journeys to and from the polling district or   in respect of inequality of population as between district and district†     section  0— votemaking habitations how defined art i the operations ordained by this section have for their purpose the determining with precision what individuals shall possess on each occasion the right of suffrage the mode employed is that of reference made to the habitations which they respectively inhabit     for this purpose it is necessary to appoint a set of marks by which every such habitation may at all times be manifestly known to have that effect and may at the same     time be indisputably distinguished from every other the sort of mark employed for this purpose is the name of some approach to it with the addition of some numerical figure or figures as per section   article xvii it differs no otherwise from what is everywhere already in use than by being fashioned to the degree of conciseness and uniformity which is necessary to adapt it to the present purpose art ii the name of an approach is to be composed of two words and no more the first constituting the individualizing part of the name the other the specific part—to wit the name of the species of approach thus in downing street downing is the individualizing part street the specific part where the name in present use contains as above two words and no more it will without special reason for alteration be preserved unaltered where it consists of but one word this word will be the individualizing part of its name and a specific part will be to be added thus whitehall may become whitehall street where the name contains more than two words all that are above two are to be omitted thus saint annes street becomes anne street where for their present name two or more streets have each of them some individual name with an adjective or other distinctive name different in each added to it the distinctive names are to be both omitted the two approaches are to be thenceforward designated by one and the same name or else let a new name be given to one or each of them thus in the case of upper brook street and lower brook street either upper and lower may be both omitted and the two streets thus reduced to one or if they are kept distinct the name of one may remain unchanged and in this case a new name will be given to the other thus if upper brook street is named brook street lower brook street may be named river street the case of the twoworded name being the most common case in general no change will need be made in no instance let any change be made unless for special reason assigned but for avoidance of confusion let matters be so ordered that in no parish shall any two approaches stand designated in the maps by the same name so neither in any polling district art iii of every habitation whether simple or compound the name is to be composed of two parts the verbal and the numerical the verbal part is to be the name of the approach the numerical part is to be the name of the number in the common arabic character as is at present customary on housedoors in the case of each approach the numbers are to follow one another as usual in the order of the numeration table art iv where the habitation is near or contiguous to more approaches than one the verbal part of the name is to be the name of some one and no more of the several approaches of one or of another as may be most convenient art v where the habitation is a compound one there in the marginal index of the map as per section   add to the name of the number the letter c and distinguish from each other the several households in it by numbers in the same manner as simple habitations are to be distinguished as per article iii art vi a simple habitation may give any number of inmates votes but it can give no more than one householder vote a compound habitation gives as many householders votes as it contains households having each its householder of the male sex in addition to each householders vote it may give any number of inmates votes art vii a household which on one day has for its householder a person of the female sex may on another day have for its householder a person of the male sex this considered let no habitation or household     be omitted in the account by reason that the householder is a female but let females households be distinguished by an appropriate mark for instance the letter f art viii in the marginal index of each map as per section   the approaches are to be set down in the alphabetical order of the individualizing parts and not under that of the specific parts of their names thus downing street will stand before exchange alley although alley would stand before street for it is by the individualizing part of its name that the object is principally distinguished the specific parts are in many instances indiscriminately applicable in this case for example are the words road street lane not so the words square crescent art ix under the direction of the electionmastergeneral doorplates resembling those in common use but on a uniform plan to be fixed one on some one door of every habitation in the united kingdom shall for this purpose be provided the use of them is—to make it known at all times to all persons concerned what habitations confer votes and what do not and thus save the need of applying on every occasion to a register and at the same time afford indications for securing the correctness of the books in which votes are registered art x in the provision made respecting doorplates for this purpose—cheapness durability and uniformity will be to be attended to uniformity is of itself a help to cheapness—since the greater the number made on the same pattern the cheaper the article may be afforded its durability will be the greater the more effectually in case of depredation its marketable value would in the act of depredation be destroyed for this purpose it should be as thin as is consistent with natural durability and by a pin passing through the door it may be effectually fastened in the inside having regard to these objects it will be for the electionmastergeneral to determine—in what if any proportion these implements shall be furnished from his office and in what if any proportion from any and what other places the plates themselves being thus provided the inscriptions may perhaps be most advantageously made by stamping machines one to be kept at each district office as per section   for the several appropriate inscriptions can no otherwise be ascertained than from the maps and of the territory comprehended in the district there will of course be a general map kept in the district office also a set of maps of the several parishes and parishlike places contained in it†     art xi for the affixing of the doorplates persons are to be provided by authority in each district in each district they are regularly to be appointed by the pollclerk but in any districts the electionmastergeneral may direct that they shall be appointed by the respective district clerks the districts in which the demand for the exercise of this power is most likely to occur are those which are completely town districts the reason is—that in town districts the extent of ground requisite to be traversed will be comparatively so inconsiderable so that in one town district a smaller number might perhaps suffice than would be necessary in each one of the whole number of subdistricts contained in a country district a doorplate fixer is removable at any time by the authority by which he was appointed for the guidance of doorplate fixers in the performance of their duty the electionmaster will from time to time furnish instructions before the tenor of the instrument is definitively determined he will cause it to be communicated to the several district clerks and subdistrict clerks in such sort as to receive any such suggestions as they may respectively see reason to communicate to each doorplate fixer shall be delivered a printed copy of such instructions signed by the officebearer by whom he has been appointed art xii in the interval between election and election fresh rights of suffrage will have come into existence this effect will have been produced in every one of four ways—   new habitations will have been erected and become inhabited by householders   habitations that for a time had been uninhabited will have received inhabitants and thence householders   habitations whether simple or compound will have received additions to the number of their householders   households will have passed from female into male hands and will thus in each instance have given birth to a fresh vote this considered here follows the provision made for the giving publicity and effect to the several rights of suffrage as they come into existence—  days at the least before the earliest day for the receiving of blank votemaking certificates to be filled up for the purpose of the then next election as per sections   and   every person who in any one of the above four ways has come into possession of a right of suffrage applies in person or by his agent at the pollingoffice for notoriety and effect to be given to such his right the demand made and  s paid appropriate mention is thereupon made in his presence in the registers of the office in the margin of the map of the pollingdistrict as kept in the pollingoffice and in the margin of that copy of the map of the parish in question which is kept in the pollingoffice at the same time he receives a certificate     in which the existence of these entries is declared and an assurance given that on or before a day therein mentioned an appropriate doorplate will have been fixed on the door of the household of which he is householder for the fixing of such doorplate within the time so described the pollclerk is accordingly responsible art xiii by the converse of the several events brought to view in article xii rights of suffrage will have become extinct for the making of the requisite entries and the requisite changes in doorplates it belongs to the electionmastergeneral to take order and by printed circulars from time to time to transmit directions correspondent in tenor or effect to the several pollingoffices art xiv in several parts of great britain for various purposes parishes have as above been considered as divided into subparishes called tythings or townships in relation to every such subparish it rests with the electionmastergeneral in each instance to determine whether to the purposes of this act as per section   article xx it shall be considered as included in the parish of which it forms a part or on the footing of a separate parish art xv in divers parts of great britain are to be found tracts of land which have never been considered at least to all purposes as included within the limits of any parish these have accordingly been known by the name of extraparochial places as often as in the course of their operations the commissioners come to any such extraparochial place they shall proceed in relation thereto in the same manner as in relation to a parish art xvi as to the map they may in this case attach it to the map of any contiguous parish at their choice regard being had to convenience in respect of bulk and other particulars distinguishing it in this case by some particular colouring or they may consign the representation of it to a separate map such separate map they shall cause to be deposited in the vestry of some contiguous parish in the choice of such parish they will have regard to the convenience of all parties interested art xvii in some instances portions of territory subject to the same authorities are severed from each other of this or that parish in this or that hundred or other division of a county one part is severed from another by one or more intervening parishes of this or that parish one part lies in one hundred or other such division another in another of this or that parish one part is in one county another in another in a case of this sort no part of a parish shall to the purposes of this act be considered as belonging to any part from which it is in any of those ways severed but each part shall either be considered as constituting a separate parish or shall be annexed to some other parish such as shall be pointed out as above by regard to general convenience so in the case of subparishes as above of any such divided township or parish or county or division of a county one part may accordingly be included in one district another in another so likewise one part in one pollingdistrict another in another so even where as in the ordinary case the several territories are at present undivided art xviii so soon as commissioners have been appointed in a number sufficient to proceed on the business notice of such appointment mentioning the days shall by the electionmastergeneral be caused to be inserted in the london gazette from thence it may be inserted taxfree in every periodical and other publication on the first day of every month succeeding that in which such appointment shall have been completed the several sets of commissioners shall respectively transmit to the electionmastergeneral an account of their respective proceedings of these several accounts notices with brief abstracts shall as soon as may be and not later than within a week after they have respectively been received be inserted in the london gazette from the london gazette they may forthwith be copied taxfree into all other periodical publications each account at length shall with all convenient speed by the electionmastergeneral be transmitted for impression to and be accordingly printed by the kings printer it shall be printed in at least two forms at the same time one shall be the cheapest legible form that can be devised this as soon as printed shall be transmitted for sale to each pollingdistrict to be sold at the office or at any such other places as the electionmastergeneral may appoint it shall be sold to retail customers at a price not exceeding ten per cent upon the retail price of the paper on which it is printed section   — members continuance art i except as per section    the term during which a representative of the people shall without a fresh election continue in his seat shall in no case be longer than one year     art ii throughout the kingdom the day on which the new representatives of the people are regularly to take their seats is—the first day of january on that day the speaker shall with such members of the outgoing assembly of the representatives as choose to attend appear and deliver up the possession of the place of meeting to the incoming assembly the incoming assembly till its speaker has entered into office is presided over by the chief clerk art iii if by any accident the incoming assembly are on that day prevented from forming a house competent to do business the outgoing assembly continues in the exercise of its functions until the day on which the incoming assembly is competent to the exercise of them art iv dissolution is not produced by the decease or disability of the monarch art v on the expiration of an assembly the business continues in the hands of the new assembly as if they were one and the same art vi in committees vacancies are accordingly filled up as if produced by death or resignation† section   — vacancies supplied art i a seat in the commons house may be rendered vacant by any one of nine causes—   0   by nonacceptance   by election to divers seats   by death   by mental derangement   by succession to a peerage   by resignation   by acceptance of a lucrative function under the crown   by acceptance of a peerage   by expulsion art ii the first day of january in every year is the day appointed for the first meeting of a new parliament on or before that day every person who having been elected member for any district chooses to serve must either in person or by letter addressed to the electionmastergeneral signify his acceptance failing of such signification the next day a new writ is issued for a member to be elected in his place art iii suppose the same person returned for divers districts if he does not choose to serve for any one of them a fresh writ for each one is issued as above if choosing to serve for this or that one he has signified his choice accordingly fresh writs are issued for all except that one art iv in case of the death of a member the electionmastergeneral as soon as he has received what in his judgment is sufficient evidence of the fact issues his writ for a fresh election accordingly in the books of his office he makes entry of the evidence as for instance letter from such or such a person noting the day on which it reached the office art v so if a member becomes afflicted with mental derangement art vi so if a member comes by succession to a peerage     art vii every member is at liberty to resign his seat at any time to do this he signs the form of resignation hereto annexed and delivers it or causes it to be delivered to the speaker at the sitting or at the rising of the house the speaker on receipt of it attests it and immediately transmits it to the nationalelection office the electionmaster on receipt of it issues by the next post his writ for a fresh election as above art viii upon his acceptance of a lucrative function under the crown as per list a members seat becomes vacant as if by death art ix so in case of his acceptance of a peerage art x for the case of expulsion see section    art xi on a vacancy if by reason of distance it is not possible for a new member to take his seat before the session is at an end no election writ shall issue section   — security for the house against disturbance by members† art i in so far as such exclusion is necessary for securing its proceedings against disturbance by annoyance in any shape the house has at all times power to exclude any of its members but on each occasion the house shall and will declare in particular by what species of annoyance such disturbance‡ was effected and by what individual instance of misbehaviour that species of annoyance was produced art ii for terminating or preventing the repetition of such annoyance the house may either expel the delinquent member altogether or exclude him for a limited time art iii if the duration of such exclusion shall at any one time exceed the term of twentyeight days such exclusion shall have the same effect as expulsion and the electors of the district for which he sat shall proceed to elect a member to sit in his place art iv they are however at liberty to reelect the same member and so for any number of times     art v in case of temporary exclusion the house as a condition precedent to readmission may exact of the delinquent member a promise in writing never thenceforward to cause disturbance to the proceedings of the house either by annoyance in the particular shape in which he has been declared to have offended or in any other shape art vi so in case of his reelection whether by the district for which at the time of such annoyance he was serving or by any other district section   — indisposition of speakers obviated art i to secure the national business against interruption by interruption of the sittings of the commons house an occasional substitute for the speaker shall at all times be forthcoming vicespeaker is his official title art ii the vicespeaker shall at all times be provided by the speaker by an instrument of appointment consigned to the custody of the chief clerk the appointment is revocable by the speaker at pleasure on and by the appointment of another person to that office art iii for the acts of the vicespeaker in respect of such his office the speaker is responsible as if they were his own art iv to the office of vicespeaker no emolument shall in any shape be attached art v the house has at all times power to substitute to any vicespeaker another of its own choice art vi in default of the speaker and the vicespeaker the functions of the speaker shall be exercised by the chief clerk in his default by the clerk who is senior in standing and so downwards according to the length of service appendix including general explanations on the present occasion it was thought better not to incumber the text of the proposed bill with any considerable portion of the matter which on the supposition of its being completed would have been to be inserted in this place the text of this part may eventually be added together with the reasons at large† of the particulars which in this place there will be occasion to bring to view the use if any will not be confined within the limits of the present bill it may be seen extending itself over the whole field of legislation to an appendix on this as on other occasions are proposed to be referred five distinguishable sorts of matter—  fixation   exposition or explanation including definition   enumeration   abbreviation   forms of instruments for designation these names will it is hoped be found to serve exemplifications as well as explanations now follow   fixation instances there are in which senses more than one being plainly enough brought to view by the word or phrase in question doubts may have place in which of them it was meant that they should be understood of the operation termed fixation the function in these cases is—to indicate according to the occasion some one of those senses to the exclusion of the rest take for example the word day   on some occasions it is employed to mean a determinate portion of the time occupied by a revolution of the earth round the sun   on other occasions it is employed to     mean no more than a portion of that time namely that portion as far as it can be distinguished during which the light of the sun is visible in this latter case the meaning is expressed without ambiguity by the words daytime the daytime   when a portion of time is spoken of as the time within which a certain operation is required forbidden or permitted to be performed—and for the designation of it the word days in the plural preceded by the name of the number is employed—as for instance five days or ten days—thence is liable to arise a question whether in the portion of time thus designated are to be considered as included so many days each of them entire or whether the intention will be satisfied if the first only or the last only or both the first and the last are respectively but the portion of a day it is on these occasions that in common usage the words inclusive and exclusive come to be employed in conjunction with the word days fuller explanation cannot be given without more space than can be spared here for the removal of the ambiguity thus brought to view in several parts of the present bill an appropriate fixation would need to be made of this case the passages in which the word days is preceded by a blank space afford so many instances   in the instance of the word days taken as above in the plural a particular demand is created by the institution of the sabbath on the occasion in question in the number of days mentioned shall the sabbath day where it happens to form one of them be reckoned and considered as included or shall the number intended be understood to be that same number over and above the sabbathday the answer will depend on the nature of the occasion if what is regarded as work be to be done in the intervals the intervening sabbathday or sabbathdays must be considered as added to the number otherwise not ii exposition or explanation including definition the demand for fixation has place in so far as by the word in question more senses than one are all of them more or less distinctly brought to view what in this case is necessary is—to decide between them by fixing upon some one of them to the exclusion of the rest the demand for exposition or explanation has place in so far as were it not for the operation thus denominated it might happen that no object at all might present itself as clearly designated fixation has for its purpose the removal of ambiguity explanation the clearing up of obscurity between the import of the words as thus explained the separation will not always be very distinct especially since by the same word on the same occasion a demand for both operations may be presented and although by the operation which happens to have been performed no more than one of them may have been the direct object the other it may happen has been accomplished synonymous or nearly so to explanation is exposition of exposition there are several modes for the complete enumeration and explanation of them more room would be requisite than can be afforded in this place a mode commonly employed or at least intended and supposed to be employed is     that styled definition by definition seems commonly to be understood the exhibition of some word of more extensive signification within the signification of which that of the word in question is included—accompanied with the designation of some circumstance whereby the object designated by it stands distinguished from all others that are in use to be designated by that more extensive appellative iii enumeration of this word the import is sufficiently clear it neither requires nor admits of fixation or explanation on the occasion in question enumeration may have for its subjects either species or individuals of species or modes of operation instances are afforded by the present bill they will be found in the ensuing example of exposition as applied to the words disturbance and annoyance which may be seen in blackletter in the text of section    security c against disturbance c of the species contained under the given name of offices an enumeration is proposed by the present bill namely in section   eligible who as constituting another portion of matter proper for the appendix iv abbreviation to the result designated by this word the operations designated by the three foregoing words—fixation explanation enumeration—may any of them be rendered subservient for these several instruments of perspicuity let the word for which they are respectively in demand present itself in the body of law in question ever so many times—the demand for the sort of elucidation respectively afforded by them may present itself that same number of times at the same time if every time the principal word came to be employed the adjunct or adjuncts such as have been deemed necessary as above were to be attached to it at full length there is no saying to what enormity of extent the bulk of the body of law would thus be swelled happily to the production of the effect required no such fulllength repetitions     are necessary if to the principal word in question the adjunct or adjuncts deemed necessary are but annexed the first time it comes to be employed every succeeding time the word is employed the purpose of them may in great measure be answered by a bare notice given of their existence for a memento of this sort the typographic art affords an instrument as simple as it is efficient—an appropriate type and if throughout the whole tenor of the work this type be not applied to any other use than this any sort of type may serve in the text of the present bill may be seen an example in section    security c against disturbance c to the words disturbance and annoyance an elucidation the tenor of which will be seen presently is proposed to be applied in the appendix of the aid thus provided for sincere conception and the check for sinister application notice is afforded by the type called blackletter in which they are printed thus and without prejudice to certainty may the operation of abbreviation be performed upon a mass of law by means of the abovedescribed instruments of elucidation—any or all of them but it may also be performed without any of them examples may be seen in the introduction to burns justice of the two parts contained in that introduction the first has for its title—certain abbreviations made use of in this work of these instances of abbreviations    in number the first is in these words—  the word justice is always to be understood to mean justice of the peace when not otherwise expressed in this case to the principal word justice is added we see an adjunct and the abbreviation consists in the constant omission of this adjunct with few if any exceptions in the other twentytwo instances the instrument of abbreviation employed is the same namely omission of an adjunct notice of the omission once for all having thus been given of the abbreviation thus afforded the utility cannot but have been felt by thousands and tens of thousands but that from the abovementioned instrument—an appropriate type—the service so rendered could not but have received no small increase will be no less manifest for among so many readers of that useful and masterly performance scarcely perhaps has there been one to whose mind the notice so given once for all at the commencement of the work has in all its parts been at all times present by an appropriate type it would on each occasion have been revived by the appropriate type true it is that the particular nature of the adjunct omitted would not have been expressed but a notice which on every occasion would have thus been given is—that to the word or phrase in question an elucidation would be found provided in some shape or other and in what particular shape is a point which the nature of the context would not often leave exposed to doubt abbreviation is not the only useful purpose to which the separation thus proposed between text and authoritative comment is capable of being made subservient another is—the saving from the imputation of frivolousness or even of ridiculousness this or that matter of detail the insertion of which may by an attentive consideration of the subject have been represented to the draughtsmen as indispensable in a case of this sort if he declines employing the expedient his work will be liable to find itself in a dilemma from which it will not be easy for him to disengage it without injury to it if he omits the obnoxious matter altogether he leaves the door open to wilful misrepresentation to misapplication and arbitrary rule if he inserts it he gives disgust to the thoughtless many to whom the sensation of the moment is everything the future nothing—and who either cannot or will not see that by those who have the power misrepresentation wherever in addition to a motive any the slightest pretext can be found for it will be sure to be practised at the same time by the addition which it cannot but make to the bulk of the mass of law the subordinate species of matter if not detached from that to which it is subordinate will in proportion to its bulk contribute to render the whole mass to such a degree incomprehensible that while inefficient as a protection it will be efficient only as a snare true it is that whether interwoven with the main body or detached from it the matter of elucidation will not the less be the legislators work but in the main body it would present itself to all readers and on all occasions in the appendix it would as it were withdraw itself from the attention of readers in general reserving itself to be consulted only by this or that particular class of readers and by them only eventually in case that by this or that event a call for their applying their attention to it should be made and in this case as the occasion will place the importance of the explanation in its true light it will thus be saved from the imputation of frivolousness   forms of instruments of this species of matter the form of a votemaking certificate in section   and the form of a recommendatory certificate in section   afford so many examples for matter of this sort the appendix has just been spoken of as being generally speaking a proper place that it would have been such in the present instance will scarcely appear disputable but on the present occasion so paramount was the importance of     these two instruments—so much of the whole plan do they give intimation of—that though the appendix could scarcely be denied to be a proper place the main body of the proposed act would it was thought be deemed the more proper place when the destination of this receptacle—the appendix—is thus settled and determined the structure of the work of which it forms a part will in some sort be to be directed by it to the appendix may be referred whatsoever matters appear capable of being thus disposed of consistently with the grand object namely the implanting and keeping at all times in the mind of the subjectcitizen such part of the rule of action—such part and such only—as according to his situation in life he may have need of for his guidance at all times reserving for other parts those particulars which it will not be necessary for him to form any detailed conception of till a particular state of things calling for application to be made to that part of the law has taken place thus whatever concerns this or that species of contract a man cannot have any need to trouble himself with till either he has entered into a contract of that sort or has in contemplation the entering into it or has need to enter into it but this refers to another division of the entire body of the law namely the division into the general code and the collection of particular codes the general code containing those parts of the rule of action which all persons have need to be informed of the particular codes those parts only which so many particular classes of persons have respectively need to be informed of as in the present proposed act so in any other act and in the whole body of the law if any such work were anywhere to come into existence here then would be two distinguishable parts—main body and appendix in the appendix would be included the elucidations the abbreviations and the forms of instruments to this part might also be consigned the rationale or collection of reasons supposing provision made of an instrument of elucidation and justification at once so useful and so difficult to frame i say the rationale for to this place it might be posted off except in so far as in this or that instance for the more immediate perception of this or that reason it were thought fit either to interweave it with the body of the article to which it belonged a mode frequently pursued in an act of parliament and pursued in several places of the present bill or in the form of a note to subjoin it in the margin at the bottom of the text taken together main body and appendix would be the entire code separated from the appendix the main body would be a sort of abridgment of the entire code sanctioned by the same hand as that from which the appendix received its sanction the abridgment thus made would be an authoritative one here follows the portion of expository matter proposed to be inserted in the appendix for the exposition of the words disturbance and annoyance in section    of the text disturbance—annoyance—art i to this purpose it matters not in what shape and by what means the annoyance be produced it among its effects be that of causing disturbance to the proceedings of the house art ii it matters not to what sense or what faculty the annoyance has been applied as for example—   to the sense of hearing by noise whereby members are prevented from hearing anything spoken or read for instance by untimely vociferation by stamping or scraping with the feet or even by coughing or blowing of the nose if performed not through necessity but for this or any other forbidden purpose   to the sense of sight for example by preventing any member or members from having the speaker of the house in view or the speaker from having any other member in view or by repairing to the house with the visible marks or other symptoms of any noisome disease       to the sense of smell by uncleanliness in any shape   to health in general by a member repairing to the house at a time when he is labouring under any infectious disease   by personal injury in any shape done or attempted or intended or proposed to be done to any member or any officer of the house or to any other person present   to the tranquillity of the assembly by words or deportment threatening personal injury in any shape—to be done whether to the whole assembly present or to any particular member or other person present here ends the explanation in the particular case here exemplified supposing that as here in the designation of the proposed ground for exclusion words such as annoyance and disturbance the words employed in the bill were employed i durst not without very particular exposition such as that here proposed to be given depend upon them as sufficient to secure the exclusion of sinister interpretation in particular on the part of honourable house even under any constitution that would be given to it in the reign of charles the second it was that honourable house concurred in an act    c ii c   §   declaring the importation of cattle into england from ireland a nuisance and punishing it as a crime were it not for the check applied by specifications such as the above—with less violent torture of words might the house at any time have applied that term of reproach to the act of any member who rendered obnoxious to noble lords and honourable gentlemen by attachment to the cause of the people had by some trifling indecorum in language or deportment afforded a pretence not many years ago a member whose language had long been sufficiently indecorous was stopped in the very act of offering violence to the person of the speaker being on the right side in politics and violent on that side—his transgression was regarded with the indulgence that might have been expected but had horne tooke been the man—horne tooke for dread of whom after the house had for so many ages continued open to clergymen without inconvenience or complaint an exclusion was put upon the whole order in the lump—mercy might not quite so readily have taken the place of justice         radicalism not dangerous extracted from the mss of jeremy bentham part i— introduction section i radical reform bill recapitulated on the  th of december last      was submitted to the consideration of the public a tract entitled benthams radical reform bill with extracts from the reasons the tenor of this proposed bill was preceded and introduced by preliminary explanations in which the several features of radical reform were brought to view with the uses and advantages which presented themselves as attached to each secrecy of suffrage—virtual universality of suffrage—practical equality of effect and value as between right and right of suffrage—with annuality of suffrage are there given as the four elements of which the aggregate called radical reform is in my view of it composed secrecy as being the only security for genuineness of suffrage is there stated as being of more importance than all the other elements put together virtual universality was there proposed as being the only degree of extent which seemed either defensible on principle or capable of affording any assured promise of giving universal satisfaction or any near approach to it in regard to extent i for my part if it depended on me would gladly compound for householder suffrage but i do not see how those who on this plan would be excluded from the right of suffrage and also would perhaps constitute a majority of male adults should be satisfied with such exclusion and being myself unable to find what appears to me a reason in favour of it i must leave the task to those who consider themselves able to accomplish it absolute equality being physically impossible if equality be at all regarded practical equality must of necessity be substituted local convenience cannot but prescribe—and that through the whole country—a degree of departure more or less considerable but to say that in any instance such departure should be prescribed by it as shall render the votes in the most populous district more than four times more numerous than the votes in the most thinly peopled district seems altogether beyond the bounds of probability as compared with trienniality of suffrage annuality did not present itself to me as being  00 of that importance that should prevent me on the supposition of its depending upon myself from surrendering it on condition of obtaining trienniality—with secrecy of suffrage equality of suffrage and householder suffrage but if asked for a reason i am no more able to give what appears to me a reason in favour of it in preference to annuality than i am to give what appears to me a reason in favour of householder suffrage in preference to virtually universal suffrage on the ground of precedent and experience—in favour of annuality i see the ancient parliamentary practice in england the existing practice in the governing body of the metropolis of the empire and the practice in every one of the american united states in every instance without alleged inconvenience in any shape in support of trienniality i see nothing but the epithet moderate which those who adhere to it insist on bestowing on it when proposed it seems commonly to be proposed without the addition of either secrecy of suffrage virtual universality of suffrage or so much as practical equality of sufrage and on these terms i see not any effect good or bad that can be produced by it except the giving additional frequency to a contest of which the evils are undeniable—and which—abstraction made of a faint chance of ulterior change—produces not any the smallest change on the state of the representation leaving uncorrected and unpalliated all the abuses and evils the hope of eradicating which presents the only possible use and demand for the system which it professes to give against radical reform as above explained unless the abovementioned word moderate be regarded as a reason i had for a long time been unable to discover any nearer approach to a reason than a sort of language which in writing is to written reason what bellowing or barking or an inarticulate yell is to reason in the form of spoken language on the tory side of honourable and right honourable house and other honourable places subversion of all order and subversion of the constitution on the whig side absurd visionary and senseless wild and impracticable and so forth and in the principal whig newspapers such is every now and then the agreement with the tories as to produce passages such as these—senseless schemes of reform which if realized would plunge us into anarchy and confusion when from such pens as earl greys and lord john russells not in addition to argument but in lieu of all argument—of all attempt at argument—nothing is to be found but a set of words in which in addition to the assumption of the thing in dispute nothing but an expression of passion is to be found what inference more natural not to say conclusive than this namely that it was by the experienced inability of finding anything in the way of argument to adduce on that side that that uneasiness had been produced which gave itself vent and sought relief in words such as these the pen i say and this not only in speaking of lord john russell but of earl grey the reasons which i have in view are those of his lordships speech in    0† and his foxdinner newcastle speech   th september      for nothing can be more evident than that before or after the lips it was from the pen of the noble earl that the discourses which in these instances bear his name proceeded if it were required of me to give a model of inanity i know not where a more finished model of that sort of composition among so many as the public is daily favoured with could be referred to if intellectual could like physical gas be compressed within a given space it should have had a place at length but as this cannot be done all that can be done here is to give reference to the place where it may be seen at full length coupled with the intimation of the observations which the reader should have in view in reading it thus much as to the footing on which the question of the usefulness of radical reform appears to have stood till lately but of late the aversion to the proposed change in question has given itself vent in objections of a more determinate shape in radical reform is viewed as an effect of which with greater or less certainty it is viewed as pregnant—a general destruction of property—whether from a proposed scheme of equal division supposed to be in the contemplation of reformists or from it is not exactly said what other cause in this instance it is true as in every other what is asserted is taken for granted—assumed as certain without so much as an attempt to give a reason why it should be regarded in that light here however though without proof or attempt at proof we have something determinate in the shape of an assertion here for the first time is a something presenting itself in what is called a tangible shape here is a something which in its nature is capable of being taken hold of and taken hold of it shall accordingly be that by its being sifted to the bottom the impartial reader if peradventure any such person is to be found may see what it is worth but says somebody a question that will naturally be presenting itself to the mind of a reader is for whose use is it that this disquisition of yours is intended to this question i will give a plain answer the aggregate mass of hostile readers i divide for the purpose into the sincere and the insincere  0  by the sincere i mean all such persons as either by such reflection as they themselves have bestowed on the subject—i e by a selfformed judgment or by the assertion made by others sincere or insincere—i e by a derivative judgment derived from the authority of the opinion or supposed opinion of those others—have been led to adopt the alarming apprehension if there were not persons in no small number to whom in my own opinion this description is truly applicable these pages would not—could not—have had existence the labour being on that supposition without hope would on that same supposition have been without a motive—an effect without a cause as to the insincere these are the opponents from adverse interest these the more perfectly they are in their own minds convinced that no answer capable of lessening the effect of it on the minds of the sincere can be given to it the more thoroughly they will be confirmed in the determination to maintain the most perfect silence in relation to it—the most perfect silence—and when it is forced by accident upon their notice to put it under by some general expression of scorn and contempt such as they are so perfectly in the habit of employing and accordingly seeing accepted at the hands of those who by the same interest stand engaged to bestow on it the same reception section ii persuasion of the dangerousness of radicalism—cause of it and of the vituperative expression given to it that in a point of such vital importance—a point in comparison with which all that are to be found in the whole field of politics are separately taken as nothing—because collectively they are all comprehended in it—the question in dispute should on one side without any exception be taken for granted—that in this case a proceeding which in every other case would be universally acknowledged to be contrary to reason should have been so universally prosecuted has at times struck me as perhaps the most extraordinary phenomenon that has ever yet presented itself to the intellectual world be it more or less extraordinary the solution of it may i think be found in the following considerations— whatsoever be the subject to which it has ever happened to them to apply themselves the weakest and the strongest are upon a par if they take upon themselves to decide their decisions are equally liable to be erroneous—erroneous to any degree of absurdity interest with or without internal consciousness on the part of the individual is in every case capable of producing this state of vacuity when the instant he veers to put his mind in such a direction as to view the object in question in a point of view in which it would produce in his mind an unpleasant sensation—in such case unless he finds himself under the pressure of an irresistible obligation he turns from it of course thus it is with thousands upon thousands in the present case looking at radical reform a man sees nothing for himself or his friends to gain by it on the contrary he sees more or less that it seems to him he and they would lose by it why then should he give himself the trouble of fixing his eyes on that side a mode much less unpleasant and as it appears to him a sufficiently safe one is to hear what his friends say on the subject and to take his opinion on it from them it is sufficiently safe for among them he beholds those whose capacity of forming a right judgment on a question of this sort occupies the highest place in his eyes it is not only a pleasant course but it is the only one which he would not find intolerably irksome by adopting the other course he would not only have the pain of receiving disagreeable truths—truths to himself—abstraction made of all other persons—personally disagreeable but by doing so he would render himself disagreeable to his friends he would perhaps lose the only society he has immediate access to—the society in which he beholds whatsoever he most values—the principal if not the only object of his affection and respect as to inconvenience either in entertaining or in deducing the opinion in question—of no such inconvenience does he expose himself to the smallest risk no concern need he give himself on the subject the opinion is ready found to his hands—the opinion and the sort of language—the only sort of language that need be employed in the support of it wild and visionary—absurd visionary senseless mischievous destructive by the leading hound in the pack the cry is commenced the others have nothing to do but join in it the principal singer has sung the solo part the others in chorus have but to repeat it the course of a mans conduct having been determined by his private interest or at least by his opinion of his private interest the language he employs is that which presents itself to him as best suited to the support of that private interest if he can find nothing more promising in speaking of any measure by which he regards his interest as being opposed he deals with it like earl grey and says it is absurd visionary and senseless—or like lord john and says it is wild and visionary this done other men on the same side thinking that a man who speaks so well as earl grey does would not in a matter of such vital importance speak so decidedly without due consideration join with him and cry absurd visionary and senseless  0  whereas all the consideration ever bestowed upon the matter by the noble leader was how to excuse himself from adopting a measure which while it agreed so well with the public interest agreed so ill with his private interest and what form of words afforded the fairest promise of answering that purpose and these were the words that happened to present themselves not that even if it were fit to be employed in other respects i could consistently with perfect truth think myself warranted in retorting upon earl grey his word senseless or deny that by lord john the object of his vituperation was really regarded as impracticable visionary indeed the plan would be if in it were regarded the assumption that by a man situated as earl grey is a plan so nearly in unison with the sentiments formerly professed by him could find support—could find anything better than the most strenuous opposition visionary indeed would be any expectation that could be entertained of its finding favour in his sight impracticable there need be no doubt of its being regarded by lord john since it was not natural that he should regard it as capable of being carried against that opposition in his concurrence with which he was so fully determined section iii terms of the accusation—speeches from the throne   th july and   st november      thus stands the accusation as far as could be collected from those vague generalities which have been so abundant and in which alone the adversaries of radical reform have ever ventured to express themselves looking with persevering anxiety for something in a tangible shape from some persons of the one party or the other who had a name it was with no small satisfaction in this respect with how much dismay soever on other accounts that i found at last what i wanted and in the place to which i should from the first have looked for it the charge such as it is will be found collected from two speeches from the throne the one that of   th july      the other that of   d november      those whose projects if successful says the july speech could only aggravate the evils which it is professed to remedy and who under pretence of reform have really no other object than the subversion of our happy constitution to these persons machinations are imputed and these machinations lords and gentlemen are immediately called upon in cooperation with the magistracy to use their utmost endeavours on return to their several counties to defeat on this occasion by lords and gentlemen in their aggregate character nothing is as yet called upon to be done—so far so good for how great soever the evil by the mere aim at producing it unaccompanied with any probability of its being produced no sufficient warrant for any coercive or otherwise burthensome measure could assuredly be afforded unhappily this reserve did not long continue here as yet on reform itself neither in the radical shape nor in any other is any determinate imputation directly cast it is only on pretence of reform that the machinations are alleged to have been carried on is it then that by radical reform supposing the machinations in question successful the subversion in question would be produced this is not directly said but this is what is at any rate insinuated and it is in the view of causing everybody to believe it that this language is employed the object declared to be aimed at is—the subversion of our happy constitution of the evil in question the alleged cause cannot therefore but be a design by which the constitution would be affected and that by parliamentary reform in any shape the constitution would in a certain way be affected cannot be denied and this was the only design on foot by which any such effect could be produced by depredation and violent destruction of property let evil to ever so vast an amount have been produced the constitution would remain untouched now as to the november speech—and there though never otherwise than in the way of allusion and insinuation reform radical reform may be seen but too sufficiently designated a ground is premised for the measures about to be proposed measures requisite for the counteraction and suppression of the system alluded to this ground is stated as constituted by a spirit utterly hostile to the constitution of this kingdom and aiming not only at the change† of those political institutions which have hitherto constituted the pride and security of this country but at the subversion of the rights of property‡ and of all order in society  0  taking the two speeches together—here then are two evil designs charged—charged on the same class of persons namely all reformists—meaning or at the least including all radical reformists in the july speech the design is the subversion of the constitution—that design and no other in the november speech it is the subversion of the rights of property of the design first charged the description given has no determinate meaning accordingly no mention would have been made of it but for the intimate connexion between the speech by which this accusation is conveyed and the other speech by which the other accusation is conveyed in defending the design of the radicals against the imputation that has been cast upon it it seemed not sufficient to defend it against the imputation of a tendency to produce evil in the particular shape designated by the words the subversion of the rights of property for supposing that although it were clear of that imputation it were not clear of the imputation of preponderant evil in some other shape or shapes—on this supposition it would still remain indefensible to the denial of its tendency to produce evil in that particular shape it therefore seemed necessary to prefix a denial of its tendency to produce preponderant evil in any shape it has become necessary to add to the more particular counteraverment a more general one but a counteraverment implies a correspondent original averment to which it stands opposed the original averment then—where in this case shall we find it—answer if anywhere it must be in the abovequoted words—aiming at the subversion of the constitution now this subversion either it means nothing at all or what it means amounts to this namely a preponderant mass of evil—a mass of evil presenting a net amount over and above whatsoever good in any shape will have been produced by the same cause yes preponderant evil for as to the being simply productive of evil that cannot be matter of charge against any political measure whatsoever taken by itself coercion in any shape by whatsoever hand applied—whether any private hand or the hand of government itself—is evil government the most perfect that imagination itself could frame would still be but a choice of evils if then the effect of the imputed design supposing it carried into effect were anything less than the production of preponderant evil it would not constitute the matter of a charge but this supposed preponderant evil in what determinate shape are we to look for it to this question the charge has not furnished an answer yet in this charge and in the other that about property to which it being less indeterminate a determinate answer will be given—will be seen the sole ground of those disastrous laws by which disaffection has been more abundantly propagated than by any of the writings which they are employed to repress thus it is that to do anything they please—to destroy any man or any number of men they please and in any manner they please—it costs those under whom we yet live no more than a phrase with halfadozen words in it and that this phrase should have anything belonging to it that can be called a meaning is not necessary in the present instance so empty of meaning is the phrase that with all the hapless labour the bitter fruits of which have been seen i have been reduced to find one for it—to make one for it in the way of inference note—that for the general counteraverment there will be found more use than what might readily have been imagined in the course of this defence one argument will be seen by which the state of things aimed at by radical reform is cleared of the more particular charge of a tendency to produce preponderant evil in the shape of the subversion of the rights of property it will be seen cleared of the charge of a tendency to produce preponderant evil in any shape and not only so but it will be shown by experience to have been productive of effects which the most determined opponents of radical reform will not deny to have been replete with preponderant good this refers to the case of ireland of which mention will presently be made section iv the accusation in general terms—counteraverment in regard to the present liberticide measures and their bearings upon radical parliamentary reform the case stands thus in justification of them and as proof of the necessity what is alleged is—that by or by means of the supporters of radical reform whether with or without direct correspondent intention some great evil unless prevented by these measures will be produced and it is for the prevention of this evil that not only these reformists but all the other members of this whole community are deprived of so large a  0  part of their securities against misrule which the state of its laws establishments customs and modes of thinking has till now afforded in particular as and for the shape or one of the shapes in which the evil in question has been said to be apprehended is that which has been designated by the phrase subversion of the rights of property was ever allegation of apprehended evil more perfectly destitute of support in a country said to be the seat of political liberty were measures pregnant with more serious and undeniable evil ever adopted and employed on the second of these topics i propose not to touch at present it is with the first alone that what remains of these pages will be occupied by this measure i feel myself injured and oppressed in my general capacity of a member of this great community by the imputation on which they have been grounded i feel an additional injury cast upon me in the character of a radical reformist had they been peculiar to myself my own injuries would not have been worth mentioning nor accordingly would they have been mentioned but i have millions to share with me even in that injury which is the least extensive on these topics my own persuasions are as follows—   that radical reform if carried into effect would not be productive of any preponderant evil but on the contrary of preponderant good   that in particular the subversion of the rights of property would not be among the effects of it   that no design of any active measures tending to any subversion of the rights of property has ever been entertained by any number of reformists at any rate not by any number competent to prosecute any such design with mischievous effect section v plan of this defence on the present occasion all endeavours to find so much as an attempt at proof having been fruitless whoever he be to whom the affirmation presents itself as erroneous or untenable either he must remain silent suffering to go abroad as if it were true and unanswerable an opinion which to him appears in the highest degree pernicious as well as erroneous and untenable or he must engage in a task so pregnant with difficulty and embarrassment as the proving of the negative this course there being no other must here be mine† under the pressure of this untoward necessity the course i shall take is this— i to show in the first place from the consideration of the general nature of the case that neither the accomplishment of any subversive partition nor therefore the formation of any such correspondent design is or was or ever will be possible this will be the business of part ii of this short work ii in the second place i shall show that in the information afforded in relation to this subject may be seen a sufficient security against preponderant evil not only in this shape but in every other shape if from the power which radical reform would place in the hands of men of the class of universalsuffrage men or at any rate in those of all householders preponderant evil in any other shape were justly and reasonably to be apprehended the improbability of its taking place would be no sufficient defence but as a ground for any such supposition neither argument deduced from the general nature of the case nor experience in any particular instances have ever been adduced in proof of the opposite assurance i shall adduce in the first place the case of the united states under that head i shall call to mind that so far from anarchy government better in every respect than in england is in that country the result not merely of democratic ascendency in a monarchy but of actual democracy and that those under whose influence in the character of electors the business of that really matchless government is carried on are persons whose condition is not substantially different from that of universalsuffrage men here this will form the business of part iii iii in farther proof of this same assurance i shall adduce in the last place the case of ireland in the years from      to      inclusive under that head i shall in this  0  instance likewise call to mind and show that instead of anarchy under democratic ascendency maintained by a class of men not substantially distinguishable from universal suffrage men the business of government was carried on in a manner confessedly superior in every respect to any in which in that same country it ever had been carried on before or ever has been since this topic will furnish the matter of part iv in the part next ensuing it may afford some assistance to conception if the reader is put personally in possession of the course taken to show from the very nature of the case the impossibility of the evil apprehended by some pretended to be apprehended by others—and thereby of every such design as that of giving birth to it this course will be shown by the following topics which will be seen forming the heads of so many sections—     conditions necessary to the existence of the imputed design—their concurrence impossible     in equal shares general partition of immoveables impossible     in equal shares general partition of moveables impossible     in equal shares general partition of property in any other shape impossible     determination as to who shall be sharers impossible     in any other than equal shares general partition of property in every shape impossible     concurrence in any other plan of general spoliation impossible     concurrence of constituted authorities necessary but impossible     accomplishment being manifestly impossible the design is impossible    0 the talkedof spunge affords no proof of any such design part ii— deference from the general nature of the case section i conditions necessary to a mans embarking in such a design the task here undertaken is—to show that the sort of design imputed is in its nature an impossible one no such design could have been formed therefore no such design has ever been formed—such in this part is the argument the accomplishment of a design is one thing the formation of it is another of the impossibility of a design being accomplished the impossibility of its being formed by a number capable of making any advance towards the accomplishment of it is not a necessary consequence in every case but it will be seen to be so in this on the other hand be the design what it may that if it cannot be formed it cannot be accomplished will surely not be disputed for the formation of a design of the sort in question certain points must in the nature of the case have been agreed upon upon these several points no agreement can have had place therefore no such agreement has ever taken place he who admits the antecedent will admit the consequent among these points are the following namely—   subjectmatters of the partition what   immoveable subjects of the rights of property   moveable subjects of the rights of property both these are real   fictitious subjects of the rights of property for example annuities and offices in regard to which a further explanation will be given these different subjectmatters of the rights of property—shall they be all of them taken for the subjects of the partition or only two of them and what two or only one of them and what one   sharers who the radicalists alone or the existing proprietors with them—among the radicalists males alone or males and females together and in both cases adults alone or adults and nonadults together the difficulties which would in practice attach upon any choice that could be made in answer to these questions will be more particularly brought to view   proportion as between the sharers of the several shares equal or unequal   mode of operation i e partition and operating hands to be employed in it among these must be the constituted and established authorities of the country for the time being whatsoever they may be if it were nothing more than the moveable plunder of a camp or town no no such permanent power might be regarded as necessary but according to the spirit as well as the letter of the charge those rights of property the subjectmatter of which exists in the immoveable shape constitute the principal part if not the  0  whole of the mass of rights the subversion of which is alleged to be aimed at the consequence is—that of the design as charged one part is either the continuance of the existing constituted authorities under their present names and charged with their present functions or the establishment of a new set of constituted authorities with correspondent names and functions here then will have been another choice to be made sect ii in equal shares partition of immoveables impossible sect iii in equal shares partition of moveables impossible sect iv partition of property in other shapes impossible sect v determination of the sharers impossible sect vi in shares other than equal partition impossible as the matter which constitutes the above five sections is to be found with little variation in the tract on the levelling system in vol i p     it has been considered unnecessary to repeat it here—ed section vii concurrence in any other extensive plan of spoliation impossible nay but says somebody no such regular and generallyagreed plan of partition and plunder will perhaps be fixed upon but under the guidance of these leaders the multitude may proceed in the work of insurrection depredation and destruction without any plan at all trusting to their leaders for their having already framed an apposite plan or at any rate for their framing one before the time for action comes all this while the leaders may have been acting on a secret plan of their own—a plan having for its object the acquisition of opulence in some shape or other for each the condition of the multitude being left to chance answer for the purpose of the argument let a secret plan have been formed by the leaders and that secret plan as dishonest and mischievous as any one pleases but still in front of this secret plan must have stood an avowed plan—an openly avowed plan—a plan which to the great majority of the supposed insurrectionists and wouldbe depredators must afford a promise more or less plausible—plausible howsoever hollow of probable good to each of them as to any such blind confidence of this or of anything else the existence may be asserted and even supposed but of any such thing not any the smallest symptom or probability in any shape can be indicated on the contrary not the abundance of confidence but the absence of it is the state of things which the multitude of evidences that have at different times met the public eye have rendered remarkable and notorious let us see then whether to the multitude judging each for himself it be possible that any other imaginable plan should afford any better promise than those which have been brought to view and disposed of this being at the same time understood that there remains not any other the effect of which would not be the narrowing the number of the sharers in the case where all individuals without exception are proposed to be sharers—sharers to an amount more determinate conceivable and clearly expressible than any other—we have seen what the bars are that oppose themselves but to any plan from the benefit of which individuals of any description should stand excluded the exclusion would be opposing an additional obstacle in any view which could be taken of the case by any the most sanguine imagination the obstacles that could not but be opposed to the plan by all constituted authorities with their adherents could not but present themselves as sufficiently formidable but on this supposition of a scheme narrowed by exclusion every individual excluded would add to the strength of the obstacles that oppose themselves as above to the scheme of allcomprehensive benefit here then comes a dilemma let the excluded be few the saving by the exclusion will be so much the less let the excluded be many the force of resistance added to that of the constituted authorities will be so much the greater every conceivable plan by the accomplishment of which the alleged mischief in question or the subversion of the rights of property would be effected being thus disposed of and the accomplishment of it being over and over again shown to be impossible it is not too soon it is hoped to declare it so to be i accordingly challenge all antiradicalists to bring to view any other plan which having that subversion for its object shall now upon the face of it be seen by everybody to be impossible and if being unable to bring to view any such plan a man will notwithstanding persevere in the assertion that there may be and eventually will be proposed such a plan and that men will act upon it i must leave any one to say whether it be in the nature of the case that he who says this should believe his own assertion to be true at every step the discussion has taken antiradicalist readers if any such it should have will of course have been turning aside from it with disgust and exclaiming—we did not mean this we did not mean that we did not mean anything of all this—can it ever have been your belief that anything so palpably absurd would have been meant by anybody  0  well then if you did not mean this what did you mean do you know what it is you mean you by whom in every the most offensive shape you could find opprobrium has for so many years been poured forth—poured forth not only upon such multitudes which to you is nothing—not only upon such moral worth which to you is again as nothing—but upon much pecuniary worth and even high rank which to you is everything say then at length what it is you mean speak out or by that sort of evidence which even from men whose declaration is worth nothing is more conclusive than it is in the power of any declaration from any man ever to be—prove in a word by silence or evasion that in thus dealing by us you have all along been talking without meaning and acting as accuser without ground section viii concurrence of any constituted authorities impossible be the plan of partition what it may if the effect and benefit of it is to be more than momentary the necessity of a concurrence and that a persevering one of the constituted authorities for the time being has been already brought to view—section i here if the pile of impossibilities is not yet high enough here then is another stage to add to it the constituted authorities by which the scheme will be carried into effect will either be the existing set as they stand at present or a new set as to the existing set the least objectionable plan being what it has been shown to be a concurrence on their part would scarcely be expected sooner than concur in any such work of certain selfdestruction they would of course all of them fly the country or die with arms in their hands in their endeavours to resist it but how certainly soever in the eyes of the now existing constituted authorities supposing any advance made in such a scheme their own destruction would be among the results of it it could not be more so in their eyes than it would be in the eyes of any person whatsoever into whose hands the immediately operative power of government could come to be transferred a design of this sort agreed upon and nobody to put the question—by what hands the business would be to be done a design of this sort thus blindly agreed upon—agreed upon by numbers competent to make serious advances toward the execution of it if any such supposition can be made it must be by some orator by whom a correspondent conception has been formed of the state of the understanding on the part of the swinish multitude my powers are unequal to it section ix accomplishment impossible—design impossible if that which a man would be glad to do is in his eyes impossible to be done—so long as it is so he will neither attempt to do it nor design to attempt it a position to this effect may it is hoped without much fear of contradiction be advanced one position remains which for the completion of the proof of not guilty it will be necessary to advance but to which the assent may not be quite so sure this is—that supposing any such desires to have had place a persuasion of the impossibility of success has on the part of those whose concurrence would be necessary all along accompanied it to this position no probable cause of dissent on the part of any person whose situation in respect of private interest and interestbegotten prejudice admits of the giving reception to truth presents itself not so on the part of those by whom the speeches in question were penned and put into the royal mouth by them the persons accused having to the amount of so many millions been pronounced guilty—guilty of the design of accomplishing that the impossibility of which has so repeatedly been shown and proved—the accused pronounced guilty and execution taken out not against them alone but against all the other members of the community along with them they stand engaged not merely to deny the impossibility of such a design but to maintain—to maintain for ever and without flinching its existence in so far as sincerity if supposable has had place imagination—imagination alone—having been the hand by which the plan ascribed to the supposed levellers has been drawn such according to this plan has been their desperation such their rage that how perfectly well soever assured of their own ultimate destruction—still under the assurance or though it were but the hope of seeing it preceded by the destruction of their adversaries even the prospect of selfdestruction has been an inviting one to them but not even by this supposition extravagant as it is could any tolerably substantial ground be made for the imputation for supposing destruction to come they and not their adversaries would be the first to be involved in it and this priority is too manifest to have ever been unobserved by themselves yes if they were all agriculturists on that supposition with a spade in hand ground to turn up with it and potatoe cuttings to put into it if a man could live for a time without fuel or fresh clothing he might keep himself alive provided always that he could wait till the potatoe germs had grown into potatoes  0  such is the condition in which on the receipt of the supposed benefit the labourers in husbandry would find themselves placed such the prospect which it would hold out to them the labourers in manufactures and other labourers other than those in husbandry—what is the prospect it would hold out to them in comparison with their lot the lot of the man bred up in husbandry labour—ruinous as we have seen it—would be an enviable one the period arrived the husbandman would have nothing to learn the nonhusbandman would have everything to learn—digging manuring sowing weeding reaping everything all this he would have to learn and in the meantime he would have to starve meantime the supposed objects of this desperate rage—the owners of property—how would it be with them they would be the last to suffer all of them together the last and among them the richer a man were and thence by the supposition the more obnoxious the longer it would be before his time of suffering came with more or less disadvantage he who had property would by exporting it along with himself retain a part of it or get something for it in the way of exchange but the supposed intended plunderers no property could they export any more than their own persons the land they could not export and that with or without buildings on it is all—so it has been shown over and over again—that would be left in their hands yes it is upon their heads that the calamity would fall in the first instance never anywhere but in the wages of labour can they have beholden the source of their subsistence as to the manufacturers in particular in no small proportion have they had for their sole purchasers the opulent class as rising one above another throughout the whole scale of opulence long before the time when the power of commencing the partition had got into any of the hands charged with being disposed to use it the proprietors instead of continuing to employ any of their money as usual in the purchase of the manufactures they had been accustomed to consume would cease from all such purchases altogether with everything they had or could get that is exportable they would take their flight from the country as above before this topic is closed one other circumstance must be brought to view and that is the smallness of the lot by which in the character of a motive the determination to embark in an enterprise so full of personal hazard as well as difficulty must have been produced note that by this one circumstance stand excluded from the number of the possible associates all those who in possession or expectancy beheld within their grasp any mass of property not much below the value of the equal lot instead of supporters all such persons the scheme would have for its inflexible opponents but at the command of their opponents are all the possible means of support to the scheme on one hand of opposition to it on the other at the command of the supposed associates what are the means the hands they were born with—these and nothing else such are the hands of which the monarch of this country with his lords and commons have been stricken with that fear the expression of which is contained in the two late speeches which have above so often been brought to view in these speeches—in the consequent addition of the  0000 men and upwards to the standing army of  00000 and upwards and in that real subversion by which in virtue of the new laws the constitution has been secured against the imaginary one section x the talkedof spunge no proof of the design but by radicalists says somebody a wish to see a national bankruptcy effected—or as the phrase is a spunge applied to the debt has at radical reform meetings been openly and uncontradictedly spoken of in the character of a desirable result and here would unquestionably be subversion of rights of property to this come the following short answers   spoken of in such meetings—yes but how rather as an expected cause of reform than as an intended effect no otherwise than in so far as it has been declared to be an intended effect does it apply to the present purpose   even supposing it intended to be produced and produced accordingly it would not amount to the design insinuated in the speech true it is that to the amount of this debt so much of the rights of property in that shape would be subverted but property in all other shapes would for anything that this would do remain untouched note well that subversion—not of rights of property i e some rights of property—but of the rights of property i e all the rights of property is the object charged to be aimed at every time a handkerchief is picked out of a pocket subversion of rights of property takes place note likewise that from the aggregate mass of property in the country though no addition would be made to it no defalcation would be made i do not say that no preponderant evil would be produced but that is another consideration which will meet us presently   the very design whether in itself it be useful or pernicious proves even a respect for property in all other shapes for what would be the effect or supposed use of it only to  0  take off so much burden—so much of deduction—from property in all other shapes deduction namely that made by taxes suppose property in all other shapes dealt by according to that design the existence of which was in the speech declared to be believed it has been seen what would have become of it and whether by the very partition the impossibility of paying the debt and thereby the virtual abolition of it would not have been effected but that no such design of universal partition can possibly have been entertained has it is believed been sufficiently shown   to no one of the supposed plotters in question would or could any immediate benefit be produced by this spunge ceasing to pay dividends to the present annuitants would not put money into the pocket of any reformist or any one else suppose the dividend divided amongst the reformists instead of the present annuitants—is that what is meant but on this supposition the debt would not be abolished it would be kept up   it is not by all radicalists nor by more than a very small part of the whole number of radicalists that so much as a wish to see this state of things take effect has been expressed take effect in any character—either as a fruit and consequence or as a cause thus much as to ineligible reform in that particular shape but amongst the plans of reform or expected fruits of reform held up to view suppose in any number schemes ever so extravagant by any such extravagance could any just cause of objection be formed against any that were free from the extravagance if yes nothing could be more easy than for men in power to manufacture in this way a bar to all reform and that an insuperable one to employ a number of men to propose and advocate each of them an absurd visionary and senseless plan of reform to use earl grays phrase or a wild and visionary plan to use lord john russells phrase would be quite as easy as and somewhat less odious and nefarious than to give birth to crimes by employing instigators for the purpose of their becoming informers that without any exception all who call for radical reform should be uniformly well informed and wise is an expectation which it will be time enough to regard as a reasonable one when wisdom in that same degree has manifested itself on the part of their rulers the supposition on which acts of government and speeches made in houses seem uniformly to be grounded is that of consummate excellence on the part of those who have any share in the powers of government coupled with consummate depravity on the part of those who have none the supremely ruling one sharing with the almighty in his attributes as blackstone who enumerates them expressly assures us he does those in authority under him a little lower than the angels the subjectmany devoid of reason and in shape alone differing from beasts hence it is that they are unfit to be and incapable of being reasoned with—fit only to be crushed and slaughtered that by the persons in question any such design should ever have been harboured as that of endeavouring at the subversion of the rights of property in other shapes has it is hoped been sufficiently proved to be impossible that by those same persons in a number more or less considerable the design may have been harboured of endeavouring at the subversion of the rights of property in this particular shape seems neither impossible nor improbable but against a mere design supposing it to have no chance of producing either the effect aimed at or any bad effect in any other shape not only would subversion of the constitution but even reason and argument be so much words and paper thrown away he in whose eyes the catastrophe is not regarded as capable of being produced otherwise than by the political ascendency of those whom he regards as labouring to produce it will see no cause for apprehending evil in that shape unless in so far as the existence of such ascendency should in his eyes be more or less probable still however as from that endeavour preponderant evil could not fail to take place might not such a demonstration be in their eyes at least productive of good effect evil in that particular shape has not any probability yet from those same endeavours evil in this or that other shape may in those same eyes or in other eyes be more or less apprehended on this supposition if to their own satisfaction it were demonstrated that by any endeavours made or declared to be made by them towards the subversion or extinction of the rights of property in this shape no good—preponderant good to themselves—could take place but that on the contrary much preponderant evil could not fail to take place might not such a demonstration be in their eyes at least productive of good effect from any declared or known antiradicalist any such statement would have to encounter the force of adverse prepossession from a known radicalist it many stand a better chance of being regarded with whatever attention may be due to it these things considered it has been thought that the following suggestions in proof of the ineligibity of this supposed remedy in respect of the interests of any persons who in the character of radicalist may have been occupied in the endeavour to apply it might not be without their use if it should appear that while the extinction of the debt without equivalent would be productive of preponderant evil to a very   0 great amount the abolition of it by means of an equivalent would still be productive of preponderant evil though to a less amount the result will be a practical conclusion such as under existing circumstances may not be without its use reasons against a national spunge—i e complete insolvency on the part of government—   upon the face of it it presents not any national advantage in any shape yes if the creditors were all of them or the greater proportion of them foreigners for here would be pecuniary advantage for a motive countermotive none but the dishonesty and the attendant consequences of it setting foreigners out of the question on setting money against money all that were in the character of debtors would gain all that were in the character of creditors would lose taking into the account the whole of the community together here then in money there would be no gain but money is of no value otherwise than as a means of happiness now in happiness there would be great loss for quantity and quality being equal and all other circumstances the same suffering from loss is always greater than enjoyment from gain otherwise there would be no preponderant evil produced by depredation in any shape nor reasonable cause for punishing it   among those who would suffer soonest and most would be all those by whom a change of this sort has been considered or spoken of as desirable among them in an indefinitely large proportion perhaps the greatest portion are those by whose labour such goods are manufactured as have for their consumers and purchasers persons whose property is in this shape from this defalcation though all labourers would suffer labourers in manufactures would suffer in the greatest degree for among their productions are those which can best be spared among the productions of husbandry alone are those which consistently with life cannot be spared   it has never yet been shown nor it is believed can it be shown in what particular shape any preponderant good from any such forcible and unlookedfor transfer of property should come—should come at any time how widely soever distant that in the first instance and for an indefinite length of time distress to an incalculable but at the least a prodigiously vast amount would be produced cannot be matter of doubt to anybody if at the end of the account preponderant good in any shape were to be enjoyed it would only be by such persons as in respect of fixed property or means of subsistence in other shapes should have been enabled to weather the storm and among these scarcely would any person of the class now in question be to be found in a word the distress produced would be certain and immediate the lookedfor equivalent—the alleviation would be uncertain and remote when the advantages from extinction in any way are brought to view first comes the taking off of the taxes then the lowering of prices to the pitch from which they were raised by the taxes unfortunately the first result is not by a great deal so speedy as imagination is wont to paint it when taxes are taken off there remain the taxgatherer and the clerks to be provided for and thus it is that it is only as a tontine annuity increases that that part of the burthen of taxation which is composed of the expense of collection can be diminished the taxgatherers and clerks may indeed be turned out to starve and for a warrant for so dealing with them some bad name or other may be attached to them but by this bad name neither will the sensibility of the individuals to suffering be diminished nor the part which their happiness constitutes of the universal happiness nor their right to have as much regard shown to their happiness as to that of an equal number of other persons look the whole community over scarcely will you find that description of persons for whom some bad name or other has not been found none whatever for which a name of that sort might not be found but to make any such pretence for evil doing requires no more ingenuity than nor so much time as the tying a canister to the tail of a dog for the purpose of tormenting him such is the sad effect of profusion—that evil of which with so many others the essence of monarchy is composed this expenditure with its burthen is the work of an instant suppose relief to come half a century may have elapsed and still the exoneration is not complete just so or worse it is with armies raise them you may in a few months disband them you may in the compass of a day but as to exoneration from the expense—oh no half a century may have elapsed and still the relief remain incomplete here too comes in another feature taxgatherer and officeclerk should not be turned out to starve—soldiers will not be   the burthen in this shape being already in existence and not to be got rid of but by preponderant burthen in other shapes the continuance of it in this shape seems productive of a distinct and peculiar advantage—namely the opposing a proportionable difficulty to war the power which has most effectually at command a greater body of the necessary and effectual means of war than any other has—not to say than all others put together have—such a power is surely in less danger than any other can be of being forced     by aggression into a war of mere defence and as to offensive wars—wars for conquest or for the pleasure of being insolent whatsoever may be the real propensity scarcely of any such propensity will the existence in their own instance be avowed at least in direct terms by any men in the situation of rulers now under a constitution or form of government such as ours the profit real or apparent to the ruling few and thence the propensity to engage in needless and useless and unjust wars is so strong and all other counteracting causes so completely wanting that the difficulty opposed by the burthen in question to such wars seem to me a blessing beyond all price   continued or   if this country were more likely to be engaged in a war of necessity and mere defence—in a necessary and defensive war than in an unnecessary and offensive war—on that supposition the effect of the extinction or diminution of the debt might upon the whole be advantageous but to advance any such position shall be left to those if any such there be who either believe the truth of it themselves or can make sure of persuading others so to do now by war whenever there is one men of the class of the radicalists—in a word of the unopulent many—will be greater sufferers than any that stand above them in the scale of opulence for in the case of war let it come when it will money must be found it must be taken from all classes and the less a man has of it the less he can spare for this or any other purpose but says somebody by the reformists supposing them to have the ascendency war except in the case of its being necessary war will not be engaged in easy enough this to say—not quite so easy to be assured of under democratic ascendency there would still remain—besides the peoples commons—the monarch with his lords all of them with their inbred appetite hungering and thirsting after war instead of righteousness power money plunder honour and glory additional distant dependencies—more and more offices and honours—depredation in all its shapes—in all of them applicable to the purposes of corruption honour and glory—pleasure of insulting and oppressing foreign nations upon the functionaries in office high and low all these incentives will be operating with unabated force and for producing a correspondent inflammation in the breasts of the people in their character of electors no power would be spared not that merely for this purpose any one could seriously maintain that the accumulation of a national debt—especially a national debt heavy enough to prevent war would be an eligible measure all that is meant is—that when the community has been subjected to a public burthen in this shape this is the shape in which for that purpose it were desirable that it should exist so long and in so far as it exists in any shape that in particular no such thing as a sinking fund should ever be established and that accordingly should any permanent surplus be found to have existence in the produce of the existing taxes the result should be the abolition of a correspondent quantity of the produce of those of which the continuance was found in all respects taken together the most pernicious     part iii— defence from experience in the case of the united states so much for the general nature of the case in experience is there anything to give countenance to a supposition thus shown to be in theory so extravagant as well as completely groundless in experience on the contrary from experience all the evidence that the case furnishes is directly in the teeth of the supposition and puts the most decided negative upon it look first to the northamerican united states in that vast region—a region peopled with men of english race bred up in english habits—with minds fraught with ideas associated with all english ideas by english language—in that vast region what is the state of things if not indeed exactly what in the british isles it would be rendered by democratic ascendency as established by radical reform it is at any rate a state of things which to the present purpose is not materially different from it and in particular a state of things which if it had been in human nature to give birth to any such design as that of a general subversion of the rights of property would have been full as likely to give birth to such a design as the condition of the radicalists in the british isles can now be well then in those united states such is the state of things in respect of the influence of the people at large in the business of government what then is the consequence any such subversion of property as the form proposed is accused of being to a certainty productive of no—nor any the least approach to it any inferiority in respect of general tranquillity and felicity in other shapes as compared with the british isles on the contrary a great and perfectly uncontrovertible superiority first then as to the parallelism—the virtual identity of the features or elements of radicalism secrecy universality equality annuality of suffrages all this literally or virtually you have in pennsylvania and in new york and deducting slaves these are the two most populous of the twentytwo united states anno    0 population of the two little less than a third of the whole secrecy annuality you have literally and of the four elements these are the only two of which in the literal sense the existence is possible universality a trifle short of it you have virtually qualification in new york renting  0s ayear renting sufficient—possession in property not required in pennsylvania not so much as renting  0s or renting anything required payment to any state or county tax sufficient—payment though it were but once made† and any man that pleases may offer himself to make it as to equality of suffrage—i e equality in effect and value as between right and right in suffrage—the effectual point is not arithmetical equality but absence of any such degree of inequality as would be the result and proof of partiality and injustice all charge of injustice on this score being in these instances unknown details of the partition would not pay for the trouble of the research here then is not merely radicalism—not merely democratic ascendency—not merely representative democracy in conjunction with monarchy and aristocracy—but pure democracy without any such supposed security for property—for good order as the phrase is as independent power lodged in the hands of the one combined with independent power lodged in the hands of the few are supposed to give well and what has been the result subversion of the rights of property no—nor at any time any the least tendency towards any such thing from the foundation of the several colonies down to the present time property existing in all degrees of inequality from 0 up to halfamillion or more and in all those proportions alike secure sedition insurrection against the constituted authorities—popular discontent—any thing of that sort near forty years have already elapsed since the triple yoke of monarchy aristocracy and sham democracy were cast off and nowhere in the union have any of those symptoms of misrule at any times shown themselves is it that distress has been there unknown not it indeed distress there has been but too much of it but the distress itself has not there been better known than has the cause the only cause of it this being known as little have men thought of making it matter of charge against their government or their constitution as if instead of want of market for productions it had had drought or inundation for its cause in our islands the distress has had two causes the deficiency of demand as in the united states for produce and that excess     of taxation which has been produced by vicious constitution and misrule the misrulers place it of course the whole of it to the commercial account no part to the financial and constitutional but the people who not only feel but see what the taxes are as well as in what state the constitution is are not to be thus blinded no indeed by shutting their eyes against facts it is not in mans power to cause those facts not to have had existence and thence it is that notwithstanding all speeches and all invectives and all penal laws and all prosecutions and all hangings and all sabrings it remains an undeniable truth that if nothing will satisfy a man but the seeing the people quiet and content with their government while they are labouring in penury and distress it is to pure democracy or at least to democratic ascendency that he must look for it oh but says somebody new york and pennsylvania—these states are but two out of that number which at first was thirteen and now amounts to twoandtwenty true and for this very reason the experience is but so much the more instructive—the evidence afforded by it but so much the more conclusive in several states of the union the qualification is not only real as well as nominal but inordinately high yet nowhere from the remoteness from universality has any advantageous effect from the nearness to it any disadvantageous effect been either experienced or surmised part iv defence from particular experience in the case of ireland years      or      to      section i analogy between this and the previous case we come now to the case of ireland in the case of the united states what we have been seeing is—as the cause of the effects in question representative democracy—pure democracy this is not exactly the same state of things as that which we have been stating as the natural the necessary the desirable effect of radical reform—namely democratic ascendency but though not exactly and exclusively that it is that and more and if so it were that radical reform with its inseparable fruit democratic ascendency were in any degree mischievous or dangerous pure democracy would to a much higher degree be mischievous or dangerous in the united states for the cause of the effects in question we have seen pure democracy for its effects of the negative kind instead of the alleged subversion of the rights of property no such subversion effects of the positive kind condition in respect of the rights of property better much better than under matchless constitution with the benefit of english institutions the whole mass of them condition in respect of general felicity as dependent on the possession of its several elements and external instruments generally superior likewise in the case of ireland we shall see a case still more exactly in point for a length of time quite sufficient for experiment—quite sufficient for the support of every inference—we shall see democratic ascendency established and maintaining itself maintaining itself not indeed under the name of parliamentary reform—radical parliamentary reform—but what is more with the essential characters of it so much for the cause of the effects inquired after as to the effects themselves they will be found still in their nature the same as in the united states subversion of the rights of property none—subversion of the constitution none thus much for the merely negative effects look now to the positive effects here on the side of ireland we shall find a brilliant superiority—the average mass of felicity exalted to a pitch unknown before or since—public and private felicity and as at once a cause and consequence of it public and private virtue section ii democratic ascendency how produced in the case of ireland the state of things here designated by the appellation of democratic     ascendency had for its cause the system which has been distinguished by the various appellations of irish volunteer association irish association the volunteer association the volunteer system meaning in every case the system carried into effect by a body of men in ireland distinguished by the appellation of volunteers the armed volunteers or the associated volunteers in the formation of their character the following circumstances may be seen united—   the members for what they did had no authority from government   they were selfformed into regular bodies   they were selftrained to the use of arms individually and collectively   they were provided with arms of all sorts—in some places even with cannon   the aggregate body was constituted by and composed of a number of smaller bodies selfformed all over the kingdom the aggregate or national body of provincial bodies each provincial body of local bodies occasionally assembled in various towns or neighbourhoods   in each such place the members of the several bodies met together by voluntary agreement in such sort that each one of them had for his electors all the others this it may be seen so far as it went was universal suffrage so far as it went and in the case of parliamentary election by universal suffrage it is not that on every occasion every one who had the right would on every occasion exercise that right but that every one without exception would be free to exercise it   by the body associated in each town or place delegates were at one time or other chosen and sent to a provincial assembly composed of the delegates from all the towns of places in which associate bodies were formed in that one of the four provinces into which the kingdom of ireland then was and that part of the united kingdom is now divided as also to a national assembly that met at dublin the metropolis   the persons under whose command in the character of military officers the rest acted in the character of armed volunteers were chosen by the suffrages of the rest in the character of privates—by the suffrages of those who placed themselves under their command and among these officers were some among the highest in rank and opulence and in particular the duke of leinster the first man in the peerage and then as at present the only duke not belonging to the royal family the conjuncture was an unexampled one the time was that of the american war—a war in the course of which in addition to so many of its distant dependencies the british monarchy had those of france and spain to contend with at sea the superiority of britain which for some time was precarious became at length converted into a decided inferiority an invasion was every day expected and ireland being the point manifestly the most vulnerable was the point upon which it was mostly if not exclusively expected a time at length arrived at which to defend the country or rather of those in power in it and over it the british rulers could not muster any more than  000 men— 000 instead of the  0000 which had been demanded as necessary abandoned by the government to their fate the people in various parts of the country stood up and prepared for their own defence in this state of things the english rulers had the choice of two evils—to suffer the enemy to make a conquest of the country or to suffer the inhabitants to take up arms under an utter uncertainty as to the use that would be made of the power thus acquired of the two evils they chose that which even in regard to their own particular interest was manifestly the best they suffered the people to take their course that in so doing they were insensible to the magnitude of the danger they were exposing themselves to was not in the nature of the case in their situation every danger is magnified and overvalued rather than undervalued but to avoid exposing themselves to it without immediate ruin was manifestly impossible they submitted to it with as good grace as they could they not only joined in applauses and thanks to the objects of their jealousy but put arms into their hands—  000 stand of arms is the number mentioned while the danger from without was still growing every day more and more urgent an attempt was made to provide against the interior and more lasting one but by this attempt to avert it the internal danger was but increased for the purpose of bringing the volunteers regularly under the command of the constituted authorities commissions from the crown were offered to men of note in the country—to members of the local aristocracy and hands were not wanting for the acceptance of them but the purpose was too obvious of such commanders there was no want but volunteers could not be found and men were wanting to such commanders freely men would serve—but under those in whom they had confidence monarchists and aristocrats there were not wanting to subject the people to martial law with the irresistible and remediless servitude that belongs to it but hands were not so ready to receive as to make offer of such chains none would serve under officers appointed by the monarch every day more and more were ready to serve     and did serve under commanders chosen by themselves—in concurrence with men pursuing the same objects and partaking in the same affections shame and weakness was the result on the part of the constituted authorities exultation and increase of strength on the part of the people in this state of things the physical force of the country was manifestly in the hands of the people—of all such of the people as chose to take a part in the exercise of it in a word democratic ascendency was fully established democratic ascendency—not democracy for neither by the armed citizens themselves nor by any man of their choice was any act of authority ever exercised corrupt as it was—an object of universally declared aversion and contempt—nothing was done but what was done by the parliament that is by the ministry with both houses prepared and hired to do whatever should be required commercial emancipation and parliamentary emancipation united the wishes of almost everybody these points were accomplished and nothing could be more evident than that but for the armed association they never could have been accomplished in what they were able to do the english rulers and those who in ireland were sold to them saw what more in case of necessity they were capable of doing and this seen whatever was done it was by the constituted authorities that it was done section iii fruit of democratic ascendency a golden age such being for five years together the effect of the volunteer system—of the will of the people manifesting itself on the principle of universal suffrage—in a word of democratic ascendency substituted to a mixture of monarchical and aristocratical ascendency under a foreign monarch and calling itself protestant ascendency because it was by protestant hands that the tyranny was exercised—such being the nature of the powerful influence exercised by the body of the people on the conduct of the government—what were the results subversion of the rights of property no such thing subversion of the constitution no such thing in the constitution of the kingdom of ireland a change was indeed effected but even on the occasion on which it was effected numerous as were the authorities without the concurrence of which the change neither was nor could have been effected ample in every case was the applause bestowed upon it scarcely in any one was an objection made to it—nor has so much as the shadow of an objection been raised against it since that one flagrantly bad point removed all the other points good and bad together continued as before such being the institution—democratic ascendency—behold its fruits tranquillity harmony morality felicity unexampled such as they were—behold another miracle—by the evidence of all parties in one voice their existence was acknowledged peoples men triumphed in their golden age and recorded it aristocratic whigs even after they had succeeded in destroying it—in substituting to it the iron age—trumpeted it calling it their own work so conspicuous was it—so incontestable that not even could the most zealous monarchialists and tories forbear confessing its existence abolition of english institutions no such thing good and bad together english institutions remained as they were these indeed are but negative results—the mere absence of certain results that have been seen presented to view in the character of pure evils and the first of them—namely subversion of the rights of property—unquestionably such and all of them as being the certain result of any state of things under which the great body of the people were left free to give expression to their wishes it is with this experience full in view—all of them being at that very time not only in existence but moreover in a situation which not only enabled them but engaged them to apply their minds to the observation of everything that passed—that the men to whom we are indebted for the speech from the throne scrupled not to represent as eventually certain in great britain and ireland all those results the complete absence of which was in that instance so conspicuous in ireland will it be said that this was not democratic ascendency for that these armed bodies were composed of men serving in the character of privates under the command of officers and that these officers were many of them if not most of them members of the aristocracy—several of them among the highest in the conjunct scale of power riches and property as above observed and acknowledged true of this description were the officers of this army in a certain proportion but let that proportion have been ever so large—suppose them all members either of the house of peers or of the house of commons with any the less propriety would the result have been termed democratic ascendency not it indeed and for this simple reason over any one of the privates in this army no one officer had at any one time any power other than that which the privates chose all of them to give to him no kings commissions—no military law nor was it that the officers chose the privates it was by the privates that they themselves were chosen officers     all this time it was the people at large—it was the privates that governed so far as they chose to govern as to the members of the aristocracy including the creatures and instruments of the monarchy each in the character of member of the democratic association had a voice indeed but no one had any more to prevent evil in any shape nothing was there in the breast of any one but the awe he stood in of the rest yet such is the effrontery of some—such the blindness of so many—mere anarchy is still the name that so long has been and so long will continue to be given to the only sort of government that is anything better than an established nuisance place and time considered even had the evil results the absence of which has been brought to view actually on this occasion had place it would not by any means have followed that in england or scotland at this time by the same power as effectually in the hands of all who chose to partake in it as it was then those evils or any of them would have been produced who is there that can be insensible to the magnitude of the body of political experience that has presented itself to view since that time who is there that in respect of the extent to which the diffusion of political instruction has had place can be insensible to the difference between ireland on the one hand and england and scotland on the other section iv coincidence of its characters with those of radicalism the position to be proved—and proved from the example here in question is—radicalism not dangerous what has been shown already is that democratic ascendency has nothing dangerous in it the thing now to be shown is the virtual coincidence between democratic ascendency as in that case established in respect of government and the state of things that would be established if a free and genuine representation of the people in the commons house were established upon the principles of radical reform impossibilities must not here be looked for between a state of things once actually in existence and a state of things only in imagination and proposal—between a state of things established without authority—by other than the constituted authorities—and a state of things as proposed to be established by legal regulations—the work of the constituted authorities—a coincidence in terms cannot rationally be expected all that can be reasonably looked for is that between the substance of the elementary arrangement or leading features on the one part and those on the other the coincidence shall be found to have place first comes secrecy of suffrage here instead of the cause—the cause which if not followed by the effect would not be of any use or value—we must look for the effect we must look for freedom or in a word for genuineness we shall find it in the particular state of things in question secured by other causes—secured to a considerable degree but still too far short of that degree of perfection in which it would be secured by secrecy of suffrage it is not in itself that secrecy of suffrage is of any use the only use it is of lies in the effects of which it is productive to the community at large freedom and thence genuineness of the votes and thereby assurance that in each instance the vote given is conformable to what in the conception of the voter is the universal interest to the individual security against that coercion and oppression which might otherwise be exercised on him on account of the service he has or would have rendered to the universal interest—namely by preventing him from rendering it or punishing him for having rendered it as the case may be in the case in question freedom had place then from the very nature of the case for no one could have been a member of the association and as such given his vote in the choice of the delegate sent by it who had not been rendered a member of it by his own real inclination that among those who appeared in that character there were many who on ordinary occasions would have felt themselves dependent on the pleasure of this or that individual or number of individuals in the character of patron or patrons cannot be matter of doubt but in the circumstances of the time they found several shields against oppression from that cause in the impossibility of resisting the tide of public opinion and popular sentiment the dependent would find an excuse which could not but operate with more or less effect to soften the rigour of an oppressing patron and in that same force he might and in many instances would find a protection by the contemplation of which the patron would be deterred from exercising the oppression with whatever power the desire to exercise it might all the while be operating at the bottom of his heart next comes universality of suffrage to the existence of this universality of suffrage what is necessary on the occasion in question is not that all persons should actually vote but that all persons should as against any legal impediment find themselves at liberty to vote that upon no person by the exaction of qualification or otherwise any exclusion should be put on the ground of want of property or for any other cause that in     the case in question such was the state of things has been rendered manifest the protestants being that part of the population in which the institution appears to have originated if upon any description of persons an exclusion had been put not want of property but want of orthodoxy would have been the cause that at the outset in this or that part of the country exclusion for that cause had place to a certain extent seems to be sufficiently declared but if lord sheffield a declared and contemptuous adversary to radical reform is to be believed as the institution spread exclusion on this ground vanished and it was in proportion as radical reform forced itself into mens eyes and hearts that exclusion vanished and in a ratio greater than that of its population to the protestant part catholicism soon found place in the body of the associated volunteers will it be said that though on the ground of want of property no direct and manifest exclusion was put on any one yet an indirect and not less effectual exclusion was produced by the need of money for the purchase of arms and for subsistence during the time occupied in training as for arms to the extent that has been seen   000 they were furnished by government and as to the remainder of the total number of the associates property in the arms not being necessary to their use of them the cost of the requisite supply to all those who could not with convenience to themselves make the purchase would be a mere nothing among the men of firstrate opulence who by participation in the common interest were engaged heart as well as hand in the design till parliamentary reform came upon the carpet and gave as we shall see an opposite direction to the current of aristocratic interests and desires thirdly as to equality of suffrage rather for the purpose of showing that no one of the elements of radicalism has been passed by is any particular mention made of this one the circumstance upon which equality of effect and value as between one mans and another mans right of suffrage depends is equality of population as between each elective district and every other by no other instrument than the hand of law could any approach to equality in this particular it is sufficiently evident have on that or any other occasion been effected by no other instrument nor even by that without a constant particular and allcomprehensive body of arrangements such as that which has lately been submitted to the public view nor by even that instrument before the end of a considerable length of time of the districts in which the several component bodies of the allcomprehensive association were formed the dimensions would necessarily be those which having originally been marked out by the legal arrangements had been perpetuated by the universallyemployed denominations fourthly and lastly as to annuality of suffrage this feature of the plan is subordinate in the scale of importance to universality as both together are to freedom and genuineness and thence to secrecy if in its composition the representative body be such as determines it at all times to sacrifice to the interest of the corporation—of the ruling few of which it makes a part—the interest of the subjectmany any frequency of removal has little other and better effect than a correspondent repetition of allcomprehensive vexation and expense be this as it may of democratic ascendency as manifested during the prevalence of the irish volunteer system not simply annuality of election but ultraannuality had place under democratic ascendency as it would be regularly organized and permanently established in the case of the commons house—under and by virtue of a system of radical reform certain terms would of course be appointed on which the electors should be called upon to renew the signification of their wishes and thus correct any imperfection which in this or that instance may have been produced by a less auspicious choice in the case of the selfformed body in question its composition and operations not having been the result of any preestablished arrangement no such simultaneous and periodical faculty of change leaving each individual in secure possession of his situation during the whole interval between change and change would naturally present itself the result was a still greater degree of impermanence than under the arrangement of annuality of suffrage a still greater degree of impermanence and thence a still closer dependence on the the part of representatives on the good opinion and will and selfsupposed interest of constituents section vi extinction of democratic ascendency and reform—restoration of monarchicoaristocratical ascendency and its consequences having continued so long—democratical ascendency—how came it to end having proceeded so far—reform—how came it to stop—answer democratical ascendency was brought to its end by the leaders whom the people in their character of associated volunteers had chosen and in particular by those of them who were in parliament democratical ascendency being stopped monarchicoaristocratical ascendency was restored and reform was stopped of course these leaders—how came it that they deserted and     betrayed the cause of those by whom they had been chosen—answer because they had gained everything that in their eyes was for the advantage of their aggregate interest—namely the aristocratical interest and if they had proceeded with the people any farther the next step they took would have been for the advantage of no other interest of theirs than that which they had in common with the people now this broad interest was in their eyes of less value than their own peculiar one as for the interest of the rest of the community in so far as distinct from their own it was not it never had been it never could have been of any value in their eyes in the eyes of here and there an extraordinarily constituted individual perhaps yes but taking them as a body it is inconsistent with the nature of men that it ever should have been so by the emancipation of irish trade from english oppression they had given increase to the wealth of the people and to their own along with it by the emancipation of the irish parliament from the english parliament they had given increase to their own power without giving proportionate increase if any to the power of the people by parliamentary reform in so far as it was efficient they would have given increase to the power of the people at the expense of their own—of course it was not to be endured being all of them public men and in particular of that class of men—the whigs—to whose interest it is not safe openly to cast off as do the tories all pretence of regard for the interest of the people—for deserting the cause of the people it was necessary to find a pretence it was necessary to them all to lord charlemont in his acting to mr hardy his eulogist in his writings to mr grattan in his speeches then as now the substance of their pretences was included in the two words mischievous and impracticable so long as they had confined as far as appeared their designs to commercial and parliamentary emancipation the people had had the most influential members of the aristocracy of the country not only for their leaders but for their sincere and active friends and cooperators no sooner had parliamentary reform come in view than their leaders continuing still in the exercise of their functions became in secret the most determined and irreclaimable opponents still however they were not the less but rather the more determinately their leaders for it was for the more sure frustration of the most important and salutary of their designs and measures that their original friends secretly became their adversaries continued to be their leaders and to employ all their art and energy in giving obstruction to these same measures for this policy such as it was the irish nation and along with it the british are chiefly indebted to the earl of charlemont for the disclosure of it to his lordships biographer which of course is as much as to say his panegyrist with mr hardys most interesting as well as instructive performance the public was not gratified till the year    0 of mr plowdens more general history the date being   0  the secret for which the friends of radical reform are so highly indebted for the candour and simplicity of the biographer was as was natural still a secret to the historian the treacherous lord is accordingly mentioned by him not merely as the actual but as the wellmeriting object of the public confidence the   th of november      was the important day on which the fate of parliamentary reform and with it that of ireland and thereby also that of great britain was—no one can say for what length of time—decided up to that day continual had been the advance on the part of the associated volunteers the only true representatives of the people—the retreat on the part of the british monarchy with its dependents and adherents in the two houses on that day within trumpets sound of the then sitting parliament the convention was sitting with the earl of charlemont for its president to the house of commons from the convention came with a parliamentary reform bill in his hand mr grattans great and worthy rival mr flood the house of commons made a stand at the end of an almost furious debate the motion was rejected by a large majority the mover having been dealt with in the character of the chief of an invading enemy masters of the field the two houses resumed their independence they gave exercise to it by the appropriate resolutions and addresses volunteer bodies—provincial assemblies—conventions—were now put upon their good behavour from universally acknowledged benefactors and saviours of their country a few words would have sufficed for converting them into and declaring and constituting them traitors no sooner had parliament marked the association and in particular the meetings of delegates with the character of delinquency than the men of rank and opulence among its leaders either quitted it altogether or if they continued their attendance on it did so for no other purpose than that of putting a stop to its operations and nullifying its influence the last meeting of any assembly under the name of a convention or assembly of delegates was held as an illegal one and those by whom it was convened were though members of the official establishment prosecuted and punished     though the only means by which any constitutional reform could have been effected had thus been stigmatized and proscribed reform itself had not been formally included in the proscription nor were meetings for that purpose either simply and indiscriminately prohibited or endeavoured to be rendered ineffectual by restrictive regulations petitions and bills having a reform in the representation for their professed object were therefore on more occasions than one presented to the commons house but with the exception of the bill which so long as eleven years after the critical censure passed on the convention in      was moved in      by mr brabazon ponsonby whatever was proposed was so far short of radical reform as to be void of all real efficiency and even these changes insufficient as they were were rejected with scorn as absurd and with horror as dangerous in this state of things finding democratic ascendency and efficient reform under the constitution hopeless the friends of the people—the only men who were really so little by little began to turn their eyes to democracy as being the peoples only remaining hope between the termination of the american war in      and the commencement of the french revolution in      disturbances in various parts of the country on the part of various sets of insurgents from various causes took place on the part of the protestants the great allcomprehensive grievance was the system of universal corruption and misrule on the part of the catholics the great and alleclipsing grievance was catholic slavery—the remedy exclusively or chiefly looked for catholic emancipation thus differing in their objects the two sects in the course of their opposition to government frequently clashed and persecuted each other all this while government availed itself of this dissension and stands charged with having fomented it and by connivance and even instigation given encouragement and increase to the outrages which were so savage and so abundant on this occasion in ireland as on every occasion everywhere else the great object of those who shared in the power and sweets of government was to maintain and with as much increase as possible their power the extraction of the money of the subjectmany for the benefit of the ruling few being in so far as it was distinct from the prior object that which in the scale of estimated importance stood next to it occupied the middle place between that and the comfort and tranquillity of the people among the effects of everything that is commonly presented to view by any such words as discord or disturbance are the lessening or tendency to lessen the quantity of money capable of being extracted as above and the calling upon members of government for an extra proportion of attention and mental labour by the firstmentioned of these effects the interest of the purse was disagreeably affected—by the other the interest of the pillow even while employed in giving support to them it became an object with the government to apply some check and limitation to the discontents—some relief to the sufferings it was producing though it had force enough at command to set insurrection at defiance a different and less atrocious policy presented itself as eligible and was adopted division as it was the most obvious expedient so from the very outset it was employed but in the course of things—as by this means discord with its mischiefs to the rulers as above was kept up—the less pleasant operation of giving to one of the naturally opposed parties a partial relief was superadded vengeance sacrificing its gratification at the irresistible call of selfregarding prudence to which of the two parties the relief should be administered was not exposed to doubt the protestants whose object was a parliamentary reform and that a radical one could not be expected to be satisfied with anything less but parliamentary reform would to the powers that be—confederacies of monarchy and aristocracy—parliamentary reform would by the whole amount of it be the surrender of so much power—a partial abdication which king george was no more disposed to than king james was to that total one which he knew not of his having effected till he was informed of it by the two houses by parliamentary reform everybody who had power in his hands would have lost more or less of it by any relief that was proposed to be given to the catholics he did but exercise it the monarch lost none—the aristocracy lost none the protestants were the party by whom the expense of it would be paid by no concession to the reformists either in the shape of gratitude or in any other could much popularity be expected by no benefit except under the notion of its being the fruit of voluntary kindness can any such sentiment as gratitude be produced and little must he know of the nature of man and especially of men in that situation to whom any such free goodwill could present itself as possible among the advantages possesed by despotism one is—that so long as the blindness produced by it continues the praise of mercy may in proportion as the despotism is pure and complete be reaped in conjunction with the profit of tyranny under it vice is at all times covered with the mantle of virtue rightly understood all mercy supposes tyranny—every claim to the praise of mercy is a confession of tyranny take away tyranny that which is called mercy is if beneficially exercised nothing more than justice the   0 more mischief a man has it in his power to produce the greater the quantity which he has it in his power to abstain from producing and for every lot of evil which the monarch abstains from producing he obtains at the hands of the prostrate multitude the praise of mercy monarchy is almost the only soil in which that species of vice which calls itself mercy can make its appearance under aristocracy the praise being as it were lost on such a multitude—lost for want of an individual to fix upon is seldom claimed in a democracy there being no person in whom any such power as that of doing evil with impunity is to be found there is no place for mercy under every monarchy—under every aristocracy—under every form of government which is compounded of these two the great body of the people are in the eyes of their rulers objects of a mixed sentiment composed of hatred and contempt the most crafty are those in whom the dissocial affection is covered by a cloak of sympathy but among the vulgar herd indolence prevails and the expense of the covering is saved only where every such covering is most completely and disdainfully cast off could any such law be ordained as that which assuming as a fact its being itself on the part of the people the object of hostile affection attaches pains and penalties to the expression of it by every act which it does under the motive of stifling the expression of the sentiment the intensity of it is increased few are the boys who by a certain number of lashes applied by a tyrant schoolmaster might not be made to cry out i love you sir in any language which he professes to teach but to expect to find the boy in whose breast the affection so designated should by any number of lashes be produced is a sort of expectation not compatible with any degree of blindness short of that of which the late liberticide measures have afforded so conspicuous an example under such a government there is a continual conflict—or as swift would say in the tale of a tub—a continual game of leapfrog between love of money and love of vengeance by love of vengeance if it stood alone the whole species would be devoted to extirpation in ordinary times love of money steps in and says nay but if no payers of taxes were left alive no taxes would be paid some circumstances there are which admit of a compromise between the contending passions when population has got the start of subsistence and the indigent become troublesome the irascible appetite may be permitted to indulge itself without prejudice to the concupiscible by a prudent and discriminating use of muskets or sabres the irascible while it is affording a feast to itself may even be rendering a service to the concupiscible in proportion as the number of paupers is decreased so is the burden of the poorrates while to the catholics government with one hand held out relief and in driblets even administered it it set the protestants against them on the other by this policy the attention of both sects was diverted from the dreaded enterprise and both parties were enfeebled instead of menace the great body of the catholics betook themselves to prostration catholic suffrage was given to them—catholic emancipation was offered to their hope those who wanted the faith necessary to such hope became insurgents—were unsuccessful—were subdued and thus instead of the electors and representatives which victory would have rendered them they became rebels and traitors being thus brought under management the great body was prepared for offering their necks along with those of their protestant fellowcountrymen to that measure from which the people of both nations received the common yoke conclusion a charge then has been made—a charge than which a more perfectly groundless a more absurd one never was or could be made myriads are its direct objects and with them millions have been the victims of it all this i have proved and now that i have proved it what am i or any one to be the better too probably but so much the worse the stronger the proof the more intolerable the provocation—the provocation afforded to those against whom there is no security—whose will is their only law and who the more highly they are provoked will be but the more likely to set upon me their legal black mastiffs and drag me into a prison there to finish what remains of life subversion of the constitution—enmity to english institutions—almost treason what needs there more than a few such phrases—phrases completely void of all meaning other than that by which the disposition and designs of those by whom they are employed is manifested almost treason today it may be quite treason tomorrow judges ready to decide this crown lawyers ready to call for this—all this is secured and abundantly secured by the constitution as it stands if to do this by the forms of the law would be too much trouble what should hinder men in power with or without the pretence of searching for treasonable or seditious matter from sending a soldier or an armed yeoman to put me to death the deed done a pardon or a noli prosequi follows this too is secured by the constitution as it stands not to speak of constitution for there is no such thing—if i love a government under     which such things not only can be done but are done how can i do so without hating or at least regarding with indifference sixteen or seventeen millions of human beings whose misfortune it is to live under it can i do this no but i can say i do so and after this declaration if this will satisfy them i am ready to do so at this time and at all times the advocate of reason has drawn forth all his reasons—rendered demonstration complete and disproof impossible what is the consequence is conduct in anywise amended by it is any of the desired effect produced by it no either it is turned aside from with a mixture of fear and scorn or if noticed noticed no otherwise than as a butt for ridicule look—did you ever see such a fool as this man as if when we said he meant to strip us of our property we or any man of common sense could believe it no—let him go to rome with his reasoning and make the pope turn protestant or to constantinople and make the sublime porte turn christian this is the radicalist who thought he should bring us over to radicalism by showing that the principles of it had been professed to be acted upon in kings speeches you remember how brougham quizzed him and how good a laugh it made for us a parliamentary ground yes that every parliamentary measure must have of course—not that the ground must have any truth in it where has the man lived all this while now let any man who has ever thought it worth while to consider what parliament is—let him say whether if instead of the words about subversion of the rights of property an equal number of words taken by lot out of johnsons dictionary would not in that place have had the same effect and whether if in addition to what has been done the bill of rights had been repealed in form and the mutiny act made perpetual the majorities would have been less or whigs more numerous and constant in their attendance or more active for the peoples interest in their counties let not the substance of the charge brought against us by the destroyers of our liberties—by the subverters of our rights—be out of mind the object we are charged with aiming at is to their purpose at least precise enough it is the subversion of the rights of property—the subversion not the destruction—the subversion by means of a new partition for without aiming at destruction which as above is impossible no other mode of subversion is there that can be aimed at but we have seen how impossible it is that any plan for mere partition of property should be formed and acted upon what they put into his speech—the men who put it there—did they themselves believe it to be true or did they not if they did think of their wisdom if they did not think of their honesty—think of the task which that man has to perform whose endeavour it is to expose the falsehood of those pretences on the ground of which for the more effectual preservation it is said of english institutions english liberties have been destroyed an absurd design is professed to be imputed—so palpably absurd that the fact of its being really supposed to be entertained is impossible of this impossibility a manifestation has been made what is the consequence—that the charge is retracted oh no but some other design of equally palpable absurdity is then imputed confute the second imputation then comes a third and so on out of the tyrants brain come chimeras after chimeras in any number now if it were possible suppose the last chimera destroyed what would the accused—and if not all accused the whole people of the country have been punished—what would the accused be the better for it not a whit this power is still in hand a power by which every oppression in every shape in which it is wished to be exercised can be exercised at pleasure the power is still in hand—it can equally be exerted with a pretence as without a pretence the pretences under which the subversion has been effected are all dissipated but the subversion remains the same the wolf and the lamb—how often has that fable been—how often will it continue to be—converted into fact the devourers pretences are all refuted but the victim is not the less devoured the men in question—the accused—protest and declare in the face of day—thousands and ten thousands—that they have no such design—no design whatever by which the right of property could be touched the state of the representation rendered what it is pretended to be—that is their aim that and nothing more these protestations what regard do they receive not any though the individuals are unknown yet that they are radicalists is known and this is sufficient to deprive them of all title to be believed men drenched in insincerity—men to whom no one who has ever been at the pains of making observations on them believe anything they assert the more for their asserting it—these men—though even not these men individually and responsibly—throw out an insinuation to this or that effect—an insinuation which means anything or nothing just as they see convenient this insinuation is acted upon—the declarations of the thousands of witnesses are set down in the account as equal to 0 such in this case is the law of evidence     how unequal is the contest between honesty and reason on the one part and sinister interest in or out of office on the other—how hard the lot of the advocate on the honest side on the part of sinister interest a short phrase composed of falsehood and nonsense is thrown out and this is to be accepted as a reason—as a reason and that of itself a conclusive one on which the whole difference between good government and bad government in this country and thence perhaps in every other—at this time and thence perhaps at all times—is to depend the advocate of reason sets himself to work he displays the nothingness he detects and exposes the fallacies what is he the better the exposure is turned aside from the compound of falsehood and nonsense continues to be delivered with the same effrontery and the same intolerant arrogance as ever even were that abandoned some other phrase of the like material would be employed instead of it the same work would be to do over again and with equal fruit subversion of the constitution your aim is to subvert the constitution behold in this phrase one of those compounds of falsehood and nonsense equally useful to and equally employed by tories and whigs the constitution—in which is implied the constitution of the state as in existence herein lies the falsehood this constitution you are aiming to subvert here is the nonsense so applied subversion means nothing that which has no existence cannot be subverted now as to the existence of a constitution for these forty years and more we have known what a constitution is and so long every man who has chosen to know has known that we have no such thing look to united america behold there twentytwo states each having a constitution of its own—a real constitution and the congressorial government which has a constitution in which all these others are included these constitutions were established each of them by a convention chosen by the great body of the population—by that body out of whose obedience all power is composed and by the interests of which all power ought in its exercise in so far as it is not tyranny to direct itself there we see so many real constitutions in this country what have we to which we give that name a mere fictitious entity—a creature of the imagination—a sham—an imposture when the existence of a constitution is asserted or assumed what is done out of his own head to suit his own private or party purposes in the form of words that presents itself as best adapted to these sinister purposes—some one says the constitution is so and so—the constitution says so and so while the truth is that the constitution not being anything is not so and so—not being anything it says nothing—neither so and so nor anything else common sense being none—truth being none—reason being none—argument being none—on either side these dissensions—how are they to be made up within doors by effrontery by arrogance by violence by intolerance—without doors by sabres by bayonets by fieldpieces is it really among your wishes that we should possess the blessing give us then a constitution or let us give one to ourselves this done

nonagenda the distribution of the imaginable stock of institutions will differ in a very considerable degree according to the different circumstances of the several political communities in regard to defalcations from general opulence for the security of subsistence an arrangement of that sort which in one country may be at once needful and practicable may in another be either not needful or what

abundant  the compound term matter of wealth is employed to prevent ambiguity it carries with it a reference to quantity there are many things which may constitute part of the matter of wealth which when taken separately or in small quantities would hardly be called wealth thus the wealth of a stationer may consist in rags a small portion of which lying on a dunghill few would call wealth none however could deny that they might constitute part of the matter of wealth opulence though so nearly of kin to wealth—and the rather for that very reason—requires to be distinguished from it opulence is relative wealth relation being had to population quantity of wealth being given the degree of opulence is therefore not directly but inversely as the population i e as the degree of populousness—as the number of those who are to share in it the fewer the sharers the larger each ones share † wealth considered as arising at successive periods is called income that portion of it which is employed for the purpose of giving increase to its amount is called capital an individual who would in any manner employ himself in the accumulation of wealth ought to possess—  materials on which to work   tools wherewith to work   a place in which to work   necessaries for his subsistence while at work all these objects are comprised under the name of capital in the order of history labour precedes capital from land and labour everything proceeds but in the actual order of things there is always some capital already produced which is united with land and labour in the production of new values when an article of the produce of land or labour in place of being consumed or kept for the use of him who has made it or caused it to be made is offered in exchange it then becomes an article of commerce—it is merchandise in all civilized societies a class of persons is found who purchase of the manufacturer that they may sell to the consumer the whole of the operations of manufacture and of sale may be described by the general terms of production and trade  thirty years after the conclusion of the seven years war some ammunition bread that had been baked for the prussian army at the time of that war was found in such a state as to have been eatable a piece of it was eaten for curiositys sake by a person whom i knew in default of stones which have sometimes for want of iron been used

person whom i knew once cut his finger as he told me with a piece of suffolk cheese hammocks articles of subsistence or rather of customary luxury not indispensably necessary to subsistence for a russian often sleeps upon a bench or upon the floor—articles of subsistence of a middle nature between clothing and lodging are frequently applied to the purpose of defence on shipboard being stowed in such manner as to deaden the stroke of the shot † instances of instruments of mere enjoyment are abundant—tobacco and perfumes may be sufficient for illustration ‡ it is in consequence of the interconvertibility above mentioned—wealth in one shape being convertible into every other—that every instrument of mere enjoyment is a pledge of security and that national power so far as depends upon wealth is in proportion not to absolute but only to relative opulence—not to the absolute quantity of the matter of wealth in a nation but to its ratio to the mass of the population for of the aggregate value of the aggregate mass of the matter of wealth in a nation the part dedicated to enjoyment is the only part applicable to the purpose of defence what is necessary to subsistence must be applied to subsistence or the man must starve hence the reason why france so much superior to britain not only in population but in absolute wealth is yet inferior in power except with relation to countries so near that the expense of invading them may be more or less defrayed by the contributions raised in them  in the character of an article of subsistence a pound of potatoes and a pound of pineapples may stand pretty nearly upon the same level—but a single pound of pineapples may sell for the same price as one hundred pounds of potatoes—the pound of potatoes selling for a halfpenny and the pound of pineapples for one hundred halfpence this being the case out of the hundred halfpence which is the price and value of the pound of pineapples one halfpenny goes to subsistence and the remaining ninetynine to mere enjoyment it is the same thing as if the halfpenny had been employed in the purchase of another pound of potatoes and the remaining ninetynine in the purchase of perfumed powder for the hair instead of being put into the mouth for nourishment  examples establishments for the propagation of knowledge viz on the subject of those arts on which the augmentation or preservation of the matter of wealth in any of its shapes depends in england—  the board of agriculture   the royal institution   the veterinary school   the royal academy viz to a certain degree if considered in this point of view in each of these several instances the amount of profit reasonably to be expected is beyond calculation while the individuals among whom it may come to be shared are equally out of the reach of conjecture on the other hand in the character of a source of profit there is no limited assemblage or class of individuals to whom the establishment of any one of these institutions would at the same time have been practicable and have afforded a reasonable expectation of payment for the expense   an illustrious and more useful example—because more needful as well as more extensive than all these english ones put together supposing the execution to correspond with the design—is afforded by the universities and other educationestablishments now setting on foot in the russian empire   0    france on the same supposition may be referred to for another the justification of the communication from sea to sea through scotland by the caledonian canal is to be sought for in the same principles though the preponderance of profit over expense can scarcely be expected to prove equally considerable of the profit part though to an unassignable amount will distribute itself among a limited and perhaps individually assignable description of individuals other part in portions altogether unassignable among individuals more clearly unassignable viz among the community at large on this supposition it seems it is that the expense was divided between the aggregate of these private purses and the public purse had the profit to the local proprietor and other neighbouring inhabitants been adequate and a fund adequate to the whole expense been obtainable from that source the propriety of a contribution at the public expense would have fallen to the ground †

not by grants of money it made no addition to the general wealth in the way of forced frugality  to the opulence of the prussian empire frederic the great made some real additions and some imaginary ones the imaginary ones consisted in encouragements given to this and that branch of profitseeking industry the real ones consisted in money given on condition of being employed in the shape of capital but to be given to peter it must have been taken from paul and his brethren this he scrupled not to do his object being—the increase of his own power and grandeur not the preservation of the means of enjoyment in the hands of his subjects he was content to purchase opulence at the expense of justice at a similar expense egypt not only was but continues to be enriched—enriched with pyramids and temples perhaps having placed himself in a state of perpetual insecurity by injustice towards his neighbours he found himself under a sort of necessity of increasing his means of security by this injustice towards his subjects on this supposition the injustice consisted—not in the taxes for defence and the taxes for the production of national wealth as a fund for defence which the perpetually impending danger had rendered necessary—but in the wars of rapacity by which the perpetually impending danger had been produced among the largesses bestowed by the same monarch we may find another class which does not come under either head of reprobation these consist in money given in reparation of damage done by war largesses of this class are not only unexceptionable but useful being consistent as well with the interests of justice as with those of national opulence their utility rests on the same basis as that of insurance against loss by calamities purely physical as to the largesses given under the notion of special encouragement encouragement to a particular branch of trade in preference to others though the addition set down as made on this score by each sum of money so bestowed was imaginary yet from that same sum of money flowed a real addition though on a different score viz on the score of forced frugality as above explained  to this head belongs the investigation of the influence of money on real wealth—or say for shortness wealth money may well be put in contradistinction to everything else which is ever called wealth—which is ever considered as a modification of the matter of wealth for money so long as it is kept in the shape of money and in the same hands is of no kind of use in that shape no man can ever make any kind of use of it but by parting with it or at least standing engaged to part with it what value it has is in the way of exchange value in the way of use it has none when out of that shape the materials are thrown into other shapes then indeed they have their value but for which they would have had none in the way of exchange paper money not having in respect of its materials any value in the way of use has no value but in the way of exchange nor in that way but on the supposition of its being capable of being exchanged for that money or an equivalent for that money of which it contains and conveys the promise † the following is an indication of the indirect incometax resulting from increase of money—in britain anno   0  money is about £  000000 income about £   000000—              —each million added to money adds therefore three millions for ever to pecuniary income and this setting aside the    per cent for ever £  0000 for profit on the million if employed in the shape of capital without addition to real income if in every year £ 000000 be added to money plus £ 00000 for an equivalent to the addition made as above to real wealth in    years anno      the nominal or pecuniary amount of a mass of real income equal to the amount of   0  will be doubled i e become £   000000 to which will be added £ 0 00000 for an equivalent to the intermediate addition to real wealth £ 00000 ×    but the £   000000 of      being worth no more than the £   000000 of   0  each £ 00 of the £   000000 will be worth but £ 0 of the £   000000 that is the income of each fixed incomist will by that time have been subjected to an indirect income tax of £ 0 per cent he whose pecuniary income in      is double what it is in   0  will in point of wealth be neither a gainer nor a loser by the change not so in point of comfort for by so much as he is a gainer in wealth in the one way by so much he is a loser in the other and by the nature and constitution of the human frame sum for sum enjoyment from gain is never equal to suffering from loss ‡ as if a proprietor of a mine of gold or silver living solely on the income yielded to him from his mine and spending his whole income as income is spent by nonlabouring hands were to receive an increase of such his rent in the shape of gold or silver ready coined and spend the whole of it as before—or as if a government should issue paper money in discharge of its debts or for defraying the consumptive part of its expenditure ∥ as in the case of paper money issued by a banker to a borrowing customer agriculturist miner fisher manufacturer or merchant to be employed in trade c § the compensation besides being inadequate in quantity is in its application unconformable to justice being shared in larger proportion by the mercantile man for whose benefit the tax has been imposed than by the public on whom it has been imposed ¶ money inasmuch as while it remains in the same hands it possesses not any value in the way of physical use has no other value than what at the instant of its passing from hand to hand it possesses in the way of exchange  this is what governments should consider when they engage to make payments of money in large masses at once to governments or individuals in foreign countries  in ireland in      or thereabouts the reduction of the rate of interest from   to   per cent was proposed in parliament as a means of increasing wealth but though proposed by the administration there was rejected after a hard struggle the defence of usury which i sent over at the time contributed to throw out the measure as parnell then chancellor of the exchequer very goodhumouredly acknowledged to me † for the proof of these positions the reader is referred to mr benthams defence of usury showing the impolicy of the legal restraints upon pecuniary bargains inconsistency is the natural companion of laws dictated by narrow views it it is lawful to lend or borrow at any rate of interest in maritime enterprises as if the pretended dangers and pretended abuses which render the indefinable evil named usury so much the object of dread could only exist upon dry land and depended upon the solidity or fluidity of the element upon which the enterprises were carried on ‡ in england a capitalist cannot employ any portion of his capital in trade without being considered a trader and consequently responsible in the whole extent of his fortune there is not statute law to this effect but it is said to be a rule of common law  this has been partially accomplished by   w iv    vict c    which empowers the crown to limit by patent the responsibility of the partners of trading companies—ed † wealth of nations b ii ch    see b i ch ix  adam smith after having read the letter upon projects which was addressed to him and printed at the end of the first edition of the defence of usury declared to a gentleman the common friend of the two authors that he had been deceived with the tidings of his death mr bentham received a copy of his works which had been sent to him as a token of esteem  when at the expense of a war which has cost a hundred millions of money and in which a hundred thousand lives have been sacrificed england has got a new colony—whatever portion of wealth in the shape of capital is transferred to the new spot the englishman considers as created for a few negative hundred thousands ayear he looks upon the positive hundred millions as well bestowed on the strength of this negative increase in opulence the englishman increases in insolence the german envies him the frenchman would devour him—and thus it is that wars are never to have an end it is true that by the export of capital a check is applied to the virtual income tax imposed upon fixed incomists by the reduction effected in the rate of interest by the continually increasing ratio of that part of the mass of money which is employed in the shape of capital to the remainder which is employed in the shape of expenditure of income but this is a good which is effected without being intended to be done  bryan edwards in his history of the west indies even in exaggerating the utility of colonies does not suppose the rate of profit upon capitals employed in the plantations greater than seven per cent whilst it is fifteen per cent upon capital employed in the mothercountrya a this fifteen per cent was taken from one of the finance pamphlets of treasury secretary rose some years before to a question put by me to the late sir francis baring the answer was six per cent this meant of course over and above interest then at five per cent—communicated by the author  each being multiplied by the number of times it has been employed within the year in making the purchases of which ultimate prices are composed † it may however happen in some instances that a branch of industry which if pursued would be more profitable than any other requires a mass of capital of such magnitude as individuals separately taken or in small numbers are not able to raise but where this happens it can only be in consequence of positive regulation of government which in contemplation of the mischief apprehended from overgrown masses of capital in certain cases forbids limits or seeks to limit the quantity of capital that shall be applied under one management to any branch of industry—by limiting the number of individuals who shall be allowed to contribute to it—or by not suffering a man to embark in trade any part of his property without embarking the whole in giving an encouragement in this shape government does little or nothing more than remove obstacles of its own creating and the good it does if any is done at no expense  at least where the revenue of the government is not the produce of land or the interest of money formed by an accumulation of rent of this nature is a part of the revenue of the republic of berne  it is true though it may not be worth the expense of supporting it by bounties with a view to the increase of wealth it may be proper to assist it as a means of subsistence or defence it is still more true that what ought not to be done with the intention of supporting an unprofitable branch of trade may yet be proper for preventing the ruin of the workman actually employed in such business but these are objects entirely distinct  adam smith has made a mistake in saying that a bounty upon production was a means of abundance on which account it was better than a bounty on exportation  the same effect is produced when it is endeavoured to favour the importation of corn for example by giving a bounty to the first importers its effect is to increase the price in foreign countries  i mean always in virtue of its destructive properties for in a general way no laws except those by which other laws are repealed can fail of doing harm as being so much lumber by the load they add to the system † the drawback of the salt duty in favour of fisheries may be mentioned as one which formerly existed  it is said that the success of the american armies was partly owing to their skill in these employments composed almost entirely of husbandmen they excavated ditches and formed entrenchments and other works connected with camps with a facility which astonished their adversaries the russian armies possess the same advantage in a still higher degree † upon this subject see vol i principles of the civil code p     ‡ ibid vol i p      it is not without distrust that i here give this feeble extract from a manuscript work of mr benthams on prices and upon the causes which increase prices it embraces so great a number of questions that it is not possible to give a correct outline of the whole in so short an abridgment—note by dumont  see vol i

scotland and £    for ireland vide commons report on patents—ed † it is scarcely necessary to remark that in blaming the abuse no reproach is intended to be cast upon the individuals who finding it established profit by it these fees form as lawful a portion of their emoluments as any other it is however to be desired that in order to put a stop to this insult and oppression an indemnification were granted at the public expense equal to the average value of these fees if it be proper to levy a tax upon patents it ought instead of being levied in advance upon capital to be postponed till the patent has produced some benefit ‡ increase of population is desirable as being an increase of—  the beings susceptible of enjoyment   the beings capable of being employed as instruments of defence it results of course from the increase of the means of subsistence and cannot be carried beyond them of population nothing is said by adam smith yet of what use is wealth but with reference to population—and how can either be considered in any comprehensive point of view without the other since quantity of wealth being given degree of opulence is inversely as population  the name of mr malthus who will for the future occupy the post of honour in political economy upon the subject of population is not mentioned here because this work was many years anterior to his this chapter with many other fragments was communicated to the authors of the bibliotheque britannique published at geneva and was inserted in the  th volume in      if mr malthus had known it he might have cited it as an additional proof that his principle relating to population was not a new paradox but what was new was to make a rational and connected application of it to deduce from it the solution of so many historical problems to survey europe with this principle in his hand and to prove that it cannot be resisted without producing great confusion in social order and this is what mr malthus has accomplished in a manner as conclusive as respects his arguments as interesting in respect of his style and his details—note by dumont  the author is consistent and montesquieu appears to me not to be so book xxxiii ch x he has well explained the true principle but he has not followed it his elogium upon the regulations of augustus respecting marriage is extremely singular they have pleased montesquieu by some vague idea of the protection of morals they violate every principle of reward and punishment they are neither analogous nor proportional they punish a man because he is unhappy or prudent—they reward him because he is happy or imprudent they corrupt marriage by mercenary and political views and after all the object aimed at is missed montesquieu acknowledges the impotence of these laws the benefit of the remedy being null there remains only the evil he blames louis xiv ch xxvii for not having sufficiently encouraged marriage by only rewarding prodigies of fecundity louis xiv did too much by his establishments for the poor nobility and he has been too frequently imitated humanity was the motive of these foundations but this humanity was equally productive of evil as it respected those who bore the expense and as it respected the class whom it was intended to relieve and who were not relieved on the contrary the more the indigent of this order were assisted the more they increased in fact every individual requires a certain quantity of wealth to be in a state to marry does he marry imprudently his distress is without doubt an evil but it operates as a warning to other persons of the same class if you oppose this natural effect if you institute foundations for families if you grant pensions or other favours on account of marriage what follows it is no longer an establishment submitted to calculation—it is a lottery in which hope is consulted rather than prudence many venture but few succeed you intended to give support and you have laid a snare what you did in order to diminish the evil has only served to make it worse in pity to these unfortunate persons they ought not to be encouraged to marry when they no longer are deceived by hope they will no longer be unhappy in england there is neither restriction nor encouragement and there is no dread lest the stock of nobility should fail—there is no dread lest celibacy should be hurtful to population the shameful and sad misfortune is not known there of the existence of a class of persons set apart to idleness and poverty—note by dumont  i have under my eyes a large political work of m beausobre counsellor to the king of prussia in which at the article population he gives no less than twenty recipes for increasing it—the nineteenth is as follows—it is proper to watch during the fruit season lest the people eat that which is not ripe he ought to have provided the means for carrying this regulation into execution to have indicated the number of inspectors who should judge of the ripeness of fruit the watchmen who should be stationed over it and the magistrates who were to judge of its infractions another method consists in hindering men from marrying very disagreeable women he neither says to what judge he would remit this delicate inquiry nor upon what principles he would have the ugliness of women proved nor the degree of inquiry which ought to be permitted nor the fees that ought to be paid the remainder is very nearly in the same taste hindering the marriage of old men with young women—that of young men with women much older than themselves—hindering the marriage of persons not likely to have children there are other recipes of this political pharmacopœia little less ridiculous but not less useless his complaints respecting prostitution are reasonable if they had for their object the misery of the class of courtesans victims of a constrained celibacy they are of no force as respects population which suffers nothing i refer to what has been said upon this subject in vol i principles of penal law part iii ch v p     prob   to make such arrangements that a given desire may be satisfied without prejudice or with the least possible prejudice  when indirect taxes are levied upon articles of luxury a man need pay no more than he pleases but the case appears to be otherwise as respects the poor when they are levied upon articles of necessity—ed  i speak of the recently past one knows not well what to say of the present † indirect taxes being collected from venders presuppose exchange direct taxes may alike be levied exchange or no exchange—they may be levied on producers venders or nonvenders the further a nation is advanced in the career of opulence the fewer the articles produced by nonvenders a main cause as well as effect of opulence as per adam smith is division of labour—as this advances fewer and fewer sorts of things are done by the same hand till at last some one sort of thing excepted there is nothing that a man does not find it cheaper to buy than to make at home this applies more particularly to manufactures in agriculture the division is stopped by a variety of causes which for the most part though not in toto are insuperable france used to swarm and swarms as much as ever with petty occupiers of land—proprietors or not proprietors who producing each of them the greater part of what he consumes have the less need and the less ability to purchase and who accordingly if they were not forced to pay direct taxes would scarcely pay anything ‡ see escheat vice taxation vol ii p     and protest against lawtaxes

into account was about   0000 quarters and of flour  00000 cwts which taken in round numbers at  0000 quarters makes  00000 quarters in all the prorata exports of the same period were about   000 quarters of wheat and  00000 cwts of flour say in all   000 quarters of wheat so that the net amount of foreign grain consumed in great britain will have been about   0000 quarters yearly calculating the annual consumption of the country at    millions of quarters the proportion employed of foreign to homeproduced wheat will be about a twentysixth part dr adam smith gives no data but assumes the

government but being unconformable to the established usage it would be apt to strike the customer as a great drawback from the value stand in the way of the profit expected as under mentioned by forbearance on the part of noteholders to receive the interest see ch v and would be in a manner destructive of the advantage obtainable in the way of compound interest by persons keeping the paper in hand as stock is kept in hand for that purpose   art   a farthing by taking for the standard note a principal sum having for the amount of its daily interest at the proposed rate of interest an even sum i e a sum having an existing piece of coined money or number of pieces of coined money corresponding to it the multiples of this standard note will in like manner have even sums for the respective amounts of their daily interest and their aliquot parts will have for their amounts of interest sums capable when put together of being made up into even sums here as in exchequer bills the interest is computed daily that each note may receive from each day a determinate addition to its value and may pass accordingly in circulation the smallest of all notes possessing this property is taken for the standard note because the smaller a note the greater the number of persons that are capable of becoming customers for ita the standard note being scarcely small enough in this view it were better perhaps that not only the half but the quarter of it should be issued at the same time the larger notes will serve to protect the smaller ones from the contempt which might otherwise attach upon them by reason of the smallness of the daily and even weekly amount of interest a had the bank been sufficiently aware of this would they have waited till compelled by necessity before they issued their £  and £  notes   art     per cent for the reason why no higher rate of interest could be allowed with profit on a series of notes carrying daily interest nor any lower above  ⅜ per cent which in the first instance might be too low see currency table note m   art   bottom of the scale see currency table   art   forbearance see currency table on a note which passes on from hand to hand any number of years may elapse before the interest on it is received from government since the interest may be received by each holder with less trouble from the individual to whom he passes it hence one source of the profit to government see chap v it is only where a man keeps a note in his hands as a source of income that the interest of it will be applied for at the offices in fact it is only in the case where a man means to hoard up at compound interest that it will be necessary for him to receive the interest upon his paper from government inasmuch as without trenching upon the principal he may spend the income from his notes by passing off a proportion to that amount keeping in hand the rest   art   interest added upon all notes of the same denomination interest must commence upon the same day say the first day of the half year otherwise     notes of the same denomination might be of so many different values and if interest is to commence on that day a purchaser in the way of issue must pay for the note accordingly otherwise customers would be apt to delay taking out their notes till the last moment keeping their money in their pockets or employing it in other ways in the meantime and then they would pour in all at once in crowds too great to be served   art   at a less price want of security against depreciation has hitherto been the bane of government currencies and is among the reasons why bankers paper yielding a low interest is taken notwithstanding the existence of a government currency exchequer bills yielding a higher interest government must it is true have the money it wants upon any terms but so long as it reserves to itself the faculty of selling any one species of annuities ex gr the existing stock annuities in a quantity commensurate to the amount of the money it wants at the times price it may refuse to sell any other such as the proposed note annuities under a fixed price as anybody may have as much of these annuities as he will at par nobody will ever give more and as no more can ever be sold than is applied for and the demand for these annuities will increase as the mass of existing stock annuities comes to be redeemed by the money raised by the sale of these note annuities backed by the money from so many other funds no man need ever part with them at a less price since by taking an annuity note in the way of circulation a man will save the trouble of going to the office for it and taking it out in the way of issue not to speak of the small fee which it may be necessary to require see art    and chap iv   art   paid off by an assurance to this effect nothing can ever be lost to government because so far from profit while an annuity to the amount of £  ayear can be paid off by £ 00 an annuity to no more than £     s ayear can never be paid off but to a loss and it will be no small recommendation especially when by the operation as will be seen of this measure the complete redemption of the existing mass of annuities has been brought to view see chap v §    0 art    this if not stopped by the expense which increases with the number and not with the value of the notes would be attended with several advantages   the copper notes the receiving of interest upon them being attended with a degree of trouble in proportion to the number requisite to produce a principal yielding a mass of interest worth regarding would stay in the circulation and by lessening pro tanto the amount of the supply capable of meeting the demands of those who want their paper to hoard for the purpose of income it would increase the scarcity of the paper of the first issue and render customers the more willing to accept a second issue at a reduced rate of interest   the profit by forbearance to receive the interest see chap v would take place upon the whole of this branch of the currency   the proposed paper being so effectually guarded as will be seen against forgery see explanations to the form of an annuity note and the copper coinage so much exposed to that crime notwithstanding all the exertions that have been made to rescue it the saving to the public especially to the inferior and more numerous classes on this score would be a matter of considerable and almost universal accommodation—and   the saving to government by the diminution of the expense of renewing the copper and other coinage would be proportionably considerable how far the expense would be capable of being paid for by the profit would be learned by experience from the silver notes the minuteness of the small notes would be protected from contempt by their relation to the large ones and to go in change for one another they must all of them even copper not excepted bear an interest and the same rate of interest a reason for making the extension gradual may be to avoid perplexing the public mind with a multiplicity of notes of different values before it has been familiarized with any of them but at the worst the magnitudes would be little if anything more numerous than in the case of banknotes    art    upwards the time for issuing large notes i e notes of the magnitude of the smallest exchequer bills and upwards in a word all annuity notes above the £ 0   s notes will not arrive till after stock   per cents are at par for till then exchequer bills yielding more interest will draw off from the proposed annuity notes all customers whose quantum of money capable of being kept in hand extends to such a purchase unless possibly in the remote parts of the country where exchequer bills are unknown or not in use    art    received at government offices were this to be done from the first a great lift would certainly be given to the proposed currency at once the only objection seems to be the possibility lest in case of any sudden turn taken against it by the public mind the exchequer should for a time be overloaded with it i e labour under a deficit of cash the only money that nobody can refuse to the amount of it but in chapter iv the improbability of such an event and at the same time an effectual remedy is pointed out supposing banknotes to be driven out of the circulationa the same sort of necessity or supposed necessity which gives employment to bank paper in the transactions of governmentb and in other transactions upon a large scale in preference to cash to save counting examining and luggage would create an equal demand for the annuity note paper on that score a this it should seem would depend upon government since if government in the issues of annuity notes refused to take bank notes in payment for them the unwillingness to take barren paper when interest bearing paper was to be had would soon become general if not universal as to the propriety of this or any further measures in the same view see chapters viii and ix b guineas cannot be used in any considerable dealings says mr h thornton in his evidence before the committee of the house of lords on the stoppage of the bank report p    reprinted in mr allardyces address on the affairs of the bank appendix p    by mr abraham newlands evidence in the above report p    it appears that the payments of cash into and from the exchequer are small in comparison with the payments in bank notes not above £ 0000 or £ 0000 aday upon an average remaining in the exchequer in the shape of cash forming a daily total of money cash and paper together averaging about £   0   see chap v and out of £ 0000000 paid on the score of dividends at the bank not above £  00000 or £  00000 is paid otherwise than in

characteristics of the postoffice establishment as compared with all other provinciallydiffused official establishments these form the properest stations for the transaction of the business as well as the properest or rather only proper standard for the mode of conducting it in the london penny postoffices deliveries of letters six in a day therefore once every day cannot be too often for deliveries of packets of annuity notes six times aday go letters some of them with money in them therefore once in a day cannot be too often for money to go without the letters the oftener the

that amount this public money being required to be kept unmixed with any other monies and in a government package and the officer declared to be a servant of government—in respect of its deficiency otherwise than from accident he might be treated on the footing of embezzlement—capital felony in case of absconding single otherwise in the penny postoffice onetenth of a penny is the pay in respect of each letter for marking each with two stamps besides the trouble of examining and receiving the money and occasionally of giving change in the case of those letters with which money is paid the proper quantum of pay is in all cases the least that will be accepted by a person competent to the business such cases only excepted in which from the nature of the service the value of it is capable of being raised to an indefinitely increasing pitch of excellence by extraordinary exertions with this exception quantity of trouble not value of the subjectmatter any otherwise than with a view to pecuniary responsibility is the proper standard and efficient cause of demand for pay poundage considered as a mode of remuneration is therefore very apt to be disproportionate and excessive on a letter for which no more than a penny is received—out of which penny the expense of conveyance must be defrayed as well as a portion of the expense of general superintendence and a profit made— 0 per cent for the trouble of receiving it is at the same time almost as little as can be given and yet though in this case no more than the tenth part of a penny as much as requires to be given for receiving the price of a set of stamps some of them as high as several pounds apiece the same poundage would be acknowledged to be excessive if the trouble attending the issuing of an annuity note the filling up the blanks and examining and taking care of the purchase money were no greater than that of receiving a pennypost letter allowance made for the proportion on which money is received and the requisite extra trouble taken experience shows that the tenth part of a penny would be a sufficient recompense but the trouble would be in a considerable degree greater—perhaps three four or five times as great—therefore so it would be necessary should the pay a halfpenny might in this way be necessary and at the same time sufficient in the case of the standard note of £      s and upon a note of this magnitude not only a halfpenny but several pence might perhaps as will be seen in art    without much inconvenience be thus imposed and thus as far as notes of that magnitude were concerned the expense of management at the local offices might be thrown upon the individuals—the purchasers but though a purchaser might not grudge a few pence for the profit to be made in the way of interest upon a £      s note he certainly would not give so much as a halfpenny for the profit to be made upon a sixpenny note as it would be three or four years before the interest would have reimbursed the fee thus advanced in notes that were to a certain degree below the standard note say in the £    s or £     s notes it would be necessary that the fee upon each though not remitted altogether should be reduced below the amount of the lowest coin—a farthing which would be the case if notes under the £    s note for instance were not to be taken out but in parcels and a halfpenny or a farthing were the fee upon each parcel in which case it would be necessary that government should make up the difference this it would be well worth its while to do even upon the copper notes since in yorkshire according to adam smith before the restriction on small notes sixpenny notes were issued by individuals in abundance as to the general annuity note office—having no intercourse with individual customers nor with the local officekeepers but by letter the nature of the business admits of its being conducted with perfect regularity and upon a plan extremely simple see chap v §   profit in respect of management    art    least quantitya a note under this amount would consequently not be capable of being taken out singly but only as one in a parcel with other notes of the same or different magnitudes so also perhaps in regard to the carrying in notes to the local office to be sent up to the general office to be returned from thence with the interest as likewise in regard to the changing large for small notes or vice versá or injured notes for fresh ones but instead of a prohibition as above the same end might be answered perhaps more advantageously in some at least of the above instances by a small fee acting as a penalty to the amount of it as by the next article by this means the offices would be kept clear of the most troublesome as well as numerous class of customers silver notes for example would in that case be taken out not singly by journeymen manufacturers but in parcels by masters by whom at payday they would be distributed among their journeymen interest would by this means be capable of being received at the offices upon the smallest notes which as above is necessary to their passing in change for large ones though what is probable is that on the small it will scarcely ever be demanded see on this head chap v profit by interest undemanded what is the least note that can be issued with profit will be determined by the quantity of time occupied in the operations necessary to the issue of it possibly on this account in the silver or at least in the copper notes if any the actual signature of the local officekeeper might be dispensed with and a stamp of some kind affixed at the time of issue at his office or previously at the general office be employed in its stead in this power is included that of suspending the issue of notes of any particular magnitude or magnitudes by which means in case of an inordinate demand for the proposed paper viz such an one as shall threaten to swell to a pernicious magnitude the quantity of it producing the effect of money in the circulation a stop may be put at any time to the inconvenience see ch ix rise of prices a not less for instance than the amount of the quarter note the £    s note or the half quarter the £     s note    art    emission exchange or payment of interest imposing after the opening of the office the minutest fee on any of these occasions would be a breach of engagement and moreover if otherwise than by authority of parliament an invasion of parliamentary rights in regard to the fixation of the amount no harm could result from allowing to the executive government a moderate latitude such as from a farthing to sixpence on the standard note of £      s and room would thus be allowed for following the dictates of convenience as indicated by experience without being so great as to check the issue the fee might perhaps be made to favour the circulation in the circulation it might produce a premium the maximum of which would be the amount of the fee the progress of the issue being known everywhere it is scarcely possible that in one and the same place this paper should be meeting with customers in the way of issue and at the same time meet with refusals in the way of circulation the trouble of taking out however small being with or without the expense of the proposed fee so much saved by taking the note in the course of circulation not even as between different places does it seem very likely that any such contrariety should take place but were the inconvenience to happen the proposed fee if made a little larger than would otherwise be necessary might afford something of a remedy suppose the fee on the £      s to be  d and the circulation dull at york while the issue was brisk at bristol a york banker taking them at par at york might by sending them to a correspondent at bristol sell the notes there at  d or  d premium especially if a correspondence of that sort were favoured in regard to postage so long as this lasted the issue at york would be stopped instead of getting them at the government office the customer would get them at the bankers whereby he would save  d or  d besides a part of the trouble and the load upon the market at york would be taken off an agio to an unlimited amount would indeed be destructive of one of the characteristic advantages of the measure but an agio to an amount thus strictly limited would scarcely it is supposed be felt as a disadvantage were the note kept in hand though it were but for a few days the interest on it for that small space of time would afford complete reimbursement of the greatest possible amount of loss if in regard to the quantum of the fee the principle were that it should amount to just so much as would be sufficient for the remuneration of the local distributor—this again would be a reason for making it variable within certain bounds for under any given plan for conducting the business it would be matter of experiment what is the lowest fee that would be sufficient and by such improvements on the plan as reflection fed by experience might indicate the time and trouble and thence the quantum of remuneration necessary might from time to time come to be reduced    art    accounts published the uses of such publication are as follows—   that from seeing this paper taken out in the way of issue people may be the more ready to take it in the way of circulation   that in case of its proving to be in any degree an impediment to the circulation of bank and country bankers paper the parties concerned may by observing how the paper spreads have timely warning to withdraw or keep out of the market any superfluity in their own paper   that in case of any local difficulty as to the circulation of the paper in one part of the country for instance by reason of any sudden and extraordinary demand for cash the load of the paper in the market may be lightened by sending it to another part of the country where the issue is observed to be going on briskly   that from the amount of the issue in the course of each given period indications may be deduced of the degree in which any temporary cause of depreciation must have operated before it can have the effect not only of stopping the issue but subjecting to a discount the quantity already in circulation   that data may be afforded from which the several classes of persons interested may be able to foresee the approach of the several results or effects in which they are interested such as the rise of stock   per cents to par—the growing scarcity of government annuities—the reduction of the rate of interest paid by government in respect of them—the increase in the mass of national capital by the paying off the annuitants—the reduction of the rate of interest in general c    art  0 conversion conversion is a word used for shortness to indicate the result of two operations—on the part of government the redemption of such or such a mass of stock annuities and on the part of the stockholders so expelled a purchase made of the fresh mass of note annuities to equal amount—a result which in the case where a man does not choose to part with the mass of annuity he receives from government is a necessary consequence that the disposition to accede to such conversion should be nearly universal seems altogether probable the loss of interest is but a sixtieth and in all other points the change will be greatly to a mans advantage in a very short period it cannot fail of taking place when stocks three per cents are no higher than par the £     s note annuities are it is true worth as far as interest only is concerned no more than £        —but no sooner are three per cents up at  0  than the £     s per cent are worth upwards of £ 00¼ among any such group of annuitants thus forcibly expelled there will always be a certain proportion it is true who at the time of the expulsion were desirous of disposing of their annuities and would have done so had the matter been left to their choice but by the supposition there will be at the same time another group desirous of purchasing a mass of annuities equal at the least to that which is thus wished to be disposed of otherwise the price of the article would not be at par which it is supposed to be—therefore setting the one demand against the other the whole amount of the mass of annuities paid off at or above par may be set down as so much taken from a set of proprietors who will not part with such their property but will accept of it in the proposed new shape proposed mode of effecting the conversion—adjoining to the room where a man signs in the stockbook a recognition of the redemption of his mass of stock annuities are two other rooms—a moneyroom as at present the dividendwarrant room and an annuitynote room question by the clerk is it money you want yonder is the room for receiving money and here is the warrant for it do you keep your annuities yonder is the annuitynote room and here is your warrant for the amount in annuitynotes on this occasion two provisions customarily inserted in the acts will require observance—  that notice a year in some instancesa halfayear in othersb be given of the intention to pay off and that the masses paid off at once be not less than of a certain magnitude—£ 000000 in some cases £ 00000 in others of the former the object was as it should seem that a man may have time to form his plans in regard to the employment of his money of the other to obviate the suspicion of personal preferences which if the masses were small and undetermined might be manifested in favour of individuals viz by paying a man off or respiting him whichever were most advantageous at the time to comply with these conditions as far as appears either practicable or material or consistent with the practice and intention of the legislature—suppose the course taken in regard to the redemption of the stock annuities with a view to their proposed conversion into note annuities to be as follows viz—   notice to be given in the usual form on the day immediately preceding the next day for a halfyearly payment or on any earlier day subsequent to the then last day of halfyearly payment—such notice to be expressive of a general intention on the part of parliament from and after the day mentioned in such notice to pay off the then remaining mass of stock annuities in masses or lots of not less than the above stipulated magnitude of £ 00000 as fast as the sums of money for the making of such payments shall respectively be completed—the order in which the masses shall be paid off to be determined by a lottery unless changed in the way next mentioned by the publication of the progress of the issue in the newspapers it will be known all over the kingdom day by day what sum is in hand applicable to this purpose the masses being marked in numerical order for this purpose each stockholder will see day by day whether the mass his portion of stock belongs to is ripe for payment or if not how soon it is likely to become so that a general notice of the intention in contradistinction to a particular notice for the very day was all that was meant by the legislature may be inferred with some degree of assurance from the practice in mr pelhams case fiftyseven millions worth and upwards was the mass of capital in relation to which notice was given on that occasion—that in the event mentioned it should on a particular day mentioned be paid off so that if the invitation given had remained altogether without compliance an event which for some time was highly probablec the whole would on that one day have been to be paid off and the money put into the hands of as many as on that one day might happen to apply for it but that such payment could have taken place either in respect of the whole of the mass or so much as the greater part of it and that either on the day fixed or on any assignable subsequent day within a weeks or a months or even a quarters distance of it is a result that does not present itself as probable to borrow nearly fiftyeight millions in the lump and at that early period too—or even nine and twenty millions and that payable all in one day—presents itself as an affair of no small difficulty even on the ordinary footing of mutual obligation as between the two contracting parties how much greater the difficulty if as by the supposition contended against one party composed of the eventual lenders was to be bound while government the eventual borrower was to remain loose it seems therefore that according to the interpretation put in that instance by parliament by a notice that the capital of government annuities will to such amount be paid off on such a day nothing more is to be understood than that as here proposed a part will be paid off on that day to such as apply for it and the remainder at some subsequent day or days according as the money for paying off shall happen to come to hand if not—and if it were regarded as an article not to be dispensed with that no one parcel of the consolidated   per cents should be paid off but on one of the halfyearly days in use for the payment of the dividends on those annuities and that day posterior by one day at least above a twelvemonth to the first day on which the notice to that effect shall have been made public—the consequence will be that upon the first parcel so paid off the loss of time and interest will amount to a full twelvemonth but that upon all subsequent parcels the loss of time will be such as cannot amount to less than a year and a quarter upon the whole for paying off the first parcel—say on the   th of december   0 —the latest day on which notice can be made public will be the   th of december   0  for paying off the second parcel the earliest day that can be appointed will be the   th of june   0  should a parcel of the magnitude required by the act £ 00000 have come in or been made sure by the   th of december   0  notice may be given on the next day appointing as the day of payment in respect of that second sum the   th of june   0  but on this second transaction  ¼ year all but a day would be lost if again by the   d of june   0  a third sum happened to have been collected or made sure and notice given accordingly for the   th of june   0  as before—then upon that sum no more than a year and a day would be lost as above mentioned and upon the whole supposing the intermediate days—of collection perfected and notice given accordingly—to run in a regular series between such earliest day and such latest day it would by the nature of an arithmetical series come to the same thing as if the quantity of time thus lost amounted to  ¼ year in each instance a    geo ii c    the

profit into positive loss the charges are such as i have reason to look upon as rather under than overrated by doing certain parts of the business himself or getting them done gratis by a friend a man may save so much of the expense—as his wife might save the expense of a mantuamaker by making her own gown but a contingency of this sort does not prevent the professional charge from being in a

administration to the deceased  this branch of profit will have for its accompaniment and that as we have seen already an inseparable one the effect and that an advantageous one of taking out of the market a mass of stock equal to the mass of annuity paper issued although the burthen on government in respect of the mass of annuity to be paid remain the same but though the effect be produced immediately and at all events the profit resulting from it depends upon two other circumstances—viz the having money to raise for the creation of government annuities and the arrival of the period which will put into the hands of government the power of bringing its annuitants to consent to a reduction in the amount of their several annuities these constitute two perfectly distinguishable branches of profit which will be considered in their respective places  the interest upon exchequer bills ceases when they are paid into the hands of the receivers of taxes  these papers appear to

end of period ii thenceforward its amount will decrease as the amount of the debt diminishes ‡ profit by interest undemanded ceases it is to be remembered at every reduction in proportion as the conversion from the paper bearing the higher rate into paper bearing the lower rate goes on—because whenever a note is paid off the whole amount of interest remaining due upon that note must be discharged as well as the principal it follows that in regard to the paper of such issue the time of forbearance cannot date from any earlier period than the opening of that issue  the premium is a necessary condition of the coexistence of two papers of the same denominative value bearing different masses of interest a man would never give £ 00 or the value for a mass of paper called £ 00 and yielding £       ½ ayear interest if for the same price he could get a mass of paper which though called but £ 00 yielded £        ayear interest † see further chapter vi advantage by addition to national capital  by this restriction the amount of the premium might perhaps be made less than it would have been otherwise—but this would comparatively be of little moment † this though so evidently true as to appear little better than nugatory will be apt enough to be overlooked or even appear disputable for such will naturally enough be the case if after rising the first year of the application of the given cause of elevation stocks should in consequence of fresh causes of depression experience a fall the next or any other succeeding year  this supposition is actually realized in the case of money employed in the redemption or purchase of portions of the landtax and laid out in the purchase of masses of stock annuities on government account to be added to the sinking fund the money for a purchase of that sort cannot be supposed unless here and there by accident to be saved out of the income of the year and defalcated from what would otherwise have been the unproductive expenditure of the year unless in the case where without any such call a sum to the same amount would have been saved and employed or lent out in the shape of capital it is therefore so much taken from the mass of national capital—on the other hand when handed on to the stockholders of whom the stock is bought and in payment for their stock it is then so much added to the mass of national capital being so much which would not have taken that course had it not been for the measure it therefore leaves the amount of national capital where it found it  i say restitution for as the amount is added to productive capital upon the redemption of the debt so was it taken from productive capital on the creation of the debt the case might be supposed in which this restitution should be complete and even more than complete it must however still be remembered that the parties into whose hands this new wealth is poured are not the parties from whose hands the wealth expended in war was originally drawn—that money given to a is no compensation for loss of money of life or of limbs to b—that if the acquisition be made it is made by no other means than that of the most cruel pinching—and that if the money wrung from pleasurable expenditure had been added the whole of it in the first instance to productive capital instead of being consumed in miserymaking expenditure the addition to productive capital and wealth would have been so much the more abundant it may be further observed that from the influx or rather reflux of capital upon the redemption of the debt suffering and loss must inevitably ensue to those whose incomes are reduced by the fall in the rate of interest of money but this consideration may serve to reconcile the public in general and the parties affected by it that such would have been their suffering and still greater had there been neither borrowing nor redeeming but had the country been reposing all the while in a state of uninterrupted peace † the source to which i am indebted for it is the evidence of mr henry thornton as printed in the several unpublished reports of the committees of lords and commons on the affairs of the bank in march and april      and reprinted in mr allardyces published address to the bank proprietors in the same year in the form of a note the substance of that evidence would form a valuable addition to the future editions of adam smiths wealth of nations  it is a fact no less curious than true that by a mere collateral circumstance such as the mode of transfer appointed and the nature of the evidence required in proof of title the nature of a species of property in itself the same in both cases should undergo so material a change without a degree of expense destructive of a part or the whole or even more than the whole of the value stock as we have seen cannot be broken down into masses corresponding to those small and diversified portions into which money is and must be divided—nor can it at any expense be either bought or sold on any occasion without loss of time and the obligation of personal attendance at one certain place the same for the whole island wheresoever the residence of the parties may happen to be in each instance it cannot be carried by a man in his pocket and so like so much cash distributed among any number of hands at the very instant the occasion for each disbursement arises annuitynote paper like cash and bank of england paper but still more divisible is already broken down into a multitude of portions still more various and commensurate to all purposes—and like cash is to be had at all times and in all places i have a weekly bill of £     s to pay to my baker the £  of it which should have come to me in bank paper has in consequence of the million of supposed deficiency of that

be tomorrow i have my batch of bread to mind my journeymen to overlook my customers to wait upon i can find no time to go with you to the bank today to receive stock another day to receive the interest and another day to sell the stock and if i were to receive it what would the principal amount to when the brokerage is paid out of it no it would be cheaper to me to give up the debt than to obtain payment for it on such terms how different would be the case if instead of stock i had my £     s worth of government annuities in the shape of an annuity note here i should say is your money—£     s is what i have just been giving for it pass it today—everybody will give you the same sum for it—keep it till tomorrow sevennight—anybody will allow you an additional farthing for it and so on a

usual magnitude but in notes of the reduced magnitudes—the £  and £  notes—whereby the market was enlarged to such an extent as if given to it at an earlier period would it seems probable have prevented the exigency   on the part of government the suspending to a certain degree the action of the restrictive laws by which individuals had been prevented from issuing notes below a certain magnitude   on the part of the commercial body by their agreement to accept of bank of england paper without demanding cash for it   to the force of these factitious remedies was added that of the natural remedy the return of the hoarded money of both kinds into the circulation upon the cessation of the alarm as no man can keep any unnecessary quantity of money by him for any length of time but to a loss would not this natural remedy together with the preceding one have been sufficient that the exigency of the case would have admitted of the waiting for the operation of these two lastmentioned remedies is more than i will undertake to say but that if it would the application of the two first might have been omitted with great advantage on another score is an opinion that will i imagine be acceded to by whoever recognizes the mischief pointed out as flowing from every addition to the quantity of money metallic or paper in chap ix on the rise of prices † to a theoretical glance it might be apt to appear that the lesser quantity of money might serve to convey the same quantity of annual receipts as the greater if in proportion to the deficiency in the quantity of matter the velocity of the circulation were to be increased but upon examination i do not imagine it would be found by what means the velocity would be capable of receiving any adequate increase the natural effect of those pressures to which such increased velocity would be a relief is—not to accelerate the circulation but to relaod editor it  it therefore would not begin to act in this capacity till after period i but from thenceforward the quantity would be more than adequate to the purpose here in question in a prodigious degree † in the compass of thirtythree years viz from      to    0

share in the profit on that paper in so far as country bankers paper came to be extruded by the proposed government paper the profit by this tax would fall of course to be deducted from the sum total of profits promised by the proposed measure ‡ in this case nothing would be receivable at the annuitynote offices but cash ∥ the estimated amount of bank and country bankers paper in   00 § the estimated amount of money of all kinds in   00 nearly  upon the whole then the result is that by every £ 00 worth of paper issued by a banker he imposes a tax upon the community and that to an amount prodigiously greater than that of his own profit † for example let £ 000000 be the quantity of extra influx money introduced into the circulation in the course of the year—let the quantity of extra labour produced by this extra influx be equal to full employment for  00000 fresh hands the allowance would be perhaps sufficient as applied to the whole amount of fresh labour produced within the year by all causes the existing quantity of money and the supposed extra quantity taken together—applied therefore to the latter alone it will be excessive it is not a matter of necessity that any addition at all to the mass of vendible commodities shall have been produced by the extra influx of money since a particular application of the existing quantity of money in the country without any accession to it whatsoever is altogether adequate to the producing the utmost possible degree of accumulation but for illustrations sake the supposed state of things may serve as well as if it were more correct call the average value of the produce of the labour of these  00000 fresh hands   s aweek for each this in round numbers will be £ 000000 ayear £ 000000 then is the quantity of extra influx money remaining the efficiency of which is spent altogether in degrading the value of the mass into which it flows and producing the correspondent rise in the price of vendible commodities  this it may be thought should not be considered as constituting part of the bonus inasmuch as in some of the acts and probably in all the acts prior to that date it will be found that a years notice previous to redemption was among the stipulated terms on the other hand if instead of waiting for meditations and negotiations and observations to be taken of the times a plan had been adopted in the first instance such as like the proposed plan would have given the public the benefit of the reduction from the instant that the rise in the rate of interest in general and of money in the funds in particular had rendered the commencement of it practicable the probability seems to be that the extra interest not only of the year in question but of one or more preceding years might have been saved † written   00 ‡ as £   0   is to £        so is £     0  to £         this being so perfectly oppositionproof is a feature by which the proposed mode of reduction stands distinguished in a very striking point of view from every other though this consequence of the proposed conversion were ever so clearly foreseen by those who either from factious motives or on the honest ground of personal motives were disposed to thwart it though it were even expressly announced by government as indeed virtually it could not but be it would not be in the power even of conspiracy so much as to impede it by refusing the paper each conspirator would make a complete and certain sacrifice of his own personal advantage without the smallest chance of affording any sensible help to the common object of the conspiracy limitation only not prevention—limitation to a degree altogether without effect—would be the utmost possible result of the most unanimous and most persevering opposition on this ground  in

of that country termed obligations de la circulation et du crédit p    there is a great deal of good and a great deal of evil he says in the effects of this law but the good appears to consist in the mode of employing the money as above—the evil in the hands in which the management is reposed or in some other such collateral circumstance as the forced sale of property in whatever other shape it

so apt to be regarded as an adversary the sacrifice of the present to the future is the common basis of all the virtues frugality is among the most difficult and persevering exemplifications of that sacrifice important in all classes it is more particularly so in those which abound in uncultivated minds in these to promote frugality is to promote sobriety to curb that raging vice which in peaceful times outstrips all other moral causes of unhappiness put together in the prospects opened by frugality the wife and children have a principal share they derive nothing but vexation and distress from the money spent at the ginshop or the alehouse compared with the prodigal the hardest of misers is a man of virtue in the outline of a plan of provision for the poor as printed in youngs

affections of the people ebbing fast into the old channel but the revolution in property operating as a barrier against the return of ancient monarchy and as a sheetanchor to the name of a commonwealth † irish debentures—price and value not less than £ 00—paper or parchment instruments as much out of the reach of the body of the people as exchequer bills—have to this purpose as little application as so much stock ‡ though the debt is in loose paper it is in large paper and in that respect on a footing with stock there seems therefore no bar to the introduction of the proposed plan unless it be from local circumstances such as without particular investigation and opportunities it lies not in a mans way to be informed of who can say but that the circulation of this paper might come to extend itself even beyond the sphere of british dominion—the value of this paper in exchange having been once established and certified by experience narrainee is a base silver coin struck in cooch bahar of the value of about tenpence or onethird of a sicca rupee the commodiousness of this small piece the profits the people of bootan derive from their commerce with cooch bahar and some local prejudices against the establishment of a mint have given the narrainee in these regions as well as in those where it is struck a common currency though both countries are perfectly independent of each other and totally different in their language and manner—turners thibet   00  to p     the seal or other mark of the eastindia company on their packages i remember hearing once from authority that appeared unquestionable is received in china at vast distances from the factories as satisfactory evidence of the quantities and qualities of the contents to the value perhaps of some hundreds of pounds is it a supposition altogether chimerical that a similar confidence might be brought in process of time to extend itself to the exchangeable value of a piece of paper value a few pounds or a few shillings in africa in more places than one park as he tells us made a paper money out of the lords prayer might not commercial experience give at length a value which was thus given by mere superstition without experience  supposing the general plan of the proposed annuitynote currency to be discarded an advantage upon a smaller scale might still be derivable from it by applying some of the features of it to the improvement of the existing species of government currency called an exchequer bill in such manner as to cause it to be accepted of at a lower rate of interest than it would otherwise be   it might be made out for much smaller sums say £ 0 or £  that is to say a part of the whole mass might be broken down with a view to general circulation—a competent portion being reserved in the present large sums for operations on a large scale   it might be furnished with the proposed aids to computation by proper tables printed on the front or back of it   it might be made to receive those facilities for general circulation which depend upon the physical qualities of the paper—viz upon the size form texture and thinness c which are possessed by the notes which compose the currency of the bank of england   it might be invested with all the new securities against forgery which are here proposed   markets for the purchase of it might be opened all over the country by the simple expedient of remitting it in such quantities and proportions as should be deemed advisable to the several local offices already in the pay of government—for example postoffices—stampoffices—exciseoffices—customhouse offices this suggestion is made solely for the purpose of illustration compared with the proposed general plan the sacrifice made by thus confining the application of it would be a sacrifice without an object limited as it is in respect of its total amount—limited as it is in respect of the duration of the annuity conveyed by it the exchequerbill currency is radically incapable of meeting the demand of the two classes of petty hoarders and thus a proportionable part of the accommodation afforded to individuals would be lost the utmost it could do would be the going a small part of the way towards meeting the demand for temporary interest on the part of the other great class—possessors of temporary sums—customers for flying annuities—and even to this portion of the demand it would become less and less suitable as the time when the annuity would cease and the trouble of carrying in the bill for payment and receiving the redemption money for it approached the supposed modification and improvement of the exchequerbill currency would be productive of but a part and that a very small part of the advantages held out by the institution of the proposed annuitynote currency but by the institution of the proposed annuitynote currency the advantages thus derivable from the supposed improvement of the exchequerbill currency would be obtained in their full extent—obtained in the way of collateral result and without any distinct measures directed to that end at an early period of the exchequer currency bills were issued for sums as low as £ 0 or even £  how it should have happened that the practice of issuing such small notes should have ceased and the minimum note be raised to and invariably fixed at its present pitch of £ 00 is not difficult to conceive the form of the security would naturally be adapted to the convenience of the lenders more especially as the lenders were individuals acting on their own account and the borrowers statesmen acting without any personal interest for the public at large the lenders on this security have been on the one part and that the principal part the immensely opulent company the bank of england—on the other part the small but prodigiously opulent circle of monied men known to each other and meeting one another continually at or in the neighbourhood of the exchange £ 00 was a magnitude quite small enough for persons of this class the faculty of employing in the same way a smaller sum suppose £ 0 would have been of no use to them—even £ 00 is not so much as they would each be under the necessity of keeping by them or at their bankers for the purpose of current expenses and payments on a small scale bills of less magnitude would thus be attended with no advantage and they would be attended with the disadvantage of making a proportionable addition to the trouble of computation another relative disadvantage and a much more considerable one is that the effect of small bills—£ 0 and £  bills for example—would be to open the market to a greater number of customers thence to increase the competition for the article and to raise the price—in other words to lower the rate of interest upon this paper and thence diminish the profit to be made by purchasing it whether government were aware of this at the time is a point which at this time of day it might perhaps be difficult to ascertain they might see it but not be able to profit by it if in times such as those of king william and queen anne the connected circle of london monied men concurred in insisting upon large sums in preference to small sums it would have been difficult for the government to resist—pressed by the exigencies of the moment it might have been hazardous and perhaps impracticable to wait for the success of an experiment upon the more extended scale as to the monied men some would be aware of this others not—witness the bank who guided it should seem rather by habit than reflection forbore for such a length of time to give that extension to the circle of customers for their paper which when given at last relieved them from their embarrassments and seems to have proved that the scarcity which had produced their embarrassments might as properly be called a scarcity of small notes as a scarcity of cash  this branch of the prerogative like most others had its origin in force with little or no regard to public utility the king took it not from any view of the general advantage the nation would reap from his taking it but because he found his private advantage in taking it but the utility of the institution is not the less real—the advantage is not less really among its effects though it were not the final cause of the institution it has at times in this country and regularly in several other countries produced a profit to government but its constant object has been the guarding individuals against loss by fraud from the substitution of coin of inferior value to that indicated by the exterior appearance of the pieces the monopoly of the metal coinage it is to be observed is confined to the fabrication of such coin as shall be legal tender i e as a creditor shall be obliged to receive in satisfaction of his debt—for as to the fabrication of medals of the same intrinsic value or purporting to be of the same intrinsic value there is nothing against it in law so long as the impression upon them is not an imitation of the medals made on government account the monopoly consists in the taking the coin fabricated on the kings account for the sole subject of that part of the law of contracts which prescribes what acts shall amount to the payment of a debt  the greatest part of the capital of the bank of england has been laid out in the purchase of government annuities the directors of the bank therefore can never distribute these annuities in the shape of dividends amongst its stockholders unless they receive them from government  a banknote has other properties calculated to guard it against forgery—but these do not belong to the present matter  here it is clear that a law which is indirect as to one act becomes direct in reference to another these terms are correct only when they refer to one and the same act or to two different laws  assignable that is either by name or at least by description in such manner as to be sufficiently distinguished from all others for instance by the circumstance of being the owner or occupier of such and such goods  with regard to offences against a class or neighbourhood it is evident that the fewer the individuals are of which such class is composed and the narrower that neighbourhood is the more likely are the persons to whom an offence is detrimental to become assignable insomuch that in some cases it may be difficult to determine concerning a given offence whether it be an offence against individuals or against a class or neighbourhood it is evident also that the larger the class or neighbourhood is the more it approaches to a coincidence with the great body of the state the three classes therefore are liable in a certain degree to run into one another and be confounded but this is no more than what is the case more or less with all those ideal compartments under which men are wont to distribute objects for the convenience of discourse  the conditions themselves having nothing that corresponds to them in england it was necessary to make use of the foreign terms  to prevent objections i remark here that religion is here only considered as an object of political utility and not with reference to its truth whilst as to the effects of religion in preparing us for a better life or giving us an assurance of its possession—these are points from which the legislator can draw no assistance it is better to say an offence against religion the abstract entity and not an offence against god the selfexisting being for in what manner can a feeble mortal injure the eternal and affect his happiness in what class shall this offence be ranked could it be an offence against his person his property his reputation or his condition  when a nomenclature has been formed respecting a collection of things before their nature is known it is impossible to draw from it any general propositions which will be true take oils for example under the same name of oils have been comprehended oil of olives and oil of almonds sulphuric acid and carbonate of potass—what true propositions can be deduced respecting the delicta privata and the delicta publica the delicta publica ordinaria and the delicta publica extraordinaria established by heineccius in explaining the roman laws what can be deduced from the felonies the præmunires the misdemeanours of the english laws—from the penal cases the civil cases the private and the public offences of all laws these are objects composed of such disproportionate parts of words referring to such heterogenous things that it is impossible to form respecting them any general proposition  that is their primary mischief † admit j i mean that retaliation is capable of being applied to the cases in question not that it ought always to be employed nor is it capable of being applied in every individual instance of each offence but only of some individual instance of each species of offence  because the person who in general is most likely to be sensible of the mischief if there be any in the offence viz the person whom it most affects shows by his conduct that he is not sensible of it  grounds that is to say circumstances which affect the necessity of punishment—which render it greater or less or altogether unnecessary a without lawful cause this requires a reference to the general head of grounds of justification b caused it is of no consequence either in what manner or by what means the mischief has been done—whether the person have been beaten or wounded with or without instruments—whether it have been occasioned by a stone or other solid body—by a current of air or other liquid—by water light heat or electric matter directed against the party injured—or by presenting some disgusting or hideous object to the touch the taste the smell the hearing or the sight—or by administering by force or otherwise a drug producing vomiting fainting or other inconvenience it is of no consequence that the means employed have been indirect for example whether a dog or any other animal have been employed as the instrument or whether by false insmuations or other artifices an innocent person or even the individual himself have been employed for the same purpose as if he have been persuaded to walk into a trap or a ditch which had been concealed or voluntarily to expose himself to the action of causes injurious to his health the offence may be equally committed by removing the remedy of which he would stand in need against some approaching evil of the same nature as for example if food be removed from the reach of a man pressed with hunger—if the medicines of a sick man are taken away  that these details are too particular is an objection which requires proof the necessity of those things which some would consider as minute may be easily proved c another refer to the title which treats of selfregarding offences which corresponds to this species of private offences refer also to the title which treats of semipublic offences of the same kind from which it would be proper to refer again to the different codes established for the regulation of trade and manufactures from the abuse of which suffering may result corporal uneasiness or danger to persons not assignable—such as those relating to innkeepers tallowchandlers tanners distillers braziers c d uneasiness it is of no consequence that the point of contact which is the cause of it is slight it suffices for its production that it takes place against the will of the party injured hence the evil of this offence may vary from the slightest uneasiness to the most extreme torture e ulterior if any ulterior damage accrue it must be referred to some other title of offences as irreparable corporal injuries—imprisonment c—refer to the table of offences a lawful cause here to the ordinary grounds of justification it is necessary to add a new one—property in the thing but what is this property—how shall it be shown that it is possessed here then a reference to titles to property is necessary c contributed the same reference d to destroy or injure to destroy a thing is entirely to deprive it of those properties in virtue of which it may be useful to man to injure is partly to deprive it of these qualities if instead of the properties which are altogether destroyed it becomes possessed of others of less value this amounts to the same thing destruction and injury differ only in the quantity of the value destroyed destruction is injury carried to its completion—injury is partial destruction e thing reference to the general title which treats of things and their kinds f value it is of no consequence whether it be a thing which possesses a commercial value—that is to say whether it be of a nature to be useful to a great multitude of persons without distinction as for example eatables—or whether it have only a particular

malè patiendi the idea of obligations referring to the passive faculty though much less familiar has been employed by the romanists—example obligationes ex delicto † those two branches of rights are very distinct but they have no proper names and i have not found any suitable word in ordinary language for designating them i would call right in corpus right of physical contrectation and the right

the species of contract called wagering ought to be an object of particular attention according to the application which is made of it it may include in itself all the force of a law and of a law which acts with the double sanction of punishment and reward it may be employed in the way of subornation for all imaginable crimes bet for example that a certain person does not live beyond a certain time and trace the consequences which such a bet may have in the case of losses by fire and shipwreck assurance is only a species of wager and its effects as an instrument of subornation are only too well known it may have a mischievous effect by its application to adjective law—to procedure during the time that the sex of the chevalier deon was doubtful it became the subject of a wager the action

behaved improperly in court † this fourth condition would be wanting when there is no written law—when custom is conjectured and followed in new cases there is no custom to follow—and all cases were

perform no act without having some individual or some officer responsible for it he cannot even arrest an individual in this manner his power is limited by the responsibility of those who are

administration of the late mr pitt a person by whose habits the language of statutes as well as of reports had been rendered familiar to him happening to be in treaty with government was encouraged to draw up with his own hand the draught of the law necessary to carry the treaty into effect desirous of making to his country the best return in his power for the benefit in which it was his hope to participate it occurred to him to endeavour to take advantage of the opportunity and apply it to the purpose of planting in the statutebook for the chance of its serving one day as a precedent a

pleasure of the higher powers found its way to two professional gentlemen one of whom at that very time was the other has since that time been in possession of the same great lawoffice by one of them it was returned with the observation that it was good and by far too good to possess any chance of finding acceptance to the other it was an object of instantaneous and undissembled horror—gallicism and jacobinism were stamped upon the face of it the imputation in truth was not altogether without foundation the matter of it was broken down into divisions sections and articles—each article was of a moderate length and provided with a number for the purpose of enabling those whom it might concern to refer to it at once instead of their being sent on each occasion to wander over the whole field without being sure on any occasion whether they had or had not found the thing they were sent in quest of this was certainly a matter of gallicism for it is in this form that french lawyers then did and still continue to draw up their laws but what the learned and orthodox censor either did not know or chose not to seem to know is that it was no more a mark of gallicism of french principles than it was of austrian or prussian or spanish or sardinian or portuguese or hindostanee principles—or in a word of the principles of every other civilized country into the nose of whose government and inhabitants the man of law has not fixed his hook as in british noses it is still fixed it was in short no more a mark of french principles than it was of british principles—to wit in so far as the principles of a british soldier may be taken for british principles for somehow or other whatsoever be the cause be it impotence or be it inadvertence the articles of war do furnish an instance in which gentlemen who have learning for their attribute have the mortification of seeing the language of common sense and common honesty substituted for a moment to their own dialect of the flash language as to the dignitaries in question one of them it need not be mentioned which was a british lawyer who had engaged in the practice of the profession with a real desire of contributing to clear the field of those abuses from which profit in such abundance flows into the coffers of its professors and of rendering the law subservient to its professed ends—a man who notwithstanding his endeavours in this line was in his day the most popular man in his profession in the kingdom—the man to enjoy a momentary glance of whom men have come from the remotest parts of the country as to the other dignitary any particular designation of him direct or indirect would be as useless as it would be invidious the observation made as above by him differed not materially from that which any other person of similar and equal learning would have made or been ready to make in his place  in and for the purpose of another work† a systematical view was endeavoured to be given of the aggregate body of offences—meaning of sorts of human actions in relation to which in respect of the mischiefs of which they respectively threatened to be productive it naturally would on the part of a legislator come to be proposed for consideration and in general had been matter of consideration among legislators whether it might not be advisable to render them objects of prohibition and punishment or something that should have the effect of punishment at the first step the aggregate body thus denominated was broken down into four divisions—and the groups comprised in those several divisions were so composed that of each group that is to say of every individual in each group a number of propositions twelve or thereabouts might be predicated and this in every instance without involving any proposition that was false these propositions being such as in every instance appeared to lead to practical conclusions—conclusions indicative in each instance of a probability that by pursuing such or such a line of conduct in legislation might be effected the prevention of sensible mischief and inconvenience mischief reducible ultimately to this or that modification of pain or to loss of this or that modification of pleasure—this scheme of classification was recommended as adapted to the purpose of the enunciation of useful truths on adverting on the same occasion to the schemes of classification employed in relation to the same subject by men of law in general and by english lawyers in particular an assertion was advanced that no scheme of classification was to be found in use of the primary classes of which propositions completely true could in any thing like an equal number if in any number at all be applied † see introduction to morals and legislation chap xviii vol i p

the expression given to the side or aspect presented by the will of the legislator to the species of act which it takes for its object may be distinguished into—  matter of a directive nature   matter of a sanctionative nature directive matter is either obligative or deobligative ie permissive—obligative matter is either jussive or prohibitive—deobligative imports either permission to forbear doing an act which by matter of the jussive cast had been commanded or permission to do an act which by matter of the prohibitive cast had been forbidden sanctionative matter is either penal i e eventually punitive or remuneratory—either for giving effect to directive matter of the obligative cast it denounces eventual punishment or for giving effect to such directive matter as would be of the jussive cast if the sanctionative part were of the penal cast it announces in case of performance eventual reward  with regard to the two numbers the singular and the plural—whether both shall be employed and

judicatory it originated and removed into another operating upon principles widely different—taken out of the regular and technical course and removed into the natural and summary—in this feature there is nothing that has not its sanction in established practice  —i in the first place comes the widelyextending case in which by the writ called a certiorari a suit is taken out of any one of the existing local into one or another of the westminsterhall judicatories on this head these few words may suffice of this arrangement the origin being lost in a manner in the clouds of antiquated lore no precedent exactly in point as the phrase is is afforded by it true it is that those courts out of whose hands the jurisdiction was thus taken were of the inferior not of the superior order but suppose need of change to have place what difference does it make whether the courts be of the one order or of the other  —ii be this as it may in the second place comes the whole jurisdiction of the equity courts more particularly that branch of it by which a suit being in the possession of a set of commonlaw judges was and is without any the least suspicion of misdecision on their part taken out of their possession and carried on and determined upon altogether different principles and this interruption given to the suit at any part of its course   true it is—that in two circumstances nor these immaterial ones—the present modern case differs from that ancient case  —  one is—that in this case the object is and the incontestable effect will be the reduction of the mass of delay and expense from a mountain to a molehill in that case one effect has been nor can it be doubted but that one object and that the main one was the raising the hill the appellation of molehill would not here be in its place into a mountain  —  the other is—that in that case during the sleep of the infant legislature—the in those days ricketty weakly and purblind legislature—the usurpation was effected by one subordinate instrument of the kings executive authority encroaching upon another their common master if he understood anything understanding nothing but fighting and hunting and looking another way not knowing nor caring what they were about—in the present case by the legislature itself—the only authority which is or dares pretend to be competent to the purpose  —iii in the third place a proposition there is which though not carried into effect may not be altogether on this occasion without its claim to notice it is that about the institution of a commission for the clearing off of certain arrears an expedient mention of which is made in the preface of the mention on that occasion made of that expedient for the production of the needful effect the purpose is the exhibition of its impracticability and of its inaptitude were it practicable of the mention here made of it the only purpose—the only one but that a sufficient one—is the presenting to the public at large and equity suitors in particular the observation that all persons and in particular all lawyers who have acceded to that proposition stand precluded—or in lawyers language estopped—from stating as an objection to the present system the circumstance of its taking a suit out of one set of hands and placing it in a different set  —iv in the fourth and last place look to france—look to bonapartes code in that sorecentlyframed and sohighlyandextensivelyapproved body of existing law may be seen the same salutary and wellintended arrangement exemplified though without any such ulterior benefit in contemplation as that which the hereproposed institution has for its object namely the affording for the efficiency and beneficence of allcomprehensive change proposed the preascertained security here promised by the cheap and quiet experiment hereby organized   in that one of the french legislators five codes which bears the title of code de procedure civile art   is a passage of which the following is a translation—the parties may at all times present themselves spontaneously before a juge de paix in which case he will hear and determine the matter in dispute between them either in the last resort if either from the law or the parties he has authority so to do or subject to appeal and this even where he is not the natural or say proper judge of the parties either by reason of the habitation of the defendant or by reason of the local situation of the subjectmatter in dispute—here ends the passage meaning of course by subjectmatter in dispute a thing immoveable such as for example a piece of land a house or other erection c  0 in the character of a precedent the value of this arrangement will not escape the notice of a real lover of justice off fly the fallacies and cavils of which the words theoretical speculative utopian good in theory with their et cæteras are the vehicles behold here in this law and in this practice not only what may be done but what is done where the ends aimed at are the proper ends of justice not that in bonapartes procedure code these ends are uniformly and undeviatingly and exclusively aimed at for in the penning of it

majority of those whose interest it is that the best choice should be made is the worthiest that all england can afford why for these fifteen years or more has this same power been possessed and exercised and that without complaint all over france not to speak of other countries by a numerous class of judges many individuals of which have for their remuneration not so much as £ 0 ayear as salary without any thing in the shape of fees a for example except where as here the disputants come jointly and unanimously to the judge for his arbitration no personal attendance on the part of them

same judicatories and the aptitude of the proposed transference i—query   under the name of equity courts judicatories have been instituted by which suits were drawn from the average length of a year or two—the length in a commonlaw suit to many times that length in some cases from the necessary length of a few minutes to as many years why should not these same lengths be reduced to years months days or minutes according to the complexity or simplicity of the matter of fact and the tardy or immediate forthcomingness of the evidence ii—query   in these same pretended seats and sources of equity the expense has been swollen from the next to nothing corresponding to the minutes of attendance to the hundreds thousands and tens of thousands of pounds—why should it not from the tens of thousands and so forth of pounds corresponding to the tens of years be reduced to the next to nothing corresponding to the tens or units of minutes iii—query   in these same pretended seats and sources of equity that means and time might be provided for dividing the money of suitors in such vast proportion among the lawyers—more than forty millions worth of property in the shape of government annuities besides landed and other property to an unmeasurable amount have been taken into and remain in the hands of judges—why should not a judicatory be instituted by which the property would be taken out of the hands of the plunderers and placed in the hands of the individuals who would otherwise be plundered iv—query   these same pretended living guides to human action—have they not—sometimes instead of sometimes even in opposition to and frustration of the only really existing rule of action—the only alleged rule of action which has a determinate and visible assemblage of words and consequently an existence belonging to it—have they not all along been spinning out do they not continue to spin out an alleged rule of action purely imaginary having no determinate assemblage of words nor consequently existence belonging to it still punishing men to the ruin of their fortunes for noncompliance with demands never issued—for nonconformity to rules never laid down and thus instead of that certainty on which human happiness depends keeping on foot an allpervading system of uncertainty—to this uncertainty why should not that certainty which by its only instrument a written rule of action might be substituted be accordingly substituted v—query   by lawyers in abundance and even by nonlawyers consolidation is set up against codification consolidation represented as requisite and necessary codification as mischievous or impracticable or both—do not they thus every one of them his utmost towards narrowing the application of the very benefit which he professes himself desirous of seeing established vi—query   when on the mere ground of those imperfections of which whatever be the subject literary composition is susceptible he professes to regard written law as being less conducive to the ends of law than is the socalled unwritten law as if that were less susceptible of these very imperfections—does he not thereby pass a peremptory condemnation on the very work which under the name of consolidation he is all the while recommending to be done vii—query   in these same seats of professed loyalty and professed regard for constitutional subordination the occupation of the judge consists all along in giving the force of law to rules having the effect of laws of his own making and thus by his single authority—he being a creature of the king alone made what he is by the king and by such his creator every moment liable to be unmade—substituting this course of unscrutable legislation of his own making by authority of the king alone to the legislation of the only legitimate and acknowledged legislature composed of king lords and commons in parliament assembled—why should not the only legitimate be substituted throughout to this as well as every other illegitimate legislature  written instruments take for example affidavits when evidence in that shape is required or admitted as it is in all suits in the superior courts and in particular in the equity courts immediately or unimmediately by his own hands or by the intervention of others the judge receives suppose a profit proportioned to the number or the lengthiness or both of the instruments of this sort admitted by him or called for by him the motive he is determined by suppose is profit but the motive he assigns is of course the anxiety of his desire to come at the truth for the purposes of justice and supposing the absence of his lastmentioned desire by what means can any such absence be ever proved take for subexample of the example the case of the honourable william long wellesley and the proceedings by which the custody of and power over his children were taken out of his hands affidavits piled upon affidavits all the occurrences that for a long course of years took place for any purpose or could be supposed to have taken place in the bosom of a large and extensivelyallied family taken for the subjectmatter of a pile of conflicting affidavits all this while no other desire but that of coming at the strict truth had the chancellor during whose reign the inquiry began no other desire has the chancellor in whose reign it is perhaps continuing how should he when as everybody knows in the breasts of rulers in general and in particular of rulers of such high degree no desire other than such as is most praiseworthy ever has place  to bring to view

the civil wars styled the grand rebellion was it not excusable not to say justifiable a subjectmatter not altogether undeserving of consideration might it not be—whether a rebellion against king lords and commons to shake off the tax by which justice is as has been seen to so vast an amount denied and excluded might not if necessary be even more clearly justifiable than a rebellion against the king to shake off the tax by the proceeds of which ships for national defence were actually provided  the giving this shape to the remuneration allowed to judges had in its origin necessity for its excuse not to say its justification see this proposition demonstrated in the work intituled petitions for justice vol v the giving to it this same shape at present has no excuse—in this instance or in any

factitious delay and expense not forgetting complication thence obscurity uncertainty and misdecision living instruments by means of whom and consequently upon whom equity courts operate three a sheriff a serjeantatarms and a sequestrator a sheriff for operating indiscriminately upon persons and things a serjeantatarms for operating commonly upon persons only a sequestrator for operating upon things exclusively these for equity court proceedings by a bill and answer exclusive of proceedings under a bankruptcy commission as to which see the next section—sect vii prehensors   first as to the sheriff this functionary is the common jackofallsides juvenile cricketplayers will understand this to four different masters at once namely the three westminster hall commonlaw courts in all ordinary cases and the equity judge now and then in an extraordinary case by the sheriff understand on this occasion the sheriff of middlesex the sheriff of that county alone of all the fifty having been regarded as having his residence near enough to the equity justicechamber to be capable of being operated upon by the equity judge without preponderant inconvenience accordingly over this edom alone has the david of equity ventured to cast forth his shoe not much less near at hand it is true than middlesex are three other counties surrey to wit kent and essex—a discovery of which for other purposes and in particular for purposes styled police purposes use has of late years been made but by causes which it would take too much room to explain no other living instrument of this kind was found so well fitted as this middlesex one to a lord high chancellors hand note now how well fitted—no man can serve two masters says scripture as well as reason meaning by serve serve well but hundreds of years ago four sorts of judicial masters there were besides this one who if they had not had each of them a fraction of this functionary to serve them for a servant would have had none there are—the kings bench common pleas and exchequer national judicatories having all of them the sheriffs of all counties at their command with the justices of peace in general sessions throughout the nation county judicatories these—each having no other sheriff than the sheriff of its own county at its command in those days the process of the kings judges being not unfrequently withstood by the barons and knights his feudatories—the operations of civil government could no otherwise be carried on than by a sort of guerilla warfare commander of the army in each shire the earl—saxonicé alderman latiné comes meaning companion of the king whence normanicé comte hispanicé conde c lieutenantgeneral anglolatine vicecomes saxonicé sciregereve deputy commander of the tertorial division thus denominated whence by contraction sheriff and so because so long ago this miserable makeshift was regarded as necessary—it must nowadays to the exclusion of every appropriate instrument—now when it has so long ceased to be necessary—be continued for centuries upon centuries this vicecomes has been a deputy without a principal the principal who when he had existence was called the comes alias the earl of the county or say shire an imaginary being without a real habitation—without anything but a name for a specimen but no more than a specimen of the suffering—of the practical and too real suffering springing out of this theoretical and ideal confusion see petition for justice §    results of the fissure—groundless arrests for debt vol v p       secondly as to the serjeantatarms this functionary is a satellite appointed on each occasion by the equity judge himself how he came by this his formidable title requires explanation once upon a time some person or other having omitted to do something which by the judge he had been bid to do—his lordship dreamt that a rebellion had been raised which being admitted an army became necessary for the suppression of it thence came the chancery writ styled a commission of rebellion by which was meant—not as in the case of a commission of inquiry a commission to make the thing for the making of which the commission was issued—not a commission to make a rebellion but a commission to quell one commander of the army or commander and army all in one this same serjeantatarms   lastly as to the sequestratora while during a course of years for the sake of the profit upon the expense the chancellor with his myrmidons was making believe to do that which if so minded he could have done with next to no expense and vexation to anybody in the course of some number of days or hours—a sort of operation called sequestration required to be performed and this like other operations required operators sequestration the operation sequestrators the operators—in these may be seen the manipulus furum of whom the serjeantatarms was in case of necessity the thraso for the purpose of giving execution and effect to a portion of substantive law—and to that end for the purpose of giving execution and effect to the correspondent judicial mandate issued on the occasion of a demand made on the judge for his appropriate service—on that same occasion and to that same purpose what is requisite is that into the hands of the judge be taken either the subjectmatter itself of the demand—namely the mass of property or other benefit of what nature soever it be which is the object of declared desire or else a person who for shortness is called a defendant meaning thereby a person who on the occasion in question for the purpose in question is assumed to be in possession of this same object and prepared to defend himself in that arena against all endeavours to take the object from him though the truth is—that so costly in this field has the war been made that out of a thousand not one is there who how justly soever entitled to the possession would if called upon be able so much as to begin to defend himself in that same field with any possibility of effectual defence—say then the defendant or proposed defendant himself but this same person or any person—to what end to what purpose except where the case being a penal one the punishment appointed is such as requires the body of the individual to be forthcoming for the purpose of being subjected to it no use is there for the body but for the purposes of coming at by that means the valuable thing itself which is the object of the desire to this end the dispatch court judge if meaning honestly he has the power will act according to the circumstances of the individual case the demandant he has seen and examined of course at the very outset of the suit this being the very operation from which the suit has received its outset from this examination he will have framed his judgment as to what cource to take for the purpose of securing with the minimum of delay vexation and expense to all parties the eventual rendering of the service demanded that is to say—if in his view a preponderant probability has place that the proposed defendant unless prevented will convey out of the reach of the judge not only the subjectmatter of the service demanded but his body likewise by means of which in case of need the compliance with the demand might be compelled he will for this purpose cause hold to be taken—prehension to be made—of things moveable things immoveable and body—one two or all three as occasion may require mindful throughout on no occasion to produce so much as one atom of evil more than is necessary for the production of the preponderant

action and source of judicature  taking   by what hands then shall they be delivered into it   to the situation of a judicial functionary of the grade of a judge a manual operation such as this is not congenial   to the eyes of the judge thus ousted of jurisdiction the witnessing of it would be needlessly painful   not but that for the wound thus producible a precedent or something very near to one were it needful might be found   but no such wound is needful   on the part of the subordinates on whom the duty is here imposed of submitting to the operation no such vulnerable dignity has place   on this occasion as on every other whatever is done the less the expense in every shape at which it is done the better   as to superordinates they will know better than in any open and direct way to attempt to throw obstacles in the way of obedience on the part of their subordinates   here then may be seen—benefit maximized burthen minimized turn now to the existing system there may be seen burthen maximized benefit minimized  0 to exhibit were it even no more than a rough outline of the several diversifications of the course taken—taken by the existing system in general and by the equity branch of it in particular for the attainment of these two conjunct sinister ends—would require for a basis a sketch of the whole body of judicial procedure including in the equity part of it the two vast morbid excrescences—the bankruptcy courts and insolvency courts    this being here impracticable suffice it to say that it is by the observation of the opposite practice as carried on under the existing system and of the enormousness of the mass of evil produced by it that the several preferences here recommended were suggested    at the head of the mass stands the portion of it produced by the practice by which for the price set by judges to every man who can and will pay that price the liberty of any and every other man is sold—sold together with the additional powers of involving in utter ruin men in countless numbers by a known and infallible process—supposing him so lost to all sense of humanity and shame as to accept of the invitation—still as well as for ages past held out to him by english judges such is the practice by which on the ground of the false assertion of a debt due to the amount of which there are absolutely no limits the prehension of the person of a man and in consequence the destruction of his commercial credit may be effected the act of inflicting the suffering not being preceded by any inquiry into the need of it the need of it—that is to say for any one of the three abovementioned purposes of justice in the practice of no other country in so flagitious a form one may venture to say have depredation and corruption on the part of judges been seen to manifest themselves for a brief but to this purpose sufficient history of the course by which this part of the system has been brought to its present state of perfection

parties from the presence of the judge necessary not less to the minimization of the burthen to the defendant than to the maximization of the benefit to the plaintiff is information obtained by the judge as to the circumstances of the parties on both sides and in particular on the defendants at the very outset of the suit for on the state of the pecuniary circumstances of the defendant will depend the means which for making provision for the executionsecuring as well as for the executioneffecting purpose they afford and at that stage of the suit no otherwise than by the wordofmouth examination of the plaintiff can that same information be obtained—of the plaintiff himself or of any such representative of his whom according to his condition in life the necessity of the case has on that occasion substituted or added to hima    of the thus allcomprehensive and hitherto unexampled extent here proposed to be given to the power of prehension one natural enough consequence is—that to a first glance not only augmentation of the judges power should present itself as a principal object of it but moreover in a degree more or less considerable detriment to the interest of the defendant as the effect on a closer inspection however it will be seen that by the variety of choice thus afforded effectual service is rendered to the defendants no less than to the plaintiffs side—whereas under the existing system burthensome to an outrageous amount as is the prehension actually performed still more outrageously burthensome is the power as above given of performing it—at any rate by the option of substituting to a more a less burthensome mode of operation no mischievous addition to power is effected and with not less solicitude has been looked out for—the mode of operation which will be least burthensome to the defendants than that which will be most beneficial to the plaintiffs side    as to security—for the several modes in which for the several abovementioned purposes it may be given and the occasions on which it may require to be given see section xvii prehensor    minute indeed is the proportion which the imagination of a nonlawlearned reader could present him with of the immense mass of expense and delay produced by the equity practice in relation to this subject with the correspondent probability of misdecision and unjust

subjectmatter imprisonment for debt considered in the abstract and for their object—on the face of them if not at bottom—the abolition of imprisonment to the whole of the length to which it can on that same occasion be employed supposing this to be the proposition with as much reason might be proposed abolition of punishment on every occasion—of punishment in every other form on the occasion of transgression in every other form without the discernment to see that exceptions are necessary or without patience to attend to them—thus does sentimentality regardless of the dictates of the greatesthappiness principle apply itself but too often to the establishment of general and sweeping rules  assizes true it is—that in that case the matter of the record being nearly the whole of it in its nature useless no use is made of it insomuch that were the same quantity of blank paper sent into the country and back again the service thereby rendered to justice would not be less than that

later removed  efficiency of this remedy compare the effectiveness with that of a bill in equity by which at the hands of an unwilling defendant at the end of five years nothing more will have been effected than the elicitation of the evidence of that one individual out of an indefinite number of individuals of the evidence of all whom the elicitation may for the purpose of the suit be necessary

proposed system to the alleviation and minimization of the mass of human suffering liable to be produced and in so large part unavoidably by the hands conjunctly or separately operating of the legislator and the judge by the opposite practice as exhibited by the existing system have these measures of relief in almost every instance been suggested an end which never has been aimed at—nor so

confounded sometimes with evilconsciousness sometimes with blamelessness of the distinction prime in intensity as well as extent is the importance blind to it have been at all times the founders of

by force or intimidation that the effect is produced note here the difference between antilegal or as the word more commonly used is illegal and anticonstitutional antilegal means prohibited by the penal branch of the rule of action anticonstitutional means unconformable to the constitutional branch of the rule of action corruption—in both its forms the intimidative and the alluring—corruption when power or opulence is the instrument of it is to a vast extent not antilegal—as to anticonstitutionality it is not contrary to what constitutional law is however contrary to what constitutional law ought to be and is falsely said to be suppose a tenant turned out of his farm or shop and thereby consigned to ruin by his landlord for giving a vote in a manner disagreeable to that same landlord by such ejectment corruption—namely the intimidative species of it is practised in this however there is nothing illegal nothing repugnant to that which the constitution is how repugnant soever to that which the constitution ought to be  turn now to the existing system there on an occasion such as those above described for the description of the offence the locution commonly employed is—contempt of the court this locution as being loose and vague—liable to be abused and accordingly most abundantly and mischievously abused—is on the present occasion in the text of the bill purposely forborne to be employed it might be employed—to justify incarceration for discourse uttered by wordofmouth or in writing and thus—for that appeal to the public opinion tribunal to which no obstruction should in any case be opposed under the existing feegathering system it is employed as often as by the price put by judges on their appropriate services real or pretended—the impossibility of compliance with their mandate is produced having made a man poor they proceed and punish him for being so for poverty—for nonperformance of impossibilities—for an offence to which the judge himself has given birth—for these things it is that the judge punishes and to oppression adding insult and defamation he punishes for alleged contempt where terror—the opposite to contempt—is certain and contempt impossible  see further on this subject section xxiv expense how provided for note † if in this way throughout the whole field of litiscontestation and in particular throughout the whole field of delinquency the burthens so far as the pecuniary circumstances of individuals admitted were laid exclusively on the party in the wrong—all factitious costs being as upon the hereproposed summary system they would be abolished—not only might the party in the right be exonerated of all the expenses to which under the existing regular system he is subjected by unreimbursed costs—but in no small proportion might be defrayed that expense the burthen of which is under the hereproposed system transferred from the back of the suitor to that of the government as trustee for the public at large but such is the power of that delusion of which words are the instrument that for a long time a much less burthen than that which is endured with patience under the name of costs might probably by men in large proportion be bitterly and loudly inveighed against if imposed under the name of punishment    the topic of remedies being now so far as regards the present purpose at a close—turn now to the existing system of the four species of remedies—the originallypreventive and the suppressive are not here in question remain the satisfactive in which is included the compensative and the punitive or say the subsequentially preventive in relation to these two what then does the existing system of these two for wrong in no shape does it so much as propose to itself to make provision of more than one sorts of shops of which judge  co are the shopkeepers two commodities sold in one of them a chance such as it is for money which when given in the name of compensation for wrong they call damages commodity sold in the other sort a chance for the benefit produced by punishment the enjoyment such as it is reaped by one man from the contemplation of the suffering produced by punishment inflicted on another—say for shortness the pleasure of revenge or vengeance and in one of the shops moreover—namely the kingsbench shop—you may call for damages or punishment which you will but what seems whimsical enough both together even at that shop where both are upon sale together you cannot have true it is—that while in consequence of your asking for it they serve out to you a quantity of the commodity you ask for—namely the chance for damages they serve out to you along with it a quantity more or less considerable of that other commodity which you have not asked for but no thanks to them they dont know that they do so they dont know what it is they are doing   it is not by them that the commodity you did not is added to the commodity you did ask for not by their hands is this addition made but by the hands of nature it sticks on without their perceiving it and thus it is that you come by it go to a plumber and buy a quantity of lead buying the lead you buy the chance of a quantity of silver in it but if there really be any it is more than the plumber knows of it was left in to save the expense of taking it out and in the case of the kingsbench shop where under the name of justice justice or injustice is sold as it may happen—whether the quantity of the suffering which thus sticks to the damages when actually served out be sufficient for the purpose of the subsequentiallypreventive remedy is matter of accident they know as little about it as the plumber who serves out the silver with the lead knows what use will be made of either they know about the matter as little as they care   a natural question here is—seeing this—that a shop is always open where the two commodities may be had together for the price of one—the so much less valuable along with the more valuable and without any extra charge for it—how is it that to any of the shops any man goes and gives his money for the less valuable article alone   the answer is—that the difference depends upon evidence upon the source and thence the reputed quality of the evidence which the party wronged happens to have at his command for according to the rules of the several shops along with your money you must for the most part for forms sake have at your command and exhibit a quantity of evidence at any rate a something which without being evidence is by them received as and for evidence the kingsbench shop has as above intimated two sides—the civil side and the penal side on the civil side is sold the chance for damages and there the evidence they insist upon is of a particular sort regarded as a superior sorta and if such is your misfortune you have none of this sort to produce you must either go without remedy or betake yourself to the other side in this case all you can have for your money is the pleasure of revenge and for that the shop you must apply to is either the penal side of that same kingsbench shop or some other shop where they have nothing better to sell than this same pleasure of revengeb   but of this commodity—the chance of which is thus sold on the penal side and is worth so little and to a man who believes in the same creed as those judges profess to believe in worth absolutely nothing—the price though so high as to be out of the reach of the vast majority of the people is still abundantly less extortious and unreasonable than that of the chance for compensation   under the existing system no wrong is there that has not its remedy such is the aphorism delivered by blackstone and ready to be repeated by all those in whose minds law learning has extinguished the sense of shame no wrong is there that has its remedy this aphorism is not indeed exactly true but it is beyond comparison nearer to the being so than its abovenamed opposite   that which on this occasion was undertaken for is an indication given of the inadequacy of the provision made under the existing system by judgemade law for remedy to wrong in the several shapes of which it is susceptible together with some general intimation of the causes by which such its worthlessness has been produced of two of these causes such general intimation has here been afforded namely the absurdity of not so much as attempting to administer any more than one of two remedies where the nature of the case admits of and requires the application of both and the still more flagrant absurdity of shutting out or letting in the one and the same evidence—that is to say the testimony of one and the same man—according as it is the one sort of remedy or the other that if admitted he would apply for as to what regards this latter absurdity further particulars belong not to this place but they may be found in ample abundance in the rationale of evidence a for example if in the kings bench shop they have got from you all the money you can command so that you are unable to pay for this or that instrument the exhibition of which they have rendered necessary to the carrying on of the suit on your side—in this case they say that you hold them in contempt as per note to art    and this contempt they consider as being conclusive evidence of your being in the wrong and deal by you accordingly of your being in the wrong on whichsoever side of the suit you are—whether the plaintiffs or the defendants b for example the justice of the peace court called the general sessions or quartersessions absurdity of not so much as attempting to administer any more than one of two remedies where the nature of the case admits of and requires the application of both and the still more flagrant absurdity of shutting out or letting in the one and the same evidence—that is to say the testimony of one and the same man—according as it is the one sort of remedy or the

the love of jurytrial how could it be otherwise for of this love the root is now laid bare   in another work of the authors—namely his procedure code chap xxiii the subject of jurytrial is treated of at large and a substitute for the present system provided in chap xxvi under the denomination of a quasijury according to the plan proposed—at the instance of a party on either side or of the judge himself all benefit derivable from the employment given to a jury is afforded by use of the body styled as above a quasijury of which for minimization of the expense the number is minimized and by which is possessed every power possessed by a judge except the decisive power styled the imperative this being reserved to him in consideration of his superior intellectual aptitude and for the sake of laying on his shoulders responsibility in its fullest state   but the mode of procedure to which the dispatch court is the experimental substitute being one in which no jury is employed the nonemployment of a jury could not be urged as a ground of objection to it and on the present occasion an object highly desirable was the maximum of simplicity—an object to the attainment of which no small obstacle would have been presented by the addition of the ulterior institution of a quasijury   in the hereproposed system is there any degree or sort of difficulty any sort or degree of danger or of probability of evil consequences in the hereproposed system no in the existing system ifyou wish to find it you must look for all the difficulty for all the mischief and not in probability but in certainty   difficulty in what should it consist what is required is that on each occasion a man should judge as he would in his own business between his own children or his own servants in his own house in so judging wherein consists the extraordinary difficulty if really any such difficulty have place where is it that it commences between the state of things which forms the matter of the domestic and that which forms the matter of the forensic mode and course of procedure the only differences are those which regard the number of the persons and the extent and number of the places concerned and the powers for effecting execution of orders and elicitation of evidence but for effecting execution of orders and elicitation of evidence powers no less sufficient than those which within its field of action the domestic tribunal possesses and much more ample and effective than the existing tribunals all together possess are by the supposition given to the hereproposed forensic tribunal these powers being by the supposition possessed at what addition to the number of the persons at what addition to the amplitude or number of the places subject to the authority of the domestic tribunal should the difficulty supposed to have place in regard to the business of the forensic tribunal commence in these may be seen questions to which it belongs to the objector to find answers and in the finding any rational and satisfactory—here indeed it may well happen to him to experience no small difficulty   danger probability of evil consequences under the hereproposed system absolutely none under the existing system not merely probability of evil consequences but certainty—yes absolute and unhappily abundant certainty if factitious delay expense and vexation not to speak of misdecision and nondecision where decision is due—are evil consequences  ends sacrificed to means—gnats strained at camels swallowed—inconsistencies in endless tissue—such throughout is judgemade

namely part ii is contained under the head of offences severally considered   in the accompanying table are exhibited the contents of this first part in and by the titles of the several chapters for the present purpose to the words employed in the original table are added here and there a few words of explanation annexed to each title is proposed to be if time and space admit—a reference to that article of the present section which presents to view a sample of the contents of ita   not altogether uninstructive it is hoped will be the comparison if made of the hereexhibited matter and titles of the proposed code—with the matters and titles of any work by which under the existing system the penal branch of law is undertaken to be exhibited and exhibited accordingly as it is or as it is said to be law—as it is namely statute law or say parliamentmade law law as it is said to be namely fictitious law or say common law or judgemade law instructive in no small degree the comparison—between the anxious and continued regard paid to human feelings throughout the one and the utter disregard throughout the other—to human feelings that is to say—to pain and pleasure—for the several diversifications of which in the little work intitled table of springs of action determinate denominations have been found and employed—disregard in a word for everything but the sinister interest of the framers contemplated through the medium of the technical words and phrases of which the gallimautrey is composed   in book or part ii containing offences severally considered—under the head of each offence application is made of the matter of the greatest part of part i application that is to say either by quotation or reference   of the penal matter employed on the present occasion no part is there which is not in and by that same proposed penal code employed likewise and applied on other occasions but in the ulterior and more extensive use so made no sufficient reason was seen for omitting on the present occasion to make application of it to the present particular use being however necessarily modified and in many instances more or less changed in subserviency to the present special purpose the several articles are not to be considered as exact quotations from the work at large by the being thus presented to view as having been applied to a more extensive purpose the matter will not it is believed be found rendered the less applicable to the present purpose   but for the determined withholding of encouragement in every shape from above—by the mere assurance of appropriate attention effective encouragement would have been administered and that same penal code would many years ago have made its appearance in a complete state   on a late occasion forgery

no more than a part of one single page sufficed to cover no more than a part was covered by the hundreds of pages of that same folio volume what no that occasion as on others was not considered

baneful art is not capable of being rendered instrumental and suxiliary constructed on the condensed plan here exemplified a generallyapplying code so called in contradistinction to a system of particular codes applying to so many different classes of persons—or say for shortness a general code—may be composed of no more than one or two octavo volumes and yet be perfect constructed upon that present pursued plan it may be composed of so many hundreds or as many thousand volumes and still be imperfect the penal code at large is in preparation and considerable forwardness but as already intimated not exactly the same as those here employed are the terms and method there employed by the application here made of the principles—abridgment and alteration in other respects were

 to this judiciary part of the act belonged the operation of instituting the powers relative to the elicitation of evidence to the procedure part presently ensuing belongs the operation of directing the application to be made of those same powers † certainty   under the existing system uncertainty is at its maximum   take for example the case of perjury in the course or on the occasion of a suit to authorize conviction two witnesses or what is regarded as equivalent being at present made requisite—and the expense of prosecution being such as persons in comparative number extremely small add to the will the power of defraying—the consequence is—that of many thousands of instances in which the offence is committed not more than one is prosecuted for   under the existing system—not from the judge but from the party in all cases called civil cases comes the demand for evidence before application made for the subpœna as it is called—that is to say the evidencerequiring mandate the solicitor of the party to whose interest in the suit the evidence is regarded as serviceable enters if he can into conversation with the supposed evidenceholder and performs with him a sort of preparatory rehearsal   mark now the effect of this state of things that is to say of the power of producing misdecision through deception which it places in the hands of a dishonest evidenceholder   an evidenceholder whose evidence is necessary to right decision is inimical suppose to one of the parties by the existing system is put into his hands a sure mode of affording gratification to his illwill at the expense of justice   his testimony supposing it truly delivered would it be favourable to his intended victim—he either refuses all communication with the inquiring agent or by falsehood represents it as being unfavourable and to this falsehood it not being uttered upon oath nor in any other way punishable complete and sure impunity is thus secured to the author of the device on the other hand will the testimony in so far as true be unfavourable to the destined victim if yes the evidenceholder enters into conversation with the aforesaid agent and furnishes him with such false information as by its apparent favourableness engages the aforesaid victim to become or continue party to the suit party on the plaintiffs or defendants side as the case may be   at the trial being now upon his oath he says nothing but what is strictly true   consequence to the thus described victim loss of cause thus is the caught in a trap and perhaps ruined   and in this trap may any man be caught by any other man who will be at the expense of thus baiting it  0 from this trap—the sort of wisdom and probity which so eminently characterize the existing system have concurred in excluding all means and possibility of escape    when the dishonest witness comes upon his examination before the judge—you the party injured by him may you make known his dishonesty—may you bring forward any evidence or give utterance to any observation the effect of which might be to cause him to appear to be what he is—not you indeed this would be—to discredit your own witness and says the commonlaw rule you must not discredit your own witness this says the reason of the rule would be as much as to say he is not trustworthy which having said you are thereby estopped from saying anything to the contrary of it—as if the human species was composed of two distinct subspecies one that never told anything but truth the other that never told anything but falsehood    behold now at its height the triumph of law over justice behold now the indiscriminate defender of right and wrong with the constant predilection and partiality for his more munificent custom—behold him in all his glory behold him pouring forth his torrent of reproach obloquy and contumely on the party who to his knowledge is in the right—and the praise of probity and injured innocence on the dishonest wrongdoer by whose villany with the assistance of his hirelings the ruin of the destined victim has thus been accomplished    give the reins now to imagination scene a tavern—behold the partie quarreé

jesting over the convivial bottle    he spoke falsely on one occasion ergo so he will on every occasion—what logic—as if the same man who would speak truly when he saw more to fear than to hope from speaking falsely might not speak falsely when he saw more to hope than to fear from speaking falsely as if the accident of having been a percipient witness of this or that matter of fact had for its proper consequence the putting him into the power of whosoever happened to have need of his testimony and this so completely that a lawyer might with truth and propriety say of him to the party whom he is hired to do injustice to this man is your own witness—as who should say this horse is your own horse or this ox is your own ox    excluded by this article will be—all exclusion put by the existing system upon evidence on the ground of security against deception for a demonstration of the impropriety of all these exclusions and an indication of the ways in which deception instead of security against deception is produced by them see rationale of evidence book ix    nor of enlightenment applied to this subject is there any want of precedents in existing practice for inquiring into the state of the law with a declared view to its improvement—three separate commissions to so many different sets of commissioners have been issued within these few years in every one of these commissions a power to this effect stands included in no one of these commissions is to be found so much as a single instance of application made of any of those exclusionary rules of which the mass of the matter of common law on this subject is in so large a proportion composed    as little are any traces of regard for them to be found in the practice of the two houses of parliament and their committees whatsoever be the subject of the inquiry    if to the exclusion put upon these same exclusionary rules by each of these three component parts of the legislative body acting separately no reasonable objection can be made—with how much less reason can any objection be opposed to this same arrangement if the authority of the whole of that supreme body be thus employed in the making of it as it will have been if this bill passes into an act    under the existing system—whether on the score of verity a piece of evidence shall be elicited or not depends upon the name given to the judicatory in which the suit has place and the course of procedure that happens to be pursued in it in a judicatory styled an equity court the testimony of a party is excluded when spontaneous and allowed to be extracted and thus admitted when reluctant in a judicatory styled a commonlaw court it is neither admitted when spontaneous nor allowed to be extracted when reluctant  0 think now of the quantity of injustice and of human suffering in consequence which from the origin of the existing system to the present day cannot but have flowed from this one source—from misdecision thus produced obviously from nondecision for want of legal demand not so obviously but not less incontestably—by exclusion put upon evidence which if admitted would have been veracious and effective—right in all its shapes left undemanded wrong in all its shapes left unchecked by remedy by remedy in any one of its shapes—preventive suppressive satisfactive punitive  productive of additional benefit to justice

proposed practice is grounded as per constitutional code ch xii judiciary collectively §    justice for the helpless even under the existing system precedents applicable to this purpose are not altogether wanting  ecclesiastical a natural enough question here is why include those courts without this reinforcement will not the opposition from the equity and commonlaw courts be sufficient

this obstacle were it not for this warning they might not be sufficiently aware † see art      by the equity courts from first to last power legislative in effect though in so inconvenient a form has

case alone but to judgemade law throughout the whole of its expanse and have accordingly on many an occasion been brought to view elsewhere   states of the mind to which these evils may be referred are—partly indolence and negligence—partly sinister interest legislators regarding themselves as having a community of sinister interest with judge  co give themselves thus by connivance the advantage of establishing by the hands of judges in an indirect and unobserved manner and without drawing the attention of the people at large upon the subject—many an arrangement which selfregarding prudence might have prevented their attempting to establish by their own hands   resistance to any arrangement to the effect thus proposed may accordingly without danger of injustice or error be considered and stated as conclusive evidence of a wish and endeavour to give strength and extension to absolute under the mask of limited power in the hands of the ruling one and subruling or coruling few   any one of a number of words would—if that same arbitrary power were not obstructed as it is by the correspondent and opposite arbitrary power of relatively ignorant men in the situation of jurymen—suffice to give to these judges an unlimited power of virtual legislation   in their hands the word libel would of itself suffice to place the press on the same footing as that which it is on in spain and portugal   the word conspiracy has for some time been making its progress over the field of penal law and is capable of converting into a crime any species of act on account of which it is the will determined by the sinister interest or interestbegotten prejudice of the judge to inflict punishment on any individual by whom that same act how completely soever innoxious has ever been done   no wonder that it should be more agreeable to judges to see the manufacture of the rule of action in their own hands than in those of the legislature to judges and to all members of the legislature who in their own view of the matter are as above linked with judge  co by the tie of a community of sinister interest  0 as a material and local field is covered by webs spun out of the bowels of spiders—so is the logical field of law covered with nets spun out of the brains of judges—and more particularly of english judges    thus it is that over so vast a portion of the whole extent of the rule of action the mind of the judge is either the best or the worst source in which it can originate the best when untainted with or purged from the impurity infused into the situation by the feegathering system the worst when infected and polluted by that allcorrupting contagion    from these considerations has been deduced a plan for preserving the rule of action—when brought from the state of judgemade law into the state of a code—from being covered over with a fresh growth of that same imaginary and spurious law    to the general propositions laid down by judges in the delivery of their judgments—as well as to the tenor of those judgments themselves—it would be made matter of duty to every judge as often as he saw in the text of the code a passage presenting a demand for amendment—whether defalcative additive or substitutive—to apply a proposed amendment expressed in the very words in which if approved it would stand as part of the act to which it applies itself exactly in the same way as that in which an amendment is applied in and by a legislative body in which case—in so far as by the only legitimate legislature approved—it would be aggregated to and become part and parcel of the body of the code in relation to this matter may be seen in terminis a string of provisions in the proposed constitutional code when published to wit at ch xii judiciary

all this precaution the persuasion has for its ground the observation made of the rooted habit of insubordination which under matchless constitution has place on the part of the judges of the superior courts in relation to the legislature   in two distinguishable shapes does this insubordination show itself not only muffled up in a covering of technical jargon as in the case of a decision on grounds foreign to the merits as to which see petitions for justice v     but even in an open way by decisions on the occasion of which disobedience to acts of parliament is explicitly and

avowed way   the emblem of the cats paw is thus in some sort realized in some sort—but with this difference in the fable it was not without reluctance nor without smart that the quadruped lent its hand whereas in the case of the bipeds no smart is ever felt nor consequently any reluctance in the stock of the readyroasted and tempting chesnuts they got their full share   this community—of feeling and sinister interest and conduct—can never be too frequently brought into nor too distinctly and conspicuously held up to view a see blackstone iii ch    every court inferior in power to

summary system nothing short of a full persuasion of the impossibility of success can suffice   unfortunately for all parties—for the community at large on the one part—for the fraternity of the men of law taken in the aggregate on the other—no satisfactory compensation does the nature of the case admit of their being made to receive—for the pecuniary suffering the official branch of the order

frustration of the design all imaginable engines will be set to work from all quarters is the assumption that ought to be acted upon   in the instance of any one or even more of the persons so situated suppose—not only no obstruction purposely opposed to the introduction of the proposed system but even aid actively and zealously given to it still by no such phenomenon would disproof be offered of impropriety on the part of the general rule a true hero in this civil line of public service—a true hero would any and every such functionary be but men of ordinary not of heroic mould are the men the existence of whom should on the occasion of this as of all measures of legislation be assumed and acted upon   among the devices employed for this purpose by a man of this fraternity will of course be—the strutting upon paper and swelling and looking big in houses honourable and right honourable like a cæsar an alexander or a bombardinian on the stage—or a turkeycock in a farmyard—with scorn and indignation poured forth against the affront put by any suspicion of this kind upon his honour and dignity   suspicion yes but for this there is no help for it is by the nature of things or say by the nature of man that the suspicion will be stirred up suspicion and thence resistance to the force of his authority in the event of its being employed in any such endeavour as that of frustrating this plan of beneficence and justice   affront true but from every such affront it depends upon himself most effectually and completely to preserve himself and that by so simple and easy a means as the negative act—the act of abstaining from all such endeavours as his situation exposes him to the suspicion of wishing to use  0 not but that from all humiliation not indispensably necessary to the effectuation of the design the existing superior authorities have all of them by the course thus taken been carefully preserved on no occasion by any functionary so situated is any operation called for only at the hands either of this or that subordinate of theirs or of individuals in the situation of suitors    pursued in this case is the pattern set by the equity judges when overruling and reducing to nothing the power of the commonlaw judges not to those same judges themselves but to the suitors in their respective judicatories were the mandates of the equity judges directed    thus it was—that by the equity courts greater delicacy was exemplified in their deportment towards the commonlaw courts than by the commonlaw courts to one another    when from the court of common pleas the cognizance of a suit is transferred to the court of kings bench error is in so many words imputed to the judges of that inferior court    so when from the judges of the court of kings bench in some cases to the judges of the two other commonlaw courts sitting in the exchequerchamber and thence to the lords in other cases directly to the house of lords    but on the conduct of no one of all these dignitaries will any imputation of error be cast in any such direct way by a judge of the dispatch court  in the procedure part under the head of subsequential evidence elicited the principles respecting the elicitation are prescribed but the present being the place allotted to the powers given to the judge here is the place in which in the first instance mention requires to be made of the corresponding checks †   as to the check thus applied to the power of the judge—in the eyes of corruptionists and all other persons if any there are who are wedded to the existing system far from affording an answer to any objection on the score of the magnitude of the power it will operate as an additional objection forasmuch as in so far as it has this effect it establishes what in such eyes will of course be a bad precedent having for its tendency the reconciling the public mind to the idea of subjecting to eventual punishment and thereby to present and actual controul those who in the existing state of things are not by law subject in effect to punishment or controul in any shape   the greater the power a man has of doing wrong the less likely is he to do wrong—such is the vulgar theory till at last when you come to the highest pinnacle in the temple of power there you behold a being perched upon it who is under an absolute personal incapacity of doing wrong in any shape—a being who could not do wrong were he to labour at it with all his might—and under matchless constitution upon this assumption is government founded   the king is impeccable the house of lords is impeccable the house of commons is impeccable and yet there are not three impeccable but one impeccable—the parliament the house of lords is legion the house of commons is legion but these are legions not of unclean but of the very cleanest spirits whosoever would find favour in their sight must thus think or pretend to think of the constituted authorities of unintentional error a successor of each official or other influential person may be susceptible of intentional error of evilconsciousness not neither of the one nor the other the actual incumbent   intentional error or misconduct in any shape especially in that shape in which it has place every day on the part of all—that is to say departure from the law of veracity and sincerity—is universally held a good ground for a mans subjecting himself to the risk of being put to death by a disputant for the chance and hope of putting to death that same disputant   neither on this occasion nor on any other should the utter impunity secured to judges under the existing system be ever out of mind urged by remorse or any other less difficultly supposable cause should an english judge court punishment his prayer would not be granted nemo auditur perire volens—is among the maxims of romebred law in english law it would not be cited but the benefit of it would be granted   if in large proportion men were not found silly enough to give credence to absurdities in the shape above pointed out men would not in so large a proportion not to say universally be found possessed of the effrontery necessary to the giving utterance to them but forasmuch as every man perceives that it would be for his benefit to be regarded as possessor of absolute perfection or something little short of it and his pretensions would find no opponent in any other man whose pretensions to it he does not oppose—hence it is that by common consent—by an agreement not the less effectual for being tacit—every such man gives false evidence in favour of other and by this evidence the unreflecting multitude of people without doors are in but too large proportion deceived and dealt with accordingly   thus would the check provided threaten them with the prospect of seeing themselves divested of the power of exercising depredation and oppression without stint that power which so lately by the influence of lord eldon lord tenterden and mr peel obtained at the hands of parliament in addition to those motives which can never be wanting the means of heaping affliction on affliction on a class of men distinguished from all others by the distress under which they were labouring namely by the power of imposing on them taxes without stint this for the purpose and with the effect of putting the money into the pockets of the learned collectors—see indications c v       for in one of the ways or modes in which subordination is established in relation to this newlyinvented sort of judge would—not only the chief justices of the commonlaw courts but the lord high chancellor himself be unavoidably placed in a state of subordinationa   manifest it is true to the eyes of the chief justice of the kings bench could not but be the state of subordination in which in the more direct and conspicuous mode the newly invented functionary placed as above over his head will be reciprocally placed under him still by what he gained in this way far from adequate would seem to him the compensation for what he would lose in that other way  0 for in no instance could the old established dignitary inflict punishment or pronounce sentence on conviction on the new intruder without presenting to the imagination of the people at large a scene in which he himself would be acting the principal character while undergoing that same humiliation    consequence of course—from the great westminsterhall volcano now at least if not before a volley of explosions—explosions of learned gas from all quarters i all this immense mass of power a mass so absolutely unprecedented and to whom—to such an upstart creature of the fancy as this imagined judge—power over every member of the community the king alone excepted power over everybody even to the purpose of punishment power over the head of the law—power and for the declared purpose of superseding his authority—constitution subverted all good order—order itself destroyed

to answer to interrogatories subjected to a treatment to which the common law in its matchless humanity suffers not the vilest criminal to be exposed thus far for the ears of the layagents iii then in a whisper to learned brethren—what a precedent this at this rate where is the criminal that will escape—at this rate a man really guilty will have no chance he will confess at once—all our learning all our ingenuity all our eloquence will be of no use to him think of the learned pockets—think of our pockets—think of the vacuum this will make in them instead of coming to us as at present his

at any time be doubted to wreak his vengeance on the intruder by whose upstart power judiciary authority is in all its established shapes laid low and to enable him to give himself this regale what is there wanting but an invitation from mr attorneygeneral vi then sits a jury but with the united eloquence of the lord chief justice and the attorneygeneral the mouthpiece of the crown thus enlisted together in support of a cause so much their own where is the jury that will be able to stand against them what word can possibly present itself to their tongues other than the word guilty    tantalizing in a sad degree will thus be the situation of a chief justice of the kings bench no otherwise could he root out the effectually responsible power of the dispatch court judge than on condition of thus undermining his own irresponsible and arbitrary power that power of maleficence without stint the loss of which is to every possessor of it naturally so intolerable    think of a lord tenterden thunderbolt in hand and opposite to and under him a sir james scarlett calling upon him to hurl it at the head of the devoted salmoneus    so much for learned objections now at the sound of plain sense behold them vanish each taken separately—strong it must be confessed are the two antagonizing powers put them together and like the salt with which our food is seasoned the elements they are composed of put off their corrosive nature and become mild and salutary    out of the two dangers is formed security the old established functionaries will not suffer anything—and as little will the new created one    as to subjection to interrogation what danger to innocence is it pregnant with what consequence worse than that of clearing it of any imputation that may have been cast upon it    from what source did these objections ever spring other than that of a wish to afford to guilt in every shape an encouraging chance of escape    as to the two giants—the chief justice and the attorneygeneral grim as they are on all occasions on the present occasion behold them thus rendered not only less grim but motionless motionless yea even as gog and magog without a call from the attorneygeneral the lord chief justice of the kings bench cannot stir without an order from the first lord of the treasury the attorneygeneral cannot or at least will not stir    but suppose the order received comes then the matter before a jury and if there be any occasion on which in the multitude of these counsellors there is a safety this surely is of the number say that on ordinary occasions when government prosecutes they are but too apt to cast off the responsibility from their own shoulders upon those of my lord judge and economizing thought as they would money say at once guilty to save trouble on an occasion such as this and this so unextraordinary a one little apprehension of any such promptitude need assuredly have place  0 thus blind were they for example when—in pursuance of the standing conspiracy against the liberty of the press—one of the machinations of which was and is the converting all history into an instrument of delusion by suppression of all facts and comments by which sin in any shape might be imputed to any one of blackstones gods upon earth—the body of the editor of a weekly paper was at the command of lord tenterden given up to him to be consigned to a two years imprisonment for daring to hold up the character of george the third in an unfavourable point of view    in ordinary cases true it is instances of such blindness have in all times been in sad abundance but the present case is an extraordinary one to the necessity of justice to human happiness—and to the hatred of it in the breasts of english judges—the eyes of the public even of that public of which jurymen are composed are at length beginning to open themselves sir james scarlett might cry aloud and lord tenterden spare not—a jury after hearing from the lips of the dispatch court judge justice and common sense substituted for the first time to pickpocket absurdity and nonsense would pause as the phrase is before they sacrificed the author of so much good to the

not the word prehensor innovational as it is startle you indispensable was the demand for it and whatsoever cloud it presents itself as being involved in a short explanation will blow off what was wanted is—a word that should signify to lay hold off—to lay hold of what answer—all such objects whatsoever they may be—as the purpose in question may require to be laid hold of and these objects—what are they answer—things of all sorts and persons of all sorts purpose—that of supplying means of remedy for the wrong complained of by the demand with which the suit commenced—or means for the elicitation of the evidence necessary to the proof or in so far as disprovable the disproof of that same wrong   for the designation of this function true it is—already in use is the word to apprehend with some of its conjugates but this composite word has divers other senses nor is it applied to things to things of any sort—immoveable moveable or incorporeal no less short of being adequate are the words arrest—to arrest prehensor from the latin prehendo without the ap does what is wanted clear of everything that is not wanted   by the mere act of laying hold of the subjectmatter—whatever it were—if nothing further were done with it no good would be done with this same subjectmatter whatever it be consequently by this same operation no good is done or something further is done either it is simply ejected out of the place in which it was found or it is transferred from that place to some other   true it is—that by the words prehensor and to prehend of none of the above modes of disposal is any intimation given but by no signs which language furnishes can all these things be signified at once and when the original cloud is cleared away as above the idea of some ulterior disposal such as the purpose in question requires will present itself of course   operator operation mandate by which the orders of the judge are signified to the operator for all these several matters has place the need of appropriate nomenclature of the mandate the denomination will be determined by those of the two others   first as to operator and operation under the existing system—in the language of justice of peace procedure when the operation is prehension warrant is the word employed for the designation of the mandate by which it is ordered to be performed when simple imperation summons as to the operator he is in both cases the same functionary and constable is the name given to him   in the language of regular procedure diversified in an extraordinary degree is the nomenclature employed in the designation of the operator   serjeantatarms   sheriffs officer   boundbailiff—vulgariter bumbailiff   tipstaff   messenger   apparitor these may serve for examples for completion of the list neither time nor space can here be spared   note that in some of these cases the only function given to the functionary is that of the prehensor in others it is that of the messenger in others again both functions are given to the same individual in bankruptcy procedure confounded under one and the same denomination namely that of messenger are the two so different services—that of a messenger and that of a prehensor   then again when the function is that of the messenger the operator is—in some cases not a public functionary but an agent of the party for example an attorneys clerk and in this case serving and service are the terms employed in designating the operation  0 in this case as in all others the more simple and undiversified the nomenclature employed in the designation of the several mutuallyrelated objects the clearer are the conceptions conveyed by it hence the length of this explanatory and justificative note  code for the purpose of extracting money to be disposed of in such manner as seems good to them the constituted authorities find no difficulty in preparing and causing to be delivered the appropriate mandates witness for example the assessed tax notices by which householders are required to give information of such taxable articles as they have in their occupation scarcely of a prehensors code would the contents be more bulky than of one of these papers which are twice ayear delivered at every taxed house †   under the existing system in the higher class of criminal cases namely those which from the species of punishment allotted to them are so unappropriately styled felonies—power of exercising this function is given to the party wronged so under the original roman law in cases called civil ii on this occasion to the danger of abuse no great regard seems to have been paid witness the phrase obtorto collo witness also the rupit in jus mentioned in horace iii small indeed is this danger—if where the plaintiff is prehensor to the right of prehension the obligation of adduction to the judgment seat is attached iv where apprehension of endeavour on the part of the defendant to avoid the rencontre has place in the breast of the plaintiff—more diligence is of course to be expected at the hands of a person thus interested than at the hands of an uninterested public functionary but the difference may be supplied by liberty on the part of the plaintiff to accompany the public functionary and this liberty if not taken away by law will have place of course  in the accounts of public offices this is a customary head the fund will be provided in this as in other cases † to a deplorable extent throughout the whole field of legislation is exemplified the evil of fixation where variability in the quantity of the matter in question whatever it be and thence applicability of such quantity to the particular circumstances of each individual case is prescribed by prudence instances are—as hereinabove mentioned—  fixed premiums   as elsewhere mentioned fixed penalties especially when in a pecuniary shape   as per petitions for justice device viii v   0 blind fixation of times for

consignee   on a preceding occasion namely in sect vi art       and    in the view of conformity to usage this word was employed for the purpose of giving expression to an idea for the designation of which it has on closer inspection been found unfit this as well as several other words which for their termination have this same syllable ee   for the purpose of giving denomination to the species of functionary whose functions are spoken of in the text some appellative was altogether indispensable and a singleworded one in every instance in which an apt one can either be found or made is eminently desirable namely for conciseness and for avoidance of that entanglement with the circumjacent words which is in the case of a manyworded appellative so liable to have place   by the threeworded appellative holderintrust the idea in question may with indisputable aptitude be designated but by simple transposition these three words as the reader sees are capable of being as it were melted into one   appellations bearing the most perfect analogy in relation to this are in most familiar use witness householder innholder freeholder bottleholder in the word intrustholder the number of syllables is not greater than in this same word bottleholder so familiar to the practitioners and amateurs of pugilism   perhaps for some little time to come there may be a use in keeping the three component words separated from each other by two hyphens as thus intrustholder   so much as to the need and propriety of this second of the two appellations the second employed as equivalent and synonymous to the first now as to the inaptitude of the first   whatsoever be the operation in question—for conveying to the mind the idea of it two sorts of appellations are and have at all times been requisite not to say necessary one for the designation of the operator or say agent the other for the designation of the subjectmatter operated upon or say in one word the patient whether the class this same patient belongs to be the class of things or that of persons and if the operation consists in the transference of the subjectmatter from one hand plainly or figuratively speaking to another then—requisite to be added is an appellative for the designation of a third object which may be termed the recipient or say receiver   for the designation of the operator whether plainly or figuratively so called together with the subjectmatter operated upon—each expression being the correlative of the other—the original language of the lawyer class—namely the normanfrench—furnished a pair of apt desinences or say terminations namely for the operator or otherwise er not to speak of ant and ent for the subjectmatter operated upon single é with an accent rendered into english by a double ee   thus far all was and is well but in process of time came upon the carpet as being necessary to the completion of the group the idea of a recipient presenting as above a demand for an appellative what was to be done in this quandary—up starts with its accent on its head letter é and presents to view a species of appellative readymade and already in use true it is—the idea was not exactly the same it was however near of kin and the age being a rude and littlediscriminating one—an appellative that belonged to another idea and did not exactly fit the one in question was in the hurry taken in hand and clapt on to this new idea as in a crowded passage a man will sometimes take up another mans hat instead of his own  0 instances are—consignee assignee mortgagee trustee after what has been said consignee and assignee speak for themselves not so—mortgagee or trustee    as to mortgagee—the species of conveyance termed a mortgage being the transfer of the subjectmatter in question from one hand to another upon certain conditions—the mortgagee should according to the original analogy abovementioned be the name of that same subjectmatter and for the designation of the person recipient or in one word the receiver some other appellative should have been and accordingly should at present be looked out for    but in the sense the inaptitude of which has thus been brought to view so rooted in the language is this same word mortgagee while there is not as yet in use any other singleworded appellative by which this same idea can by possibility be brought to view—that for the present at least it must be left in the undisturbed possession of the ground on which it has planted itself    for my part says the author of these pages never till this moment has it seemed to me that the idea associated in my mind with this word was a clear one    what has added to the confusion has all along been—the syllable mort meaning death death what has it to do with the matter as little as any other thing that can be mentioned for this species of transfer before any apt and generally intelligible set of appellatives can be found death must be turned out of doors and a substitute for him or her provided the real property commission will let us hope find this operation not unworthy of being included in the catalogue of its so welldirected cares    as to the word trustee—it presents itself as being much too extensively and firmly rooted in the language ever to be drawn out nor on the other hand does any considerable harm appear to be done by it by a kindred though not exactly similar misapplication the word examinant substituted to examiner has been itself taken for the subjectmatter of examination elsewhere    two other words here present themselves as having a claim to notice namely assignee and sequestrator in both instances—besides their inaptitude for bringing to view the correlative ideas herein abovementioned—their import is too narrow to admit of their receiving on the present occasion any employment    as to the word assignee the idea presented by it is—that of a species of trustee under whose care and management a stock of things of all sorts is placed to the intent that it may be brought into the shape of money of that money the ultimate destination being—the distribution of it among a set of creditors    in that case in the idea of the subjectmatter confided is not included that of a person except in the singular and happily comparativelynarrow case of slavery and for the present purpose a word capable of being made to present the idea of a person as well as that of a thing was necessary    by the word sequestrator the idea presented is—that of a functionary whose functions are confined to the case where the subjectmatter of the intermediate possession is a thing namely a thing immoveable and that not intended to be converted into money  0 two sorts of judicatories there are—in which to a functionary whose functions are of this description employment is occasionally given by the judge namely an equity court and an ecclesiastical court both acting under romebredlaw    of the term consignee the use

say not so much as £ 000 seized and distributed in the sort of receptacle which in holy writ is termed a den of thieves   on the ground of this precedent to any individual to whom it is agreeable to give acceptance to the offer—to every such individual with or without confederacy with the head of the law or his subordinates—on the ground of this precedent for under matchless constitution a single precedent made by a single judge suffices on all occasions to make law a sure course may be seen opened for the like plunderage at the charge sooner or later of all the members of the aristocracy of the country—those of both houses of parliament included having taken for the intended victim a sufficiently opulent family in which a child under age is entitled to property independently of the father—a jackal with or without concert with the lion by so simple a process as the filing a bill in equity against the father transforms by this means the child into a ward of the high court the property in question is thereupon taken into the hands and placed at the disposal of the judge and the costs of the suit are taken out of it as far as it goes—by so extensively practicable a course of pillage may the precedent set in mr wellesleys case be pursued and turned to account to the extent hereinabove described   now mind what this calumniatorgeneral—this instrument and accomplice of every particular calumniator who as above can and will come up to his price and hire him—mind how he comports himself should it happen to himself to be the object of defamatory imputation suppose it bribery

that case security being thus provided for all malefactors the truth is not permitted to be proved and the man punished is—not he who committed the crime but he who addressing himself to the public opinion tribunal gave information of it—a sample this out of thousands upon thousands of what under matchless constitution is administered under the name of justice   note here—that though in this case impropriety in some shape in the conduct of the father must be imputed it is not necessary that the imputation should have so much as a syllable of truth in it for as shown in petition for

nonsense that which they concur in supposing is that a list of principles and a corresponding list of rules generally recognised as coming under that denomination are in existence whereas no such lists are capable of being produced by any person by whom the existence of them is thus asserted † thus it is that throughout the whole of the pannomion or say allcomprehensive body of law to which the presentproposed bill belongs the arrangement made is deduced from the consideration of the quantities of pain and pleasure likely to be produced by it—or say from its effects on the happiness of all persons interested or as the familiar phrase has it on human feelings void of all claim to regard on the part of any rational mind is every subjectmatter of consideration on any other ground than

purpose—machinery which under the load of expense and delay at present lying upon it cannot be set to work by one out of perhaps a dozen perhaps a score of the sets of persons that have need of it ‡   when section the first was sent to the pressa the expectation entertained was that for the purpose of participating in the herebypromised benefit—namely the substitution of a system in which delay and expense are minimized to one in which those evils are maximized—suitors in sufficient numbers would join in a petition to the king for that purpose and that to them upon the principle on which arbitration is sanctioned by law the choice of the dispatch court judge might be committed such was the expectation entertained and proceeded upon at the time when the matter of that first section was sent to the press and so it continued to be till not only the matter originally destined for this section had been written but matter also for the whole remainder of the bill   for the purpose of trying the experiment a tract moreover was published intituled equity dispatch court proposal containing a plan for the speedy and unexpensive termination of the suits now depending in equity courts—with the form of a petition and some account of a proposed bill for that purposea but before the present section had been sent to the press it had become but too certain that the experiment had failed—so far at least as regarded the trial of it proposed in that tract to be made   not only the matter of that publication including a detailed account of the matter proposed for the present bill but the principal part of it in terminis including the whole of the matter down to the present section with the exception of some subsequentlymade and notasyetcommunicated amendments had received not only from amply competent judges but from men high in professional eminence the most unreserved approbation   but on the part of suitors such was the terror of what might befal them from the resentment of the lawyers official and professional belonging to the courts in question that by the invitation given in the abovenamed tract from no more than two suitors one from each of two suits was any application produced and in both these instances this obstacle had been removed the persons in question being in a state of actual hostility with the court in the hands of which they had been undergoing a course of depredation and oppression for a multitude of years that it was in this terror that the failure had its cause is matter not merely of inference but also of experience for in various instances by the abovementioned approvers endeavours were employed to persuade suitors to join in the proposed petition and notwithstanding the just estimation in which the opinion of the givers of the advice was held by the receivers of it still the terror was so great as to prevent them from taking the course recommended by it   by this failure however neither had the demand for the remedy to the grievance in question been shown to be less urgent nor any ground afforded for diminishing the confidence in the hereproposed remedy on the contrary the perception and acknowledgment of the inaptitude and utter depravity of the existing judicial establishment and procedure have been increasing daily in intensity and extent   moreover the plan for the accomplishment of which a bill had been brought into the house of commons on the motion of the learned member who has since been elevated to the situation of head of the law and subsequently pursued by the announcement of a bill for the same purpose with the necessary amendments as being about to be moved for in the house of lords has been declared to be dropped   under these circumstances how much soever the encouragement to perseverance was weakened the inducements in other respects remained and with even augmented force   as to the machinery here visible the only part which by the abandonment of what regards the proposed petition is rendered needless and thence unserviceable is the matter of section i judge located how and a portion more or less considerable of section vi judges powers   but though with reference to the purpose of the present act this is rendered unserviceable to other purposes of still more extensive importance it will it is hoped be seen to be in no inconsiderable degree applicable

the house of commons would be not less competent and by this additional engine addition might be made to the extent of the information obtainable by the dispatch court as well as the assurance of the completeness of it   saving might moreover be made in the article of expense namely that which would be necessitated by the elicitation of the information from the several courts if performed by the dispatch court judge   by orders to one or more of the equity court offices from which returns have of late years been presented might be obtained the days of commencement as above of the suits commenced in the several years also the names of the town solicitors on both sides or at any rate what would be sufficient on the plaintiffs sides   of the several proceedings had down to the then present time—proceedings that is to say operations performed and written instruments issued from and received into the several offices information would be afforded by the several solicitors as per section xiv examination of solicitors and thereby of the committees time a correspondent quantity which would otherwise have to be expended in the oral examination of those same solicitors saved   if for any particular purpose—such as the bringing to view the cause of the longevity of the suit—the committee should see reason it would then rest with them to convene the solicitor or solicitors and by word of mouth elicit the appropriate information   such is the advance which towards the end in view is capable of being made by the house of commons without the concurrence of the house of lords and thence clear of the danger of nonconcurrence as well as of that retardation which to an indefinite extent would even in the case of concurrence be inevitable  see the note at the beginning of this section and its relation to this article the article referred to was afterwards omitted by the author—ed  lot apparent objections which present themselves to be obviated with answers to them are the following—   severe the loss thence proportionable the reluctance on the part of professional men all of them to the furnishing of the information required the lottery in proportion as to clients it

considerable the difficulty of surmounting this same reluctance in such sort as to secure the fulfilment of the obligation   considerable the delay and expense necessary to the causing the orders issued for this purpose to be made known to all the several individuals from whom the information would in this manner be endeavoured to be obtained   considerable would be the difficulty of ascertaining the fact of the knowledge for the purpose of applying punishment in case of disobedience   as to the hardship to individuals from the benefit to the community matter of just regret as it would be in this as in all other cases it not only ought not to be regarded as constituting a peremptory objection to the eliciting this necessary information but is not so in legislative practice

commonlaw suits   as to the delay and expense of the requisite notification great indeed would it be were it necessary to give a separate notice to every person on whom the call for the information has need to be made—namely the several solicitors residing in or in the near neighbourhood of the metropolis but situated and circumstanced as they are one common notice would serve for all as effectually as a separate notice to each the measure being of course the subject of universal conversation as well as interest during the progress of the bill abundant and effectual would be the notice received by every one of them long before the passing of it   by every one who has had any acquaintance with the proceedings in the courts of chancery were it only from the newspapers it must have been seen in what enormous quantities competition for priority with correspondent altercation has in the highest of the three courts habitually had place of complaints of the grievance no want of length or loudness in that place need be feared the longer the complaint of the delay continues the more of it is produced—expense on the one part profit on the other proportionable the complaint of

existing practice   lord chief baron of the court of exchequer this denomination is more lengthy than any one of the hereinaboveproposed denominations and is moreover wholly uncharacteristic the word

exchequer this is equally uncharacteristic with the foregoing and not less lengthy than those here proposed   lord chief justice of the court of common pleas little less uncharacteristic this and not at all less lengthy moreover the word justice is by reason of its ambiguity an awkward substitute for the word judge—the name of a fictitious entity employed also in making designation of the real entity—the name of a quality employed also in making designation of a substance—a living and rational sort of substance   like observation as to kings bench judges   lord high chancellor this is also uncharacteristic little less lengthy is it than the hereproposed appellation it is not so universally familiar as the word judge it belongs not as that does to the ordinary language of every nation   vicechancellor has the same uncharacteristicalness so likewise the same want of familiarity and to an ordinary ear the prefix vice has on the face of it an awkward ambiguity from which the word depute is free—the idea opposite to that of the name of the fictitious entity virtue being by this application brought up into the mind in conjunction with that which it is here employed to designate   master of the rolls this is in a superior not to say supreme degree uncharacteristic and more than simply and negatively uncharacteristic as being in a positive sense awkwardly ludicrous like the word vice it operates as an incurable provocative to punning its inferiority in lengthiness affords not a sufficient compensation for its uncharacteristicalness and its other abovementioned features of inaptitude to the lawyer class these imperfections are by usage rendered imperceptible not so to the other classes more especially to the most numerous to whom on this as on other occasions most regard is due †   compare with the security afforded by the provisions herein made for oppropriate aptitude in relation to mastersinchancery business the utter absence of all security for such appropriate aptitude in the situation of master in chancery under the existing practice   in the case of other judges of all classes and grades publicity has place and this security stands instead of all others and under all the imperfections which have place so considerable and effective is this security that in the comparatively tolerable state in which we see it it keeps the administration of justice   but in the case of the masters in chancery even this security is wanting under the veil of secrecy in which the masters closet is involved by the operation of that sinister interest to which unbounded licence is allowed is carried on the system of depredation and counteraction of all the ends of justice and these closets are with or without exception rendered so many dens of cacus   emolument enormous—false pretences on which it is obtained scandalous—mode of payment so far as regards fees such as places interest in a state of as violent opposition to duty as can be conceived pay for the whole year varying from £ 000 to £ 000—number of days of attendance in the whole year various and accidental in instances which have many years been before the public not more than as many as compose five months out of the twelve in one instance which has been before the public a fee of not less than £  0 extorted for a signature which by an automaton might have been subscribed with equal use   of the business for which master and clerk are paid in fees a vast proportion is done by the clerk alone and this part upon the whole probably the least badly done and the emolument being so enormous thus is the value of the patronage screwed up to an enormously high pitch for under these circumstances no relation or other connexion of the patron can be too weak or too depraved to be thus enriched by him for depredation and oppression to whatsoever degree carried no redress by any possibility obtainable from any hands other than those of the patron whose interest in it and benefit derived from it rises in the same proportion as that of a patron with the incumbent of an ecclesiastical benefice   by a tenth part of the emolument several times the aptitude might were there any

notified by his signature  at this first hearing savings in delay and expense will incontestably and manifestly be the following—   the facts which in the plaintiffs bill are alleged will by the defendant be either contested or admitted if they are all admitted remains as and for the subjectmatter of contestation the question of law and the time and expense saved will be all the time and expense which in the equity suit remained to be employed in the elicitation of the evidence respecting the question of facts   if some are admitted some contested then the saving will be all such time and expense as would otherwise have been employed in and produced by the elicitation of those which are admitted as also all the time that would have been to be expended in the elicitation of all such as would not otherwise have been elicited at the same time with those which are admitted or those which being contested remain to be elicited   whatsoever portions of evidence remain to be elicited measure may thus immediately be taken of the quantity of time requisite for the elicitation of them and thence on substantial ground expectation built of the time at which the suit will receive its termination   if in a large proportion of the number of instances the maximum of time cannot be determined with certainty the minimum of time may in every instance as for example where the distance in respect of time has for its cause the distance in respect of place  in contradistinction to the term defendant simply altogether necessary is the appellation proposed defendant cases in which under the existing system the term defendant being employed is improperly employed two—  where he performs the service demanded at his charge   where being purely passive he omits to perform it—of this distinction not inconsiderable is the practical importance for what purpose is it that by the existing system the name of defendant is stamped on a man by whom nothing in that character is done answer for the purpose of finding a pretence for plundering him  under the existing system for the purpose of proving that a letter or a signature to a note of hand or to a bond was written by the man by whom it was written a witness may have been fetched from australia or peru this operation having been pretended to be or having even really been necessary while the man may have been living all the while within a stones throw of the justice chamber and every now and then on the occasion of some discussion carried on in the course of the suit standing up in full view of the judge bad enough this assuredly but what is still worse and cannot but frequently have place is that on the occasion of this or that suit no such extraneous witness can be found and in this case ruin may be the lot of the honest man opulence and triumph that of the cheat whom by the assurance of success thus offered tohim the judges authors of this corruptionspreading arrangement have rendered such under the existing system neither by all the powers of the commonlaw courts nor by all the powers of the equity courts can an acknowledgment of this sort be obtained to no matter of fact of any sort will a commonlaw court call for a mans answer in any shape at the instance of his adversary—to a fact of any other sort than this exceptions excepted at the end of some five or six years in case of his unwillingness an equity court yes but as to the making him admit or deny the fact of his having written the words in question no means are there for it the only means the nature of the case admits of is this the paper being in the view of the presiding judge produced to the interrogatee and the words in question pointed out to him the question put to him—did you write this or did you not—and for this the mutual presence of the interrogatee and the judge is as everybody sees necessary an examination of this sort does it ever happen to it to be performed by a set of commissioners furnished with the documents in question for the purpose if yes thereupon comes a fox chase fox the party intended to be examined dogs—wellfed dogs—the commissioners † on the plan herein set forth the truth of the case would come out at the earliest moment and except the vexation which would result from the indispensable attendance no suffering either under the name of punishment or any other produced without previous demonstration that by the person in question the alleged guilty act had been performed and that it was of the number of those to which prohibition stood attached by the hand of the legislature say for shortness promptitude of proof or disproof maximized misdecision by punishment without proof none turn now to the existing system here amongst other vices may be seen—delay maximized groundless suffering not the less enormous for not being inflicted under the name of punishment to which is exposed every person in the kingdom at the hand of a government advocate paid by and acting under the orders of the highest board—a body of kings ministers all completely irresponsible not a single person in the kingdom of england on whom it is not in the power of this same cabinet toimpose a virtual mulct or say pecuniary penalty to an unlimited amount at pleasure without need of proof or so much as a pretence of proof to the government advocate—attorney general his official name—order is by this same cabinet given to issue an instrument styled an ex officio information innocent or guilty the devoted victim finds himself on pain of being treated as if he was guilty under the obligation of putting in a correspondent written instrument which he is not admitted to put in without paying under the name of fees money to an unlimited amount out of the pockets of the people at large do these same cabinet ministers thus pay this instrument of theirs in the first place then in the next place do they impose a virtual tax on these same victims putting the produce into the pockets of the various functionaries superordinate and subordinate of the judiciary establishment connected with the aforesaid attorneygeneral by the ties of sinister interest of this state of things an occurrence that has recently called forth a considerable portion of public notice may afford an apposite exemplification hiatus in ms the account of the occurrence alluded to is not given nor can it now be discovered the comment is as follows—ed this being a criminal offence here then is an act to which the appellation of an act of defamation may with incontestable propriety be attached but on the person by whom this same act has been exercised should punishment in any shape be inflicted here then comes a just demand for satisfaction in the shape of compensation for the expense and vexation attached to the operation of judicial selfdefence and supposing the burthen imposed by the necessity of making this compensation—suppose it not sufficient for punishment thereupon comes a demand for the infliction of ulterior suffering under the name of punishment but now suppose on the other hand that by that same high functionary of the law that same criminal act so imputed to him was really committed on this supposition should either such compensation or such punishment have place no surely but at the least permission and rather than punishment reward reward at the public expense—simple permission if this without reward would be sufficient to produce the information reward on the contrary supposition in the hereproposed bill in the event of a criminal offence being committed by any one of the high legal functionaries in question for the future prevention of such offence punishment is appointed to be inflicted on him why because amongst the objects proposed as ends in view of this same bill is the prevention of all such offences under the existing system in the actual practice of its judicatories in case of the commission of any such offence punishment in outward show is indeed appointed but in the system of procedure which is applied to this portion of the main body of the law such arrangements are established that instead of punishment impunity and even remuneration is the result why wherefore but that on the part of the functionaries by whom this state of things was brought into existence it was really the wish that of the criminal offences in question the abundance should be maximized and the motive the profit in all shapes derivable from these same offences—derived by themselves and in general by such persons by and with whom they connect themselves by the ties of sinister interest or sympathy now if this is not tyranny what is if in england under such a state of things tyranny is not established—established by law in so far as the practice of the functionaries of government is law where else is tyranny to be found in spain in portugal or in morocco  see section vi art       and note behold upon how simple a matter of fact or circumstance the character of a whole system of procedure may be determined by how familiar and at the same time how manifest notorious unconcealed and unconcealable a vice it is capable of being rendered hostile to all the ends or justice in french procedure the licence to mendacity is still more ample than in the english in the english it is in some small degree repressed and it has been seen in how small a degree by the punishment attached to it in so far as delivered in the shape of affidavit evidence in french procedure in no such shape as that of affidavit evidence is evidence ever delivered true it is that falsehood in evidence having for its subjectmatter the facts belonging to the case has punishment attached to it in french procedure as in english but in french procedure also as in english the distinction has place between evidence and pleadings between the cases the parts in the course of the suit in which falsehood is punishable and the cases in which it is not punishable among the cases in which it is not punishable are those in which it is employed in framing a ground for the removal of the suit from one judicatory to another in removing the suit by appeal by which error and in so far misconduct is imputed to the judge appealed from or without any such imputation bandying has place—bandying as explained in the petition for justice see vol v     in the french judiciary system the number of the judicatories one above another being excessive—though not so excessive nor by a good deal so diversified as in the english nor the factitious expense in any of them anything near so ruinous—hence arises what there is that is correct in the statement given of it in the french work quoted in the morning chronicle of   th march    0  turn now to the existing system in regard to notice   for the giving of notice on each individual occasion the judge of the dispatch court is provided with adequate means—namely those which common sense when there is no sinister purpose to answer employs of course those means being suited to the particular circumstances of each individual case and having nothing to get by avoiding to employ them his employing them and to the best advantage is a matter of course   under the existing system the equity judge as well as every other judge having much to get by these as well as all other notices not being received takes care accordingly to avoid being provided with the means proper for causing them to be received the place to which he sends the information is any place other than that at which at the time in question the man is in relation to whom the pretended wish is that he shall receive it uttered by word of mouth it is uttered by proclamation in some place in which at the time it is sure that he will not be uttered in black and white it is caused to be printed in some paper—london gazette for instance—on which it is sure he will not cast an eye and as these modes of avoiding to communicate information will serve in equal perfection in one case as in another hence the advantage of doing the thing by general rules   as to the use derived by the learned marksman from thus missing the mark it lies not assuredly very deep below the surface were the party to know what it is that is required of him he might do it in which case those good things would not be got which are got by his not doing it not knowing what it is that is required of him—meaning always what is pretended to be required of him—he omits doing it thereupon if he has land you lay hold upon his land and good things in plenty you find means to make out of it if he has no land when the worst comes to the worst he has at any rate a body and if along with this body of his he has money or moneys worth at command the more and the longer you plague him the more money out of him you get   if and when thus punished for not doing that which care was taken it should not be in his power to do of course for the chance of seeing his suffering put an end to then in the appointed form comes an application from him for relief by the punishment he was tormented by the costs of this application his torment is augmented but in proportion as he is tormented the learned tormentors are comforted   meantime whatever be that good which the dispatch court judge can do without doing needless evil to the suitor he will as above do in every case at once instead of endeavouring to plague the suitor for the chance of forcing him to do it on every occasion he will go directly to the object because nothing is to be got by him from going zigzag under the existing system the ground being strewed with fees turnings and windings are multiplied because the larger the course the greater the number of fees that are capable of being picked up on it † house of call in buonapartes code civile election de domicile is the locution employed to denote what is here denoted by the locution house of call but compared with those here

of taxpayers in indefinite and unascertainable multitude—namely the poor among the taxpayers—a much larger quantity will be saved   in the breast of the judge no assignable motive inducement or temptation to give to such his power on any occasion any abusive exercise has place more than whatsoever would have place if to the suffering were given any other imaginable shape   in the day which gave birth to the statute by which a stigma was imprinted on the practice of imposing excessive fines fresh in all memories was the sentence by which on hampden the second son and heir of hampden the first a fine of £ 0000 was imposed—a sum in those days of comparatively small taxation equal in value to three or four times the nominal amount of the present day in that state of things powers such as those hereinabove proposed would have been pregnant with a mass of mischief protestations against which could not have been too energetic the money exacted would have gone the whole of it into the pockets of a spendthrift king and being dislocable at pleasure the occupants of the bench of justice were the breath of the nostrils of him whose seal was on them—the occupant of the throne a pair of empsons and another of dudleys might have composed the population of the kings bench and under a charles the second or a james the second the rapacity of the seventh and the profusion of the eighth henry might at one and the same time have been polluting the same throne   true it is that for giving to the mass of evil that completeness and perfection which the proposed powers would have given the power of scrutinizing by oral examination the state of the offenders pecuniary circumstances would still have been necessary true it also is that grave considerations—considerations such as in the mind of a lord eldon were capable of breeding great doubts—would have opposed a bar of no mean strength to the assumption of such a power for as may be seen in the petitions for justice of an exclusion put upon this element of natural procedure was formed the keystone of the feegathering system and by every instance of it employed in practice what would be regarded as a dangerous precedent—a bad precedent—would have been set—a practice of which no more than one exemplification—namely that afforded by the justification of bail—had been suffered to creep in  0 of bringing these things to view what it may be asked is the purpose answer this to render it plain and incontestable that against the cluster of powers proposed to be united in the hands of the judge no valid objection can be deduced from that same declaration of rights for that whatsoever beneficial tendency is commonly regarded as being possessed by it is in the proposed authority of the dispatch court carried into effect and that the security which in that case was imperfect and given to no more than a few is in this case perfect and given to all that in that state of things the power of exacting money of mulcting without stint connected with the equally unlimited power of eliciting evidence of the state of pecuniary circumssances would to a certainty have been abused and to an extent destructive of all property whereas in the present state of things under the hereproposed checks the certainty is that such abuse could not have place in any degree    so much for the certainty of revenue now as to the probable amount of it neither within a hundred a thousand or a million of pounds need it be confined the proper standard of reference and measurement in this case is indeed the aggregate value and amount of the offenders property in all shapes but what amount answer not the absolute amount but the relative—relation had to the state of his pecuniary circumstances—that is to say to the sum of his needs or his demands for money compared with the sum of his means of satisfying those demands    result upon the whole a compound of public frugality and moral improvement—the economy the efficient cause of the morality a compound but in proportion altogether incapable of being reached so much as by conjecture the elements antagonizing in one way cooperating in another in each and every individual instance in which by the operation in question money is raised the correspondent want of morality will have been proved at the same time by the example set by it—by the warning given by it abstinence would be probabilized—abstinence to an extent unlimited and unlimitable and free would be this compound from every the smallest particle of danger in every shape    but under the assurance of the salutariness of both these results and of their being one or other or both together actually produced no great regret need be entertained at the thoughts of the impossibility that would oppose itself to any such operation as that of determining their mutual proportion—the proportion of each of them to the other    shut up for ever would be the affidavit and

thereabouts being years of peace i e years in no part of any of which was war actually carried on twentynine was the only number concerning which in the sources of information in question any information could be found in consideration of their being so nearly in agreement with each other and at the same time forming so considerable a majority twenty out of the twentynine are here inserted under the above head of years of ordinary demand in the case of the remaining nine years ranked as will be seen under the contrasted head of years of extra demand—the circumstances of the times not being for any such purpose as the present capable of being subjected to a particular examination—the very circumstance of the superiority of the numbers in so much smaller a number of instances has been regarded as constituting an adequately conclusive proof that in those years respectively there existed some special cause of alarm—either from within or from without or both—of such a nature as to cause the condition of those years to make an approach more or less considerable to the condition of war years how it may be asked—how is it that by preparation for war to be carried on abroad increase should be given to the number of troops employed or provided for home service answer—they are raised and kept at home in readiness to be employed in foreign service and till they are thus employed they are not distinguishable from those destined to no other than home service note that in the very nature of the case to a very considerable amount though it be impossible to say to what amount the number cannot but have been—so from the very first even walpole himself declared it to be—superfluous and excessive the excess having for its cause the principle of the inseparable union

different sets of quotations examples of which are hereinafter likely to be found may be designated shields composed of quotations exhibiting opinions accordant with those here delivered and having for their object the defending those opinions against the scorn or hostile terror of those in whose eyes by the single word innovation be the proposition what it may an objection and that a conclusive one is afforded of these an exemplification has just been seen—monitions composed of quotations from persons who—being absolutely and generally speaking more or less wellinformed as it may have happened—have by one means or other commonly by that presumption which is so natural an accompaniment of power by what means soever obtained—been led into the misadventure of betraying at any rate relative ignorance—by their eagerness to overwhelm with the reproach of ignorance men in inferior situations whose interests and wishes have been regarded as not accordant with theirs as to the quotations employed as shields an intimation given once for all may in this place have its use in the plan itself may be seen the train of reasoning by which i was led to the several particular conclusions in the formation of that train of reasoning no opinions drawn from any external source bore any part hence it is that—unless what regards the narrowness there given to the extent of the electoral franchise be regarded as an exception—in no instance has it happened that the opinions here employed as shields had served in the character of sources of judgment or invention the formation of the opinion having in every instance preceded the discovery of the external support not that i could ever suppose myself exempt from the yoke of that necessity—by which on many of the most important occasions of life all humankind are condemned to speak and to act upon no firmer ground than that of derivative judgment—not that any such continually disproved fancy could ever for a moment have had place in my thoughts—but that on any question or subject those excepted on which a selfformed judgment had been formed by me it has never happened to me to see in my own instance any use in the endeavour to present anything to the public eye ascribing to my own opinion taken by itself as little intrinsic weight as it is possible for any other person to ascribe to it—never giving it as worth anything and by this only means making sure of never giving it for more than it was worth—accordingly so it is that in the reasons subjoined to it by way of support they having been the considerations from which the judgment expressed by it had been deduced—in these reasons may be seen the only claim which i could ever regard any opinions of mine as possessing to the public notice as to innovation—in the instance of every man by whom under that name any proposed measure is held up to view in the character of a just object of horror or terror—let it be judged whether by the importance attached to that universally irrelevant argument an acknowledgment is not made of a sort of incapacity of framing in relation to the subject any selfformed judgment—a sort of incapacity of producing any arguments that are not irrelevant ones of the consciousness of any such sense of incapacity—if not humility at any rate toleration as towards dissentients should be a natural and would be a more becoming result unhappily pertinacity and intolerance are full as apt to have place in the inverse as in the direct ratio of the soundness of the judgment—of the degree in which appropriate intellectual aptitude has place—and of the quantity of appropriate information possessed  so long as in any shape offences having for their object relief from the mischief of misrule are committed—the laws whatever they are that have been made for the punishment of them are thereby proved insufficient and thus it is that for the selfsame offences fresh and fresh laws continually increasing in extent and severity must be made theory as well as practice is not this become already a maxim of government—is not this become the very character of the government lie as you are you are more and more oppressed gradually—seek relief—forcibly or be it ever so peaceably—you are oppressed and crushed suddenly when all hands are cut off lest they should write treason—all eyes put out lest they should read treason—all tongues cut out lest they should speak treason—then it is that the climax of precautionary wisdom will be at an end—yes then indeed but how much earlier not at all unless in some part of this or a future century—as towards the close of the seventeenth—the people—soldiers and all—should become effectually tired of such theory and such practice  existence however it has

vi works of sir william jones by lord teignmouth vol viii p  0 —speech on the reformation of parliament anno      may   —speaking of the feudal system—narrow and base he says as it was and confined exclusively to landed propertya it admitted the lowest freeholders to the due enjoyment of that inestimable right without which it is a banter to call a man free the right of voting in the choice of deputies to assist in making those laws which may affect not his property only but his life and what is dearer his liberty and which are not laws but tyrannous ordinances if imposed on him without his suffrage given in person or by deputation this i conceive to have been the right of every freeholder even by the feudal polity from the earliest time and the statute of henry iv i believe to have been merely declaratory an act which passed in the seventh year of that prince near four hundred years ago ordains that all they who are present at the county court as well suitors duly summoned for the same cause as others shall proceed to the election of their knights for the parliament all suitors you see had the right and all freeholders were suitors in the court however low the value of their freeholds observe all along that one pound in those days was equal to ten at least in the present timeb here then is a plain declaration that minuteness of real property created no harsh suspicion of a dependent mind for a harsh suspicion it is and by proving too much proves nothing thus far sir william jones behold now the words of the statute   henry iv c    after reciting the grievous complaint of the commons in the french original communalté of the undue election of the knights of counties     sometime made of affection of the sheriffs and otherwise against the form of the writs to the great slander of the counties and hindrance retardation of the business of the commonalty in of the said county—it enacts that at the county court after proclamation all they that be there present as well suitors duly summoned for the same cause as others shall attend to the election of the knights for the parliament and then in the full county court they shall proceed to the election freely and indifferently notwithstanding any request or commandment to the contrary and a little after it adds—and in the writs of parliament to be made hereafter this clause shall be put—et electionem tuam in pleno comitatu tuo factam distincte et aperte sub sigillo tuo et sigillis corum qui electioni illi interfuerint nobis in cancellaria nostra ad diem et locum in brevi contentos certifices indilate note that without any distinction made what is here required is—that the seals to be affixed shall be the seals of those—i e of all those—who shall have taken part in the election villeins—composing still no inconsiderable part of the population though it is impossible to say exactly what part being it may be supposed plainly out of the question—who were the persons thus admitted to the exercise of this franchise who but all who were not villeins with the exception of a class of persons happily no longer in existence if this be not virtually universal suffrage—suffrage more extensive than in the case of the householders—by charles fox and mr grey as will soon be seen proposed to be admitted—by the said mr grey now earl grey proposed not to be admitted—if this be not what else can be even as to villeins—were they after all really excluded look to the words clearly not who were the persons by whom the elections were to be made suitors summoned as such and they alone no but all they that be there present well but says somebody in the state of villeinage no will of his own could any person be said to have so much for surmise and but for particular inquiry not an unnatural one well as to the fact eightandtwenty years before the time in question viz anno      was passed the statute   r ii of which c  —a chapter of considerable length—is in the old french—and in the vulgate edition not translated from this statute it appears that already even at that time villeinage was a condition very different from slavery rent did they pay and though instead of money it was in the shape of services yet these services were certain in this statute what is assumed as a general fact is—that they were able to pay a fine to the king besides making satisfaction to their lords the main offence imputed to them is—obtaining liberation from those services by forged deeds the existing copyholders are the posterity of the ancient villeins tenants—the villeins were—the copyholders are—so were they and are they styled—by copy of court roll deriving from the records of the court the title to the lands they occupied what can be more natural than that to that same court they should lie under an obligation—under which it included the liberty—of access and resort to it but supposing any of them present at any such court how is it possible that they should not have been included in the assemblage designated as above by the word others presently in the excessive multitude of the persons resorting to those courts we shall see a fact and the only fact employed in another reign twentyfive years afterwards as a pretence for limiting in those same courts the right of voting to those who possessed in freehold an estate equal in value to £ 0 ayear money of present time but unless copyholders be supposed to have even at that time made a part of it where shall we find matter enough out of which to compose any such excessive multitude true it is blackstone see his considerations on the question concerning copyholders c london      p   applies a limitation to the import of the word other it should be—the french is—autres others confining it to suitors for this surmise however no ground does he give nor of any such or other limitation can i find any intimation given in or by any word or words of the statute—communalte du dit countee says the old french omnes illi qui electioni illi interfuerint says the latin inclosed in it so much for the strong and prosperous reign of henry the fourth in which virtually universal suffrage was then established comes now

examination assured myself of the correctness item whereas the elections of knights of shires to come to the parliaments of our lord the king in many counties of the realm of england have now of late been made by very great outrageous and excessive number of people dwelling within the same counties of the realm of england of the which most part was of people of small substance and or of no value i e worth whereof every one of them pretended a voice equivalent as to such elections to be made with the most worthy knights and esquires dwelling within the same counties whereby manslaughters riots batteries and divisions among the gentlemen and other people of the same counties shall very likely rise and be unless convenient and due remedy be provided in this behalf   our lord the king considering the premises hath provided ordained and stablished by authority of this present parliament that the knights of the shires to be chosen within the said realm of england to come to the parliaments of our lord the king hereafter to be holden shall be chosen in every county of the realm of england by people dwelling and resident in the same counties whereof every one of them shall have free land or tenement to the value of forty shillings by the year at the least above all charges      as to the grounds first as to any supposed deficiency in respect of appropriate intellectual aptitude among those who in the shape of landed property had not so much as  0s ayear of that day—going as far say as £ 0 money of the present day—small indeed probably was the number of those who were able to read how much larger among those who had their  0s and more probably enough very little as for the knights and esquires some few of them not improbably were in those days able to read but by not one of them most certainly was any book to be found from which any information tending to the increase of appropriate intellectual aptitude could be extracted so much for intellectual aptitude now as to freedom of suffrage manslaughters c     what at that time in any one instance had any of these mischiefs really taken place no no such thing is so much as pretended what then oh they will very likely take place unless due remedy be provided aristocracy this—all over but was ever pretence more plainly groundless by the alteration of the value of money the efficiency of the aristocratical principle has in this part of the field of election though no thanks to parliament been somewhat diminished—extent of the right of suffrage somewhat increased but—such as will be seen has been the influence of other causes—that from this extension no real advantage has resulted see what in a following section will be said on the subject of votecompelling and competitionexcluding terrorism on the ground of general utility and propriety—behold moreover the sentiments of charles fox—woodfalls debates anno      p    —there is one position in which we shall all agree that man has a right to be well governed now it is obvious that no people can be satisfied with a government from the constituent parts of which they are excluded in regard to universal suffrage even under that unlimited name we shall find him acceding to it and advocating it upon principle refuting it no otherwise than upon the ground of a supposed matter of fact in relation to which it has been seen and will further be seen the truth is exactly opposite not adverting to the effect of secresy of suffrage the notion on which he here grounds himself is—that in the case of nonhousekeepers in general freedom of suffrage is not to be looked for antecedently to the above passage behold what he says in page    —my opinion is that the best plan of representation is that which shall bring into activity the greatest number of independent voters thereupon it is that immediately he goes on and says—and that that is defective which would bring forth those whose situation and condition takes from them the power of deliberation in this i heartily concur with him but in the next section it will be seen to what this observation leads an observation by which it may be seen ib p     he was led to the disapprobation of giving any extension to the system of county representation a little earlier in the same page i have always says he deprecated universal suffrage not so much on account of the confusion to which it would lead but because i think that we should in reality lose the very object we desire to obtain—it would in its nature embarrass and prevent the deliberative voice of the country from being heard thus far charles fox meaning by reason of the supposed want of freedom as above as to confusion—upon any thing like the plan here proposed all danger of this sort will be seen to be most completely excluded charles fox sat for westminster in the westminster election what confusion do we see yet in the westminster election there remain in abundance natural causes of confusion all which would on the plan in question be completely excluded so much as to what might be and would be but now look at what actually has been anno   0  sir francis burdett was for the first time elected successor to charles fox since then near ten years have elapsed and in all that time no more confusion than if westminster had been a pocket borough see the history of the westminster representation from that time in hones reformists register no   a most interesting picture of the state of purity and good order into which election proceedings not only may be brought but have been brought and in it have already for ten years been continued under a degree of extension so little short of that of universal suffrage in the same sentiments—both as to the general principle and the illgrounded reason for putting it aside—already had he spoken and even still more explicitly in the year      almons parl register anno      p    —his foxs objection to universal suffrage was not distrust of the decision of the majority but because there was no practical mode of collecting such suffrage and that by attempting it what from the operation of hope on some fear on others and all the sinister means of influence that would so certainly be exerted fewer individual opinions would be collected than by an appeal to a limited number therefore holding fast to the right of the majority to decide and to the natural rights of man as taught by the french but much abused by their practice he would resist universal suffrage at that same time mr grey now earl grey though he did not approve of universal suffrage absolutely approved of it—yea and moreover of annual parliaments—comparatively viz in comparison of the existing system woodfalls debates anno      p    —he mr grey did not approve of the duke of richmonds plan of reform though he thought it better than the present system the duke of richmonds plan well what was it—suffrage universal parliaments annual this but

smile if i endeavour— after saying as above he adds—my opinion is that the best plan of representation is that which shall bring into activity the greatest number of independent voters and that that is defective which would bring forth those whose situation and condition takes from them power of deliberation i can have no conception of that being a good plan of election which should enable individuals to bring regiments to the poll i hope gentlemen will not smile if i endeavour to illustrate my position by referring to the example of the other sex in all the theories and projects of the most absurd speculation it has never been suggested that it would be advisable to extend the elective suffrage to the female sex and yet justly respecting as we must do the mental powers the acquirements the discrimination and the talents of the women of england in the present improved state of society knowing the opportunities which they have for acquiring knowledge that they have interests as dear and as important as our own it must be the genuine feeling of every gentleman who hears me that all the superior classes of the female sex of england must be more capable of exercising the elective suffrage with deliberation and propriety than the uninformed individuals of the lowest class of men to whom the advocates of universal suffrage would extend it and yet why has it never been imagined that the right of election should be extended to women why but because by the law of nationsa and perhapsb also by the law of naturec that sex is dependent on ours and because therefore their voices would be governed by the relation in which they stand in society therefore it is sir that with the exception of companies in which the right of voting merely affects property it has never been in the contemplation of the most absurd theorists to extend the elective franchise to the sex a a law which has no existence b perhaps a peremptory exclusion by which one half of the species is excluded from that security for a regard to their interests which in the case of the other half is pronounced indisputable ground of this exclusion—or at least a principal part of that ground—a perhaps c law of nature—another nonentity a too common phrase in the present instance—quere what is at the bottom of it  see the reverend mr belshams observations on the bishop of londons charge anno      † by mr cobbett this topic i observe just now mentioned by himself as having been frequently worked—and if so doubtless with that force and acuteness which might be expected at his hands as well as with that copiousness and diffuseness which is so well adapted to the situation of the bulk of those among whom he has to look for readers  such at any rate in my own view it cannot fail to be for in this state for a long course of years was my own mind—the object a dark and thence a hideous phantom until elicited by severe and external pressure the light of reason—or if this word be too assuming the light of ratiocination—was brought to bear upon it in the plan itself may be seen at what period viz anno   0  fearful of going further—embracing the occasion of finding in derivative judgment an exterior support—i was not only content but glad to stop at the degree of extension indicated by the word householders—taking at the same time for conclusive evidence of householdership the fact of having paid direct taxes but the more frequently my mind has returned itself upon the subject—the more close the application made to it—the more minute the anxiety with which every niche and cranny has been pried into—the stronger has been the persuasion produced—that even from an extent as unbounded as that which would have been given to the principle by the vigorous and laborious and experienced mind of the duke of richmond always with the proviso that by that secresy—which somehow or other he could not bear to look in the face—freedom should be secured—no mischief no danger in any such shape as that which is denoted by the words anarchy or equalization i e destruction of property would ensue in a word not any the smallest defalcation from any rights but those which are universally acknowledged to be mere trustrights—rights the exercise of which ought to be directed to the advancement—not of the separate interests of him to whom they are intrusted but of the joint and universal interest tranquillized on the other hand by the persuasion that although by defalcation after defalcation very considerable reduction were made in respect of extent still no very determinate and distinguishable defalcation might be made from the beneficent influence of the universalinterestcomprehension principle—and that by every extension obtained the way could be smoothed to any such ulterior extensiona the demand for which should in the continued application of that principle guided by the experience of security under the experienced degree of extension have found its due support—with little regret considering the subject in a theoretical point of view and altogether without regret considering it with a view to conciliation and in that sense in a practical point of view—thus it was that without difficulty i found i could accede to the extent indicated by the words householders or directtaxpaying householders due regard being at the same time paid to the arrangements prescribed by the simplification principle as above representation coextensive with taxation—with taxation in every shape oh yes with all my heart no danger to property any more than to person should i apprehend from it for under another description what would this be but the duke of richmonds universal suffrage but the principle—in the principle behold the defect—a principle which is but the product of imagination—of imagination with nothing but itself for its support—a principle not looking to universal interest—not looking to interest in any shape or to any extent—to human feelings in any shape or to any extent—to general utility—to utility in any shape or to any extent—a principle deaf unyielding and inflexible—a principle which will hear of no modification—will look at no calculation—a principle which like that of the rights of man is in its temper a principle of despotism howsoever in its application applied to purposes so diametrically and beneficently opposite coextensive with taxation why this reference this adjustment if instead of imagination reason be consulted the answer is—that by extent coinciding with that of taxation so it happens that in this country all interests are comprehended—deference is paid to practice would accordingly be guided by the principle by which the comprehension of all interests is prescribed good but if in the principle which prescribes the giving admission at once to all interests you were to have a principle which nobody but yourself would listen to what would you be the better for it and if with a principle which in numbers sufficient to carry the question men would listen to and be governed by you were to get a constitution under and by virtue of which for want either of appropriate probity or appropriate intellectual aptitude or both property and liberty would be destroyed—what in this case would you be the better for your principle—would not your condition be still worse—yea much worse—than even at present behold here—for it is well worth beholding—the relation—the instructive relation—between theory and practice—of the goodness of theory the test is in every instance its applicability to practice—good in theory bad in practice—behold in this fallacy—this vulgar fallacy—a contradiction in terms but if theory be recurred to it suffices not that a proposed measure be good in itself—the theory employed in support of it should also be a good one a theory capable of being—and without practical mischief—applied to practice but capable of being without mischief applied to practice it cannot be—if no reference being made by it—no regard paid by it—to human interests or to human feelings—to feelings of pain—to feelings of pleasure—it admits of no modification—no yielding of interest to interest—and thereby of no means of conciliation—of no means of conversion but overbearing despotism the horror and terror with which by the words universal suffrage and annual elections so many uncorrupted breasts are filled—for i speak not here of the case of those in whose instance language and deportment are necessarily prescribed and fashioned by the predominance of sinister interest—these selfdisturbing and dissocial passions—to which object shall we look for the cause of the application thus made of them shall it not be to the weakness—alas the too natural and in a greater or less degree the universal weakness—of yielding too readily to first impressions—of giving the reins to imagination and at the same time to that love of ease which spares itself the labour necessary to close inspection and carefully comprehensive analysis oh yes in the combination of all these cooperating causes may be found power but too sufficient for the production of these and so many other undesirable effects in my own instance well do i remember the time when the principle of universal suffrage howsoever modified presented itself to me as being in a general view inadmissible yes but what time—any time subsequent to that attentive consideration and scrutiny which the importance of the question now so imperiously calls for oh no it was a time at which as yet no purposed attention had on my part ever directed itself to the subject no the closer the attention bestowed the firmer has all along been my conviction—on the one hand of the undangerousness of the principle taken in the utmost extent to which the application of it can ever reach—on the other hand of the facility and consistency with which for the sake of union and concord defalcation after defalcation might—provisionally at any rate and for the sake of experience—quiet and gradual experience—be applied to it as to what concerns the influence of understanding as understanding—in the case here in question the only beneficent the only endurable influence—my own persuasion is—that under the most unbounded universality of suffrage—instead of being annihilated the influence of aristocracy would still be but too great too great i mean with relation to appropriate intellectual aptitude too great not to give admission to many an idle and comparatively unfurnished to the exclusion of a laborious and better furnished mind as far as i have been able to collect it—and i have not been unsolicitous in my endeavours to collect it—the whole stream of experience runs that way in proof or at any rate in illustration of this position—one particular incident which has place in my own remembrance has just been confirmed by cotemporary recollections in the days of wilkes and liberty—among wilkess supporters—and indeed for activity and extent of influence at the head of them—was churchill the apothecary brother to poet churchill election time approaching wilkes himself being for the moment by some incident or other put out of the question—apothecary churchill was proposed an apothecary member for westminster by a loud and general clamour to this effect was the proposition immediately crushed—yet besides that extraordinary personal popularity by which he had been enabled to render such commanding service to the fine gentleman his protégé was this apothecary of the number of those who kept their coaches as to apothecaryship and gentlemanship—for my own part if of two candidates—knowing nothing of either but that one was an apothecary the other a gentleman of £ 0000 ayear—the question were to be asked of me for which will you give your vote my answer would be at once—the apothecary—the apothecary for me—why even because in the mind of the apothecary—the apothecary being to a certain degree known as such—i should be assured of finding intellectual aptitude—intellectual aptitude in the shape and degree corresponding to the exigencies of that eminently useful and respectable profession including the branches of art and science that belong to it—in the first place intellectual aptitude at large and scarcely can it happen but that so it be considerable in degree intellectual aptitude appropriate—appropriate if not with reference to any subject without exception at any rate with reference to the subject here in question—may with more or less facility be acquired the already acquired stock or capital being with more or less advantage capable of being transferred and applied to the newly adopted branch of industry thus much for the apothecary now as to the gentleman this gentleman with his ten thousand ayear—he having been bred up in the expectation of it—on what assignable or maintainable ground could i build an equal or nearly equal expectation of his possessing the requisite intellectual aptitude in any tolerably competent degree in any shape—at any rate in any shape in which it would any part of it possess a tolerable chance of being transferred to this purpose intellectual aptitude—to whatever subject applied—is it not the fruit of labour—is it to be had without labour how then should he have come by it—by the force of what motives shall that of the pain attached to the labour have been overcome a supposing this a speech spoken—hear him hear him would it not at this place be the cry from the opposite

the only man who had the sense and the courage to fight the peoples battle he had proved himself a friend to very extended suffrage and to annual parliaments ii managers who few in number of no political importance whatever—without influencea—even their names unknown to the electors the electors from the long disuse of the elective franchise in the way in which alone it should ever be used had no confidence in each other each man was indeed ready to do his duty yet few reckoned upon the same disposition in their neighbours     iii managers—their mode of canvassing managers to the

assertions made good by proof of individual facts ii— continuance viii on the part of the managers perseverance on the part of the system of uncorruption permanence it is now nearly ten years ago and from that time to this the electors of westminster have kept their steady course while corruption has been obliged to hide its head and to draw in its claws the electors of westminster have since that time reelected sir francis burdett once and lord cochrane twice on the same excellent plan they have had to contend three times in courts of law they have held upwards of thirty public meetings all at their own expense—all too at an expense scarcely exceeding £ 000 in ten years four thousand pounds—scarcely more—even with the drain from the great hall but for the cramming of giants ever refreshed still insatiate—to how much more moderate a sum would not that so astonishingly moderate sum have been reduced ix principalities and powers contended with and vanquished—in westminster are the courts of law—the houses of parliament—the palaces—the admiralty—the pay office—the war and ordnance offices—the treasury—the india board—the great army agents—the barrack office—the navy office—the victualling office—the tax office—the theatres—the opera house—and many other offices and public establishments all of them from their very nature opposed to free election yet in this place—abounding beyond all others in the means and the love of corruption—in this place power was impotent against the people x sophistry thus confuted by fact—westminster has replied by its acts to the calumny of the enemies of reform that the house of commons was corrupt because the people were corrupt the people corrupt forsooth this was the plea of the alarmist muddleheaded jokespinner metaphorhunter and laborious wouldbe deceiver now no more in whose head no one idea was ever clear nor any two ideas consistent the people corrupt forsooth corruption why thus charge it upon the people even because among the men he was addressing he saw—and upon each occasion felt—an eagerness to catch at every pretence for shrouding under a covering of contempt cast on the subjectmany the system of depredation and oppression continually carried on at their expense by the ruling few even because supposing the pretended corruption to be regarded as having its source in that quarter it could not but be regarded as being below the reach of remedy—and reform in every shape and every situation hopeless the aim of this man was to extinguish hope xi contrast between this genuine reform and government shamreform—talk of reformation and economy indeed here are examples of both worthy the contemplation of every man here is no petty retrenchment from unlimited extravagance here is a radical reform in management and in morals at once demonstrating that the people and the people alone are willing and able to do their own business in the best and the least expensive manner xii example set lesson given practicability proved assurance of like success everywhere—westminster at this moment exhibits a fair sample of what the whole people would be if the plan of reform proposed by sir francis burdett were adopted corruption and profligacy would speedily disappear from among them and the profligate and the corrupt would no longer dare to offer themselves as candidates to misrepresent and abuse them then must a man have a character for wisdom and integrity who aspired to the high honour of representing a virtuous a free an intelligent and brave people and then would the wise and the virtuous whose more correct notions of honour keep them out of sight come forward proud to receive real honours from their countrymen and what is there after all in the conduct of westminster which would not instantly be put in practice by the whole people if they possessed even the right of voting enjoyed by the people of westminster nb freedom of suffrage here—freedom to an extent sufficient for the purpose—and yet it may be observed without the protection of secresy true—but though in every other particular a fit example for the whole kingdom in this one it could not be why because in the circumstances in which the population is placed freedom even without the aid of secresy finds a protection such as unless it be in the adjoining metropolis it would in vain look for anywhere else though by the particularly independent condition of the majority of the inhabitants terrorism was vanquished it was not till it had struggled and done its utmost terrorism notwithstanding the majority being so great how much greater might it not have been had terrorism been disarmed by secresy of democracy it is among the peculiar excellencies that to good government in this form nothing of virtue in so far as selfdenial is an ingredient in virtue is necessary such is the case where the precious plant stands alone no upas tree no clump of machineel trees to overhang it but in the spot in question still live and flourish in conjunction both these emblems of misrule here then was and still is and will continue to be a real demand for virtue and here has the demand proved as adam smith would say an effectual one shade of hampden look down and in a host of tradesmen and shopkeepers behold thy yet living and altogether worthy successors a by influence must surely have here been meant—not influence of understanding on understanding the influence exercised by acknowledged wisdom on unexperienced probity—but the vile instrument commonly called and understood by this name viz the influence of will on will—the influence exercised by the double headed beast whose name is terrorism and bribery  gratitude may perhaps here present itself as a motive—which though not of the nature of either terror or bribery may not unfrequently be capable of being productive of the same effect and in so far as this case is considered as exemplified sentimental may be the adjunct employed for the purpose of giving expression to it say sentimental seduction or sentimental seductive influence but in the instances in which at bottom no motive but of the selfregarding kind and that looking to the future viz either hope or fear or a mixture of both has place—gratitude the social motive is a cloak which in so far as any tolerably plausible pretence can be found—and whensoever a favour has been received or supposed to be received it always may be found—is sure to be employed as a covering for the selfregarding motive and even when favours to any amount have been received a selfregarding fear—fear of the reproach of ingratitude—is frequently the cause by which if not the whole a part more or less considerable of the effect is produced on the occasion of election bribery such as in this last case is the mode in which the seductive influence is commonly applied and operates in this way if at all must it operate when the bribe is given beforehand and in this case to the reproach of ingratitude will in common apprehension be added the stronger reproach of improbity viz in the shape of perfidy see springsofaction table as above from the situation of elector turn now to that of representative in the motive of hope with or without fear and with a covering of gratitude more or less sincere may be seen the seductive influence by which in this case under the dominion of c—rgeneral the conduct of members of parliament both houses included is to so vast an extent determined to this case may be referred in a more especial manner the gratitude which has place under the sort of robe the sleeves of which are of lawn when i forsake my king may my god forsake me was the once famed speech of a highseated and notorious profligate to whom for once it seemed good to play the hypocrite but in this case lawn was not the material of the sleeves hope fear gratitude—in such situations generally speaking who but the searcher of hearts can distinguish the proportions in which those affections contribute to the production of the effect still greater is the difficulty as beween gratitude and fear of the reproach of ingratitude when in such a situation the profession of gratitude has anything of sincerity at the bottom of it the stronger the sincerity the more mischievous the gratitude is apt to be why even because the stronger it is the more strenuous the exertions with which it will operate towards the support of the separate and sinister interest as between individual and individual—if in so far as it exercises itself to the benefit of one individual who is the object of it gratitude is a virtue—yet in so far as when exercising itself to the benefit of the one it exercises itself to the injury of any other in so far instead of being a virtue can it be anything better than a vice much more if as between an individual and the whole community exercised to the still greater injury of the universal interest gratitude by which at the expense of the universal interest the private interest of the c—rgeneral is served—is this a virtue yes if stealing money out of the exchequer or the bank to slip it into the privy purse would be a virtue—not otherwise behold a man eightandthirty years in parliament threeandthirty of those years in office in all those threeandthirty years—not to speak of the other five—though the measures of the monarch were ever so mischievous never in any instance failing to give his vote not to speak of his speeches in support of them and in a life of him written in lawn sleeves by a brother of the right honourable person in question this habit as will be seen placed to the account of virtue in respect of extent as well as malignity see the character of this mischief admirably displayed in an edinburgh review of the last year or last but one but in this place the matter is too apposite as well as too impressive to be sufficiently put to use by a mere reference lord viscount barringtons life by his brother the bishop of durham pp     to     time that of the american war in october      letter to the king desiring leave to resign no notice taken june        for the first time conversation on the subject with the king in his closet year of lord barringtons age the sixtieth—of his official service the thirtyfirst hear lord barrington this from his own manuscript—many difficulties i answered p     in respect to the house of commons were of the most serious kind as they affected my conscience and my character i have said i my own opinions in respect to the disputes with america i give them such as they are to ministers in conversation as in writing i am summoned to meetings where i sometimes think it my duty to declare them openly before perhaps twenty or thirty persons and the next day i am forced either to vote contrary to them or to vote with an opposition which i abhor viz not thatparticular opposition alone but every opposition whatsoever in whatsoever case and on whatsoever ground acting judge whether this be not true view him in the year of his age the twentyninth of his parliamentary service the fifth or sixth p    anno      then it is that to his perfect astonishment he discovers that in that one instance opposition in parliament had given a certain degree of encouragement to rebellion as if it were possible that where rebellion is in contemplation opposition could in that place by any possibility be made without contributing more or less to that effect thus made the discovery profound as we see it suffices of itself to produce on his part a determination never to be in opposition in any case whatsoever and to this determination for such a number of years together—the whole time against his most decided judgment—to the support of one of the most tyrannical and disastrous measures—disastrous—to the wouldbeenslaving country yes but to the country intended to be enslaved how felicitous—ever contemplated he most heroically adheres speaking of the rebellion in      he had seen says his right reverend biographer and panegyrist—he had seen with some degree of remorse how much the conduct of opposition had encouraged that enterprise he perceived continues he that appeals to the people against the parliament and the government contribute towards anarchy and that ministers are more frequently deterred from right than from wrong measures by the apprehension of opposition possibly continues he some may think that his having an employment in administration might have contributed to his adopting these sentiments being once however offered to his mind the force and truth of them became irresistible yes—the truth of them says the good lord bishop behold then the scrupulous viscount with his tender conscience thus according to his own showing was this man and for so many years together in the unvaried habit of voting against his own conscience—contributing in one of the most influential situations to the commission of legally dismurdered murders to speak according to his opinion committed in the wholesale way and why only because had his votes been given according to his conscience and against these murders he would have seen other votes operating in aid of his and contributing to the efficiency of his by being given in favour of the only system his conscience could approve of after this comes the determination expressed to the king over and over and over again—the determination thus to continue voting—and at the head of the war department as well as in parliament acting to this effect against his conscience and this to the end of his days unless and until it should please his majesty to consent to his ceasing so to do p     june  st     —your majesty knows the very bottom of my mind if after that you order me to remain as i am i will obey you i find i cannot force myself from you and whenever i go your majesty must voluntarily tell me that i may leave you after as well as before this from p     to     see passages reporting conversations or letters out of number all to this effect the king thanked me warmly viz for continuing to operate towards the perpetration of the dismurderized murders against the declared dictates of his conscience and said continues his lordship it was impossible to act a more handsome part than i had done throughout thus it went on the king still refusing dismission—permission to act according to conscience the war secretary still obsequious till almost three years after the date of the letter by which for the cause in question the desire to resign was made known the   th december      on which day with this lesson before his eyes mr jenkinson father to the present earl of liverpool to whom his paternal care could not but have transmitted it kissed hands as successor to the present earl who on the   th june   0  cobbetts debates p  0   from long deliberate and mature consideration said i am convinced that the disfranchisement of the smallest borough     would eventually destroy the constitution—nb on this same  st june      p     king to lord barrington—i will give you a mark of my favour at parting but i wish much to keep you at present c and during all this conflict betwixt gratitude and loyalty on the one side and conscience on the other the quantum of this mark of favour remained to be determined it was settled at £ 000 ayear pension kings letter to lord barrington in terminis p     until says the letter he shall be appointed to some other employment thus much for king and ministers now for bishop—perhaps says he p     the reader may be disposed to interrupt my narrative by observing that if lord barrington objected to the general system which administration had adopted and which they continued to act upon notwithstanding his remonstrances it was his duty to have resigned his appointment and not to have taken any further part in measures which he disapproved the answer is in itself complete as soon as lord barrington found these measures would be persevered in he tendered his resignation but he did it in that candid and consistent manner which became lord barrington he did not make his difference of sentiment the subject of appeal to the public favoura or the means of thwarting national efforts and embarrassing the king and his ministers but he submitted it in a private letter to his majesty as early as with propriety he could in the beginning of october      and he renewed his instances until his retirement from public life could be permitted without inconvenience to his majesty or to the interest of the public behold in this one frame three portraits—the kings the ministers and the bishops—drawn by the pious hand of the original of one of them in these three behold moreover a amily picture of matchless constitution—monarchy and aristocracy above sham democracy beneath—a slave crouching under both but the sample afforded by this triad is a favourable sample the king a bettermost kind of king the peer and warminister a bettermost kind of peer and minister the bishop a bettermost kind of bishop all agreeing in this viz that when a king is pleased to express a wish be it even ever so faint a one no part but obedience can be left to conscience note well this from among the bettermost sort what would be to be expected from the ordinary sort answer exactly what we are now experiencing these portraits from a partial pencil—what if from an impartial one walk in and see church and king—walk in and see church and state after this what need can there be of libels this if it were not the work of a bishop would it not in itself be the quintessence of all libels—a libel on everything that is most excellent—a libel accompanied with the most flagitious of all aggravations—the matters of fact unquestionably true behold legitimacy in puris naturalibus behold not only passive obedience and nonresistance but active obedience—active obedience to the monarch whatsoever be his measures—professed and preached without reserve if—by any form given to language thus speaking in generals—it be possible that any more profligate servility should be inculcated any more profligate despotism invited one should be curious to see it and while the pen is writing this comes from durham the intelligence by which a practical comment on this theory is brought to view turn back now to section  —one more glance at westminster election management behold there democracy—representative democracy—in its lowest stage not as in america erect and independent but as in britain ever threatened and ready to be crushed say now whether property is probity say whether kingship is probity say whether peership is probity say whether bishopship is probity say whether—if every one of these is probity—tradesmanship probity as exemplified for these ten years past in westminster is not worth all such other probities put together a learn hence that

other had as it seemed to them been for a long time in use to be derived well not many years ago by the mere force of terrorism—competitionexcluding terrorism—in the hands of an as yet untried competitor was this man driven from the seat that seat which with the effect just mentioned he had so long filled and this seat what was it it was one of the two seats filled by the county of yorkshire a county by the exorbitant amplitude of which the joint power of landholding and pursebrandishing terrorism are swelled to a maximum £  0000 i have heard mentioned as the sum which on the occasion of one election was expended by one only of the two victorious competitors for the two seats but the victory had conquest—complete conquest—for its fruit the condition of a proprietory borough—a proprietory borough held in jointtenancy—such is the condition to which that vast county inclosing in its bosom three large counties called ridings is reduced this is not all for by the same instrument by which the disease is produced and fixed is all remedy barred out petition—if it aim at any thing better than the continuance of the disease by this same instrument is petition nipped in the bud and thus it is that so long as between the two high allies peace and union shall continue to flourish the peace of the county for such is the appropriate phrase remains secure the peace of yorkshire secured and by the same instrument which under the auspices of the newinvented christianity is with such irresistible effect occupying itself in the giving security to the peace of europe in the debates moreover traces are not altogether wanting of the impression made by the experience of terrorism and that in its several shapes of votecompelling influence competitionrepellingandexcluding influence in the hands of peers and competitionrepellingandexcluding influence in the hands of the crown with which are mixed indications of the existence and degree of the undue dependence in which nominees are held by proprietory and other possessors of seats under the name of patrons more particularly peers contrasted with the absence of due dependence as towards electors in the small number of instances in which in the whole assemblage of those by whose suffrages a seat or a pair of seats are filled suffrages completely free are in any proportion to be found behold accordingly in this note the following instructive particulars—  by earl grey at that time mr grey a peerage not as yet in any near prospect the existence of terrorism recognised and in so far as exercised by peers not approved of   by charles fox the part borne by terrorism in the filling of the county seats recognised and therefore the extension of the number of those seats not approved of   by charles fox the

at that time mustered parl reg anno      p     mr grey now earl grey—  mr grey remarked that when mr pitt moved for an addition of  00 members to be added to the counties he could not carry his motion and yet he had contrived to procure the nomination of forty members by indirect means for he had added to the house of peers thirty members who either nominated directlya or by irresistible influenceb that number of members of the house of commons as appeared from the petitions then on the table and which the petitioners were ready to prove woodfalls debates anno      p    —charles fox—  i submit however to the good sense and to the personal experience of gentlemen who hear me if it be not a manifest truth that influence depends almost as much upon what they have to receive as upon what they have to pay whether it does not proceed as much from the submission of the dependent who has a debt to pay as on the gratitude of the person whose attachment they reward and if this be true in the influence which individuals derive from the rentals of their estates and from the expenditure of that rental how much more so it is true of government who both in the receipt and expenditure of this enormous revenue are actuated by one invariable principle that of extending or withholding favour in exact proportion to the submission or resistance to their measures which the individuals make woodfalls debates anno      p    —charles fox—  a noble lord says that the county representation must be good—that must be approved of be it so this proposes to leave the county representation where it is i wish so to leave it i think that representation ought to be of a compound nature the counties may be considered as territorial representation as contradistinguished from popular but in order to embrace all that i think necessary i certainly would not approve of any further extension of this branch of the representation   woodfalls debates anno      p    —charles fox—there is one class of constituents whose instructions it is considered as the implicit duty of members to obey when gentlemen represent popular towns and cities then it is disputable whether they ought to obey their voice or follow the dictate of their own conscience but if they happen to represent a noble lord or a noble duke then it becomes no longer a question of doubt he is not considered as a man of honour who does not implicitly obey the orders of his single constituent he is to have no conscience no liberty no discretion of his own he is sent here by my lord this or the duke of that and if he does not obey the instructions that he receives he is not to be considered as a man of honour and a gentleman such is the mode of reasoning that prevails in this house is this fair is there any reciprocity in this conduct is a gentleman to be permitted without dishonour to act in opposition to the sentiments of the city of london or the city of westminster or of bristol but if he dares to disagree with the duke or lord or baronet whose representative he is then he must be considered as unfit for the society of men of honour this sir is the chicane and tyranny of corruption and this at the same time is called representation in a very great degree the county members are held in the same sort of thraldom a number of peers possess an overweening interest in the country and a gentleman is no longer permitted to hold his situation than as he acts agreeably to the dictates of those powerful families let us see how the whole of this stream of corruption has been diverted from the side of the people to that of the crown—with what a constant persevering art every man who is possessed of influence in counties corporations or boroughs that will yield to the solicitations of the court is drawn over to that phalanx which is opposed to the small remnant of popular election i have looked sir to the machinations of the present minister in that way and i find that including the number of additional titles the right honourable gentleman has made no fewer than one hundred and fifteen peers in the course of his administration that is to say he has bestowed no fewer than one hundred and fifteen titles including new creations and elevations from one rank to anothera how many of these are to be ascribed to national services and how many to parliamentary interests i leave the house to inquire the country is not blind to the arts of influence and it is impossible that we can expect men to continue to endure them in the statesman for february         authenticated by the signature of major cartwright may be seen a statement in these words—the writer has seen a very numerous troop of tenants holding under a placeman and sinecurist conducted to a county election as swine are conducted to market one steward in the front and another in the rear as one hogdriver goes before the herd and another follows after to regulate the drift and prevent straggling thus far the worthy father of radical reform from the nature of the two corresponding situations coupled with the circumstance of the two stewards one behind as well as another before let any one judge whether the surmise is

within my knowledge in which in any published work any indication has been given of this circumstance in the character of an imperfection attached to the constitution in its present state is that which is afforded by a passage in mr wakefields account of ireland vol ii p     in it after mention made of two names—think says he what must be the character and complexion of the constitution of this country in so far as concerns the commons house of parliament when for such a length of time as they have been in existence neither of those names has ever been found in the list of the members of this house of those persons one was mr arthur young the other was a person with whom otherwise than by reputation mr wakefield had not any acquaintance—and of whom it is sufficient to say that from early youth throughout the whole course of his life—even at that time anno      not a short one—his time had been almost exclusively devoted to the endeavour to meliorate the condition of his fellowcreatures in all countries but more particularly his own by labour as unremitted as it could not but be thankless applied to the field of legislation  the pace at which in virtue of such a series of antecedent impulses they saw the chariot of the state descending towards the gulph was not yet rapid enough to satisfy the impatience of the phaëtons from whom it receives its guidance behold one instance in which on the spur of the occasion to give redoubled energy to the indefatigable arm the surtout of common decency was cast off as being a needless incumbrance a bill for the

boldness of a lord folkestone to read this character in it belongs to any man to whom the words of it are not unreadable would you form an adequate conception of the anxiety by which on this occasion that honourable house was agitated read it in the anxiety expressed—not to say betrayed—by the right honourable gentleman who is the head of it bursting the bond of those delicacies which but six days before june  st had produced the wellconsidered and elaborate declaration of the reluctance by which down to that time he had been restrained from mixing in the debates—twice in one day—viz on the  th of that same month—did he stand up and insist that the word express that being the word employed for the grant of the licence included in the monopoly should be inserted inserted—and upon what grounds on grounds to which the absence of all grounds would surely have been in so small degree an advantageous substitute in the determination of honourable house to establish the monopoly at that time—in that determination which he was thus labouring to produce—he saw an earnest of their determination to abolish it as soon as the occasion should require and in an imagined rule of common law already punishing the practice with an adequate punishment in both cases he saw a sufficient reason for adding a regulation of statute law for punishing it in the one and for refusing to add it in the other of those same casesa a cobbetts debates june     0  xiv    —the speaker stated his wish on the first view to extend the provisions of this bill to the purchase of seats in parliament as well by office as by money the great rule was—to strike at the prominent and most flagrant points of offence amongst those most certainly was the proof of an express contract these he would state always impressed him with the conviction that this species of traffic whether carried on by implied or express covenants was an offence against the law of parliament and in his opinion punishable as a misdemeanor at common law it was fully within the power of the house to provide any future enactments against any future offences which in the course of the operation of this measure might subsequently arise mr ponsonby with considerable diffidence in his own opinion when opposed to the very high authority of the speaker still contended that the insertion of the term express in a declaratory act of parliament conveyed the interpretation that the penalty attached to express agreements and that all of an indirect nature came not within its operation the speaker considered that the resolutions of that house in      bore fully upon a traffic carried on by an implied contract and therefore he saw no reason to oppose the proposed clause as now worded  yet by charles fox as hath been seen could the supposed impracticability of uniting freedom with universality of suffrage be urged in the character of an objection—and that though the only one a conclusive one—against the giving any such extent to the right of suffrage  in this case what may perhaps be observed is—that under the check thus applied the will to which he gives effect is not his own will any more than under the check applied by individual terrorism true but here though it is not his own will it is the only proper will which is still better to give effect to that will the effectuation of which is in the highest degree subservient to the public interest in question—this is the only ultimate end in relation to this ultimate end the giving effect to his own private and individual will as governed by his own private and individual interest or supposed interest is but a means be the means what it may that which the public service in respect of the public interest in question requires is that when the means in question i e that which is proposed in the character of a means is really subservient to the end then it should be employed—when it is not thus subservient then it should not be employed † say in a number equal to the average of the number of those who since the irish union have had seats in the house—army and navy officers nominated of course by the monarch officers—not as now engaged in active service thence in a line of duty with the fulfilment of which the fulfilment of that of a member of the commons house would if constancy of attendance as hereinafter proposed were effectually enforced be incompatible—but veterans who their service in their respective lines being at an end would—to a body of professional experience superior to that which at present under the dispensations of blind chance is afforded by the average of all characters and all ages—add a degree of leisure such as would not present a demand for any abatement from the most perfect constancy of attendance these

which they were respectively regarded as being in a peculiar degree qualified to afford choice of these uniforms behold here an exercise—nor that it is humbly supposed altogether an unacceptable one—for the taste and talents of the prince regent in the situation here proposed the use of an appropriate uniform seems rather more obvious than in those situations of a nonmilitary nature in which uniforms it is said are already in use  like queries in the case of a chancellor supreme judge in a judicatory in which immediately or through the channel of patronage he pays himself by fees the aggregate amount increasing with the aggregate of individual bankruptcy and public misery produced or increased by war—in the case of the judge of a prize court paying himself and co in like manner—the aggregate amount of the fees depending altogether upon war—chancellor and judge strenuous from first to last in the support given to war by vote eloquence and influence think of this and then say whether under a government so formed in looking for the causes of war commencement and continuance the eye need to convey itself to any unmeasurable distance like queries in the case of a judge sitting in a superior situation to judge of the propriety in each individual case and in the aggregate of fees received to his own use in a subordinate situation—and in another place with transparent yet ever prevailing fallacies on his lips and flame and fury in his eyes slapping the door in the face of every measure in which the vast majority of the people behold the only possibility left to them of obtaining so much as a chance for justice—see scotch reform and protest against law taxes think as often as war—and the causes and the profit and loss by it—come in question—think whether in any company—private or even mixed—it be a frequent occurrence to meet with an officer in any branch of the military service who makes any scruple of declaring his wishes to see war commence or if already in existence continued—and unless it be in the article of frankness whether there be any reason for supposing human nature to be in this respect different in the one of those situations from what it is in the other if on any such occasion from general rules the inquiry should descend to individual cases then would naturally come the question whether in the individual instance or instances in question there be any such known contempt of money as in such instances respectively to take the individual case out of the general rule  see section xvi moderate reform c † see above

stronger in proportion as this inquiry advances to complete any such task as that of collecting it would require abundantly more time not only than at the present conjuncture but moreover than at any future time out of the small expectable remnant of my life it would be possible for me to spare if to any person who has sufficient leisure it should appear that in regard to the whole or any part of this mass of information the search would afford a sufficient promise of being productive of adequate use—the consciousness of rendering to the public that service will be his reward and if for the purpose of enabling me to give to the stock so collected such useful application as may be in my power he will have the goodness to communicate it to me by letter—he will be the object of an inward sentiment of esteem and gratitude in the breast of a man from whom no exterior demonstrations of it can in the vulgar signification of the word be of use to any one under such heads as the above with

subjects viz for standing armies and demand for revolution as well as annual parliaments behold the opinions of dr swift—opinions not thrown out on the sudden for a party purpose or in the heat of debate but in a state of retirement after a long course of experience in the very arcana of politics and a long course of subsequent reflections on the subject of that experience—poured forth into the bosom of a most confidential friend from balfours edition of popes works edinburgh      vol vi p    —from dr swift to mr pope letter v dublin january  0    0 —you will perhaps be inclined to think that a person so illtreated as i have been must at some time or other have discovered very dangerous opinions in government—in answer to which i will tell you what my political principles were in the time of her late glorious majesty which i never contradicted by any action writing or discourse   as to what is called a revolution principle my opinion was this—that whenever those evils which usually attend and follow a violent change of government were not in probability so pernicious as the grievance we suffer under a present power then the public good will justify such a revolution and this i took to have been the case in the prince of oranges expedition although in the consequences it produced some very bad effects which are likely to stick long enough by us i had likewise in those days a mortal antipathy against standing armies in times of peace because i always took standing armies to be only servants hired by the master of the family for keeping his own children in slavery and because i conceived that a prince who could not think himself secure without mercenary troops must needs have a separate interest from that of his subjects—although i am not ignorant of those artificial necessities which a corrupted ministry can create for keeping up forces to support a faction against the public interest as to parliaments i adored the wisdom of that gothic institution which makes them annual and i was confident our liberty could never be placed upon a firm foundation until that ancient law were restored among us for who sees not that while such assemblies are permitted to have a longer duration there grows up a commerce of corruption between the ministry and the deputies wherein they both find their accounts to the manifest danger of liberty which traffic would neither answer the design nor expense if parliaments met once ayear well now who was this dr swift an ignorant wild visionary enthusiast a jacobin an atheist † for the difference in this and all other particulars as between trienniality and annuality see section    moderate reform c  see barringtons observations on the ancient statutes  of parliamentary acts ordaining the annual or oftener than annual holding of parliaments—by the researches above mentioned three other instances have been found over and above those which are to be seen in the current editions of the statute book these are—  one in henry the thirds reign anno         h iii seven years anterior to that         h iii in which for the first time deputies from boroughs were summoned viz by simon de montfort reference for this is to rymers fædera and annales monasterii burtonensis—  one in edward the seconds reign anno        ed ii lately published statutes of the realm i     cap       these two anterior to those printed in the common statute books viz among the statutes of edward the third—  one posterior to ditto viz in richard the seconds reign anno        r ii for which see brady and the monkish historian walsingham anterior to the year         h iii in which deputies from boroughs were first summoned viz by the rebel simon de montfort comes a year     —   h iii in which writs are by the king sent to the sheriffs of counties commanding them to return each of them four knights brady—parliamentary history—report on the public records in several of the instances in which parliamentary sessions more than one appear to have been held in the compass of the same year—the evidence by which the diversity of the parliament will be made apparent consists of divers existing lists of members returned to serve in parliament in one and the same year by and for one and the same county city or borough  prosperous as it was in all transactions with foreign powers the long reign of elizabeth see neales history of the puritans by toulmin was a reign of grievous oppression to all those who would not sacrifice to her thirst for power the religious part of their consciences those who with such undisturbed complacency view the majority so long since established little think by how grievous a course of oppression it was obtained the state of scotland shows what had it not been for that oppression would in that respect have been the state of england  for the immediate subjectmatter of this analysis see mr meadlys paper as reprinted in the appendix to this work  on turning to the document from which this article in mr meadleys paper here reprinted was taken viz cobbetts parl deb xvii p     debate of may   st    0 i find that in the plan on that day brought forward by the hon t brand one proposed arrangement was that the right of voting should be given to all householders paying parochial and other taxes the reason for the mention thus made of it in this place is—that in that paper reprinted from mr meadleys it will not be to be found i hope not to find any other occasion for regretting my inability pressure of time considered to make the like reference to the sources in every one of the other instances on the other hand as to this modification of the householder plan—it appears not that it entered into mr brands design to make application of it in any other instance than that of the populous and at present unrepresented towns to which it was his design to give seats to the counties it seems pretty clear that it was not the design of this gentleman any more than it had been earl greys that the advance thus made towards virtually universal suffrage should be extended  taking the representation upon its present footing—one feature it possesses which in the way here in question is eminently prejudicial—and in the instance of which whatsoever use it may have had has for centuries been in great measure if not altogether obsolete this is all over england—in the case of the counties without exception—and in the case of the boroughs with no more than five exceptions—the having two seats filled by one such territorialelectoral district to this sort of duplicity i know not whether any rational cause has anywhere been assigned was it for provision against sickness—was it that in their negociations with the crown the fidelity of each agent might find a safeguard in that of the other note that by the want of the press and even of the pen the negociations in question were rendered comparatively secret and unchecked suppose each county divided—though it were into no greater a number of districts than two with a seat allotted to each—here would be some advance made towards practical equality of suffrage as above explained here would be some advance but that advance still far from adequate under moderate reform—it appears not that even this first step towards the equality in question has ever found favour among the advocates of these modes by mr brand in particular—by mr brand whose edition of moderate reform seems to have come nearest to radical—the idea of thus dividing counties is brought forward and rejected but in the circumstance by the consideration of which this rejection is stated—stated as having been produced—i cannot relation had to the great end as above explained discover any determinate inconvenience the result which in the speech ascribed to that gentleman is stated as the ultimate inconvenience is—that on such a plan some inhabitant of a town comprised in the county—in contradistinction to some inhabitant of the country part of that same county—would be generally returned so far the honourable gentleman but under a system of free suffrage supposing this result to take place no inconvenience can i find in it neither the inhabitant of the country part nor the inhabitant of the town part would be chosen unless by the majority of the electors he were deemed fitter than any other person they could choose and so long as they chose the fittest person that was to be had whether a town or the country were the seat of his residence would for any reason i can see be a matter of complete indifference in the next place no cause can i discover adequate to the production of that same result the freeholders of the town says mr brand would uniformly prevail over the freeholders of the county because they could almost always outnumber them at an election yes at present while the only territorial districts viz the counties are most of them with reference to this not to speak of other purposes so excessively extensive yes under the existing state of things scarcely however it should seem in the state of things which be himself proposes hertfordshire for arguments sake he supposes to be divided into four districts but so small is the extent of that county—divide it into four practically equal districts and in a central spot of each place the pollbooth—small indeed would be the number of the electors that by remoteness from that spot would one should think find themselves practically excluded from the exercise of their right of suffrage  for the sake of distinction and clearness of conception—for any such districts as for the purpose of the more commodious collecting of the votes may be proposed to be carved out of the electoral districts i employ the appellation of subdistricts understanding all along by electoral districts those which correspond to and in number agree with the number of the seats—or in contradistinction to the electoral districts these subdistricts might be termed voting districts to express what is here expressed by dividing the country into districts some of them in the ensuing plan territorial others population districts—the phrase employed by an honourable gentlemana is making the returns by districts to express what is here expressed by voting or collecting the votes in subdistricts to be called voting districts he says taking the votes by districts the occasions—for speaking of the districts which upon the plan in question would have to correspond with the number of the seats presenting themselves so continually—hence the necessity of providing a name to speak of them by as to the phrase employed by the honourable gentleman—though the propriety of it may be considered as unexceptionable yet as it affords not any name for the thing i had such frequent occasion to bring to view it could not on every occasion be rendered applicable to my purposes nor indeed till after some little expense in the way of attention was the state of things which it presents brought within my view a mr brand—cobb deb xvii    —anno    0 may     cobbetts debates xvii    —may       0—annual parliaments would be found exceptionable from the shortness of the period by leaving the representative too little accustomed to business to be competent to his duties in that house  cobbetts debates xvii   0—may       0—hon t brand—other gentlemen might consider other objections to the existing state of the representation of the people of more importance and particularly that respecting the duration of parliaments upon this question he had bestowed much and earnest attention and he found it one of enormous difficulty but of extreme interest and equal importance septennial parliaments had a tendency from the length of their term to weaken the relation between the elector and the representative and to shake the dependence of the one upon the other—while annual parliaments would be found not less exceptionable from the shortness of the period by leaving the representative too little accustomed to business to be competent to his duties in that house and from the too frequent recurrence to the troubles and contests of parliamentary elections the one term was too long to please the people and the other too short to satisfy the members he for his own part would be inclined to take a middle course between the extremes of annual and septennial parliaments and to recommend triennial parliaments which without the evils of either would possess all the advantages of both advantage to the member yes—plain enough advantage to the people still to seek but mind this—members interest set in the balance against the peoples interest and the scales it should seem hang even consider however where this was spoken the supposition that when set against the interests of those trustees of the people the interest of the principals should suffice to make the scales hang even—hazarded in that place a supposition to any such effect was it not a daring one by the honourable gentleman the question had been found—thus frankly he confesses—one of enormous difficulty but of extreme interest and equal importance of enormous difficulty—of extreme interest o yes no doubt it had but the difficulty where did it lie in the interest and in what interest in the interest of the members all this while let it not be forgotten that—to keep out improbity—corruptionhunting improbity—is the capital object as to appropriate active talent a case may be conceived in which taken in a certain degree of abundance the effect of it may upon the whole be found—not only not of a beneficial but in some respects and in a certain degree of a positively prejudicial nature the desire to take a share in the speaking part of the business or even in the writing part—suppose it to be to a certain degree extensive and intense an inconvenience of a sort above noted on another occasion viz useless and excessive consumption—waste in a word of so precious an article as time—disposable official time—may be the result this considered—only for the sake of giving increase to the number of the individuals duly qualified to become objects of choice and thence increasing the probability of the best choice—is aptitude in respect of that one of the three elements an object to be desired and aimed at not so in regard to appropriate intellectual aptitude considered as distinct from appropriate active talent—in respect of this element inconvenience not being either in the shape of waste of time or in any other shape liable to be produced by any degree of abundance—excess cannot here by any possibility find place on the other hand only in the event of its prevailing to a certain extent will deficiency—even in respect of this great and to a certainty innoxious endowment—be productive of any practical—of anything more than a theoretical—a hypothetical—in a word of any real—inconvenience on the part of a decided majority of the population of the house—say on the part of the great majority—suppose for arguments sake that in every instance the votes respectively given are on the right side—on this supposition it matters not whether the rectitude has for its cause a right selfformed judgment a right derivative judgment or even supposing it concealed from public eye the most perfect imbecility of judgment—imbecility—kept in this last instance in the path of rectitude by the hand of chance  the passage as reported not being altogether clear of ambiguity here follow the words—above

regnant and a prince regent not to speak of williams mary who in name was a queen regnant with her husband but in authority as expressly declared a queen consort and nothing more had the princess charlotte survived her father her grandfather being still alive she might have added to the list a fourth species of monarch—a princess regent—protector being an unpopularised denomination—unpopularised first by richard who became king richard the third then by cromwell—is already a fourth species of monarch but a species not very likely to be revived precision such as this is not to the taste of the man of law monarch would in his eyes be an innovation the use of the word a mark of theory and ignorance he will not so long as he can help it part with the profitable wit of saying upon occasion that a man and a woman are the same person or of contending according as the vane of professional or official interest points upon some occasions that a queen is a king upon others that she is not and so in regard to princes and princesses regent  it is in pursuance of the custom generally observed in parliamentary bills that the word thus designative of quantity is inclosed in brackets so it will be in many other places in bills as prepared for the house the space between the brackets is left in blank the blanks are filled up at a particular stage and then is the time for the settling of the quantities in the present draught the blanks will in several other places besides this be seen filled up the design of this was—to aid conception the brackets show that the fixation was not considered as definitive † for greater clearness here follows an exemplification of a votemaking certificate when filled up names of persons being of course feigned names— election district st georges polling district out ward this is a votemaking certificate made to serve for the ensuing parliament which is to meet on the  st day of january in the year      the day on which it is made is the   d of october      the person to whom it is to give a vote is george simpson arabella row no  0 the persons by whose declarations as hereinafter expressed this certificate and thereby the vote are given are we whose names and descriptions are here by our several hands respectively immediately underwritten in the alphabetical order of our surnames viz jackson thomas arabella row no    householder and carpenter householder within the abovementioned election district for upwards of twentysix weeks ending this day laleham samuel james street no  0 householder and glazier householder within the abovementioned election district for upwards of twentysix weeks ending this day williams joseph james street no  0 householder and carpenter householder within the abovementioned election district for upwards of twentysix weeks ending this day that which we hereby certify is—that according to the several true declarations following as contained in the nine numbered paragraphs following he the said george simpson is entitled to give a vote in the polling district above mentioned on the election of a member to serve for the election district above mentioned in the abovementioned ensuing parliament i at the house of samuel laleham above written on the day above written on or about eleven of the clock in the forenoon we whose names and descriptions are above written did write them to wit each of us his own name and description in the sight and at the same time in the hearing of the two others ii in our sight and hearing is now present the abovementioned george simpson his name and description his name being herein and now immediately written by his own hand here follows to wit george simpson glazier arabella row no  0 inmate in the household whereof the abovementioned samuel laleham is householder iii he declares to us that in the abovementioned household to wit arabella row no  0 for upwards of four weeks together ending with the commencement of this day   d of october      he has been an inmate it is our belief that this his declaration is true iv he declares to us that he is upwards of    years of age it is our belief that this his declaration is true v in the sight and hearing of all of us together he has read aloud the whole of the printed part of this certificate vi also divers lines pitched upon by us at random in the act of parliament by which this certificate is required vii it is the sincere belief of every one of us that the lines so pitched upon by us were really read by him and that they had not any of them been committed by him to memory for the purpose of their falsely appearing to be read they were not in any part repeated by him from the mouth of any other person viii from the manner of his reading as above we do believe him capable of reading any portion of the new testament as printed in the english language ix he has in like manner in our presence signed the declaration following—i do hereby seriously deliberately and solemnly declare and promise to my fellowcountrymen as follows— declaration—  when at the approaching election by means of this certificate i have given my vote i never will declare nor otherwise endeavour to make known to any person whatsoever directly or indirectly either for or against what proposed member such my vote was given   should any question be ever put to me any one word said to me or any sign made to me having for its object the causing me so to make known my vote every such question word or sign i shall consider as the law considers it as an attempt at oppression i do hereby declare that under the sense of such oppression no more reliance ought to be placed on anything i say than if the same were addressed by me to a robber or to a person insane for the purpose of saving from immediate destruction my own life or that of some person dear to me witness my hand george simpson here ends the exemplification of a filledup votemaking certificate of the direction for giving the alphabetical order to the names of the certifiers the use is to prevent dispute whether from mutual civility or from claim of right  to prevent the votes of the resident voters from being in particular districts outnumbered by soldiers or sailors stationed with or without such design in large bodies † this degree of particularity promises it is believed to be of considerable use by fixing the attention of the persons in question to these several points of appropriate aptitude and thereby taking the chance of preventing men by fear of shame from giving their recommendation to a person eminently and notoriously deficient in any one of these points or manifestly inferior to a rival candidate in all of them taken together lower than this mark in the scale of particularity it might not be easy to descend without giving advantage to this or that particular party and thus giving to this instrument the effect of a test act tyranny and corruption under the mask of religion might for example introduce orthodoxy and thus keep the most conscientious characters out of the house and force the poison of insincerity into the mouths and hearts of others the oaths and other engagements with which the statutebook swarms are with few if any exceptions a great deal worse than useless either they have this exclusionary effect or by their emptiness and looseness they afford to those who have taken them the pretence of acting under a sense of obligation while no such sense is in their hearts hear a judge talk of his oath what is that oath a piece of old womans tattle that is never seen by anybody means nothing and has nothing in it that can have any tendency to bind anybody o yes one thing it has and that is—a promise never to take a money fee of anybody but this he breaks in the face of day and most days of his life and thus it is that in the teeth of magna charta he denies justice to all but the rich and makes them pay him for it  for the reason why all other disqualifications would here be useless see those which apply to the case of electors in section   as to females the disqualification stands upon grounds quite different in the two cases in the situation of member mischievous no less than obvious would be the absurdity of an intermixture betwixt sex and sex not so in the situation of elector inconvenience there might be upon the whole absurdity there would be none nor even would there be any novelty in it in the india house among the selfelected representatives of sixty millions of hindoos are females in any number ballot is the mode of voting ballot with the form of secresy and as little as any one pleases of the effect everywhere have females possessed the whole power of a despot everywhere but in france without objection talk of giving them as here the smallest fraction of a fraction of such a power scorn without reason is all the answer you receive from custom comes prejudice no gnat too minute to be strained out by it no camel too great to be swallowed as to corruption this being the disorder which the here proposed arrangements are employed to combat this part of the remedy it must be confessed is not altogether coextensive with the disease of this imperfection the existence will soon be seen and at the same time why it is impossible that perfection should take its place the objects of general desire—money power factitious dignity and so forth compose the matter by which in the hands of monarch or minister corruption applied to the breast of a representative of the people or that of an elector does its work the desires and passions in and by which it operates are hope and fear hope of obtaining the desirable object or fear of losing it so far as depends upon the influence of hope so long as the minister or the monarch has anything to give it is impossible for any disqualifying enactment to guard the probity of the representative at the next election or even immediately upon acceptance he loses suppose his seat good but before this he has secured something which is of more value in his eyes if instead of obtaining it for himself he obtains it for some person for whom he would otherwise have had to make provision at his own expense he may indeed if so his constituents please lose his seat at the next election but in this case he cannot be made to lose it sooner for a provision causing one person to suffer in this way for the transgression of another over whom he had no controul would be too manifestly repugnant to justice to be endurable it may thus be seen that against corruption in so far as it operates only by hope good government has no means of contending but the reducing to the lowest amount possible the sources of that hope annulling for example all future grants of peerages baronetcies ribbons and sinecures especially all sacred sinecures in comparison of which the profane are but as a drop in the bucket antichristian sinecures the very acceptance of which has more of blasphemy in it than many an act which has been styled such against that religion on pretence of supporting which they are accepted against the influence of fear in this case—fear of losing the good thing which is in hand—the sort of disqualifying enactment in question has more power the loss is certain and when in the two cases not only the object is the same but the certainty—in the one case of losing it in the other case of gaining it—is the same fear is beyond comparison more powerful than hope—assurance of eventually losing a thousand ayear which a man has in hand will be seen by every one to be a much more powerful stimulant than any hope of gaining as much can be it may be so in an infinite degree since there is no chance so small as not to be capable of giving rise and support to hope and a chance of acquiring the greatest quantity of wealth that was ever possessed by man may be so small as to be worth next to nothing as to the wording—office commission contract and pension are the words employed on this occasion as being familiar to every ear the more proper expression would be some general one under which the particular articles are comprised for example—source of emolument meaning source of emolument held at the pleasure of the crown and where the import of it has been fixed once for all by an exposition inserted in the appendix to the statute and in the text marked as such by a particular type—a type employed for all words and phrases thus expounded—it should thenceforward be employed without mention of any of the details included in it see p     but for expounding it the only effectual course would be to give a complete list of all the several sources of emolument to which the disqualification was meant to apply as to the grounds for disqualification they are in this case three—   guarding the probity of the public trustee as far as possible against all temptation to betray his trust   preventing a man from sitting in judgment in one character upon acts of his own done in another character and thus in case of delinquency being judge in his own cause   preventing him from bestowing on any public function of less importance any part of that time the whole of which would not be too great for this highest of all trusts if executed with that degree of assiduity which by the extent and importance of it it demands were the first of those grounds the only one some offices there are—the office of justice of the peace for example—which need not be considered as constituting a disqualification not so when the third of these grounds comes to be considered under any system under which the situation of representative of the people were considered as a source of obligation if the magistrate and the representative were the same person the magistrate could not act without robbing the representative under the existing mode of sham representation of no european despot is the power so perfectly disencumbered of all sense of public obligation as is that of the occupant of a seat belonging to a rotten borough or to a county held under the yoke of election terrorism and this is one short reason for a reform and that a radical one so far as depends upon law despotism is at the bottom limited government only on the surface in spain the despot is one in england he is legion and legion is composed not only of tories but of whigs for an as yet uncontested demonstration of this utter absence of all sense of obligation see parliamentary reform catechism introduction §    on nonattendance opportune occurrence—votes of honourable house   th november      jovis   ° die novembris      the house met and forty members not being present at four oclock mr speaker adjourned the house nb the day before met for crushing the small remaining fragments of english liberties     professing to oppose it a few sincerely   0 together out of the whole     members     attended such are the men who as representatives call not only for obedience but confidence obedience it is not in my power to withhold confidence it is no more in my power to give to them than to the beloved ferdinand as to judicial corruption all great placemen being thus not only each man a judge in his own cause but knit by community of sinister interest in a league with the majority of the others—impunity—universal impunity—has been the constant and notorious result among the members of this league are the highest judges no illusion therefore was ever more complete than that which trumpets forth the purity of english judges no set of men is there whose interest as far as depends upon law has been rendered more hostile to their duty impunity coupled with superior profit are the principal features by which they are distinguished from the most corrupt that can be found anywhere else the only obstacle that prevents an english judge from being less corrupt than a spanish a russian or a turkish judge is the liberty of the press and as far as judgemade law called common law is anything there is no liberty of the press but what is contrary to law and without violation of law may be crushed at any time note that no disqualification of this sort could have its effect but in proportion as the fact of acceptance werenotorious the arrangements necessary to secure such notoriety would enter too much into detail to be inserted here the principal is—that as soon as an appointment is accepted the instrument of appointment or a sufficient extract from it shall be communicated to the house through the speaker and to the public through the government newspaper this too of necessity in all cases as now by custom it is in some and that on failure of such communication the appointment shall be void void that is to say in such sort as to render the delinquent himself a sufferer by his usurpation but not so as to extend the suffering to any persons who are unconscious of it supposing a list of disqualifying sources of emolument made out by authority as above—a member on taking his seat should with this list in his hand have to declare to this effect—i am not in possession of any article in this list to which might perhaps be to be added—nor in expectation  by this clause the expense of   0 officers may be saved in a town district there would probably be no need of polling offices other than the district election office † analogous denominations are postmastergeneral and paymastergeneral  on the first opening of this or any other extensive system of reform opposition from persons of all classes in all quarters ought to be expected and as effectually as possible provided for in some of the offices disaffection to the reform and consequent betraying of trust out of office from high and low opposition and artifice in every imaginable shape the late proceedings at manchester were not necessary to prove the truth of this observation but they may help to render the public mind sensible of it fraud every man invested with power in any shape from the lowest to the highest will occasionally be disposed to abuse it to abuse it in every way that can be imagined by this maxim should every line be guided in this and every other constitutional code whoever contests the truth of it be sure that it is for the purpose of committing or supporting some abuse by this maxim the scribe of every monarch is actually guided in the penning of a penal code in speaking of the power that will be abused—in a penal code say natural power—in a constitutional code say political power—there lies the only difference whenever interest or prejudice or passion prompt they on whom the execution of the law depends will constantly or occasionally to the utmost of their power render it ineffectual or exceed or misapply the powers of it complain of the delinquents the law is bepraised you are referred for redress to the delinquents themselves or those who are in league with them and you are punished or it is inferred at least that you ought to be punished for calumny against the ministers of justice n b under the constitution as it stands all ministers of justice of the highest order are in league with the official delinquents of the higher orders situation forms the league of itself it does so without need of any the least concert between individual and individual think of grand juries whose actings being secret cannot by possibility be otherwise than right think of a coroner who lest a jury should give a verdict of murder will not suffer it to continue its sittings till a house of commons interested in giving impunity have had time to give it think of lord sidmouth who to prevent abuse in a prison renders the interior of it invisible to all those who have not express leave either from himself or from some person in intimate connexion with him for seeing it inquire whether this is not actually the case with the millbank penitentiaryhouse think of the slow tortures with death for better concealment at the end of them that might in any prison be inflicted by such means † question power adequate to the carrying of the plan into effect why thus lodge the whole of it in a single hand the electionmastergenerals reasons—security against failure rule—be the plan what it may leave not in any one adverse hand the faculty of defeating it be the plan what it may every person whose concurrence is ultimately necessary to the carrying it into effect has a virtual negative upon it to insure such concurrence nothing short of a power of removal in the hands of a person well affected to the business can be sufficient punishment in any the greatest quantity that on any such occasion can be employed—punishment in the form of law—never can in any such case be to be depended upon by plausible pretence by subtraction of evidence or by a variety of other means it may be evaded or what comes to the same thing expected to be evaded at the worst indemnification against it may be received or expected no person who by whatsoever cause—simister interest interestbegotten prejudice authoritybegotten prejudice or original intellectual weakness—is likely to be rendered adverse or determinately indifferent to the production of the effect should therefore be left in possession of any such negative if as here the production of the effect is placed within the power of one person—that person well affected to the business—the danger of failure is thus reduced to its minimum to this one add any number of others whose concurrence is thus made or left necessary by every one so added the danger of failure is increased if so it be that for this allcommanding situation not so much as a single individual competent and at the same time well affected to the business is to be found—accomplishment is on this supposition hopeless on the other hand suppose one such individual though there be no more than one whom the system has either found or rendered well affected to it—the requisite power as above being also given to him—accomplishment may thus be rendered morally sure at the recommendation of the electionmastergeneral are moreover appointed the commissioners of survey and demarcation as per section   and by him they are removable and thus all the functions necessary are put under the guidance of one will in the duke of richmonds radical reform bill the division of the election districts—this first step in the whole course—was allotted to the twelve judges as well might it have been allotted to the twelve cæsars their time was even in those days fully occupied for this strange mathematicopolitical function to have been executed by them well or ill within any limited time the concurrence of every one of them would have been necessary for by any one on one pretence or other or even without pretence every requisite operation might during an indefinite length of time have been delayed on the part of no one of them could any such concurrence have reasonably been expected after that which would never have been done had been done the business was to go all over the country to grand jurors and for the occasion every man who had ever been was to be one no obligation was there upon any one individual to do any one thing in it if a man who could and would do something were found no responsibility was there upon him for anything he did the electionmastergeneral is an individual in the hands of an individual not in those of any board should any such allsufficient and indispensably necessary power be lodged every board is a screen and if to the remembrance of a proposition of such practical and unquestionable importance the play upon words is subservient let it not be despised under the system of corruption the uses of a board are manifold—  to afford a screen to abuse in every shape what is everybodys business is nobodys business what is everybodys fault is nobodys fault by each one the fault is shifted off upon the rest so many members so many confederates all of whom—they and their connexions—join in affording support and protection to whatever misdeeds in any shape are committed by any one of them   to afford a pretext for multiplication of offices to each of which is attached its mass of emolument so many needless offices so many sources of waste so many instruments of corruption   if upon occasion any such desire should have place as that of seeing the business miscarry to secure the production of the sodesired effect of course never could any such expectation be entertained as that of seeing any such plan as this carried successfully into effect on any other supposition than that of the existence of a prime minister well affected to the business here then is one welladapted mind necessary that of an electionmastergeneral of his choice another and now for effectual accomplishment these two concurrent minds would in these two situations be sufficient even with little aid from the great body of the people—as for the most abject slavery so for the perfection of liberty—the quantity of the matter of corruption in the hands of a british prime minister would sufficea in the present practice the sort of business for the management of which the election masters office is instituted by this bill is divided between two offices that called the office of the messenger of the great seal for sending out the orders called writs in pursuance of which the elections are to be made that called the office of the clerk of the crown for receiving the several answers called returns in which it is stated what has been done in pursuance of these writs in neither instance does the name of the office give any the slightest intimation of the nature of the business the man who sends out these letters knows nothing about the answers the man who receives the answers knows nothing about the letters neither the one man nor the other know anything about what has been done in pursuance of the letters complication abundant darkness visible depredation the necessary and notorious fruit of it depredation sanctioned and unsanctioned regular and irregular limited and unlimited candidates contending for undue preference officers bribed and giving it under the notion or pretence of excluding the corruption legislators botching time after time in the usual style    geo iii chap    the date of the last botch such is the mode in which that correspondence is carried on by which honourable house is filled object in filling it mode in which it is filled correspondence by which it is filled—is it not all of a piece a british prime minister upon this occasion what then shall we say of ireland answer—nothing upon this occasion as upon thousands and millions of other occasions the learned person whoever he was that drew the irish union act followed by so many preeminently learned persons who gave their sanction to it has not left it possible king of great britain and ireland—yes this we are commanded to say—british and irish king—no this we cannot say constructed as the language is the form given to the name of the united kingdom will not allow of it english king—there is british king and in him a scottish king—there is irish king—there is none english and scottish interest taken together—you can speak of for you can say british interests—irish interests in conjunction with english and scottish you cannot so much as speak of on no occasion in the grammatical form of an adjective can the united kingdom be spoken of but ireland must be left out left by the writer or speaker unmentioned left by the reader or hearer unthought of such was the skill or such the goodwill of pitt the second and his scribes but ireland where have been her eyes all the while how long will she be content to remain thus an outcast since the union scarce has a day passed that i have not been plagued with the continually recurring necessity of thus dealing by her as if she were unheeded one word would supply the remedy for the united kingdom a name by which as england and scotland are by britain all these nations would be brought to view a word that would do this i have had in mind and on paper these thirteen or fourteen years but by those to whom good taste that is their own whim is everything the welfare of mankind nothing so sure as it were fit for the purpose so sure would it be scorned—and of such is the corporation of the ruling few composed that in this instance language should have no influence on conduct is not possible for in what instance is not conduct a slave to language  the more effectual the provision here made for the equality endeavoured at is the less will be the advantage obtainable by any additional degree of publicity capable of being given by undue favour or weight of purse for repressing by prohibitory provisions with penalties any such undue extra circulation any endeavour that could be used would be attended by a degree of complication the inconvenience of which could not it is believed be paid for by the advantage  in this as in other cases powers for extraction of evidence would be necessary to the persons charged with the inquiry but as the details would occupy much room and would contain little that is peculiar to the present case they are not here inserted one thing almost peculiar to the present case is—that the object of the inquiry is to administer benefits namely rights of suffrage to those who are the subjects of it and not burthens as in the case of taxes hence instead of being shrunk from the inquiry would generally if not universally speaking be met with alacrity  question why for establishing the existence of the several facts employed in the composition of the title to a vote omit to employ the ceremony of an oath follow the answers—   the effect of it would be to put an exclusion upon an eminently respectable class of persons who but for the bar set up against them by this instrument would be entitled and admitted to vote   by the ceremony a considerable quantity of time and expense would be uselessly consumed   in but too many instances it is proved by experience to be void of efficacy and thereby useless   by giving increase to the number of instances in which it is notoriously an object of violation and contempta the application of the ceremony on the occasion here in question would have the effect of diminishing whatsoever influence it might otherwise still possess and thereby whatsoever useful security it might otherwise be capable of affording a amongst others english university oaths by which at entrance the members all of them swear to the observance of a set of ordinances which no one of all these swearers fails to disobey see this shown in swear not at all these university men all of them and amongst them with few exceptions all who come afterwards to be church of england clergymen and with no exceptions all who come afterwards to be bishops and archbishops not forgetting those who under the name of blasphemy are so eager to draw down punishment on the heads of all who against that which for lucre they have made profession to believe have written anything which in their opinion cannot be sufficiently answered otherwise than by fine and imprisonment so likewise customhouse oaths and a vast variety of other oaths prescribed by statutes see note prefixed to swear not at all in this collection also petty jurymens oaths—oaths which are constantly violated by the minority as often as any ultimate difference of opinion has place  for some years past a survey of great britain on a scale that promises to be fully competent to this purpose has been going on with under the orders of the ordnance board of the engravings the scale is an inch to a mile not more on this scale thirty sheets are already published in these sheets are included the following six counties entire namely   essex   cornwall   devon   somerset   dorset   hants   pembroke   rutland also parts of the four following onesnamely   kent   surrey   berks   wilts   shropshire   staffordshire one of these maps is before me in parts that i am acquainted with i see expressed the sites not only of streets in towns but of single houses where the magnitude of them is considerable even this might perhaps serve for the scale spoken of in the text by the name of the country scale but the scale on which the original drawings were made is a scale of six inches to a mile this scale might at any rate serve for what was in view in the text in speaking of the enlarged country scale whether this would suffice for the town scale i cannot take upon me to say but that which at any rate could not fail to suffice for this largest scale is that on which horwoods map of london is constructed the scale of this map if the information furnished from the geographerroyals shop is correct is twentysix inches to a mile a sheet of it lies before me  a precise definition of a householder as contradistinguished from an inmate would be requisite on this occasion as well as on the occasion of the votemaking certificate as per section   this definition would be as necessary on the plan of those who approve of householder suffrage and no more as on the plan of those who call for virtually universal suffrage a householder is one who pays taxes good but what taxes taxes payable to the national fund such as those of late years called assessed taxes or taxes paid to local funds such as poorrates c and what local funds in particular under the existing system in some boroughs every potwobbler as the phrase is is an elector every habitation in which a pot is boiled gives a vote and in so far as this is admitted the distinction between householdership and inmateship is obliterated for married or single where is the person who for such a purpose may not have it in his power to boil a pot if not of his own a horrowed one but with that exception under the existing system there is not it is believed in any house more than one householder namely the one person by whom all house taxes are paid lodgers though there be ever so many different families of them pay no house taxes heads and all other members of families are indiscriminately styled inmates in this way the matter stands on a very simple footing payment of the taxes is secured and thus the only object looked to is accomplished but the same building which at one time is used only as an outhouse to a dwellinghouse is at another time inhabited and used as a separate dwellinghouse and whether it be for burthen or for benefit—for payment of taxes or for giving a vote—it seems not easy to say why a mans lot should be varied by circumstances so indeterminate and irrelevant so far as concerns taxes it seems right enough for a lodger pays to his householder so much the more on account of the householders bearing his the lodgers share of the taxes but so far as concerns the right of suffrage it seems difficult to say on what principle it should be confined to the person by whose hands thetaxes are paid the principle of property is hardly applicable for nothing is more common than for the lodger to be in better circumstances than the person by whom the lodging is let  in and by the course above submitted any person might take upon himself to answer for the carrying the design into effect and to describe such a course seemed to be the problem the solution of which was called for by the nature of the case not but that in a rough manner it might perhaps be found not altogether impracticable to arrange the business without this process of survey demarcation and registering of habitations and if it were practicable the saving in expense would be of no inconsiderable importance—the saving in time of incomparably greater importance but in that case likewise the essential thing would be—that the direction of the process should be the whole of it in one hand if committed to a number of hands those for instance of so many local authorities there would never be an end to it numerous would be the adversaries—some open some perhaps disguised under the masks of friends against the artifices of these last in particular it would have to secure itself it is sufficiently known what sort of a reform every whig reform is that has ever been proposed in the character of a gradual reform a gradual progress in doing nothing but were it not for a warning such as this whigs if pressed might if they thought they saw their account in it give in to the proposition even of radical reform and this even in all its elements without exception they might accordingly support up to a certain point of time with very little danger of success among the local authorities some would be in the confidence of the whigs others in that of the tories whigs or tories on any such occasion one thing they could find no difficulty in agreeing in namely to disagree without end one circumstance however there is which is in favour of the business the inquiry has for its object the knowing throughout who it is that has a right to vote among those who have the right few if any will be desirous of losing it and if they are and lose it accordingly there will be no harm done nobody will have any injury to complain of and as to an electionmaster it seems difficult to conceive how in the adjustment of a set of rights collectively indeed so important but individually so small he should be exposed to the action of any sinister interest strong enough to turn his course aside from the path of rectitude operator—say accordingly upon every imaginable plan operator in chief one only the electionmastergeneral of his operation in great britain the basis would be the population returns in these he would see the parishes contained in each division immediately subordinate to that into counties within these limits for determining relative positions he would upon the rough plan now in question have no other constant and sure resource than what could be afforded by already existing maps the rest would be to be done by separate inquiries the population returns of      point out the persons to be resorted to and the mode in ireland unfortunately the mass of those resources could not it is apprehended but be much more imperfect on any plan district offices with their respective officebearers could not be dispensed with but in any case the expense need not be so great as at first sight it might be imagined for the office any town that in other respects would be suitable would furnish a townhall a markethouse or some such public building in the city of london the churches are applied to this purpose and without scruple in case of need even any dwellinghouse might serve where necessary portable hustings might be erected for the day at a very moderate expense as to the officebearer neither in the case of the districtclerk nor in the case of the subdistrictclerk would much time be occupied as to the districtclerk he would have scarce anything to do on any number of days in a year beyond one in both instances the official person would naturally be some country attorney for the salary of the pollingdistrict clerk—the only one of the two upon whom there would be a demand for any considerable part of his time—a hundred ayear or even less might suffice the office would bring him into universal notice with ordinary good behaviour it would secure to him an ample stock of business in the case here supposed the rights of suffrage not being determined by reference to habitations previously ascertained distinguished and denominated—the difficulty to be overcome is that which might be liable to be produced by influxes of itinerant voters brought together by accident without design or by mischievous design householder suffrage might seem to obviate this but so as to exclude contestation and indefinite delay how is it that for such a purpose the households could be ascertained and distinguished without contestation or difficulty in by far the greater part of the united kingdom perhaps yes still in many parts there might remain enough to produce a quantity of contestation the result of which it seems not very easy to foresee witness the irish cottages † the journeys in question are—those between the abodes of the several voters on the one part and the respective polling offices on the other that these journeys with the expense and loss of time attending them should be as short as general convenience in other respects will admit is indisputably desirable the smaller the polling district and the nearer the office is to the central point of the district the shorter upon an average will these journeys be if in regard to these points namely smallness and centrality of situation these polling districts are brought into a conformity with general convenience—what the election districts are—the election districts in which the polling districts are respectively included—will in these respects be matter of indifference the extent of the election district is determined by the quantity of population and this as nearly as convenience in other respects will admit is to be the same in all but as in respect of density of population the difference between district and district will be so great—having for its limits the density of the population in the purely town districts and the thinness of the population in the thinnest peopled country district—hence the difference in respect of extent will be proportionably great but in the instance of each district proportioned to its extent will be the number of the polling offices which for reducing the length of journeys will require to be established in it for this purpose in the purely town district no polling office distinct from the electiondistrict office will be requisite—nor does it appear why it should for any other purpose for even upon the universal suffrage plan the greatest possible number of voters it will be seen would not be more than  000 or  000 the customary number perhaps not more than threefourths or a half of that number and by adding to the number of secretselection boxes as per section   an unlimited addition might be made to the number of voters giving their votes at the same time thus much as to the main consideration by which the number of the polling districts in each election district will require to be determined as to the number and in particular as to the number which might require to be established in the most thinly peopled election district it is not possible to speak with anything like decision without a calculation the labour of which would not here be paid for by the benefit the only consideration by which any limits can be set to the number is that of the expense and that unquestionably is no trifling one here then comes in a question by what fund the expense shall be borne answer—by the national fund not by any local one neither the benefit nor the facility of supporting the burthen is any greater in the most thinly peopled than in the most densely peopled district therefore neither should be the burthen itself as expressed in pounds shillings and pence but though the exact extent of an election district is thus far immaterial it may be in some degree matter of satisfaction to the reader to have in mind some general conception in relation to it so likewise in relation to the quantity of the population a quantity which as above observed will not only want much of being determinate but will moreover be as near the average in the least extensive as in the most extensive districts to this purpose mr rickmans masterly and most instructive preliminary explanations prefixed to the parliamentary population returns printed in      for the use of the members afford us much and very satisfactory information first then as to great britain—   inhabitants in great britain anno      per do                000   square miles in do as per do     0    divide inhabitants      000 by seats     number of inhabitants to a seat is       a   divide square miles    0  by seats thence by districts     number of square iniles to a district is                  in a district greatest direct distance of any habitation from the district office upon the supposition of its being in the centre of the circle in which the square is inscribed is a fraction more than             miles   f   greatest travelling distance on the supposition that to the above distance is to be added onefourth more for the twinings and windings of roads a fraction less than       miles   greatest travelling distance on the supposition that by reason of want of exact centrality in a town sufficiently adapted to the purpose there are in some districts habitations at a distance half as great again as the above from the district office a fraction more or less than      m   f but it is in districts that are purely town districts that a large proportion of the total population of great britain is contained of any such attempt as that of ascertaining the exact proportion by travelling for this purpose over the whole field of the parliamentary returns the use would not here pay for the labour for aid to conception let us assume a result differing perhaps not very widely from the correct result and suppose the half of the population to be contained in those districts that are upon the purely town scale but in districts so circumstanced all taken together the whole quantity of land is in comparison of the whole quantity contained in the country districts so small that for simplicity of calculation it may perhaps on this occasion without any error very material to this purpose be considered as nothing and left out of the account this being done the consequence would be that to find the average number of square miles in a district instead of dividing the whole number of square miles by the whole number we should have to divide by no more than half the number of the districts on that supposition the lengths of utmost distance as above mentioned would be to be doubled but from the number of square miles in the most thinly peopled district to the number in the most densely peopled district the number would be descending in a regular series this considered instead of as large again we may perhaps state the utmost length of journey in that district which is the most thinly peopled and thence the most extensive as being half as large again as the number above stated on this supposition we shall have for this utmost length            m   f thus then comes in a topic which important as it is could not have been touched upon in the text namely that of the injustice done done by the irish union act to ireland in respect of the proportionable number of the seats allotted to it to ireland as to great britain injustice in that or in any other shape could be done and but too easily under the system of disguised despotism—could be done and accordingly was done but with any prospect of success neither in that nor in any other shape could injustice especially so flagrant and so palpable be so much as proposed in any proposed system of equal liberty note that at the union with scotland the injustice was still more flagrant now as to ireland—   inhabitants in ireland as per playfairs statistical tables anno   00 and pinkertons geography vol i p     anno   0  by conjecture in round numbers   000000   from other accounts that number being supposed to be rather under than over the mark especially for the year of the british population returns      take instead of it the number which forms an exact third of the number of the inhabitants in great britain namely           divide inhabitants         by seats  00 present actual number of inhabitants to a seat neglecting fractions is               per rickman p  0 scotland with its islands is about equal to ireland in area and is half as large as england and wales supposing these dimensions correct as they are sufficiently for the present purpose—say then square miles in england and scotland taken together being    0  as above square miles in ireland are                     divide square miles       by seats  00 no of square miles in ireland to a seat is      such are the existing proportions as marked out by the irish union act under the system of distribution actually in existence observe now what would be the proportions under a system of equal justice the population of ireland being as above onethird of great britain the number of seats allotted to ireland ought to have been and ought now to be onethird of the number of those allotted to great britain   no of seats for great britain and ireland taken together is                instead of     take for both together the number which being divisible by   is next above     this is             0   proper share of great britain threefourths of   0 is accordingly—seats instead of the present actual                    proper share of ireland onefourth of   0 is—seats instead of the present actual  00      anno   0  the year of the scottish union population of england as per rickman from the population returns of           0000 divide inhabitants    0000 by seats     this gives to a million of inhabitants seats nearly  00 at that time the population of scotland could not have been less than      000000 seats for the million no more than      note on these occasions as on all others injustice the continually increasing offspring of uncontrouled power at the scottish union england being strongest was unjust to scotland at the irish union england and scotland together being strongest were unjust to ireland but scotland being swallowed up in england it is still to england that the honour of the injustice is due on the ocean england prides herself in being unjust to other nations—in exercising dominion over them and this is another of her honours lords of the ocean indeed this means lords of all other men upon earth whenever they come upon the ocean out of our own country what right have we to be lords over any other men any where but the time is coming when rascality will be rascality everywhere not less when manifested upon the largest scale than when upon the smallest but says somebody is not this sowing dissension amongst the friends of reform sowing dissension yes so it would be if by shutting his own eyes it were in a mans power to shut other mens if by shutting their own eyes against injustice when prepared to be committed to their advantage it were in the power of englishmen to shut the eyes of scotchmen—of englishmen and scotchmen together to shut the eyes of irishmen—against injustice proposed to be committed to their disadvantage but exists there any sort of mechanism capable of producing any such effect i for my part know of none under the system of force and fraud there is little difficulty in this and practice insures in a great degree the success of it not so under a system of freedom and sincerity in a case like this i see not how upon any tolerably promising grounds a man can expect to receive justice unless he begins with rendering it for my part i believe not that there either is or can be any scheme of political deception that is not either already exposed or in a way soon to be so when a thing that to me seems to be material presents itself to my view my notion always is—not that it will present itself to nobody else but that it will present itself to everybody else though in ireland there has not as yet been any enumeration of the people nor has any such survey been commenced as that in which such considerable progress has already been made in great britain viz in      yet as in ireland the quantity of surface is not more than about onethird of that in great britain ireland seems to be the country in which the conjunct operation might reasonably be expected to be soonest completed a in the congress house of representatives the proportion was in    0 one representative to every   000 inhabitants that is if the whole territory were divided into election districts   000 inhabitants to an election district—seyfert p    in the constitution of these united states of which the congress is the general legislative body date of the constitution   th september      in speaking of the congress house of representatives it is said—the number of representatives meaning from all the states taken together shall not exceed one for every  0000 art ii section    the formulary thus expressed is here substituted throughout to the whereas which has been hitherto in use without the benefit of the addition made by it to the otherwise sufficient incomprehensibility of the rule of action the sentences in an act of parliament are sufficiently protracted and involved with this addition the attention is frequently exhausted before so much as any one expression of the legislators will is so much as commenced in ruffheads edition i remember seeing a statute in which the preamble introduced by this word occupies more than thirteen pages of that close and spacious letterpress bound volumes might be found each of which does not contain more than this preamble i am sorry i cannot now make reference to the statute i am inclined to think it is one of those of which the eastindia company was the subject in french legislation the sort of matter our lawyers introduce by a whereas has a particular name the times before the revolution are those which i have in view it is called the considerant of the law it exhibits the facts or supposed facts on the consideration of which in the character of reasons or inducements the law or portion of law has been grounded but like our whereas this considerant used to precede the mention of the facts and in the same way glue them together into one sentence leaving them to be set down before it one by one the form here employed it may be seen sets them free the enormous practical mischievousness of the customary formulary—the sinister interest by which it has been hitherto rendered sacred—the grammatical circumstances by which the two modes of expression stand distinguished—the alliance which on this as on every other part of the field of law has place between fraud and imbecility—these are topics that must be reserved for a future occasion in this place the room which anything like a full explanation would require cannot be spared meantime whatever may be the grammatical and logical description of the difference between the two modes the effect of it can scarcely fail of rendering itself perceptible to every eye that has ever found itself condemned to drag itself along the length of a british act of parliament britishandirish i mean but for the expression of this meaning the union act it has been seen has not afforded us a single word  various and important are the collateral uses which a complete register of this sort might be found to have chiefly under the head of police for example provision for the poor prevention of crimes securing the equal payment of taxes c it will be evident upon a little reflection what strength would be given to whatever is good and popular in the laws if by means of everybodys habitation everybodys abode were thus at all times capable of being made known to everybody let it not be forgotten that the state of things in which the sort and degree of notoriety that would be the result of the survey here in question would have place would not be that unhappy state of things in which it is a question whether most evil would be produced by the execution or nonexecution by the strength or the weakness of the laws † parishes in england and wales are  0    in scotland     parishes and subparishes taken together in england and wales       in scotland  00  extraparochial places about  00 by subparishes is here meant such divisions of parishes as severally maintain their own poor stat        c   c    they are called tythings or townships parishes and subparishes together are the places stated as having made separate returns the parishes so divided are chiefly the seven northern counties of england and they are all so  0 or  0 miles square is no unusual extent upon an average these northern are seven or eight times the extent of the southern counties—parl pop returns prel observ        for the execution of this business on which trifling as it may seem the right in question will in so great a degree be dependent neither the individuals interested nor any local authorities would be to be trusted in neither case could uniformity of proceeding or completeness of execution be reasonably expected in the case of individuals failure in abundance would be produced by absence poverty or negligence in the case of local authorities by negligence or disaffection in neither case would there be any effectual responsibility in either case the expense would be greater than on the here proposed plan reckoning consumption of time as expense as to the expense of the requisite remuneration for these doorplate fixers if considered as constant as in a certain degree it will require to be it may naturally enough appear formidable but by uniting in the same individuals this function and that of the distribution of letters this expense might be greatly reduced at least if not wholly done away to the exercise of both functions in addition to reading the same knowledge exactly and no more would be indispensable namely an acquaintance with the site of every habitation within their respective fields of action supposing it to be regarded as interfering with the patronage or in any other respects with the power attached to the office of postmastergeneral nothing less than the most determinate opposition from that office would of course be to be expected but the functionaries immediately under the patronage of the postmastergeneral are the several local postmasters not the distributors of the letters and it is only to the function of distributor of letters that that of doorplate fixer would have to be united it would be for consideration how far for economys sake it might be of advantage to unite regularly or occasionally the functions of districtclerk and pollclerk to the function of local postmaster instead of to the profession of attorney as proposed in a former note to the function of doorplate fixer that of constable might it should seem be united with no small advantage and thus in so far as a constable is at present remunerated at the expense of the public a proportionable saving might be effected  among the artifices of misrule are needless and useless and groundless nullifications interruptions and terminations of public business no measures but those that have for their object either the interest of the people or the interest of the opposition suffer by these obstacles the crown has times and seasons at command † resignation at present a seat cannot be vacated by simple resignation when a member wishes to resign he cannot do so without being appointed to an office under the crown which appointment monarch or minister may refuse or delay as long as he pleases refusal is not indeed customary but it is not the less legal and might and would at any time be resorted to if an expected successor were to a certain degree obnoxious in ireland before the union and on the occasion of the union it was actually resorted to among the inwardly harboured maxims by which the practice of honourable house conducts itself a leading one may be stated to be this—never do in a direct way that which you can do in an indirect way in other words never do without insincerity that which you can do by insincerity thus in the present case one man cannot make room in the house for another but a false pretence for it must be made a false pretence and to that false pretence not only the outgoing member himself but the monarch and minister likewise are parties the ground of the falsehood is this in the statutebook are some half dozen acts mentioning by general description certain offices and other sources of emolument at the pleasure of the crown and declaring that upon acceptance given to any office c coming within that description by a member of the house of commons his seat is vacated why vacated because were he to continue in it the office being one of those to which emolument is attached his conduct would by the fear of losing it be apt to be rendered subservient to the particular interests of monarch and minister—adverse to the universal interest thus the very principle of all the acts is the notorious corruptness of the system of which they make a part among these offices is one called the stewardship of the chiltern hundreds of the system of falsehood without which a seat is not suffered to be vacated this office is the constant instrument on this occasion the following is the pretence the falsehood of which is so notorious regarding the person in question as being eminently fit for the trust in question—and willing as well as able to perform the duties of it and thereby to earn the emolument attached to it—his majesty has been advised and is graciously pleased to select him for that purpose and place the office in his hands what in the instrument of appointment is actually expressed i cannot pretend to say nor can i at this moment be certain whether any instrument for this purpose actually receives official signature but whether expressed or no such are the allegations implied willing and determined to do his best towards the fulfilment of these duties the member who has thus been singled out gives on his part to his majesty his humble thanks and to the office his acceptance this being what is said—said by monarch and by minister—both saying it in solemn form by their signature how stands the matter of fact no duties whatever no selection the office is given indiscriminately and successively to every member that applies for it to all members who one after another apply for it perhaps to several on one and the same day thus drenched in insincerity is honourable house it is by insincerity men get into it it is by insincerity men get out of it hear their speeches look to their votes look to their journals see whether without insincerity anything that is done there is ever donea were not all regard for sincerity almost universally cast off in honourable house—cast off by whigs not less completely than by tories—could sham representation have stood thus long in the place of genuine among the effects of radical reform would be—not only in honourable house but in so many other places—in other houses—on the throne—on the seats of judicature—in the seats of education—if not to put an end to this at any rate to put an end to the empire of this a it is from the class of men by which the proceedings of honourable house have at all times as they could not but have been been guided that the insincerity so conspicuous in the whole frame of them has manifestly been derived lies manufactured by lawyers as such are even by themselves acknowledged to be untruths and as such constantly spoken of under the name of fictions but never was the appellation of a lie ascribed to anything with more strict propriety than to these fictions a fiction of law hurts nobody says one of their latin maxims this lie embraces and overtops all the others a fiction of law hurts everybody never was any one of these lies told but it had for its object and as far as it compassed its object for its effect usurpation and injustice when a judge wanted to do something which he was conscious he had no right to do his way was in relation to some matter of fact to make an assertion which if true might have afforded him a justification for what he did but which to his knowledge was not true here then was a gross lie and by lies of this sort in the dark ages did judges contrive to steal power sometimes from parliament sometimes from the monarch sometimes from one another under favour of that universal ignorance which they had so successfully laboured to keep up by the clouds in which by these and other means they had succeeded in enveloping their proceedings the detail of these lies and these thefts may be seen in blackstone in blackstone who so thoroughly depraved by bad education were his understanding and his morals saw for anything that appears no harm in it—yes usurpation and injustice never in the coining of any one of these lies could the coiner have had any better object for if what he was doing had not been contrary to justice the lie would have been of no use to him contrary to justice yes and even contrary to law as it stood in so far as in such a shape and in such hands anything to which the name of law could with propriety be applied could be said to stand or to have existence for some time past no fresh lies of this sort—none at least that in flagrancy can compare with the old stock—have been coined the people it may have been feared would not bear it but the old stock is made the most of—several purposes are continually answered by it—purposes as baneful to the people as beneficial to those by whom the base currency is forced upon them a vice which for its mischievousness ought to be an object of universal abhorrence—the vice of insincerity in its very grossest forms—has to their own profit—such is the efficiency with which power decked in false science can produce delusion—been converted by them into an object of almost universal veneration to an eye that dares open itself a curious sight is—to see how in the very act of punishing this vice in others they revel in it themselves no never has man been punished by them for lying but a string of lies has been uttered by the judge to help form the ground for punishing him every record is the discourse of some judge or judges look into any record you will see the lies it teems with examine in detail the forms of judicial procedure and see whether it be not in insincerity that they began and from the beginning have continued no proposition so absurd no practice so flagitious—that custom and habit will not reconcile men to when the king has made a man a judge amongst other powers is this of converting vice into virtue this is among the articles of faith which hitherto the people have bad the goodness to believe it may be seen in another work swear not at all whether the clergy of the establishment are not on their part trained up for years in a course even confessed by themselves to be that of habitual perjury not to speak of the insincerity in so many other forms with which without exception men on their entrance into that profession are by authority of law compelled to defile themselves of the sort of morality thus imbibed by the higher orders who does not see—yes and feel but too sensibly—the effects—in particular the effects produced by it in honourable house and in the whole system of sham representation on which it stands to men thus educated how can insincerity—when so constantly practised to their own sinister purposes—be otherwise than an object of fond affection and sincerity an object of terror and abhorrence thus it is that whatsoever regard for sincerity has place in the lower orders it is not in consequence but in spite of the example set them set them by those who on no better ground than that of the riches and power with which fortune has favoured them pretend to constitute the only class in which either wisdom or virtue is to be found protest against highseated vice in this and so many other shapes the answer is—you are an enemy to english institutions as if only by continuing to practise it englishmen had a power of converting vice into virtue  this source of mischief should be cut off and if under radicalism of course it would be   in the hands of monarch and minister it is a perpetually ready bribe for those who could not be bought by bribe in any other shape   it gives additional strength to a body of men whose interests are avowedly distinct from and thereby unquestionably opposite to the universal interest and who have in their hands the means of making perpetually repeated sacrifices of the universal interest to that separate and sinister interest   it is giving continual increase to a breed of men who from increase of numbers and extravagance are in large proportion continually sliding down into a sort of elevated pauperism which according to an avowed maxim of government must be pampered at an expense proportioned to its factitious elevation see the avowal of the maxim proved—upon the whigs in the defence of economy against burke and upon the tories in the defence of economy against rose both printed in the pamphleteer—see these works in this collection to a limitation of this sort the peers themselves would naturally have no great objection in the reign of george the first by an odd concurrence of causes it was favoured not only by the lords but by the minister but as was altogether natural it was effectually opposed in honourable house † for an exposition of the words annoyance and disturbance see appendix ‡ this section has two objects—   to obviate the apprehension that annoyance may be given in the house to men of high habits by men of low habits for with men of this obnoxious description to an unlimited amount imagination howsoever opposed by reason and experience will in the highseated minds be busy in peopling the house supposing the seats in it filled by free and universal suffrage   to secure individual members against groundless expulsion and thereby their constituents against injury by the injustice of an occasional majority of the house it being clear that under any order of things every governing assembly must possess over its own members whatsoever power is necessary to secure its proceedings against disturbance—on this ground it is that honourable house reserves to itself of course the power of excluding from its walls any person who shall have been pointed out by monarch or minister to be so dealt with thus it was that in      to please the monarch it expelled john wilkes the alleged cause was a libel and a libel is—any discourse in print or writing which he who has power to punish for it chooses to punish for had that pretext failed any words that had been spoken by him might have served for any words that honourable house chose to expel a man for might and at all times may be for that or any other purpose voted scandalous scandalous or upon occasion—what would form so much stronger and commodious a ground—blasphemous for on the field of religion whatever a man says that another man does not like is according to that other man blasphemy whereupon in so far as he has power he makes the miscreant smart for it under the sway of corruption no species of annoyance can be imagined that honourable house would not submit to rather than submit to have this privilege defined and thereby confined to its real uses not so under radical reform the paramount objects here have been—to give effect to all legitimate causes of exclusion and in so doing to put an exclusion upon all illegitimate ones for this purpose it was necessary to take what promised to be an exhaustive view of the legitimate ones a temporary object was that which is herein above first mentioned quieting the alarm which in such a case seemed liable to be felt by the opulent multitude to whom personal ease is everything public interest nothing  hitherto so long as a speaker has been indisposed the business of the house and thereby the business of the nation has been at a stand on or without an intimation from a monarch or a minister a speaker as well as any other man may be indisposed whenever he pleases the business of the nation is of no importance a speaker of the commons house is not susceptible of infirmity bodily or mental—one or other of these maxims is what the present practice in this matter has for its ground it rests with honourable house to say which for the causes see the note † p     under radicalism the business of the nation will not be of no importance under radicalism a speaker will not be exempt from human infirmity under real and preappointed law the man in power—monarch minister judge—be he what he may—is not altogether without check there is a something which is or may be in the eyes of everybody and which he may be expected at least to be bound by under imaginary and retrospective—or as the phrase is ex post facto law for such is all common law—he is without check on each individual occasion he imagines whatever suits his sinister interest and says—this is law this he says is law and as if that were not enough from the beginning of things down to this time so if you will believe him it has been though this is the first time that any such thing ever entered into mans thoughts see this in blackstone and this it is that makes common law the perfection of reason of reason but in what eyes in the eyes of all those who have or have had the making of it and of all those others whom they have made their dupes † the matter thus indicated was never published by the author it will appear in this collection if found in a sufficient state of preparation—ed  why say intended and supposed as if the thing intended on an occasion of this sort ever failed of being done to this question something of an answer may here be expected by logicians when speaking of a definition is commonly meant as of course the mode termed in latin definitio per genus et differentiam definition afforded by the indication of a more extensive collection of objects to which the object in question belongs—some genus as the phrase is of which it is a species—together with the indication of some peculiar character or quality by which it stands distinguished from all other objects included in that same collection—from all other species of that same genus and this form is that which when what is considered as a definition is given is the form constantly intended and supposed to be given to it now then by him who undertakes to give a definition in this form what is necessarily howsoever tacitly assumed is—that there exists in the language a word serving as the name of a genus of things within which the species of things indicated by the word he thus undertakes to define is comprehended but words there are and in no small abundance of which definitions of this sort are frequently undertaken to be given—or which are supposed to be as clearly and generally understood as if definitions in this form could be and had been given of them—but for which all this while no such more extensive denomination is afforded by this or any other language and among them words which in law and politics are in continual use and upon the signification of which questions of prime and practical importance are continually turning take for instance the words right power obligation now in the way in question—namely by indication of so many superior genuses of things of which these words respectively designate so many species—it is not possible to define these words no one of these three words can you thus define the word man for example you can thus define you may do so by saying that he is an animal and then stating a quality by which he is distinguishable from other animals here then is a word you can and do thus define why because comprehending in its import that of this same word man stands that same word animal by which is accordingly designated a genus of which man is a species so likewise in regard to operations for example that of contracting in the civil branch of the field of law and that of stealing in the penal branch of that same thorny field contracting is one species of operation stealing is another but this you cannot say in the instance of right or power or obligation for a right is not a species of anything a power is not a species of anything an obligation is not a species of anything the objects of which the words man animal substance are names are extensive sorts or kinds of real entities the objects of which the words right power obligation are names are not sorts or kinds of any real entities the objects of which they are sorts or kinds are but so many fictitious entitiesa a for expounding or explaining the import of any one of these names of fictitious entities the nature of the case affords but one resource and that is the finding some class of real entities which is more or less clearly in view as often as to the name of a class of fictitious entities any clear idea stands annexed—and thereupon framing two propositions one in which the name of the fictitious entity is the leading term the other in which the name of a corresponding class either of real entities or of operations or other motions of real entities is the leading term—this last so ordered that by being seen to express the same import it shall explain and make clear the import of the first this mode of exposition has been termed paraphrasis—paraphrase giving phrase for phrase it is for want of observation made of this distinction that all attempts to define words of the description in question such as right power and obligation have proved abortive of a regular and comprehensive body of law framed in subservience to what are or ought to be the ends of law a set of appropriate expositions for words of this description would be an indispensable accompaniment but for any such work this is no proper place in a work entitled a fragment on government published by the author in      see vol i without a name and long since out of print indication was for the first time given of the utter impossibility of doing that which in such numbers men have been continually supposing themselves to have done instead of a superior genus what on this occasion has been brought forward has been some term or other bearing in its import such a resemblance to the term in question as to be capable of being on some occasions with little or no impropriety employed instead of it a right is a power—or a power is a right—and so forth shifting off the task of definition backward and forward from one word to another shifting it off thus at each attempt and never performing it but though a right is not itself a species of anything right has divers species perfectly and clearly distinguishable namely by means of the benefits which they respectively confer and the sanctions by which they are respectively created and for each of these species a separate exposition would be found requisite give us our rights say the thousands and the millions give us our rights they say and they do well to say so yet of all who say so not one perhaps can say not one perhaps ever conceived clearly what it is he thus calls for—what sort of a thing a right is  note that in the particular case here in question namely that of offices c of a certain description considered as having the effect of excluding the possessor from a seat in the house—it is not altogether clear that any enumeration of them would to the purpose in question be absolutely necessary definition with exemplification might perhaps suffice on the other hand what is certain is—that without definition or explanation—without words of general description—enumeration in a case such as this would not suffice why because if enumeration were the only mode of designation employed sinister ingenuity could not fail to set itself to work under different names it would pour in objects on which it would bestow the desirable quality free from the undesirable one instead of offices it would attach the emolument to functions—to situations—to trusts—to posts—to anything and thus the purpose of the law would be evaded to establish distinctions where there are no differences is among the endeavours and the performances—not only of crown lawyers but of every member of that profession of which insincerity and artifice are not so much the confessed as the professed attributes  in its application to the penal branch of law this mode stands exemplified in the first of those works of the authors on legislation which were edited in french by mr dumont in this way a quantity of letterpress not larger than what has been seen contained in an almanack might supply a man with as large a quantity of legal information as he would have need to carry in his head with the addition of appropriate indication sufficient to enable him upon occasion to present to his mind in time for use whatever was not contained in it in every such abridgment it being as truly the work of the legislator as the work at large of which it is an abridgment every man would of course behold a rule of action on which he could repose an equally safe confidence i cannot let this occasion pass without observing that an abridgment thus made is the only sort of abridgment on which any such confidence can be placed on the part of any uncommissioned abridger no degree of ability can have any such effect as that of giving to his work a just title to any such confidence in the original suppose imperfections in any abundance in the abridgment none the greater the number of these imperfections the more delusive and dangerous to trust to will the abridgment be for it is from what the original is not from what it ought to have been that the interpretation put upon it by the judge will be deduced unless indeed it should happen to suit his private views to interpret it according to what it ought to have been for wherever through the medium of that which is that which ought to have been and is not is discernible the judge is upon velvet with hands decorated with sham chains he

the acknowledged rule not only in the field of local law but in the field of universal law—in a word over the whole field of reason if to this canon there be any exceptions small indeed is their extent nor will the present case be found to be in the number of them guilt is imputed to us—guilt of the deepest dye but the proof where is it nowhere—none adduced—none so much as attempted to be adduced yet condemnation follows—has followed—just as if there had been proof and that proof complete and conclusive  in this country under the existing state of the government excitements to unjust and pernicious wars have place to a deplorable degree—to a degree greater than under any other form of government either despotic or democratic in a democracy those on whom war depends—namely the great body of the people—have everything to lose and nothing to gain by war in any event in a despotism those on whom it depends may have to gain in the case of success to a certain extent but by any ill success they are complete losers and their chance of gaining is never equal to their chance of losing but in this country in the persons that form its government those on whom war depends have much to gain in every event whether the war be what is reputed a successful one or be an unsuccessful one what they have to gain is patronage—patronage contingent in case of conquest in the case of illsuccess and constant defeat still and for a certainty there is additional patronage true it is that while gaining as ministers they will be losing as citizens but to men in their situation even the pecuniary gain will in the one shape often be and will always appear to be greater than the loss in the other the gain is certain immediate and in large masses the loss is unliquidated gradual and in great part contingent and remote one class of rulers there is whose profit by war so far as money alone is concerned consists only in patronage to this class belong for example—  the monarch   the commanderinchief   the first lord of the admiralty   the secretary at war another class there is to whom profit over and above any that may come in the shape of patronade is yielded by war through the medium of the distress of individuals to this class belong—  the lord chancellor   the judge of the admiralty court the lord chancellor through the medium of the bankruptcies of which it is productive the judge of the admiralty court through the medium of the captures and the consequent litigations of which it is productive add to which till tother day a lord who by pretending to be a sort of clerk
