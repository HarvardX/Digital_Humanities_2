with strange adventures fills the historick song twas in those warlike days when growing france would with extending power her realms advance the sturdy germans late the roman pride still struggled hard still pushed and gored her side vast troops they raised the king and prince their head filled with their youth and by their heroes led this done there follows and important care whom they shall trust their great vicegerent here the dauphin to his father recommends one of his dearest most deserving friends the count of angiers then in high renown fittest to guard and fill the empty throne the choice with universal joys approved never was man like noble angiers loved against his will the mourners drawn to court who had forsook the world and all resort to the dark groves and silent caves was fled to weep in vain his dear maria dead for tyrant death had snatched a faithful wife and with her all the joys of hapless angiers life the world to him had now no pleasing charms nor waked he with the once loved sound of arms thus lived the count to eating grief a prey till by his masters voice he is forced away he heard and knew he must the king obey he comes and soon the mighty charge receives and for his trust his faith and honor gives and now the dauphin ready to depart presses his faithful angiers to his heart oh thou my dear and long tried friend he said and on his bosom kindly leaned his head to thee my father leaves his kingdoms care no subject boasts of power a larger share the trust is weighty and the trouble great to rule this potent land and poplar state yet my best

away by some ill fate my peace at home betray watch that cleora undisturbed may rest in serving her thou gainst thy masters breast this said he clasped him fast nor staid replies but cried i read thy answer in thy eyes quick to his warlike troops he took his way whose youthful heat could brook no longer stay angiers is left the sole commander now to him the officious courtiers crowd and bow he looked as born to the honors of his place his noble soul enriched with every grace shone with majestic sweetness in his face just ripened full from youths delightful bloom enough to promise happy years to come with most judicious policy he reigns supports the good the bad his power restrains remembering well his masters last command he signs all orders with cleoras hand cleora bright as the approaching day when fair aurora does her beams display and gilds the mountains with her blooming ray in her ten thousand graces revelling meet the blowing rose not half so lovely sweet she looked as if her eyes commanded fate formed equal to her great imperial state yet on her soul a yielding softness sat and noble angiers was her chiefest care on him she smiled with a familiar air tried every way that might his griefs redress oblige the count and make that passion less with all delights that prudence could afford or palace yield in the absence of its lord sometimes with rural sports they would chase the hind whose nimble feet seem to outstrip the wind then dancing balls and masquerades and plays with these they wast the nights and cheerful days with these delights cleora kindly strove to drive from angiers breast all former love abroad they prosper couriers daily bring news of success both by the prince and king now in the height of bliss just angiers stood supreamly great and more supreamly good yet short the joys which humane souls allure nor can we make our happiness secure vain man as well on sand may structures lay as hope to fix his fate in mouldering clay a thousand accidents frail life attend and mortals only know that life must end our paths seem hid in the dark book of fate the doom once past precaution comes too late so luckless angiers thoughtful bold and wise esteemed his court another paradise yet to his cost the noble hero found ten thousand snakes beneath the enameled ground had he foreseen his fate though but in dreams he must have died at terror of the scenes which thus began cleora orders sends to the count her councellor and best of friends to her appartment he must straight repair for business of importance waits him there with have and loyal zeal the victim came dressed like loves goddess was the princely dame her eyes had equal brightness equal flame her mantle azure filled with stars of gold and shining jems adorned each curious fold careless thrown scarce covered half her breast but to the wondering eye exposed the rest choice garlands crowned her lovely flowing hair yet seem to lose their luster planted there the rose not half so fresh the lilly half so fair supinely on a glorious couch she lay as she would rival the bright lamp of day her head she leaned upon her snowy hand whilst angiers kneels to hear her dread command the bright attending nymphs that round her wait retire not pry into affairs of state when thus the charming princess silence broke and with a smile to faithful angiers spoke arise my noble lord and seat you there for i have much to say and you must hear you once did feel great loves tyranick reign and sure must kindly sigh when i complain the dauphin writes the wars will take much time and me neglected leaves in beauties prime hard fate a sacrifice to public voice i never knew the priveledge of choice when in my fathers court the wondering crowd still gazed and poets sung my praises loud they haild my youth and wished me all delights but i am condemned to care and widdowd nights the sad reverse of all their blessings prove and must conclude the dauphin does not love the flattering world and each reflecting glass owns matchless glorys in this injured face forgive me if i break our sexes laws when wronged we may assert our right our cause speak angiers were i circled in thy arms would thou for camps forsake loves softer charms up to her cheeks a conscious blush straight flies and thousand cupids revelld in her eyes angiers arose with reverence profound began nor raised his fixed eyes from the ground most divine princess you may rest assured you are the treasure of your absent lord by glory torn from loves delightful chains yet in his heart alone cleora reigns oh had you heard the tender charge he gave of you his lifes reward to me his slave you never could his constancy suspect but call that violence which now you term neglect scarce could the fair her soft confusion hide and half composed she blushing thus replied to angiers then did he cleora leave for that one act i all his faults forgive to angiers freely i my self resign too sure i am his heaven make the hero mine what racking fires are these that fill my breast my soul distract and rob my eyes of rest oh turn not from me since too much i have said and the soft secret of my soul betrayed if i am refused death is the punishment but love and pleasure wait on kind consent down at her feet the trembling angiers fell his terror and surprise no tongue can tell his faulters not knows which way to begin the princess he reveres abhors the sin it is a hard task superiors to reprove and mighty virtue to resist such love amazed he spoke in the mildest phrase he could instructs the charming princess to be good then cried what frenzys this that dares control the noble greatness of cleoras soul youre born supreme your lots are paired above bounded by fate from an inferior love the dauphin first of men alreadys yours by right divine his lawful claim secures i own ye beauteous as the blooming may fair as the first ever nature knew decay still in your looks you wear all conquering charms but these are destined for my masters arms i would give my body to consuming flame leave any other blot upon my name ever wrong in you that royal masters fame she rose with fury and would hear no more disdain now worked her boiling spirits over those eyes shot fire that languishd love before she starts then paused and with a scornful smile foretold the mischiefs and intended guile the count who knew no ill suspected none blushed for her shame and wished himself alone when straight she threw her mantle on the ground her garland tore her curling hair unbound then seizing angiers with a scream of woe cried murder villain traitor let me go the voice of terror through the palace flies followed still with loud incessant cries help all oh help or lost cleora dies all have and swift as thought the apartments filled where on the flore the princess they beheld the injured earl confused and pale they view this turn robbed him of speech and reason too when false cleora reared her weeping face and beauty gave to sorrow double grace look on the base perfidious man she said by whom the dauphin and youre all betrayed trusting his faith i charged him to declare the affairs of state and business of the war the conference strict secrecy required my waiting servants by command retired but ever he half the dauphins will declared seized on my hand around like madness stard and cried the regent princess now is mine she shall her honor or her life resign for i am wild with loves ungoverned rage possession only can my flame assuage with the surprise i scarce could raise my breath to call your aid which has secured from death who could suppose the raising of the dead might see the amazement that each face overspread none but the wicked this sad tale does please nor dare his enemies his person seize alone disgraced he to his palace goes and there reflects on his malicious foes thinks on the weight of his pretended crimes resolves to fly his coming fate betimes for if he should declare h innocence and on the princess cast the black offense the laurels which the prince abroad did gain would wither all at the unhappy stain resolved alone the rigorous fate to bear and own the guilt rather than layt on her his speedy flight is straight condemned by fame and all ill tongues are busy with his name he takes two tender pledges wedlock gave the only treasure he had power to save with him ernesto flies faithful and just who long had served and never betrayed his trust thus the great man whom that same rising morn saw dressed in honors that such trust adorn with crowded levee and a waiting train all the gay pomps that can observance gain now stripped forsaken bare disgraced and lost wanders to find some hospitable coast and as he traveled toward the distant sea a dreadful light directs his doubtful way he views his castle blazing in one flame the fierce revenge of that invetrate dame unmoved he saw the structure tumble down and cried thou can not bury my renown in time perhaps my truth may come to light my fame outshine those towers that blaze so bright and the mistaken world though late may see a conspicuous virtue in unhappy me now in a cell they snatch a short repose soon as the sun the wakeful angiers rose his courage yet unshockd by adverse fate his noble suffering showed him truly great but oh when he beheld his little pair the mothers darlings and the fathers care in vain upon their nurse and servants call the floods so long restrained in torrents fall at their sad wants he could no more forbear indulged his grief with many a pitying fear the tender charge who thus awaked his care a little son and lovely daughter were both beauteous seemed as formed by hands divine the parents graces in the infants shine lewis the son a charming sprightly boy the first dear fruit of angiers nuptial joy his other hope his darling daughters name was  sacred still to fame the helpless infants the wronged angiers viewed their woes the dear marias lost renewed dashed by despair and groveling on the earth cursed the malignant star that ruled his birth like some sad wretch long struggling for the shore he sinks and gives his hopeless labor over till old ernesto urged him to remove by that fond care and that paternal love if you neglect your princess wroth to fly then next prepare to see your children dye revenge will touch you in the tenderest part her rage will wound through theirs your manly heart he found twas vain to make a useless moan the father and the unhappy babes must on at length they calice reached and there they found a passage ship for neighboring england bound he gets an humble weed md poor disguise besmears his face and vai his noble eyes to shun the swift pursuit of eager enemies embarked he turns toward his native land though injured much he sighs to leave the strand and softly murmurs over his riged fate undone by love far worse than mortal hate yet still he bids the listening winds forbear nor waft the story to the dauphins ear for his sweet peace he barters all his own neglects the fame which did his actions crown wives errors on the husbands head remain to keep the dauphin clear he bears himself the stain cleora can thou have a peaceful thought whose lawless fires this mighty ruin brought poor angiers still pursued by his ill fate as if the winds joined with cleoras hate adverse they toss the vessel on the seas like his tempestuous mind no calm no ease these toils to old ernesto were unknown a gentle servitude his years did crown unable now in his declining age to act a longer part on this rough stage pale death the last retreat and sure relief came to his aid and ends his life and grief the gashly tyrant he seems joyd to meet and sinks beneath his troubled masters feet there was no need of this grieved angiers said will heaven still preserve the wrath it made why was this added to my misery that thou my poor ernesto too must die now of a sudden all the seas grow calm as if his grief had hushed the raging storm at length the fair white chalky cliffs they spy a joyful sight to every sailors eye only the earl who knows ot where to go alone expects variety of woe the travelers would fain his sorrows cheer inquire his name what course he meant to stear he answers with a sigh i cannot stray the wretched never fear to lose their way in the same ship a venerable man well marked the count and then with tears began whoever thou art says he within thy face is written spotted truth and matchless grace and thy young cherubs seem of heavenly race then haste thee stranger to our nations pride to that great mart where gaudy courts abide there if my foresight fail not thou shall find some noble britain to these infants kind ie view d him well then pressed him more to know good man he cried thou have a sceam of woe inquire no more but where i bid thee go his words emphatick struck an awe divine both priest and prophet in his vizage shine angiers unknown to london takes his way resolved the holy fathers voice to obey whereeer he goes there is no avoiding fate he to his sufferings finds no early date the public news his shameful story tells explores his crimes the dauphin wrath reveals his castles razed his lands confiscate were too poor amends for that offended fair a vast reward whoever shall angiers bring alive or dead to the revengeful king his race to endless exile they condemn and death to those who should these laws contemn i would sing my muse his woes in such a strain that no sad reader might from tears retrain sure all the generous worl must weep to see exalted virtue in such misery who can expres his fears and anxious care enough to raise distraction and despair when he looks back upon his prosperous days the pleasant paths and the delightful ways his youth had trod it racks his thoughtful brain his lot of grief he scarcely can sustain but piety forbids that he should heaven arraign he knows the only way to vanquish there is patience faith unmoved and servent prayer so to the temple flies that ancient pile which long had graced the city and the isle st pauls for stately pillars so renowned with all the beauties of the artist cround there he repairs and takes his children too in hopes their innocence may mercy woo stretched on the paveent wretched angiers lay and kneeling infants early taught to pray devotion done a lovely british dame with her attendants from the temple came the lord high marshals wife of brightest fame she stopped and not disdained to turn her eye toward him who bore such marks of misery she said my friend from whence and what art thou why hangs that cloud of sorrow on thy brow this little pair with beams of beauty shine i cannot think thee poor if these are thine yet speak declare what is thy cause of grief perhaps by me kind heaven designs relief oh wondrous condescension angiers cried the truly great are always free from pride madam i native am of neighboring gaul my parents honest though my portion small twas my hard fate superis to offend whose wrath no moderan knew nor end and i was placed too humble to contend i from my peaceful dwelling straight was hurled and bid to wander over an unknown world nor would they stop their cruel vengeance here but sorcd these babes my punishment to share too weak alas such mighty ills to bear she heard and pity filled her mind the too long cruel powers now made her kind with soft compassion and a gracious look to listening angiers thus the lady spoke if thou will give thy daughter to my care her breeding and her fortune shall be fair in virtues rules we will instruct her youth with love of modesty and sacred truth speak hen if to my words thou do agree inform her name and leave the child with me first up to heaven his watery eyes he reared and thanked the powers who thus his prayers had heard then to her oh thou bright pattern of thy charming sex blessed be thy days may no disquiets vex thy peaceful mind nor lengthened years perplex but all thy joys uninterrupted be thy life one scene of blessed prosperity florella is the name of the wretched child o may she virtuous prove her temper mild with a kind eye may you her actions view for you are parents now and mistress too with that he turned and bursted out a tear the infants parting look he could not bear the courteous dame to him a present gave and the poor babe to an attending slave in ancient times thus did they merit praise by noble acts their name and country raise few wanton dames no broken nuptial bed the wretched they relieved the poor they sed in deeds like this dwelt their renown of old no pride no falsehood no cursed love of gold but glory reigned in every britains soul no lurking vice their greatness durst control angiers returned still sad his heart still grieved to him the child is lost though thus relieved and as he measured out his pencive way he met the bard with whom he crossed the sea he hailed him thus lift up thy eyes from earth no sulien star oerruld thy childrens birth thy daughter now has reached the happy shore destructive fate has lost its poisonous power her innocence the planets hurt no more thy son good fortune shall attend his bloom and a long train of blessings press to come only thou many tedious years must wait ever thou shall conquer thy malignant fate on me be all their hateful

instruct me sir how i this youth may save from threatening ills which often the brave for i shall soon press to the peaceful grave there undisturbed may find that sweet repose so long denied by my too cruel foes instruct your son in his uncertain wa for truth divine shines forth in all you say then thus the bard amidst the western mountains where of old such warlike deeds of britains chiefs are told where merlin did his mighty art expose from whence his wonders and his fame arose the lord high president keeps there his court and fondly seeks the strangers kind resort the youths are there bred up to feats of arms thy lovely son has all those manly charms that will attract his eyes his fancy move and fix him to his soul with bonds of love farewell for i shall never behold thee more my tempest beaten age comes near the shore where wearied out i lay me down to rest when thought and care no more shall load my breast nor vainer objects my freed soul molest but upward mount through yon bright realms and see all the great maze of vast eternity the wondrous contemplation silence brought and he seemed lost in energy of thought then lift his eyes and blessed the believing pair but though entreated would no more declare he deemed the council sacred and from thence does his long weary pilgrimage commence often scraggy rocks and lofty mounts they meet where rising ground resists their willing feet then reached those britains so renowned of old of whom such famous actions have been told there as the prophet said the lovely boy the last the dearest hope of angiers joy at the first sight the president approved made him his care and soon he grew beloved soon angiers saw his happy son designed the darling of that court and humane kind this was an age when the renowned and great made wealth but serve them to assist the state when bountious nature had the groundwork laid their forming hand the worthy hero made like his own children angiers son was trained and from his patrons bounty arms and arts he gained in this was britains glory and her boast from discipline like this they raised a host then no industrious youth neglected lay but merit to preferment led the way lewis dposd as might advance his worth was called perotto to conceal his birth the dauphiness became the queen of france her pride and rage do with her power advance new proclamations all around she sends disgraces those who had been angiers friends he fears a stricter search will now be made nor stays he least his children be betrayed but hasts to find a more secure retreat from womans rage that is lasting as it is great distressed he quits fair albions courtous shore but leaves behind his all his valued store for whom he often does the heavens implore he with regret now leaves the lucky strand looks back and sighs as on his native land extremest griefs his suffering soul overflow and every breath declares incessent woe then he reflects on his malicious foe inhumane queen ah whether must i fly is there no way to escape thee but to die yes i would die throw off these servil chains did not our priests pronounce eternal ains to those who wearied out with lifes disease shall dare to cure themselves ever nature please fond fatal princess could thou see me now nor love nor rage would discompose thy brow thus lean and pail secure from being known i should move pity for a wretch undone and now my royal friend the dauphin reigns his subjects in their native right maintains and valor justice mercy grace the throne no injured wretch makes his impatient moan but all the gallick world the face of joy puts on it is only i that am debard of bliss nor can find rest without destroying his then let me never accuse the imperial dame but suffer still the punishment and shame he who had once a nation at command now seeks a master in hibernias land it was his fate a haughty lord to find fierce and severe nor could he bend his mind and he who in his mild and gentle sway his servants made through love not fear o bey no slaves to pride in plenty and in ease they lived content for twas no task to please yet their good masters diligent in vain faultless is chid nor dares he to complain not hebrew job at length to ills inured so much or half so patiently endured but now my wearied muse his woes sorsake begin another scene and turn the prospect back over pass the rolling years of flying time and show florella in her beauties prime divinely fair as the first eden maid ever she for knowledge innocence betrayed when in her eyes sat smiling every grace and the immortal bloom was on her face and bright unfullyd glories new creation grace only one son preserved the marshals line whose form was lovely and his soul divine his tour through france and italy had been and europes world the traveling youth had seen returned improved by skilful masters taught with all their language and their learning fraught pleasing his mean so gay but truly brave nor yet to vice or passion made a slave the courts delight for whom each lady strove and put on all her charms to make him love lord mandevil was now the only theme their daily pleasure and their nightly dream florella at a rural mantion staid left to the conduct of the lovely maid content with what her fortune did afford the virgin thought not of her new come lord the joyful parents showed their darling round and every pleasure his return had crowned then leave the town their country seat to view and with variety their joys renew soon as arrived florella duty paid but heaven how gazed the youth when he beheld the maid in all the realms that he had traveled over he thought he never had beauty seen before he sighed and looked and fastened there his eyes and scarcely could he hide the vast surprise she saw him fixed the doubtful virgin feared she had done some fault so blushing disappeared as if the sun had straight his beams withdrawn and left no gladsome ray no twilight dawn so seemed to him the place dark and forlorn when fair florella from his sight was gone absent her lovely form remained behind fixed was her image on his tender mind he soon inquired who the virgin was and smiling said she had a charming face the indulgent mother whose delightful aim was to please him from whom her pleasures came with graceful air the whole adventure tells and to his listening ears each circumstance reveals he blushed and sighed at what she did relate and cried it is sure some mystery of fate her looks do awe and admiration strike such charms from want not courts can show the like sure heaven mistook and with a hasty hand formed her a slave when it designed command the talk was changed but still his thinking soul was with the glorious bright idea full he strugled hard nor yielded to the snare but often cried she is not sure so fair besides her birth is mean not worth my care urged by desire a second sight he sought as if he would correct his former thought thus treacherous love draws the unwary on the more they gaze the more they are undone the pointed rays had filled his youthful breast the amourous fire his daring soul possessed and quickly grew too great to be suppressed the brave the soonest are to love inclined and love delights to sooth a generous mind in vain the youth with fated passion strove for every breast must yield to powerful love the sons of art no recipee have found in all their store to heal this pleasing wound had there in herbs or plants a balm been known the god of physic sure had cured his own he pines and sickens now with loves excess his sighs and languishings his pains confess his wonted sports grew tastless to his soul triumphant pashon all his joys control he hates the court shuns every charming fair they cannot please unless florellas there to some dark grot or melancholy grove the youth retires and breathes his hapless love there vents his killing griefs and there complains and only tells the silent trees his pains a little distance from the palace stood a stately shade of venerable wood which full a hundred years the seasons bore and reverend trunks with moss were covered over whose dusky shade defied the rays of light and spite of noondaybeams seem sacred still to night in this retreat the lovesick hero chose to nurse his flame and to indulge his woes florella too to solitude inclined but her amusements of another kind various theams delight her easy breast and no prevailing thought disturbs her rest pensive she walks to take the evening air at her approach the greens fresh verdure wear for her companion flowing horace chose and could her self harmonious airs compose officious love her wandering steps betrayed and brought the dispairing youth the lovely maid stretched on the earth beneath a maple shade as rooted there poor mandevil was laid his absent soul was waiting on his fair but sense and life returned as she drew near straight with convulsive transports he was seized at the surprise alarmed disturbed and pleased the modest maid blushing her lord espied obeisance made and turned her steps aside but when he saw the virgin haste away confused he rose and thus bespake her stay dear nymph you seem the goddess of this grove or what is more the immortal queen of love let that soft form a tender heart contain with pity hear a dying youth complain for mine are real woes and real pain these woods are witness to my constant flame each tree thy cipher bears though not thy name least jealous eyes the mighty secret find and to my charmer grow from thence unkind but when alone my tongue naught else will sound i reach the vaulted skies and pierce the hallow ground to ecchos care i send florellas name and kindly she reverberates the same oh do not look with such relentless eyes if youre unmoved your faithful lover dies all night on beds of down i restlessrave on this cold earth i measure out my grave it is you alone can help it is you alone can save the maid whose soul was suited to her birth with noble scorn raised her fair eyes from earth then with a voice majestic and severe thus spoke and gave the lovesick youth despair because i to your mothers bountious hand for food and raiment do indebted stand you think perhaps you may the slave command but though my lord my niggard stars denied me wealth and titles they have given me pride if from my wants your wanton hopes you frame know i prize honor and a virtous name my hearts unconquered and my soul unstained a fortitude by heaven it self maintained nor force nor flattery can my mind subdue behold me then great and resolved like you surpised at this the wretched lover cried if youre displeased i wish ere this i would died in my unhappy speech what have i said to offend my dear beloved bewitching maid beneath thy feet let me for ever lie or by your just commands condemned to die if against your honor i had least design my thoughts though they are kind are chaste as thine when of my love i make an offering with flames less pure then pious vessels bring when in their temple they sincerely pray and bright devotion at their altars pay may all my days and nights be dashed with woe nor ever the blessing of possession know may no selfjoys my longing wishes crown but curse me still with a remorsless frown never think i would destroy the worshipped shrine or wrong that honor which i court for mine it is hymens torch is my auspicious guide directs my love to seek you for my bride blessed with that hope i bear the pains of life i ask you not a mistress but a wife else on the instant would i quit this breath and seek my peace in the cold arms of death oh it would overwhelm my soul with black despair if after all my service all my care i did not hope to gain my charming fair florella cease to think my love a crime and let my faith be tried by that sure test of time enjoin me any thing that may convince of my flames durance and its innosence the greatest tortures i would undergo if you will except it and believe it so she listened now more calm and more sedate yet seemed resolved as the decrees of fate then thus replied such virtue sure has charms but i am placed inferior to your arms such honors might the most ambitious move who would not prize the treasure of your love but i am unworthy your exalted state and must except a more convenient fate let not ignoble fires your youth mislead with equal fortune grace your nuptial bed a father will direct you in your choice there is no true joys without the parents voice therefore no longer feed this fond desire but here in silence let your flames expire and that from guilt florella may remain that no ungrateful act her duty stain thus in the face of heaven firmly swear your ill placed passion i no more will hear except your fathers free consent you gain and reason tells you that attempt is vain for he is cold in his declining years a dowrless wifes the greatest ill he fears old men are always fond of darling gold still strive to grasp the earth they cannot hold amongst the great some wealthy fair adore consult with duty urge this suit no more then with redoubled haste she flies away he called in vain she woud no answer stay what pen can paint the sinner in despair when heaven regardless will not hear his prayer terrors like those the hopeless youth oppressed and filled the tortured mansion of his breast now he submits to healthdestroying grief bends down beneath he load nor seeks relief a deadly pale his youthful cheeks over spread continual sighs have chased from thence the red his languid eyes the cheerful light refuse and in pale fits their former luster lose scarce will this wanton age my tale believe a constant youth their vice would never forgive now love is grown the universal sport the men design to leave ever they begin to court fickle their natures roving their desire in various heats there is no real fire of old to one the passion was confined they would wait an age to make the fair one kind changings the mode a lover is a fool and to be very faithfuls to be very dull but to return to our kind aithful youth and all the wonders of is love and truth the mother does with careful eyes survey his griefs and finds a sencible decay she trys with all delights his soul to cheer and when he sighs cries out what ails my dear in vain her fondness the inquiry frames guesses in vain a thousand things she names fruitless her aid he still the wrack indures beneath the moon but one elixer cures that denied all other helps are vain he only with his life can end his pain a languid sickness makes his youth a prey and canker like eats the fine form a way apollos sons are bribed to use their art to save this darling of the mothers heart their cordial juilps they apply in vain they cannot cool the heat nor swage the pain who can the sighs the piercing woe express the fears which his sad parents souls distress his noble father crys his hopes are gone his name is lost his heir his only son but his great courage helps his grief to bear the lady seems distracted with her care sorrow no sleep no balmy peace allows and heaven she wearies with incessant vows no cheerful guest the wonted mirth maintains but through the house a solemn sadness reigns florella too who did these woes create in secret mourns the youths unhappy fate blames the cross star that had to love inclined and made her cause the ills she never designed now at a stand are all the learned tribe they find it vain to visit or prescribe the active spirits weary of eir course and drooping life appears taind by force his servants all are drnd in black despair he only lost in thought seems void of fear reserved and cold to his officious friends he chides their care their diligence offends when in her turn the fair florella came the lovely source of this consuming flame he reared his dying eyes and faintly said come near thou too too lovely charming maid now see how pale and languishing i lie and still remember it is for you i dye death cold as your disdain comes over my bloom and ah sweet nymph in ages yet to come as none in beauty ever can rival thee so none in constancy shall equal me oh cruel fair hereafter prove so just when i am lost forgotten in the dust to all the listening swains my story tell proclaim how much i ovd how early fell no other way i would court a lasting fame but as loves victim eternize my name yes goddess the bright tract i have in view is that the world may say i died for you at this the tears fell from her conquering eyes and sighs uncalled from her fair bosom rise the fainting youth beheld the blushing maid and to his trembling lips her hand conveyed enough my first my everlasting dear i dye content since i am worth a tear he said no more the approaching friends might spair their useless aid for all the help was there amongst apollos sons that crowded there one to his skill added peculiar care resolves if art will do it to save the important heir upon his life he saw their opes depend nor unconcerned hea every mourning friend though some unmoved can see the parents cry lamenting wife or friend stand sighing by and gravely answer man was born to dye when they perhaps have hastened natures date and lay their own mistake on guiltless fate but this with utmost care consulted health like generous garth aimed not alone at wealth the mean the great his equal influence find as sent by heaven to heal and bless mankind in him the graces with the arts combined like poetry and wealth but seldom joined yet here they triumph all while he with ease can charm relieve and conquer a disease a stranger to the new fantastic way which dresses first and bids the dying stay he weighed each c rcumstance ever gave his vote took not the common way and killed by rote and by his nice observances could find the body struggling with a tortured mind healthful reluctant to the imperial sway contending still unwilling to obey no ctive fever lodged within his blood the sullen soul denied the body food and sighs and sorrow robbed his eyes of rest he sooths the griefs which his sad mind oppressed seeing him thus resolvd the ill to endure and that he neither strove nor wished a cure the only care must be to search the wound there is no receipt has power till that be found he waits and watches the slow passing sand though bid retire he minds not the command but still observes and grasps his feeble hand the pulse was low as at the bb of life and weakened nature rce maintained the strife when fair florella to the chamber came sent by his mother that dispairing dame straight the male ministers fetch nimble strokes and fresh vermillion died his languid looks new strength new vigor now his eyes inspired and glowing cheeks with conscious blushes fired relapsed again soon as the nymph retired the wise physician this with judgment weighed he found the youth was dying for the maid h e smiling rose and hastened to depart and murmured to himself how vains our art we have no medicine for a lovesick heart he left the room th inquiring mother flys to ask what hopes examines first his eyes longing the truth to know yet truth she sears her trembling voice is choked with rising tears says he i long have viewed your deep concern and studid much your sons disease to learn what led his youth toward an untimely grave and why my drugs now lose their power to save in vain my utmost art and care i use my medicines all their healing power lose and the sick youth does all releif refuse at this amazed at length i truly guest some pain hid in the closet of his breast there like destructive fire in secret mines consumed his strength and baffled our designs the impatient mother interrupted now surpised she cried can there be ought below my darling son eager as li requires and wait not i too crow his fond desires it is love he then red has racked him long love that delightful torture of the young the worlds great lord subduer of the strong the subtle fire has pierced his aching heart and drinks his vital blood with ceasless smart his les a prey to the all powerful flame unless he is cured from whence the torment came and is there then she haughtily replied a dame too great to be lord mandvils bride why pines my son upon the wrack of love when to be his each charming nymph has strove name but the fair who bears such conquering eyes be sure my lord high marshal gains the prize how great soever her noble parents be my son can boast descent with any she the blood that fills his veins from either source has a glorious spring and untaunted course titles and flowing wealth his name adorn what cruel nymph can pay him back with scorn then the good man whose speeches only tend to calm her wrath and to preserve his friend went on if thus head placed his love why should he mourn or fear your kind consent or her return but if forgot the honors of his race he doats upon a beauteous form and face of birth unknown though most divinely fair whose utmost glory is to be your care his reason by his conqug love betrayed and the sad choice is ath or that bright maid i need not now prounce her well known name there is but one can kindle such a flame the mother said what ills must i endure ever my stern lord will yield to such a cure for this misfortune he will me upbraid because i succord first the tender maid virtue and grace florella does possess my cruel lord builds there no happiness however my utmost tears and prayers i will try it is better far to see him hers than dye this spoke she hasts to find her mourning lord in the softest phrase her language could afford with moving tears the unhappy tale relates often blames her son but more the cruel fates that thus ordained to rob their souls of rest to lose the youth by whom their age was blessed or give consent she sighed that ills the least her soothing softness could not stop his rage nor gentle showers his mad fury swage from his fierce eyes the fiery tempest came tumultuous passion set him in a flame let him then dye he cried ever thus disgrace his name oh barbarous sound oh most unnatural breath she said to doom an only son to death when first my lord to me your vows you paid how often you wished me born some humble maid that you might greatly prove your generous fire and grieved your fortunes could not raise me higher had i been so you the same risque had run then oh forgive your too too amourous son yet all her pleading agonies were vain her unperswasive griefs could only gain that she might sooth her son in his destructive pain that she with hopes might lull his cares a sleep make promises which he never meant to keep with this dear cordial to the youth she flies sits down and views him with the kindest eyes he sighed and begged she would his faults forgive and cried dont ask your wretched child to live nor torture thus my soul to see you grieve your blessing on your hapless son bestow excuse the debt i to your goodness owe it is a vast sum which i can never pay yet i will rather dye than disobey weeping the lady spoke oh thankless child oh most ungrateful boy too well thou know thou art alone my joy thy death will my remains of life destroy therefore no more of thy false duty boast when you indulge the ill by which my peace is lost since after days and nights of wracking pain scarcely to be endured or thought again since the first happy hour the gladsome morn when the wished news went round a son was born i have indulged thee every anxious year no mother ever such tenderness did bear why do thou then distract me with despair upon my love and pain thou never look back nor the successive cares which i did take so forward still the eager streams are born and to the nursing fountain rarely turn he only groaned here let my life have end too long i have lived such goodness to offend she could not bear the grief she saw him feel feared to increase the pangs she meant to heal then mildly with a softer air began and kindly cheered her poor dejected son thy fathers hopes and mine are built in thee his pride thou art and every wish to me yet cautious youth in this you are to blame you do not prize aright a mothers name but hide from me your very best of friends the secret woe on which your life depends whilst your physician the true cause displays and says it is inward grief your youth decays officious fool the pensive son replied his nauseous draughts he longer should have tried not the dear secret of my soul impart and thereby show the weakness of his art oh mandevill his mother mildly said confess the truth i will no more upbraid for now his care thy wishes have betrayed thy healthful bloom let grief no more devour but seek my aid and trust another power what silent still will naught your spirits cheer go quickly one and call florella here look up my son and now believe me kind i have brought the balm for thy distempered mind your life in balance we this choice prefer your only tasks to live and conquer her too much transported at this change of fate he cried your proffered kindness is too late the mighty tides of joy come on too fast and weakened life is gone too far to last a dreadful sound adds terror to their fears and fills the room with piercing shrieks and tears the mother from the pillow snatched her son and cried help all or i am lost undone then on her breast the darling youth she laid and bid florella bring her useful aid he strait revived at touches of the maid then conscious what transporting joy had done he blushed at what extravagance he would shown and she as if the fault had been her own this was his crisis this the lucky hour and death and sickness quit malignant power now winged with joy the happy minutes flew he still beheld the fair and still the sigh was new soft tales of love he whispered in her ear not so reserved butshe seemed pleased to hear and when he begged she would his fears remove and bless him with that charming sound i love her tongue was silent but her eyes proclaim she loved the youth and caught the infectious flame his health returned and every blooming grace revives and sparkles in its wonted place with transports in his mein and raptures in his face a new respect was to florella paid all hailed with joy the beauteous happy maid throughout the land was spread her wondrous fame each sonnet raised new trophies to her name with such a grace as scarce can be believed these flowing honors the fair nymph received the courtly youth now envied mandvill more for this rich prize than what his titles bore paint now the pleasures of the happy pair whose joys were innocent and most sincere from garden grots to purling streams they rove endless their talk and all that talk was love new raptures still from conversation grow ten thousand joys which only lovers know such sancyd bliss her charming presence brings the blessed transported youth looks down on kings implores that hymen make his joys secure and tie that knot which does for life endure those were the sun shine days when cupid played and every laughing hour was joyful made they dreamed not of the black approaching shade mankind when he injoys the smiles of fate but vainly thinks to fix a prosperous state and when ill fortune does his life attend as vainly fears his woes will never end alas it is foolish all our lifes a dream and every season has its changing scene fearless supine and blessed with sweet repose the lovers were when unthought storms arose the father to his closet takes his son and with an air severe his speech begun i would know when you will quit this sluggish pace when banished honor reassumes its place and you maintain the glory of your race is not thy fancy sated foolish boy love is a sweet designed to please and cloy nor meant the nobler facultys to employ license i gave to the ignoble fire that thou might glut thy insatiate desire and feed like some illmannerd eager guest till thou grew sick and loathed the luscious feast nay turn not pale thou can not change my mind nor think i ever otherwise designed the impatient son then eagerly replied under loves vail could you such baseness hide compelled by duty i have heard too long the sacred business of my love you wrong florellas virtue is above your thought nor would the jem with all your wealth be bought for the fair maid good angels be her guard may her just worth still meet a just reward kind providence preserve her youth from harm oh may she ever live and live to charm his father was enraged at this reply the father said and with a stern tremendous voice did cry audacious boy and durst thou to my face bless one born for thy shame and my disgrace go to the grave and hide thy abject flame could hope i would give to her a daughters name or vainly think i would thy choice applaud though i did yield to a fond mothers fraud i would rather see thee and thy sorcress dye than to the marriage but in thought comply he calmly answered enough my lord your furious rage give over take your sons word you will hear of this no more with looks composed he left the hateful room nor could his father guess the fate to come no image of delight now fills his mind he never can hope to make his father kind deep struggling griefs his doubtful thoughts oppressed all day no dawn of peace all night no rest tortured with pains too great to be expressed disturbed he walks revolving in his breast what course he should his wretched footsteps stear that most might show his love and his despair florella feared him weary of his flame nor gay nor pleased he to her toilet came no tuneful airs her gentle slumbers break no songs salute her ever she is well awake and sweet melodious notes composed for her dear sake nor one soft billet deaux so kind does prove to whisper the dear tale of truth and love if she approach he hangs his pensive head his looks strait change from pale to glowing red he sighs as if around destruction fell and his full eyes a fatal story tell these boding symptoms fright the charming fair who finds when love does faithful breasts ensnare they are wracked with jealous fears and every tender care retired alone she softly does complain and wishes for her former peace in vain reflects upon her hours of downy rest before enchanting love that cruel guest usurped with tyrant power her milder breast oh happy days she said from passion free when all was peace and calm felicity if eager joy i neither wished nor knew i lived without the pain and pleasure too oh happy state of cold indifference blessed in that seeming want of nicer sense whom nothing pleases nothing gives offense no fierce pursuit their thoughtless minds employ they feel no sorrow as they taste no joy in bounds the stagnate waters sullenlye no tempest raises them like mountains high whilst curling waves formed by the rapid stream can never rest nor ever be serene oh friendless maid if he unkind should prove or so untrue but to dissemble love and i the public talk the public jest become of every meeting every feast but hold there is something tells me i am born above their laughter and above their scorn yes mandvill if thou disdainst thy humble victory know i can triumph too and bravely dye thus her dispairing fears her hopes oercame thus she accused her lord and cursed the fatal flame whilst love alone possessed young mandvills mind to give the greatest proof he now designed and quit the waiting grandeur of his birth and with his love forsake the glories of the earth for since florella is denied his wife he will wed himself to a monastic life and though within his own dear native land many fair abbyes do inviting stand gardens and groves delightful to the eye as if they meant to sooth austerity the best of all the realm the priests still chose they looked as if designed for soft repose but we are to believe they watch and pray and tears and penance wear their hoursaway these he avoids least power his will restrain and force him from their convent home again in france he means to find some lovely cell and there in solemn silence ever dwell now all things for his voyage he provides but from his dearest friends the secret hides the marshal daily tables did ordain the weary traveling pilgrims to maintain who always found a welcome there refresht with hospitable food the gracious donor blessed like one of these his son designed to dress and scape unknown amidst the thronging press thus his designs the wandering scene had laid and thus the hapless youth himself betrayed not to his love he would his thoughts reveal yet could not part without a last farewell though twas a pang that life could hardly bear for her to health and life he did prefer nothing beneath the sun he held so dear he to the beauteous nymphs apartment went pains in his heart and looks of discontent he found her reading to divert her mind twas ariadnes prayers breathed to the wind when faithless theseus left the fair behind he took the book and when he saw the place a burning blush flew to his lovely face she forced a smile and cried what find you there that in your cheeks such signs of guilt appear said he had theseus been compelled to go to purchase fame and fight a distant foe and left the nymph in some blessed happy place would that and sighed not alter much the case if left the maid replied though in a palace where she bore command twoud soon grow hateful as the barren sand since there is no amends for perjured love no pleasures will the bitter pain remove heaven it self takes cognizance of broken vows and its strict justice there no mercy shows whither oh whither do thy speeches lead with dying eyes the tortured mandvil said do thou unjustly think thou art betrayed me my florella me do thou accuse or tax with perjured love or broken vows do not my sufferings dwell upon thy mind oh thou too killing fair and too unkind know that in all the tales of love thoust found no heart with greater truth was ever crowned my thoughts have still been fixed my eyes never straid since first loves mighty laws my soul obeyed and if my adverse stars such woe ordains that i am still condemned to endless pains if i am doomed to lose what i hold dear a punishment which nature cannot bear add not my fair to the too cruel weight but think it is the hard necessity of fate ah little little of my pangs you know nor kindly guess the wracks i under go the rending grief that tears my laboring heart when i with you and all my joys must part such woes as these fond nursing mothers feel to see their infants on the soldiers steel such piercing pain when we behold from far the vessel sink where all our treasures are yet these sad woes compared to mine are small a parting lovers grief exceeds them all must we then part she said oh most unkind and for what wretched place am i designed friendless forsaken must i wander now or to some new imperious mistress bow ye unauspicious stars that ruled my birth why was i formed why did i crowd the earth when no provision for my life was made and not one place my own to rest my head let not such thoughts affright thy tender mind here thou shall stay my mother will be kind that parent for the other does atone she mild as doves he hard as petred stone my charmer she thy life will easy make and love florella for her mandvils sake she answered why such disjointed thoughts do you express you will leave me yet talk of happiness ruin thee surely my ruin is designed by fate and mustlove more destructive prove than hate why my calm virgin hours did you molest flatter me with possession of your breast make me exchange my peace for this unrest if still he cried i do not love thee more than greedy misers gold or monarchs power than sick men ease the happy lifes increase towns beseigd relief or pious matrons peace if thou art not my joy my life my health prized like my soul my only valued wealth then send just heaven upon my perjured head ten thousand plagues and strike me with em dead but oh my fair my hope my only wish a father stands twixt me and happiness deceived in his dissembled false consent whose specious words disguised a foul intent in rage he bid me quench my faithful flame in terms so vile my soul abhors to name i often have heard your cruel fatal vow your virtue no stolen marriage will allow therefore we must for ever everpart why do i live why do thou hold my heart why does not fate quick sure destruction bring burst tortured natures ties and break each trembling string why when lifes tedious march was almost over was i brought back to suffer on the shore my cruel father worse than death destroys death is a good when lifes bereft of joys cease my loved lord the fair florella cried would i had never been born or born that moment died all things to your kind family i owe and in return curses alone bestow i will go where you shall never behold me more and with my absence former peace restore peace without thee the doting youth replied no griefs will all my days and nights devide despair and sorrows all my restless hours betide since from what my soul desires i am debarred forgive my earnest suit nor think it hard i beg you never will yield to a new lovers charms for i should dye to see you in anothers arms and as my first last dear with lovely you i bid the world and all your sex adieu so let me hope that snowy virgin breast will never entertain another guest if i have first your heart to love inclined oh still preserve me in your chaster mind will ye be so kind can these tears persuade the fairest nymph that ever nature made can she for the poor hapless mandvills sake resolve a lasting leave of all mankind to take it looks like sullen pride i must confess that i should others bar of happiness but oh impute it to my loves excess grant this my charming dear my hearts desire the only suit that i shall ever require like sorrows image then he silent stood and strove in vain to hide the falling flood pale at her feet the dying hero fell and let those signs of grief his inward sorrows tell distressed she raised him with her lovely hand and cried what would my lord his slave command oh poor return for all his wondrous love that to no other youth i kind should prove without injunction i would have made that vow immortal passion is your merits due no maid can love again after once loving you no thou dear idol of my conquered soul thy empire in my breast no power shall ever control each tender wish i will dedicate to thee for wheresoeer confined still thought is free and mine shall ever faithful ever constant be oh for my sake each desperate purpose shun if thou art lost florella is undone with patience let us our misfortunes wait and hope from innocence a better fate he with glad pleasure listened to the fair his heart rejoiced to hear her love and care yet still resolves his purpose to pursue and meant this visit for a last adieu he could not take his longing eyes away but rooted stands and adds another moments stay another and another to the mighty sum grudges the past and fears the rest to come at length he clasped her in his faithful arms and said thou mistress of eternal charms remember mandvill thou soft lovely maid and let no scandal on my name be laid my love was pure from thought of interest free virtue i sought found the rich jem in thee more worth than boundless heaps of hoarded gold or gaudy titles which are bought and sold a mighty stock of beauty nature gave beauty that would all humane kind enslave judge then my fair the wrack such worth to leave he said no more but forced himself away with sighs that did his truth and pangs betray the nymph distracted knew not what to guess but found ill fate on every side did press whilst secret means for his escape he made and trusting none could be by none betrayed his pilgrim weed to all unknown he bought and to his chamber undiscovered brought and sends his page on errands several ways that must detain tke youth the space of many days then leaves the key of his own private chest and says when he returns therein his wills expressed so fitted for the purpose when alone his robe throws off and the poor weed puts on with a false beard and hair he hides his face and amongst the traveling pilgrims takes his place with them he passes through the house unknown leaves the gay pompous roof designed his own to search some dismal melancholy cell some caves where sorrows self would choose to dwell oh mighty love behold look down and see this glorious victim sure is worthy thee and if over mortals thou would still maintain dispotick sway and undisputed reign this story in thy annals still preserve from him let constant lovers learn to serve his birthright left the honors of his name a wondrous tale fit for the book of fame let sighing virgins endless praise rehearse crown him ye poets with immortal verse ye shepherds and ye nymphs new songs ordain he was indeed the glory of the plain when a forsaken fair laments her friend if her complaints to exclamations tend name but this faithful youth and all her wrath shall end mandvill thy constancy thy worth alone shall for the falsehood of thy sex atone when amorous youths shall meet in plains or groves and there repeat the story of their loves thy lasting truth in all their songs shall shine thy eager love and constancy divine and each shall wish his fame may equal thine mean time florellas busy in her mind some quick expedient she resolves to find her mandvill of his dangerous love to cure though she her hapless self the pain endure concludes to hide her in a living tomb forsake the world religious straight become sympathy gave to each the same design both meant to raise their love to that divine and aimed to show what mighty flames could do for each had vowed to bid the world adieu yet still they hid the secret working thought till the formed purpose to effect was brought mandvill succeeds in what he fears to own and with the holy pilgrims flies unknown now in her turn nights gloomy shades invest the ruddy glories of the shining west and weakened nature seeks recruit by rest when round the palace the inquiries pass who saw their absent lord and where he was near his appartment they expressed their care with dutious love expect to find him there he wants no service from officious hands they wait in vain for his desired commands when darkness came they could no more forbear to the fierce marshal told their cause of fear with furious rage he to his lodging flies no locks nor bars the impetuous way denies but all is exposed to his inquiring eyes sad trembling fears the mothers steps retard complains the cruel powers have no regard to worth but hinders mortals of their wished reward when entered soon their busy search does find him gone his scattered garments left behind a thousand fears they in their fancy frame and many dangers which they dare not name in this distress each meddling fool grows wise the helpless still are readiest to advise with flying speed florellas sent for there pale looked the virgin almost dead with fear to their demands she could no answer give but that he seemed to take an everlasting leave his lady cried this did my soul presage see now the effects of your too cruel rage we are childless left in our declining age your boundless wrath destroyed a faithful pair and heaps on me the terrors of despair could this fair weeping maid create offense has she not charms enough in truth and innocence to match with so much virtue no disgrace they to your joy might have brought forth a race to uphold the honors of your name and place but now your hoarded wealth your seats and lands will fall to some ungrateful strangers hands and i shall curse my prudence and my care compelled with the effects to bless some foreign heir stung with reproach and loss the marshal swore if he would return to oppose his love no more that his fixed flame should be with joys repaid and he would yield his son to that allcharming maid if with strict search that son can ever be found for which the servants are dispatched around he binds his promise with a solemn vow that the wished marriage freely he will allow nor by reproach his passion disapprove but crown his constancy with lasting love thus does affection bend the stubbornst mind pierced with the smart turns pious and grows kind each road they take and pry with eager eyes but miss their lord unknowing his diguise they only find the page and force him home examine often where his loved masters gone the affrighted boy the truth of all reveals his lords commands and secret letter tells his cabinet is in a moment brought and there with ease they find what they had sought to florella this inscribed the letter eer this my dear will reach thy lovely hand i shall have ever left my native land cast out from thee no matter where iroam the tryals over ive suffered all at home to rough unpolished cells i now retire and leave behind fond hope and fierce desire yet love will there maintain a languid flame like lamps in tombs though useless burn the same did my florella now her pilgrim view shed own the wonders mighty love can do woud say i in this parting suffered more than ever wretched mortal did before did she my trembling and my tortures see im sure she would pity and remember me mandvill   the virgin faints as she the letter read like dewy roses hangs her drooping head their search again renewed they take their way to all the ports that lay along the sea and that their message may his flight prevent blessed news they bring to give his mind content his fathers letters full of kind consent his better fate oerruld that working sea and for a wind the waiting pilgrims lay now the general cry was all aboard just as the men arrived and found their lord rejoiced amazed and filled with glad surprise delight and wonder strugld in their eyes his were cast down ashamed of his disguise great minds are constant to their purpose still and take from fate a disappointment ill resolved he held a ponyard to his breast and said my friends i am not now in jest my fathers will i own i should obey but love over duty has imperial sway you force my certain death if you come on i own my self a most ungrateful son but quitting that beloved illustrious maid with double punishment my faults are paid affrighted they the headstrong passion wait and scarce could cool this most intemprate heat at length they humbly did their letters give begged he would hear and be at peace and live he reads his parents with a double joy his rising fears his raptures did destroy till fair florellas hand and signet came she fixed his hopes twas sacred with her name and thus her letter spoke her kind concern return my dearest faithful lord return give me not endless cause your loss to mourn can you pretend you love and yet prepare for your florella worse than death despair oh most unkind could you for ever go and let not me your fatal purpose know if with a flame sincere your heart does burn i charge you by that sacred flame return so royal mandates the last hour arrive when pitying queens bid malefactures live with such vast joy the innocent and brave receives the only cordial that had power to save forgets the penance that his soul designed and with his garb resumes a cheerful mind by her command his speed outflies the wind a general joy through all the house is spread welcome as if our voice could raise some darling dead his father speedy marrage does command and joins in his the fair florellas hand yet there is a fixed regret he is forced to hide so much the marrage mortifies his pride not so the mother that kind british dame she likes the maid and well approves the flame what is their concern to the glad lovers bliss all day they gaze and talk and vow and kiss till that dear joyful long desired morn that day which mandvill thinks will years adorn is come when charming bridal virgins wait and jolly youths throng to the palace gate then bright florella lovely as the rose ten thousand glorys in her eyes disclose by curious art decked in the british pride to wondering crowds appeared the fairest bride that ever famed alhion graced in all her store so bright a nymph was never seen before then the bridegroom gay as the eastern sun yet seemed in haste and wished his race were run challenged his shining rival of the day and bid him hasten toward the ebbing sea paid all his vows to sacred solemn night his prayers the sober footed matron do invite and calls her darkning gloom his hearts delight at length the happy joyful day is past and the dear welcome shades are come at last new sports the longing bridegrooms joys retard farce and dance which have but small regard he hasts to the last scene the gaudy bed with indian odours native roses spread each busy hands employed to undress the fair no need of sweets when young florellas there how many fears the blushing virgin awe she knew not what she said nor whom she saw blessed mandvill comes my muse the curtain draw leave now in perfect bliss the happy pair and let perotto next become thy care in all that court he was the youth alone whose acts immortal fame and endless glory crown in sports or in great exercise of war then all the rest he still exceeded far his mothers beauty and his fathers grace was stamped upon the lovely heros face kind fortune did his glorious youth befriend and all he undertakes success does still attend judgment and piercing wit which all approve and various charms to gain an universal love the president who did his title grace had bounteous nature blessed with numerous race all things in court wear an auspiceous face and that experience may his arms advance he is sent a volentier to serve in france such strange adventures does blind fortune bring unknown he treads his native shore defends his king but whilst exposed he courts an early name and with expense of blood secures that darling fame at home a pestelential sickness rages round destructive mists ascend thick vapors from the ground the unwholesome blasts does man and beasts confound perotto heard their state and evil case and quickly flies to the infected place rumor but half the desolation spoke twas such a scene as noblest hearts might break that palace which he gaudy left and gay now midnight silence reigned at noon of day a cause that did incessent grief afford death had destroyed his patron and his lord and all his sons with whom he had been bred even all the heroic youths were dead cammilla the only daughter still survived and in the midst of this destruction lived so tender plants do sometimes brave the storm when oaks and towers are from their basis torn she lived indeed but shut from humane eyes for bove her life she did her father prize that being near her dead and dying race she was confined in the infected place and she whose form did all the world delight is shunned like death or some destructive spright till to the place the bold perotto came he loved and danger but increased his flame through all the avenues eagerly he flies still complicated horror meets his eyes and noisome steams from the unburied dead arise here lifted hands in vain for help do call the servant at his masters feet does fall in one promiscuous heap lay old and young the rich the fair the healthful and the strong then angry heaven sends the destroyer forth who can express the terrors of his wrath the plague with rapid force devouring rage seems as twoud clear this crowded busy stage of all that thinking stock of humane kind infects the body sinks the forming mind despair and black ideas fill the soul such thoughts as all religion would control all ties are broke the fathers flies the sons the mother from her bosomed infant runs dire hate in each infected breast presides and new made bridegrooms shun their charming brides deaths grown so common none will shed a tear nature and love are both overcome by fear only perotto he his fair will save or else in worse than charnels find a grave amidst these ruins bright cammilla fate expecting still her tender parents fate perotto comes implores that she would leave that wretched place and fly with him and live at first she would not believe her weeping eyes and viewed perotto with a strange surprise art thou come she said to this house of death approach not least i infect thee with my breath shun this contagious and destructive air i am a prey to sickness sorrow and despair with untaught sighs the lover made reply consent with me your faithful slave to fly or give me leave to stay with you and dye dread of these horrors soon the point does gain and with those few that did alive remain they quit the castle for the open plain perotto skilled in business of the wars a ten for fair cammilla strait prepares and though their little troops infected round he from their sight nor touch no danger found whether love with his all powerful dart and burning flames secured his manly heart filled all and for contagion left no room or whether fates decree deferred his doom with cheerful health the faithful youth was blessed with strength and ardent power to serve the rest bleak winter now with nipping frost draws near courted desired and hollow winds that clear the hot unwholesome and polluted air thinly the peopled towns appear again the ruined clime begins to look serene the untilled lands again the laborers care and temples now resound with praise and prayer nobles to long deserted houses come and straight invite the brave perotto home for having learned his honor love and truth they court cammilla to espouse the youth and that he may not want deserving grace adorn his merit with her fathers place cammilla pious just and truly good his worth and her obligements understood besides the meddling world might tax her fame and fix some blot on her unsullid name when she with him fled to preserve her life twoud stain her honor not to be his wife it is done in solemn pomp the knot is tied the great cammilla is unknown perottos bride oh angiers thus providence makes up what thou did lose no better fortune if thy self had chose that guiding fate which does our steps direct we fall not by it but our own neglect we tread forbidden paths without a guide it is not heavens fault but our own selfish pride thus man is cursed with what we call free will in error lives and wondrous prone to ill why were we made why from our unsought birth are the immortal seeds condemned to earth why do we think and judge above the bruits yet gain no farther knowledge by disputes why endless bliss and torments do we frame yet cannot give the joys nor punishment a name happy alone that thoughtless mortal lives who feeds on faith and as the church believes who never wrong commits and whose calm breast no deep inquiry makes to break his rest this man my muse pronounces truly blessed ye undistiuguishd notions hence begone let us to our story let our tale go on thus angiers race are in due honors placed with plenteous wealth and shining glory graced now my muse the fathers woes depaint the various hardships of that suffering saint who twenty years remained in servile state with patience bore the rude insults of fate humble in sorrow in affliction wise conformed his actions to that base disguise as on the lowly flowr he sleeping lay heaven to his working thought this vision did display his room seemed filled with darling light divine immortal rays with glorious splendor shine scarce could his humane eyes the brightness bear the darting beams shown forth so radient clear when in a garment of unspotted white too heavenly fair for earthly mortal sight close by his side the reverend hermit stood who twice had taught him for his childrens good and with a voice whose sweetness charmed his ear thus spoke bid him his words observe and hear from the eternal realms of endless light where there is no shadow of approaching night where all with beatifick joys are crowned where sin and sorrows never to be found but bliss and praises take their tuneful round from thence by gracious providence i am sent to cheer thee in thy race of punishment to tell thee thy reproach draws near an end and pitying heaven will thy last years befriend angiers again to courteous albion have good fortunes welcome if it comes at last thy daughters there matched equal to her blood thy son magnificently great and truly good then thou again shall view thy native land again be raised in the state and fixed in high command from calumny and guilt discovered free and after all my son shall share those joys with me look up anticipate what shall hereafter be he saw ten thousand angels on the wing straight heard the loud immortal praises sing beheld the golden lyres felt melting strains that struck his soul and trembled through his veins the ecstasy for nature grew too strong nor could he bear the mighty vision long but as he strugld hard and would have spoke the weaker bands of flattering sleep were broke he waked and found it almost perfect day twas darkness when compared to the bright ray which late his soul and wandering eyes had seen the glorious transports of this heavenly dream to doubt the truth he deems a mortal sin parts with his cruel lord his voyage does begin safely he crossed the boisterous watery main and now beholds the british clifts again in pilgrims weed the noble earl was dressed begs all his humble food and where at night to rest to the marshals house directs his weary feet the first sad object his sad eyes did meet was violante led by her courtous lord with all the pomp such greatness does afford the gaudy scene of joy he scarce could bear to see his child so wondrous great and fair yet still no sign of gladness he betrays but humbly with his fellow pilgrims stays till summoned by the appointed servants call they press and fill the hospitable hall angiers distress his servitude and woe had turned his curling locks as white as snow his meagre face with many a wrincle ploughd and sun burned skin no former beauty showed the pilgrims fed and dinner taken away two lovely infants were brought forth to play kind heaven had blessed young mandvills marriage joys with two bright beauteous charming boys the children straight to the pilgrim angiers run as if they knew the root from whence they sprung he kissed them joy that stranger to his breast at their loved sight became once more his guest they walk with him and hang about his knees while he finds ways their childish hearts to please and when the time is come for their return when they their little studies must perform their masters call and servants ask in vain they will not the pilgrim leave nor to their books again the mother from within beheld this sight and smiled to see them in such high delight bid them their innocent desires obey and let them longer with the pilgrim stay then the stern marshal and his noble son walked cross the court and through that spacious room with a proud smile the scornful marshal cried there let em stay to beggary they are allied too near by the ignoble mothers side when that reproach poor suffering angiers heard the tears run down his cheeks and snowy beard young mandvill fumed his inward rage boiled over his father only durst his wife explore whom he with true devotion does adore mandvill the unknown pilgrim thus bespake what sorrows thine is it for the childrens sake know then thou good old man whose tender heart is moved i feel than thee a greater smart in the reproach the little babes are mine all virtues in the charming mother shine of birth unknown the tales too long to tell raised by my love she wears her honors well no power nor pomp oersways her steady mind she is justly great yet affable and kind forgive me father unawares he said that on this subject i so long have staid florella merits more than i can say more faithful love than my whole life can pay angiers replied oh noble constant youth with pleasure i have heard thy wondrous truth the brightest tale in the lasting book of fame amongst lovers ever sacred be thy name let virous maids garlands for thee prepare virtue was found thy most peculiar care the humble maid was wholly in your power yet you sosook the loose luxuriant hour and to make your amorous wish complete preserved your passion good so made it great no band is softer than the nuptial ties th renegade that does the form despise m ets with ten thousand arrows as he flies charmed with his speech manavill of nature kind asked him from whence he was and where designed he said he was a bark by tempest hurled and left a stranger in this cruel world here be thy harbor generous mandvill cried here thou shall find no frowns no ebbing tide in thy devotion quiet and serene in safety view thy past tempestuous scene angiers with thanks replied if i partake thy kindnesses still done for virtues sake accept what service feeble age can pay thee back again the germans against the french prepare and all is hostile grown and open war england was then a friend and dear ally with her bold britains did their troops supply to head em mandvill and perottos chose for their unquestioned merit none oppose the next delight that charmed old angiers heart he viewed his son perform the great commanders part beheld him lead a troop of gallant men whose sight brought former glory back again when young such valiant bands himself had lead and been a kingdoms and an amrys head now bowed with age unknown his life he past and seemed to travel to his grave in haste thus the two brothers linked in joint command knew not that they were tied in a much stricter band let us vail cammilla and florellas fears their vows their parting sighs and flowing tears together they are left each to condole that by dividing grief neither may bear the whole mandvill designed to leave the pilgrim here but the poor count begged to attend him there resolves to view where he had been undone the ungrateful land that cast forth such a son the jolly soldiers now are got aboard and the auspicious winds quick passage do afford their plumes and waving banners they advance and with their succors bring new joy to france now let our just historick tale remove the queen must give account for lawless love to alldevouring time her charms give way her looks not lovely now nor briskly gay no fire her eyes her veins no amourous flame but in her heart remorse repentance shame confusion sorrow a melancholy train perplex her soul and keep her mind in pain angiers vile wrongs stand glaring in her view that thought does all her secret steps pursue the hag that nightly loads her tortured breast and never lets her taste the sweets of balmy rest a lingering sickness follows pining grief nor can the sons of art bring wished relief with downcast eyes they approach the dying fair their solemn looks discover their despair gashly the king of terrors does appear black guilt adds horror to tormenting fear she looks around and sees no comfort nigh spite of imperial greatness she must dye to bear the shock she summons former pride she is grown too weak all aid is now denied then let us yield she sighed and faintly said and sunk upon the bosom of a faithful maid fetch here the council and the injured king than death my friends i have a sharper sting i cannot dye in peace while it is concealed and i must dye for shame when it is revealed the waiting slaves straight her commands obey eager the king to hear what she would say with weeping eyes he viewed departing life and called her by the tender names of love and wife oh prince she cried behold cleora lost and sinking down a guilty guilty ghost unless great angiers race you can restore i am wracked on earth with pangs and plunging into more forgive your wife let mountains hide her shame mine was the sin mine the impetuous flame and cursed cleora only was to blame in this cabinet you will find the story writ if it is possible my fatal crimes forget angiers to honor straight and grace retrieve and natures faults let heaven and you forgive this said nature ashamed her soul to earth inclined broke the weak ties of her majestic mind that it might mount to purer regions unconfined reason and sense from the affrighted king is fled to hear the unsuspected guilt and see her dead revived the search of truth his soul pursues and with amazement he the paper views where every secret thought he saw confessed and every guilty wish that filled her breast he groaned to think how much he would been deceived and said no beauteous woman ever should be believed now to her tombs conveyed the unhappy fair but busy fame will not be buried there fame seems to join with our invetrate foes spreads our bad deeds and gathers as it goes and with the rumor royal mandates come to call the injured suffering angiers home rewards whoever brings the absent lord and all his castles and his lands restored angiers could scarce resolve to trust again the uncertain world and faithless cruel men hid in a lowly state a mean retreat he found some plagues but none like being great now with a gentle lord his age does rest no care nor envy does his hours molest and innocence and peace possess his breast his children want the greatness of his name nay he grows fond of the exalted fame and as his sons revolving in a tent discant on change death and this strange event both commiserate the guiltless heros fate noblest natures still are most compassionate attending angiers heard and strait came forth and with a look that stamped his words for truth began my lords in pity lend an ear they are blessed who will not disdain the poor to hear if you will admission to the king obtain for my endeavors would alas prove vain of that unhappy angiers i might tell i have met him often indeed i know him well they said the favours lessened when with pain it is sought my friend thou sure shall to the king be brought to the royal tent they strait their steps direct and having paid the king their due respect thus mandvill spoke this aged man of my domestic train who begged with me to cross the british main to your majesty he sais he can relate the history of your loft angiers fate let him speak hastily the king began for much i long to hear of that great injured man as noble angiers spoke and formed his tale in such pathetick words as must prevail the king observed with an intensive view then starting from his seat cried angiers it is you those graceful looks and that dear faithful voice in which my youth with pleasure did rejoice quick to my arms my constant wish restore and fate shall never never part us more who can express the joy in every face when they beheld him kneel and saw the king embrace the courtiers flock he is circled in the crowd of those who strive to speak their welcome loud soon to his wondering son the storys told how in the east their father they behold in silence they their inward joys suppress blush they no sooner knew their happiness mandvill sunk with shame when reflection brought his fathers sharp reproach to his revolving thought angiers soul was to that calmness grown that he forgave the ills designed and those unknown with tears the worthy kneeling hero raised and to the king their deeds and virtue praised to make the earls returning joy complete a victory they gain with wealth and honor great they lead in triumph the long suffering lord and he is to thrice his former wealth restored the news to violante fame conveys and soon as that she is begged to cross the seas the kings own yatch attends on her

took of this alone that she was branded mean because unknown to the earl marshal this said he declare let him not still despise his charming heir tell him the blood the female side supplies does from as old and great a fountain rise the haughty marshal does from her receive the wondrous news which they with joy believe they all congratulate then she takes her leave the bark is driven by auspicious
