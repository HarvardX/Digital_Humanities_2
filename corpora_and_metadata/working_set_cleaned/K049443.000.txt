caledonia a poem etc in northern hights where nature seldom smiles embraced with scas and buttresst all the western and northern parts of scotland are fenced with small islands which not only break off the force of the atlantic ocean but make excellent harbors for shipping and conveniences for trade round with isles where lofty shores the shores to the north of scotland may be said to regard the adjacent pole either because it lies directly open to the great northern ocean which no sailer could ever yet find the extent of or because it sees that pole elevated to a great height regard the adjacent pole where winds incessant blow and waves incessant roll where tyrant i call that continual cold in the frozen seas here tyrant cold because he reigns uncontrolled by the accession of any heat from the sun cold in glacy ocean reigns and all the habitable world disdains defies the distant influence of the sun and shines in ice the ice and snow always give a kind of light tho faint and melancholy shines in ice first youngest sister because the north capes and the coast of greenland  to be of the same family but advanced farther north first youngest a license taken to expess scotland the first of the habitable or at least sociable parts of the world so far north youngest sister to the frozen zone battered by parent natures constant frown adapt to hardships and cut out for toil the best worst climate and the worst best soil a rough unhewn uncultivated spot of old so famed and so of late forgot neglected scotland shows her awful brow not always quite so near to heaven as now circled with dreadful clifts and barbarous shores where the strong surff with high impetuous roars invades the rocks and these their rage disdain and with redoubling noise they are hurried home again the hollow caverns mutual roars return and baffled neptune the raging of the sea will often resemble fire and seem to burn especially as some say on a southerly wind raging makes the ocean burn the furious elements in vain contend unmoved the mighty natural breastworks stand their awful hights in threatening grandeur shine emblems of mightier hearts of stone within the instructing rocks invincible and strong describe the race that to these rocks belong and bid the quick retreating waves declare and warn the world against a northern war tell them the hopes of conquest must be vain when hands of steel shall rocks of flint maintain the high shores could be in no place more needful to place bounds proportioned to the furious and vast northern ocean that beat upon scotland from whence there is nothing but water to the very frozen zone of the north pole those rocks therefore are the lands defense and the ocems bridle and consequently beauties in their kind made so by the necessity of them these are the eternal bounds of providence the oceans bridle and the lands defense the warts and wrinkles placed on natures brow that her maternal care and conduct show the meanest parts of nature have their use and some to terror some to strength conduce nor is their ornament at all the less for beautys best described by usefulness behind this rugged front the situation of scotland is certainly her defense against either the fury of the ocean from the north or of invaders from the south the dangerous coast being such that no fleets care to venture themselves long at sea that way securely lies blessed caledonia and with ease defies her northern or her southern enemies fixed by decree her natures not to fear huge navies there or icy mountains here here towering clifts and there the beachy shoal defy the by the monsters of the pole may be understood the whales in former times terrible to mariners as frequently oversetting the small barks they sailed in or since by the greater skill in navigation that fear is at an end it may be taken for the monstrous floating islands of ice which by the fury of the winds are driven about the northern seas raging monsters of the pole there equally they floating worlds navys and fleets of ships of war to assault that country and transport armies to make descents and depredations on the coast floating worlds defy bid them stand off and live advance and die the hardy wretch that sees the hint too late fails not to find his folly in his fate behind this rugged front securely lies old caledonia all the worlds the worlds surprise to find so fine a country so peopled and so inhabited behind such terrible places which to the seaward promise nothing but desert and abandoned uninhabited places surprise her native beauty and her wealth concealed waits the union whereby improvement shall reveal the hidden fruitfulness of scotland the blessed hour when both shall be revealed in age and fancied poverty secure and yet she is ever young and never poor here laboring with the injuries of time inclement air inhospitable clime foreign invasions and intestine wars yet all her native beauty still appears brittains scotland is allowed the left hand of britain as to wealth england as her younger sister in matter of antiquity must however be allowed the right hand in wealth and trade at least till union if ever that shall happen make them all one left hand which when she shall unite as nature dictates and the fates invite and join her younger sister on the right how shall they mutual wealth and strength convey and with contempt the weaker world survey till that blessed hour how does her injured name sleep in the rubbish of her ancient fame buried in the scandalous reproaches of authors pretending to describe either her climate people or government have been intolerable and have buried her character with noise and slander which being never yet defended in public or any attempt made to clear up those things to the world foreign nations are too much possessed with the belief of what when the truth comes to be examined appears mere fiction and falsity slander by reproach laid low and all the distant world believes her so then let us first survey her fancied hearse she will find some resurrection in our verse till rousing from a long declining fate whole britain shall her glory reinstate how have cleavland in his poem upon scotland has said a thousand extravagant things on these heads we placed her out of natures eye where constant colds few seeds of life supply where nature chilled some despicables dwell immured with darkness and allied to hell no moderate blessings no endowment share nothing that is pleasant see nothing delightful hear but see the horrid by the horrid bear is to be understood the constellation so called which scotland being so far north easily sees in its whole circular motion round the pole bear march round the pole and feel her piercing breath congeal the soul their musicks whirlwind and the shrill echoing roar of frozen seas on the deserted shore legends of fables fill our partial heads of lands where grass never grows or mortal treads where keenest winds and storms incessant blow on mountains covered with eternal snow where nature never blooms and sun never shines but cold with cold and frost with frost combines this is as suggested by foreign authors in open injury of scotland and one of the principal reasons of this poem inhospitable clime  what countreys this and whither are we gone bright caledonia where will fable run suffer the impartial pen to range thy shore and do thee it is presumed this part will clear the author from a charge of flattery he designing to say nothing in this poem but what justice and the nature of things require

country which easily discovers that scotland is equally qualified for trade with any nation in the world whether we consider her openness to all parts of the trading world or the convenience of her harbors safe roads and neighborhood both to the german and atlantic oceans various aspects the design explain and her unhappy circumstances with respect to the rest of britain have without doubt been the great obstructions of her prosperity particularly as to trade circumstances shall resist in vain subject no more to every cross event she shall be great and rich as nature meant view next her seas from ancient terrors named for bugbear storms by bugbear sailors famed the ancients in their sailing these seas were strangely surprised at two things   the length of the days which they being generally phenicians and southcountrey merchants had not been used to from whence some of them more addicted to superstitious observations than the rest blindly imagined that since the farther they went northward the days were the longer and in some parts hardly any night the elisium shades must needs be thereabouts and that if they should go further they should come at length to bright eternal day   they were surpised not with the storms and tempests only but with the tides and currents which were not only strange to em but particularly terrible in that they drove em in amongst the rocks and shores where they often perished not from any real danger but for want of judgment from whence we have them often expressing themselves in this manner  and british seas ii here storms incessant blow and tides uncertain ebb and flow  phenician sailors wise in ignorance that dreamed of thule an island in the north of scotland was frequently fabled among the ancients to represent the elisium which could be for no other reason than the length of the days  bright thvle far advanced in raging seas dierum spatia ultra nostri  his mensuram and nox clara and extrema britanniae prte b vis ut

unusual or uncommon with the rest of britain subservient grown calm tides smooth surface and a shining brow and gentle gales for wealth and commerce blow these reconcile the once so dreadful waste and

natures quarrels he to his own use applies their enmity the furious wind the waters rage he wisely joins to his just end the voyage in this he makes their pointed rage agree and forms their discord

to no mens temper like thy own the bounteous ocean fraught with native gold i e the treasure of the fish which is gold efficiently because an immense treasure is drawn from it by all those nations that apply themselves to that trade fraught with native gold saved it for thee by its own curse that cold which by the ancients was thought intolerable and kept those seas for so many ages impracticable doubtless prevented the discovery of the great treasure of the fishery was not that their taking of them could have lessened the quantity but without doubt foreign nations might have been prompted not to have fished here only and in time have been too strong to be displaced but perhaps have taken possession of the land for the sake of the vast trade and so a more powerful nation have dispossessed the scots both of their trade and their country too the cold had not the storms and tempests governed here and fenced this long hid treasure round with fear past ages had thy rifled store decreast and foreign nations all thy wealth possessed wealth that well suits a hardy race like thine that dares through storms and death pursue the mine wealth hid from cowards and the fainting hand scared with the seas content to starve by land but when thy daring sons the wave explore the ocean yields her not our experience only allows the store to be unexhausted in that the quantity is every year renewed but authors tell us that even in their daily fishing in one and the same place when great quantities are taken up yet those that remain and may immediately be taken in the same

poor and rich speak malice speak insulters tell us which describe the globe run all the climates over she is poor compared to rich and rich compared to poor in climates next let us view her northern coast a fruitful style with epithets embost the horrid boistrous barren and the cold what fabld monstrous stories have been told yet range the globe and her extremes survey and sail from the two extreme parts of america and almost both uninhabitably cold and to which scotland being compared may be styled a hot climate as compared to mexico and peru she merits the name of cold magellan to

bountys of the land fitted by nature for the boistrous clime and larger blessings will grow due by time the numerous offspring patient and sedate with courage special to the climate wait when nigard nature shall their nation hear shall smile and pay them all the vast arrear a manly surliness with temper mixed is on their meanest countenances fixed an awful frown sits on their threatening brow and yet the souls all smooth and calm below thinking in temper rather grave than gay fitted to govern able to obey nor are their spirits very soon enflamed and if provoked not very soon reclaimed fierce when resolved and fixed as bars of brass and conquest through their blood can only pass in spite of coward cold the race is brave in action daring and in council grave their haughty souls in danger always grow no man durst lead em where they durst not go sedate in thought and steady in resolve polite in manners and as years revolve always secure their largest share of fame and by their courage keep alive their name the laboring poor dejected and suppressed see not the approaching prospect of their rest knowledge of libertys their only want and loss of expectations their content too much subjected to immoderate power their petty tyrants all their pains devour the the racking the tennant is not only a suppressing of the poor and discouraging of his industry but an error in the landlord himself as to his own interest preventing the improvement of his land and disabling him from doing abundance of things which would in the end be his own advantage and though abateing this might in some measure lessen the immediate income yet would certainly in time turn to the advantage of the family as well as the encouragement of the people extorting masters their just hopes restrain and ts impossible the farmer in scotland can ever grow rich while the rent of his farm amounts within a small matter to the extent of the product and while if a scarce year comes he is entirely ruined whereas if a good year comes he either enjoys not the benefit or does not enjoy it long it being in his landlords power upon all occasions to raise his demands diligence is no where more in vain the little chiefs the author is here willing to suppose that generally speaking no landlords but such as are of small estates would thus disregard their own interest or continue the oppressions of the poor their necessities not permitting em to be more generous little chiefs for what they call their due eat up the farm and eat the farmer too suck the lifeblood of tennant and estate and needless poverty to both create mistake their interest natinal ills procure and make the poor be very very poor th unhappy drudge yet bears the mighty load with strange unnatral temperance endowed so servile so unused to liberty he seems the last that wishes to be free prepostrous wonder where will nature run that men should struggle to be twice undone afflictions make men stupid nature winks and sense orelaid he acts before he thinks subjected nature fettered with distress dozes and bondage does the soul possess endeavor slackness all the prospects die and with the hope the love of liberty yet under all the hardships of their state they have something seems to claim a softer fate nor does it claim alone the grand portent foretells the blessing and decrees the event it is plainly printed on the painful brow they shall not always be suppressed as now the approaching light at distance dawns the ray darts a dim earnest of the welcome day when sleeping bondage doomed to lasting night shall help to make the chearing beam more bright thenlightend crowd shall their own freedom see for willful blindness only shuts out liberty bondage is ignorance and he that sees needs no directer cure for that disease knowledge and liberty go hand in hand fools only will obey when knaves command the sordid yoke no longer can be born when once he sees he must the grievance scorn he that in blind dependence now submits will rouse his strength when he shall rouse his wits nature prevails and sense in exercise the chains on reason natrally unties thus when new sight shall once but bless the poor it is these will scotlands liberty restore the strong conviction no man can resist and blindness shall against her will be blessed and now in all their miseries let us view what blessings they industriously pursue what just equivalent they can supply for loss of wealth and loss of liberty the instructed poor laborious and suppressed yet in their very miseries are blessed crushed with injurious homage they obey god and their landlord but with different eye and yet to both they pay without regrett to this the homage and to that the debt the negatives of nature they endure in virtue rich tho in possessions poor knowing in sacreds in religion nice and ignorant in nothing more than vice what crimes they have they borrow from mankind hells manufactures here are contraband imported by the help of foreign trade clandestinely enjoyed clandestinely conveyed unusual judgment fills the meaner heads devotion follows as instruction leads grave in behavior in discourse sedate and apter to believe than to debate and if they can exceed in doing well it is in a little little too much zeal in doctrine sound in discipline severe the church obtains her true dominion here and yet her foft coercives yield no power either to persecure or to devour fiercely tenacious of determined truth dreadful to error vigilant of both the wild opinions of a neighboring state find here no atomfancies to create the strong fermented venom hither brought like irish poisons perish in the thought here no enthusiastic notion grows the only barrenness the nation knows a mitred jest indeed the land perplexed of pomp and pride and policy so mixed the awkward medly left us in debate whether it did proceed from church or state begot by power and introduced by plot with tyranny came in with tyranny went out but ill agreeing with preciser air it soon grew yellow pale and sickly here the people wise and in religion nice could not be gulled with such a faint device some blood the monster drank but when it tried to take a dose of liberty it died but it their civil state some praise affords much greater are the trophies of their swords ages of blood have brought them up to war and their strong legions breath in every air at the battle of leipsick the scots were the first that were ever seen to fire with their ranks closed foreward and their pieces over one anothers shoulders or as we call it kneel stoop and stand which was such a surprise to the germans pouring in such a quantity of lead upon them together that they could not stand it which the king of sweden owned was the great occasion of the victory and practiced it afterward among all his troops they taught the very swedes themselves to fight and spite of dullness armed the the scots officers have all along been the instructors of the muscovites and if they are the worst soldiers in europe it has not been for want of good masters but by being dull scholars tho something may be ascribed to the constitution of their country arming only the boors and not entertaining em as soldiers but demitting em after the occasion to their employments again which method the present czar having altered the russians to europes cost are not unlikely to show the world they have been very well taught muscovite the sordid russ to discipline they train and fain would teach the the pride and haughtiness of the pole has made him disdain to be instructed and consequently their foot especially are good for nothing in the field poles but that is in vain the untracted brute in ignorance too wise learned only how experience to despise nothing keeps nature closs in jayl like pride squadrons of pagelike crimes before her ride and ignorance is always next her side where shall we all their ancient glory trace the forward nations court the very race not europe ventures to commence a war but caledonian blood demands her share and if it is bought or sold it is always very dear particularly famous for the great battle between the imperialists and the swedes the   d of september anno  and afterward for being the occasion of the great battle at lutzen where the king of sweden was slain having made a long march to relieve this city then besieged by the impertialists but coming to late he attacked their army and overthrew em but lost his life leipfick  a name in fames red lettered roll matchless in war where from the frozen pole the fnland horse in the swedish army grew a terror to the germans by their extraordinary bravery and discipline finland sent monsters strangers to the sun bred up to fight by great gustave led on and yet by hardy the scots at the battle of leipsick were very ill clothed and had complained of it to their officers who had often promised em a supply and being just entering into the battle sir john hepburn who commanded em pointing to the imperial army jestingly told them their clothes were come  tilly had brought em en purpose for em and if they would have em they must fight for em   naked

thirst for more approacht all europe trembled at his power in leipsick plain the dreadful scene begun on brighter deeds the sun himself never shone tillys first fury broke the the duke of saxonys troops formed the left of the swedish army the king of sweden having the right upon the first charge the right of the imperialists broke the saxons and drove em quite out of the field killing between two and three thousand upon the spot and had not the scots interposed they had been all cut to pieces saxon line and cried victoria all the troops fall in with blood and terror glittering eagles shine the scots reserved for dangers hither fly dangers their post by nation taught to die and winged with rage they the scots being about twelve battallions of foot joined with some dragoons made the second line of the swedish army and finding how matters went with the saxons on their flank they immediately wheeled to the left and joining a brigade of foot of the saxons not yet broken they fell in upon the pursuing imperialists and by their extraordinary fury turned the fortune of the day ravished victory not the unequal squadrons not the day half lest not slaughtered saxons in the way not formidable death that jest of war in whatsoever shapes she durst appear could their intrepid stedy motion stay nothing but slaughterd foes and victory the imperial dragoons being recalled from the pursuit of the saxons and being superior in number surrounded the scots falling in upon their flank which making them desperate they fought like mad men and made a terrible slaughter of the enemy surrounded they with doubled fury fight and pleased with danger shine in  in the fury o this fight the scots threw off their clothes and fought in their shirts the novelty of which struck a strange terror into their enemies and convinced em that despising all danger these were resolved to conquer naked white the king of sweden hearing of the distress the scots were in came in person with a body of horse and dragoons to their relief charged the imperial dragoons who had engaged their flank and soon cleared em of that encumbrance but seeing how bravely they fought and that there was no danger on that side he called out laughing to sir john hepburn al i egrement which is as much as to say in english bravely done boys and went back to his own forces where he soon overthrew the imperialists and completed the victory gustavus saw how fury like they fought and better witness never soldiers sought the mighty hero smiled with wonder pleased and still they fought the more the more he praised they crowned his head with lawrells first and he to their just valor both the king of sweden and the elector of saxony publicly complemented sir john hepburn and the rest of the scots colonels upon the occasion and owned the victory to be very much owing to their extraordinary behavior owned his victory from whence advancing with a just applause the ruined protestants abandoned cause religion and the country they restore and grateful germany commemorates the hour in thirty months continued fierce campaign from leipsick plains the neckar and the main the rhine the danube and the lech they crost no battle where they fought was ever lost never was such an army such a head such men to follow such a king to lead such countries traversed or such battles won such conquests made or in two years and three quarters they overrun two third parts of the empire and were possessed of the whole country from wolfenbuttle in westphalia where duke hamilton with another body of scots acted to prague in bohemia and had the king of sweden outlived the battle of lutzen he had bid fair to have taken winter quarters at vienna conquests made so soon where shall we all their ancient glories trace let us hasten down to ramellies a pace but stop at phillipsburg and ask turenne and read their ancient trophies on the rhine how they did there the gallick name advance and by their blood gave plumes to to growing france the scots regiments under the viscount de turenn and particularly douglasss regiment consisting then of   or  000 men were the flower of his infantry and helped to make france terrible as at that time she was to all her neighbors growing france france that on foreign valor raisd their throne by other nations swords and not their own stripped of that help how easily they fall and faint like jericho without her wall recalled from hence they williams sword the scots were recalled out of the french service by king charles the second at the instance of his parliament soon after the marriage of the late king william then prince of orange with the princess mary a little before the peace of nimeguen and ordered to join the prince of oranges army in flanders williams sword obey and beat the french at mons for want of pay when the scots were recalled from the king of frances service they were very ill treated carried to the remotest parts of france and there dismisd with but very little money ordered to travel but two or three together the country ordered not to trust them and every where great rewards offered em to list on purpose to force em unto their service by which means very few of that great body reached home but they that did vowed to be revenged of the french if ever they came to hands with them which they made good at the battle of mons want of pay soon as the caledonian bands appear not luxemberg himself the duke of luxemberg commanding the french army at mons placing some of his best infantry at a post where he expected the prince told some of his officers that if the prince of orange ventured to attack him there he was sure it must be with the scots regiments intimating that they were the fittest troops he had for so desperate a work luxemberg himself disdaind to fear twas on their valor he had raised his fame he knew they would conquer where soever they came he would seen em fight when great turenn lay dead when turenn was killed the scots brigade stood the shock of the first line of the german army with so much resolution that very much recovered the french out of the surprise they were under for the loss of their general turenne lay dead he would seen them follow where he durst not lead twas luxembergs post that day to have been with the advanced troops amongst which the scots were posted but he thought fit to get himself employed elsewhere which some said was taken notice of in the army as if he thought the service too hot for him durst not lead he would seen them fight when all the army fled when wise wise d lorge who took upon him the command of the army at the death of turenn obtained great reputation by retreating the army to an advantageous post while the extraordinary bravery of the scots kept the whole german army in play de lorge to shun his own defeat under their valor sheltered his retreat the experienced hero grave in war and state in this as sober as in that sedate advisd his master cautioned by his fear to gain the scots or else decline the war then view em under fifteen years recess ranging through europe to avoid the peace battle and death they make their chief delight and in all nations teach the world to fight buda the dreadfullst siege the world ere saw what heros did the fame of danger draw lesly this was old lesly general of the imperial forces and made ban or governor of croatia by the emperor the same that burnt the bridge of esseck and tho near  0 years of age and tortured with the gout yet performed a great many desperate services against the turks during that war and some of them in the depth of winter lesly the old croatian ban appears and daring scots led up the volunteers what actions passed let only such relate who know how men resolved to conquer meet never was town with such strange fury filled such deeds victoria seldom has beheld such storms such fury flesh and blood nere bore nor town was ever so maintained hefore the desperate garrison disdain to fear with their own slaughtered bones the breach repair contemning mercy they like furies fight and just as fast as life declined submit what streams of blood must in such fights be lost what fatal price must such a conquest cost life so bestowed is always sold too dear but valiant scots what business had you here with noble blood adorned and blooming years you were not made to storm like musketeers scotland run too much venture in your blood to have your rate so little understood you had no desperate fortunes there to raise your names enough you could not fight for praise then why so lavish why so rashly brave to play away the lives you ought to save scotland has sons indeed but none to spare to furnish out the shows and sports of war you are her tenderest part which touch the whole and what lets out your blood lets out her soul pardon the satyrs interrupting it is hoped no gentleman in scotland will take this for a personal satyr but as i take volunteering to be a vice in war as it is now practiced where men fit to lead armies serve as private sentinels the author hopes he may be excused in condemning the practice as an injury to their native country satyrs interrupting here she owns she hates this volunteering war when neither king nor country to retrive the injured help or the oppressed relieve neither to gain dominion or to save men die for nothing but the fame of brave so foster hanged himself a foolish fellow in england who often talked of hanging himself that he might have a fine funeral and at last did it but whether upon that account or no is not very certain foster hanged himself with deep design only to see himself be buried fine hard fate of men that only for a name will in their own destruction seek their fame that covet dangers and ride post to die to live in air and walk in memory vain fame with high fermented vapor hot to be remembered strives to be forgot wrapped in his jest the bubbld hero dies immortalizd in mortal memories fills up a ballad made too great in rhyme is fabld into tale and dies again by time and this for nothing but to have it known he died an ass of very great renown a forward coxcomb who in haste to die fought for he cared not who nor cared not why one just excuse indeed some few may give that die because they cannot tell how to live these shall in pity scape our censure here so cowards dare not live and hang themselves for fear he is truly brave that fights in just defense of virtue pressed of injured innocence himself the laws his neighbor or his prince dares all the lawful calls of fate obey no danger will decline no trust betray while he that heals his tortures in the war owns he is a coward and only fights for fear as for the sport of fighting that is a jest they talk of most that understand it least buda reduced and gallantry laid by europe the sweets of short lived peace enjoy not the recess of arms can cool their fire quenched in the act they burn in the desire not capuan plenty not luxuriant ease the man of actions first and worst disease can taint their temper quench their thirst of fame or rust the pollishd splendour of their name their arms may tarnish but the souls kept bright for spite of practice they by nature fight born soldiers fitted from the birth for fame bodies all iron and their souls all flame the war revives bellona sounds to arms the scots by nature ravished with her charms from their remotest mountains hear the sound and troops of heros spread hibernian ground with native fire and sense of glory filled and winged with joy they rush into the field in every action that deserved a name they shared the hazard others shared the fame william with pleasure often led em on they gave they guarded and they loved his crown smiling he viewed the wonders of their hands happy the general troops like these commands the gladded monarch said when at namure ramsay fell on and mocked the gallick power and emulating nations wondering first gave over at derry limrick agrim or the boyn athlone namure at steenkirk or anden at all their heros fought at all they died and latent virtue want of victory supplied william that men of courage loved to obey how mourned he douglass angus and mackay too great a loss for one unhappy day a loss that yielded france the victory a loss that none but scotland could supply none had such to survive or such to die should we to recent memory apply and trace the scots in modern history the present rising glory of their name comes up to all that is ancient in their fame at schellemberg how could they choose but fight new vigor swelled their nation at the sight the very spot where hepburn stormed before the scots in the king of swedens army beat john de werth the bavarian general out of his intrenchments at schellembergh where they had posted themselves almost upon the same ground where the french and bavarians were now posted here ramsey and rea two colonels of the scots according to the usual and particular bravery of these two ancient families entered the intrenchments sword in hand with a very great slaughter of the enemy hepburn stormed before and conquering scots imperial standards tore where ramsey murray rhea and hamilton like lions fought the swedes amazed looked on and saw the impregnable intrenchments won and now the scots in valor still the same worthy the race and equal in their flame with the same fury gain the same applause the same the courage and the same the cause the same the circumstance the same success that great gustavus saw the bavarians complemented gustavus adolphus on the taking the intrenchments at schellemberg as a thing they thought impracticable and the people of the danawert say it has been thirteen times attacked and never was taken till then which i take to be an equal honor to the scots troops under the duke of marlborough as to their ancestors under the king of sweden these having a great share in the late attack under the command of lord orkney as the other had under colonel hepburn gustavus saw great marlbro this let future poets blenheims trophies sing and ramellies to chime with leipsick bring there orkney campbell hamilton and hay shall match the heros and shall match the day to times last period hand their nations fame and every ages glory shall the next inflame part iii their foreign deeds are traced and now we come to search the fund of fame that is left at home a thousand kings alluding here to the ancient figure in which the isle of britain is generally supposed to be when every nobleman was a sovereign upon his own estate some marks of which sovereignty are yet remaining and within few years past were very visible in several of the noble families of scotland particularly in the family of douglass who pursued fought took prisoner of war sir william hairis of terriglis for having withdrawn himself from his vassalage or dependence and esteeming him as his own servant taken in arms where his jurisdiction or regality extended upon his own authority put him to death godscrosss history of the house of douglass page     the same earl of douglass executed justice upon macklalane tutor of bumbee chief of his name and one of the principal houses in galloway for murdering one of his servants king james himself interceeded for him in vain kings the mighty land possess in merit greater though in title less kings in command and in superior race and virtue ripens such for crowns a pace nobility of blood their actions suit and action here indents the attribute here families in lines of virtue run the fathers merit doubling in the son the growing honor forms a just increase first crowns in war and then rewards in peace illustrious blood with more illustrious hand in proper channels has been here retained the antiquity which other nations boast would here turn modern and in age be lost scotland in senior glory will contend when lame chronology with age grows blind here mighty ancestors preserve their style from long prescription ancient as the isle not raised on party favor bribes and fear blood tyranny oppression theft and war not raisd by strength of face or strength of purse a stock of money or a stock that is worse but from the youth of time their names remain when virtue only could that fame obtain back further back than story can relate when infant nations fixed their forms of state when tricks of state and court intreague unknown no mighty knave could brother villain crown from blood to blood their violence pursue first steal their honors then proclaim em due by fraud and strong oppressions crowns obtain while those support the frauds and these the reign alternate violences fame supply the modern fund of mean nobility if there be any thing in birth and blood or were antiquity but understood if the old trophies of our fathers fame when thoughts of virtue burn would fan the flame make us their steps of dignity pursue and ancient honors would excite to new if any true nobility remains and virtue could by blood possess the veins then let us no farther search the world in vain to ancient rome and lost records of spain nations in barbarous hydramixtures raised and only by their own too partial flattries praised fabii cornellii and the bruti yield to caledonian tribes the ancient field cummin duff donald strathern hay and keith and names would run fames trumpet out of breath their old armorial honors still retain while rome in modern lines contends in vain nor has the country lent her partial fame and from her later towns bestowed the name not towns the names but names the towns command and families take titles from the land so douglass mar and southerland survive and not from towns but provinces derive kingdoms of old who tho the claims laid down yet in the antiquity they keep the crown the blood of princes in their race we see and modern merit joins to old nobility blessed are the families that great in blood have thus their truest honor understood that on the base of virtue built their fame and join to that lesser praise i know this word is objected against as ungrammatical and therefore by some very carefully avoided in verse and by others perhaps too critically censured but as i have very good authority for the word i venture the indignation of the critics and anticipate their observations by referring them to the following examples  prior  minor  which in english cannot be expressed by any other word than what i here make use of lesser which is formed from the comparative less exactly after the same manner lesser praise their name the only just and truly great design for virtue helps nobility to shine then who shall search the long forgotten roll examine all the parts or sum the whole who shall the impotence of art supply beyond the reach of books or heraldry it is hoped the gentlemen whose names are included in these lines will not sind fault with the author for not observing preceedency either in dignity or antiquity the necessity of rhyme measure and cadence being his just excuse and which he desires them to accept in that particular there gordon lindsay crawford mar and wems with seaton ramsey cuninghame and graams forbes ross murray bruce dunbar and hume and names for whom no poet can make room remote in birth in names and honors known the caledonian glory through the world have shown where shall the galick trophies now appear the ancient belgae would look modern here not mommerancy not the great nassau could ancestors like these directly draw douglass with native dignitys adorned ancient beyond record records they scorned the worlds the general record here i make no question but to be animadverted upon for my different way of expressing the word record and changing the quantity making the vowel long in the last syllable of the first and short in the last syllable of the second but for this i have so good an authority that all men will allow it sufficient to justify me being from such a master of the language as buchannan himself as follows dies tenetbras and tenebrae dient buch ps    ver   l   which being the verse called dactilicus alchaicus the second foot is always jambus and the third and fourth dactyli record of their house when histories are silent and abstruse the fund of families is in their blood and the famed scoti the author of the history of the house of douglass tells us that william douglass grandchild to sholto douglass was the father of the noble family of the scoti at placenza in italy fol   and some say that by a marriage between a branch of the said family of scoti and some of the ancient line of the house of mar in scotland was the original of the family of marrescoti a great and flourishing family in italy to this day famed
