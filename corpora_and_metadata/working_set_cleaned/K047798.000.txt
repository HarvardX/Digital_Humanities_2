elements of conic sections etc  elements of conic sections with select exercises in various branches of mathematics and philosophy  for the use of the royal military academy at woolwich  by charles hutton lld frs  professor of mathematics in the royal military academy  london printed by j davis sold by g g j and j robinson paternosterrow  mdcclxxxvii  to his grace charles duke of richmond lennox and aubigny etc etc etc master general of the ordnance my lord should this small performance continue to prove useful to the institution for which it was composed or become acceptable to the public its existence as well as its publication must be ascribed to your grace  but my lord the particular injunctions to avoid panegyric under which permission for this dedication was granted preclude me from explaining how the advanced state of learning in the royal military academy rendered such a work necessary since this would be to enumerate the means by which under your auspices this institution has attained a degree of perfection which perhaps few public ones have ever equalled none certainly have exceeded  to your grace therefore with all respect this work is most humbly dedicated by  my lord your graces most obedient most devoted and most humble servant charles hutton royal mil acad aug         preface the want of a proper set of exercises applied to the different branches of mathematical knowledge which are deemed requisite to the military profession induced me to draw up the following sheets their utility to the students in the royal military academy having been fully established recommended them to the consideration of the master general and his grace has been pleased to order them to be printed  the miscellaneous form of this small work arises from its consisting chiefly of practical questions in most of the sciences now taught in the academy although invention was not my immediate object yet throughout the whole there will be found many things that are new in point of matter but more so in the manner of treating the subjects  in the conic sections there are several new and important properties dispersed through the books and it is presumed that this branch is treated in a way better adapted to its intended use than heretofore the propositions although demonstrated in a manner strictly geometrical have this peculiarity that only the first property of each section is demonstrated from the cone itself and all the subsequent ones derived from the first or from each other in an easy and natural way without introducing any arbitrary organical description of curves in plano the arrangement of the seps in separate lines is also found to be an advantage as it renders the demonstrations more easy to be comprehended by presenting the whole to the eye in one connected view and another very considerable improvement arises from the application of a new and general property concerning the intersections of a right line with any of the curves in two points by means of which the general properties of the oblique ordinates to any diameter are easily deduced without the forced and perplexed consideration of the areas of certain spaces  the several propositions and properties in the three curves or sections are also arranged in such order and enunciated in such manner as to show which properties are common to the different sections and in particular it will be found that most of the definitions and scholia are common to all the three curves and that all the propositions and demonstrations of the ellipse are literally the same with those of the hyperbola a circumstance which must render both the learning and the remembering of the properties much easier than heretofore  the collection of practical questions which follow the conic sections are mostly given without solutions their answers only being set down as probationary exercises to certain rules and branches of science contained in most books relating to these subjects but the last collection concerning forces and the accompanying circumstances of time space and the velocity generated have solutions annexed to them as they require a knowledge of some other principles besides those that are usually found in the common books of science many of the problems in this part may indeed be met with elsewhere but it is presumed that the solutions will be found in general either new or attended with considerable improvement  i have taken the liberty also to enrich this part with some new and useful problems relating to the times of filling and emptying the ditches of fortifications or other receptacles with water entering and evacuating them under certain circumstances these curious problems his grace the master general of the ordnance was pleased to propose at a late examination of the gentlemen cadets and the solutions at large of such important propositions are here published as far as i know for the first time  to these succeeds the common theory of the motion of bodies in resisting mediums but delivered in a manner i trust better adapted to practical purposes than in any former publication  the volume then concludes with a compendium of some experiments lately made to ascertain the actual resistance of the air to given surfaces moving through it with given velocities and different degrees of inclination experiments which it is to be wished may be farther prosecuted as it is by such means only that the true theory of military projectiles as well as other branches of natural philosophy can be improved to any degree of practical

five different figures or sections namely a triangle a circle an ellipse a parabola and an hyperbola the three last of which only are peculiarly called conic sections    if the cutting plane pass through the vertex of the cone and any part of the base the section will evidently be a triangle as vab  diagram    if the plane cut the cone parallel to the base or make no angle with it the section will be a circle as abd  diagram    the section dab is an ellipse when the cone is cut obliquely through both sides or when the plane is inclined to the base in a less angle than the side of the cone is  diagram    the section is a parabola when the cone is cut by a plane parallel to the base or when the cutting plane and the side of the cone make equal angles with the base  diagram    the section is an hyperbola when the cutting plane makes a greater angle with the base than the side of the cone makes  diagram    and if all the sides of the cone be continued through the vertex forming an opposite equal cone and the plane be also continued to cut the opposite cone this latter section will be the opposite hyperbola to the former as dbe    the vertices of any section are the points where the cutting plane meets the opposite sides of the cone or the sides of the vertical triangular section as a and b  hence the ellipse and the opposite hyperbolas have each two vertices but the parabola only one unless we consider the other as at an infinite distance   0 the axis or transverse diameter of a conic section is the line or distance ab between the vertices  hence the axis of a parabola is infinite in length ab being only a part of it  ellipse  oppos hyperb  parabola  ellipse   oppos hyperb   parabola      the center c is the middle of the axis  hence the center of a parabola is infinitely distant from the vertex and of an ellipse the axis and center lie within the curve but of an hyperbola without     a diameter is any right line as ab or de drawn through the center and terminated on each side by the curve and the extremities of the diameter or its intersections with the curve are its vertices  hence all the diameters of a parabola are parallel to the axis and infinite in length and hence also every diameter of the ellipse and hyperbola have two vertices but of the parabola only one unless we consider the other as at an infinite distance     the conjugate to any diameter is the line drawn through the center and parallel to the tangent of the curve at the vertex of the diameter so fg parallel to the tangent at d is the conjugate to de and hi parallel to the tangent at a is the conjugate to ab  hence the conjugate hi of the axis ab is perpendicular to it  ellipse  oppos hyperb  parabola  ellipse   oppos hyperb   parabola      an ordinate to any diameter is a line parallel to its conjugate or to the tangent at its vertex and terminated by the diameter and curve so dk el are ordinates to the axis ab and mn no ordinates to the diameter de  hence the ordinates to the axis are perpendicular to it     an absciss is a part of any diameter contained between its vertex and an ordinate to it as ak or bk or dn or en  hence in the ellipse and hyperbola every ordinate has two abscisses but in the parabola only one the other vertex of the diameter being infinitely distant     the parameter of any diameter is a third proportional to that diameter and its conjugate     the focus is the point in the axis where the ordinate is equal to half the parameter as k and l where dk or el is equal to the semiparameter  hence the ellipse and hyperbola have each two foci but the parabola only one     if dae fbg be two opposite hyperbolas having ab for their first or transverse axis and ab for their second or diagram conjugate axis and if dae fbg be two other opposite hyperbolas having the same axes but in the contrary order namely ab their first axis and ab their second then these two latter curves dae fbg are called the conjugate hyperbolas to the two former dae fbg and each pair of opposite curves mutually conjugate to the other     and if tangents be drawn to the four vertices of the curves or extremities of the axes forming the inscribed rectangle hikl the diagonals hck icl of this rectangle are called the asymptotes of the curves  scholium the rectangle inscribed between the four conjugate hyperbolas is similar to a rectangle circumscribed about an ellipse by drawing tangents in like manner to the four extremities of the two axes and the asymptotes or diagonals in the hyperbola are analogous to those in the ellipse cutting this curve in similar points and making the pair of equal conjugate diameters moreover the whole figure formed by the four hyperbolas is as it were an ellipse turned inside out cut open at the extremities d e f g of the said equal conjugate diameters and those four points drawn out to an infinite distance the curvature being turned the contrary way but the axes and the rectangle passing through their extremities continuing fixed  corollary i ellipse   hyperbola   parabola   in the ellipse the semiconjugate axis cd or ce is a mean proportional between co and cp the parts of the diameter op of a circle drawn through the center c of the ellipse and parallel to the base of the cone for de is a double ordinate in this circle being perpendicular to op as well as to ab  in like manner in the hyperbola the length of the semiconjugate axis cd or ce is a mean proportional between co and cp drawn parallel to the base and meeting the sides of the cone in o and p or if ao be drawn parallel to the side vb and meet pc produced in o making co  co and on this diameter op a circle be drawn parallel to the base then the semiconjugate cd or ce will be an ordinate of this circle being perpendicular to op as well as to ab  or in both figures the whole conjugate axis de is a mean proportional between qa and br parallel to the base of the cone for because ab is double of ac or cb therefore by similar triangles qa is double of oc and br double of cp consequently  de  or  c   e or  co   cp is  qa  br or qa de de br  in the parabola both the transverse and conjugate are infinite for ab and br are both infinite  corol   in all the sections ag will be equal to the parameter of the axis if qg be drawn making the angle aqg equal to the angle bar  for by the definition ab de de p the param but by corol   br de de aq therefore ab br aq p but by similar triangles ab br aq ag and therefore ag  p the parameter  in like manner bg will be equal to the parameter p if rg be drawn to make the angle brg  the angle abq since here also ab aq br bg  p  corol   hence the upper hyperbolic section or section of the opposite cone is equal and similar to the lower section for the two sections have the same transverse or first axis ab and the same conjugate or second axis de which is the mean proportional between aq and rb they have also equal parameters ag bg so that the two opposite sections make as it were but the two opposite ends of one entire section or hyperbola the two being every where mutually equal and similar like the two halves of an ellipse with their ends turned the contrary way  corol   and hence although both the transverse and conjugate axis in the parabola be infinite yet the former is infinitely greater than the latter or has an infinite ratio to it for the transverse has the same ratio to the conjugate as the conjugate has to the parameter that is as an infinite to a finite quantity which is an infinite ratio  of the ellipse proposition i the squares of the ordinates of the axis are to each other as the rectangles of their abscisses  let avb be a plane passing through the axis of the cone agih another section of the cone perpendicular to the plane of the former ab the axis of this elliptic section and fg hi ordinates perpendicular to it then i say that fg  hi  affb ahhb  diagram  for through the ordinates fg hi draw the circular sections kgl min parallel to the base of the cone having kl mn for their diameters to which fg hi are ordinates as well as to the axis of the ellipse  now by the similar triangles afl ahn and bfl bhm we have af ah fl hn and fb hb kf mh hence taking the rectangles of the corresponding terms we have the rect affb ahhb kffl mhhn but by the nature of the circle kffl  fg  and mhhn  hi  therefore the rect affb ahhb fg  hi  qed  corol   all the parallel sections are similar figures or have their two axes in the same proportion that is ab ab de de  for by sim triang ab ab aq aq and ab ab rb rb theref by comp ab  ab  aqrb aqrb but aqrb  de  and aqrb  de  therefore ab  ab  de  de  or ab ab de de  corol   hence also as the property is the same for the ordinates on both sides of the diameter it follows that   st at equal distances from the center or from the vertices the ordinates on both sides are equal or that the double ordinates are bisected by the axis and that the whole figure made up of all the double ordinates is also bisected by the axis   d the two foci are equally distant from the center or from either vertex  corol   when the angle which the plane of the section makes with the base of the cone increases till it become equal to the angle made by the side of the cone and the base or till the section be parallel to the opposite side of the base then the axis becomes infinitely long and the ellipse degenerates into a parabola and because then the infinites fb and hb are in a ratio of equality the general property namely affb ahhb fg  hi  becomes af ah fg  hi  or in the parabola the abscisses are to each other as the squares of their ordinates  proposition ii as the square of the transverse axis is to the square of the conjugate so is the rectangle of the abscisses to the square of their ordinate  that is ab  ab  or ac  ac  addb de   diagram  for by prop   accb addb ca  de  but if c be the center then accb  ac  and ca is the semiconj therefore ac  addb ac  de  or by permutation ac  ac  addb de  or by doubling ab  ab  addb de  qed  corol   or because the rectangle addb  ca   cd  the same property is ca  ca  ca   cd  de  or ab  ab  ca   cd  de   corol   or by div ab ab ab ca   cd  de  that is ab p addb or ca   cd  de  where p is the parameter ab ab by the definition of it  that is as the transverse is to its parameter so is the rectangle of the abscisses to the square of their ordinate  corol   when the axis ab is infinitely long the curve becomes a parabola and the infinites ab db are then in a ratio of equality and then the last property namely ab p addb de  or abde addb p de becomes de ad p de or ad de de p  that is in the parabola the parameter is a third proportional to any absciss and its ordinate  proposition iii as the square of the conjugate axis is to the square of the transverse axis so is the rectangle of the abscisses of the conjugate or the difference of the squares of the semiconjugate and distance of the center from any ordinate of that axis to the square of that ordinate that is ca  cb  addb or ca   cd  de   diagram  for draw the ordinate ed to the transverse ab  then by cor   prop   ca  ca  ca cd  de   but cd   de  and de   cd  therefore ca  ca  ca   de  cd  or by alternation ca  ca   de  ca  cd  and by division ca  de  ca  ca   cd  and by alter and invers ca  ca  ca   cd  de  qed  corol   if two circles be described on the two axes as diameters the one inscribed within the ellipse and the other circumscribed about it then an ordinate in the circle will be to the corresponding ordinate in the ellipse as the axis of this ordinate is to the other axis  that is ca ca dg de and ca ca dg de  for by the nature of the circle addb  dg  theref by the nature of the ellipse ca  ca  addb  or dg  de  or ca ca dg de  in like manner ca ca dg de moreover by equality dg de or cd de or dc dg  therefore cgg is a continued strait line  corol   hence also as the ellipse and circle are made up of the same number of corresponding ordinates which are all in the same proportion of the two axes it follows that the areas of the whole circle and ellipse as also of any like parts of them are in the same proportion of the two axes or as the square of the diameter to the rectangle of the two axes that is the areas of the two circles and of the ellipse are as the square of each axis and the rectangle of the two and therefore the ellipse is a mean proportional between the two circles  proposition iv the square of the distance of the focus from the center is equal to the difference of the squares of the semiaxis or the square of the distance between the foci is equal to the difference of the squares of the two axes  that is cf   ca   ca  or ff   ab   ab   diagram  for to the focus f draw the ordinate fe which by the definition will be the semiparameter then by the nature of the curve ca  ca  ca   cf  fe  and by the def of the para ca  ca  ca  fe  therefore ca   ca   cf  and by addit and subtr cf   ca   ca  or by doubling ff   ab   ab  qed  corol   the two semiaxes and the focal distance from the center are the sides of a right angled triangle cfa and the distance fa from the focus to the extremity of the conjugate axis is  ac the semitransverse  for as above ca   ca   cf  and by right angled triangles fa   ca   cf  therefore ca  fa and ab  fa  fa  corol   the conjugate semiaxis ca is a mean proportional between af fb or between af fb the distances of either focus from the two vertices  for ca   ca   cf   ca  cfca  cf  affb  corol   the same rectangle affb of the focal distances from either vertex is also equal to the rectangle acfe under the semitransverse and its semiparameter since this last is equal to the square of the semiconjugate by the definition of the parameter  or af fe ac fb  proposition v the difference between the semitransverse and a line drawn from the focus to any point in the curve is equal to a fourth proportional to the semitransverse the distance from the center to the focus and the distance from the center to the ordinate belonging to that point of the curve  that is ac  fe  ci or fe  ai and fe  ac  ci or fe  by  where ca cf cd ci the  th proportional to ca cf cd  diagram  for by right angled triangles fe   fd   de   now draw ag parallel and equal to ca the semiconjugate and join cg meeting the ordinate de in h  then by prop   ca  ag  ca   cd  de  and by sim tri ca  ag  ca   cd  ag   dh  consequently de   ag   dh   ca   dh  also fd  cf cd and fd   cf    cfcd  cd  therefore fe   cf   ca    cfcd  cd   dh   but by prop   ca   cf   ca  and by supposition  cfcd   caci theref fe   ca    caci  cd   dh   but by supposition ca  cd  cf  or ca   ag  ci  and by sim tri ca  cd  ca   ag  cd   dh  therefore ci   cd   dh  consequently fe   ca    caci  ci  and the root or side of this square is fe  ca  ci  ai  in the same manner is found fe  ca  ci  by qed  corol   hence ci or ca  fe is a  th proportional to ca cf cd  corol   and fe  fe   ci that is the difference between two lines drawn from the foci to any point in the curve is double the  th proportional to ca cf cd  proposition vi the sum of two lines drawn from the foci to meet in any point of the curve is equal to the transverse axis  that is fe  fe  ab  diagram  for by the last prop fe  ca  ci  ai and by the same fe  ca  ci  by theref by addition fe  fe  ab  corol hence is derived the common method of describing the curve mechanically by points or with a thread thus  diagram  in the transverse take the foci f f and any point i then with the radii ai by and centers f f describe arcs intersecting in e which will be a point in the curve in like manner assuming other points i as many other points will be found in the curve then with a steady hand draw the curve line through all the points of intersection e  or take a thread of the length of ab the transverse axis and fix its two ends in the foci f f by two pins then carry a pen or pencil round by the thread keeping it always stretched and its point will trace out the curve line  proposition vii if from any point i in the axis produced a line ieh be drawn cutting the curve in two points and from those two points be drawn the perpendicular ordinates de gh and if k be the middle of dg and c the center or the middle of ab then shall ck be to ci as the rectangle of ad and ag to the square of ai  that is ck ci adag ai   diagram  for by prop i addb aggb de  gh  and by sim tri id  ig  de  gh  theref by equality addb aggb id  ig   but db   ck  ag and gb   ck  ad theref ad ck  adag ag ck  adag id  ig  and by div dg ck ig   id  or dg  ik ad ckadag id  or  ck  ik ad ck  adag id  or ad ck ad ik ad ck  adag id  theref by div ck ik adag id   ad ik and by comp ck ci adag id   adid  ia or ck ci adag ai  qed  corol when the line ih by revolving about the point i comes into the position of the tangent il and the ordinate lm being drawn then the points e and h meet in the point l and the points d k g coincide with the point m and then the property in the proposition becomes cm ci am  ai   proposition viii if a tangent and ordinate be drawn from any point in the curve meeting the transverse axis the semitransverse will be a mean proportional between the distances of the said two intersections from the center  that is ca is a mean proportion between cd and ct or cd ca ct are continued proportionals  diagram  for by cor prop   cd ct ad  at  that is  or cd ca  ca ct  and cd  ca  and ca  ct  therefore cd ca ca ct qed corol   since ct is always a third proportional to cd ca if the points d a remain constant then will the point t be constant also and therefore all the tangents will meet in this point t which are drawn from e of every ellipse described on the same axis ab where they are cut by the common ordinate dee drawn from the point d  corol   hence a tangent is easily drawn to the curve from any point either in the curve or without it  first if the given point e be in the curve draw the ordinate de of the diameter ac and in the diameter produced take ct a third proportional to cd ca then join te for the tangent required  but if the point t be given any where without the curve join ct in which take cd a third proportional to ct ca and draw the ordinate de then join te as before  proposition ix if there be any tangent meeting four perpendiculars to the axis drawn from these four points namely the center the two extremities of the axis and the point of contact those four perpendiculars will be proportionals  that is ag de ch by  diagram  for by prop   tc ac ac dc theref by div ta ad tc ac or cb and by comp ta td tc tb and by sim tri ag de ch by qed  corol hence ta td tc tb and tg te th ti are also proportionals  for these are as ag de ch by by similar triangles  proposition x if there be any tangent and two lines drawn from the foci to the point of contact these two lines will make equal angles with the tangent  that is the fet  fee  diagram  for draw the ordinate de and fe parallel to fe  by cor   prop   ca cd cf ca  fe and by prop   ca cd ct ca therefore ct cf ca ca  fe and by add and sub tf tf fe  ca  fe or fe by prop   but by sim tri tf tf fe fe therefore fe  fe and conseq e  fee but because fe is parallel to fe the e  fet therefore the fet  fee qed  corol as opticians find that the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection it appears from our proposition that rays of light issuing from the one focus and meeting the curve in every point will be reflected into lines drawn from the other focus so the ray fe is reflected into fe and this is the reason why the points f f are called foci or burning points  proposition xi if a line be drawn from either focus perpendicular to a tangent to any point of the curve the distance of their intersection from the center will be equal to the semitransverse axis  that is if fp fp be perpendicular to the tangent tpp then shall cp and cp be each equal to ca or cb  diagram  for through the point of contact e draw fe and fe meeting fp produced in g then the gep  fep being each equal to the fep and the angles at p being right and the side pe being common the two triangles gep fep are equal in all respects and so ge  fe and gp  fp therefore since fp  fg and fc  ff and the angle at f common the side cp will be  fg or ab that is cp  ca or cb  and in the same manner cp  ca or cb qed  corol   a circle described on the transverse axis as a diameter will pass through the points p p because all the lines ca cp cp cb being equal will be radii of the circle  corol   cp is parallel to fe and cp parallel to fe  corol   if at the intersections of any tangent with the circumscribed circle perpendiculars to the tangent be drawn they will meet the transverse axis in the two foci that is the perpendiculars pf pf give the foci f f  proposition xii the equal ordinates or the ordinates at equal distances from the center on the opposite sides and ends of an ellipse have their extremities connected by one right line passing through the center and that line is bisected by the center  that is if cd  cg or the ordinate de  gh then shall ce  ch and each will be a right line  diagram  for when cd  cg then also is de  gh by cor   prop   but the d  g being both right angles therefore the third side ce  ch and the dce  gch and consequently each is a right line  corol   and conversely if each be a right line passing through the center then shall it be bisected by the center or have ce  ch also de will be  gh and cd  cg  corol   hence also if two tangents be drawn to the two ends e h of any diameter eh they will be parallel to each other and will cut the axis at equal angles and at equal distances from the center for the two cd ca being equal to the two cg cb the third proportionals ct cs will be equal also then the w sides ce ct being equal to the two ch cs and the included angle ect equal to the included angle hcs all the other corresponding parts are equal and so the t  s and te parallel to hs  corol   and hence the four tangents at the four extremities of any two conjugate diameters form a parallelogram circumscribing the ellipse and the pairs of opposite sides are each equal to the corresponding parallel conjugate diameters  for if the diameter eh be drawn parallel to the tangent te or hs it will be the conjugate to eh by the definition and the tangents to eh will be parallel to each other and to the diameter eh for the same reason  proposition xiii if two ordinates ed ed be drawn from the extremities e e of two conjugate diameters and tangents be drawn to the same extremities and meeting the axis produced in t and r  then shall cd be a mean proportional between cd dr and cd a mean proportional between cd dt  diagram  for by prop   cd ca ca ct and by the same cd ca ca cr theref by equality cd cd cr ct but by sim tri dt cd ct cr theref by equality cd cd cd dt in like manner cd cd cd dr qed  corol   hence cd cd cr ct  corol   hence also cd cd de de  and the rect cd  de  cd  de or cde  cde  corol   also cd   cddt and cd   cddr  or cd a mean proportional between cd dt and cd a mean proportional between cd dr  proposition xiv the same figure being constructed as in the last proposition each ordinate will divide the axis and the semiaxis added to the external part in the same ratio  that is da dt dc db and da dr dc db  diagram  for by prop   cd ca ca ct and by div cd ca ad at and by comp cd db ad dt or da dt dc db  in like manner da dr dc db qed  corol   hence and from cor   to the last prop we have cd   cddt  addb  ca   cd  cd   cddr  addb  ca   cd   corol   hence also ca   cd   cd  and ca   de   de   corol   farther because ca  ca  addb or cd  de  therefore ca ca cd de likewise ca ca cd de  proposition xv if from any point in the curve there be drawn an ordinate and a perpendicular to the curve or to the tangent at that point  the distance on the transverse between the center and ordinate cd  will be to the distance pd  as the square of the transverse axis  to the square of the conjugate  that is ca  ca  dc dp  diagram  for by prop   ca  ca  addb de  but by rt angled s the rect tddp  de  and by cor   prop    cddt  addb therefore ca  ca  tddc tddp or ac  ca  dc dp qed  proposition xvi all the parallelograms circumscribed about an ellipse are equal to one another and each equal to the rectangle of the two axes  that is the parallelogram pqrs  the rectangle abab  diagram  let eg eg be two conjugate diameters parallel to the sides of the parallelogram and dividing it into four lesser and equal parallelograms also draw the ordinates de de and ck perpendicular to pq  diagram  then by prop   ct ca ca cd and by cor   prop    ca de ca cd theref by equality ct ca ca de  and by sim tri ct ck ce de theref by equality ck ca ca ce and the rect ckce  rect caca  but the rect ckce  the parallelogram ceqe theref the rect caca  the parallelogram ceqe and by doubling the rect abab  the paral pqrs qed  corol   the rectangles of every pair of conjugate diameters are to one another reciprocally as the sines of their included angles for the areas of their parallelograms which are all equal among themselves are equal to the rectangles of the sides or conjugate diameters multiplied by the sines of their contained angles the radius being   that is the rectangle of every two conjugate diameters drawn into the sine of their contained angle is equal to the same constant quantity and therefore the rectangle of the diameters is inversely as the sine of their contained angle  corol   as it is proved in this proposition that every circumscribing parallelogram of an ellipse is a constant quantity so it may hence be shown that each of the spaces eagp eaeq gber gbgs between the curve and the tangents is equal to a constant quantity for since every diameter bisects the ellipse the conjugate diameters eg eg divide the ellipse into four equal sectors ceag ceae cgbe cgbg but the same conjugate diameters divide also the whole tangential parallelogram pqrs into four equal parts or small parallelograms cepg ceqe cgre cgsg and therefore the differences between these small parallelograms and the sectors which are the said external spaces must be all equal among themselves  and as the ellipse and circumscribing parallelogram both remain constant the difference of their fourth parts will also be a constant quantity that is the said external parts are each equal to the same constant quantity  proposition xvii the sum of the squares of every pair of conjugate diameters is equal to the same constant quantity namely the sum of the squares of the two axes  that is ab   ab   eg   eg  where eg eg are any conjugate diameters  diagram  for draw the ordinates ed ed then by

meeting the others diameter produced the two tangential triangles so formed will be equal  that is the triangle cet  the triangle can  diagram  for draw the ordinate de then by sim triangles cd ca ce cn but by prop   cd ca ca ct theref by equal ca ct ce cn  the two triangles cet can have then the angle c common and the sides about that angle reciprocally proportional therefore those triangles are

the rectangles phq phq are still in the same ratio therefore in general the rectangle phq phq phq phq  that is the rectangles of the parts of two parallel lines are to one another as the rectangles of

distances from the center or from the vertices the ordinates on both sides are equal or that the double ordinates are bisected by the axis and that the whole figure made up of all the double ordinates is also bisected by the axis   d the two foci are equally distant from the center or from either vertex  corol   when the angle which the plane of the section makes with the base of the cone decreases till it become equal to the angle made by the side of the cone and the base or till the section be parallel to the opposite side of the base then the axis becomes infinitely long and the hyperbola degenerates into a parabola and because then the infinites fb and hb are in a ratio of equality the general property namely affb ahhb fg  hi  becomes af ah fg  hi  or in the parabola the abscisses are to each other as the squares of their ordinates  proposition ii as the square of the transverse axis is to the square of the conjugate so is the rectangle of the abscisses to the square of their

p de becomes de ad p de or ad de de p  that is in the parabola the parameter is a third proportional to any absciss and its ordinate  proposition iii as the square of the conjugate axis  to the square

qed  corol when the line ih by revolving about the point   comes into the position of the tangent il and the ordinate lm being drawn then the points e and h meet in the point l and the points d k g

it appears from our proposition that rays of light issuing from the one focus and meeting the curve in every point will be reflected into lines drawn from the other focus so the ray fe is reflected

distance of their intersection from the center will be equal to the semitransverse axis  that is if fp fp be perpendicular to the tangent tpp then shall cp and cp be each equal to ca or cb  diagram  for through the point of contact e draw fe and fe meeting fp produced in g then the gep  fep being each equal to the fep and the angles at p being right and the side pe being common the two triangles

foci that is the perpendiculars pf pf give the foci f f  proposition xii the equal ordinates or the ordinates at equal distances from the center on the opposite sides and ends of an ellipse have their extremities connected by one right line passing through the center and that line is bisected by the center  that is if cd  cg or the ordinate de  gh then shall ce  ch and each will be a right line

conversely if each be a right line passing through the center then shall it be bisected by the center or have ce  ch also de will be  gh and cd  cg  corol   hence also if two tangents be drawn to the two ends e h of any diameter eh they will be parallel to each other and will cut the axis at equal angles and at equal distances from the center for the two cd ca being equal to the two cg cb the third pro portionals ct cs will be equal also then the two sides ce ct being equal to the two ch cs and the included angle ect equal to the included angle hcs all the other corresponding parts are equal and so the t  s and te parallel to hs  corol   and hence the four tangents at the four extremities of any two conjugate diameters form a parallelogram circumscribing the ellipse and the pairs of opposite sides are each equal to the corresponding parallel conjugate diameters  for if the diameter eh be drawn parallel to the tangent te or hs it will be the conjugate to eh by the definition and the tangents to eh will be parallel to each other and to the diameter eh for the same reason  proposition xiii if two ordinates ed ed be drawn from the extremities e e of two conjugate diameters and

this proposition is general for any line oblique to the axis also namely that the rectangle of the segments of any line cut by the curve and terminated by the asymptotes is equal to the square of the semidiameter to which the line is parallel since the demonstration is drawn from properties that are common to all diameters  proposition xxiv all the rectangles are equal which are made of the segments of any parallel lines cut by the curve and limited by the asymptotes  that is the rect hek  rect hek and the rect hek  hek  diagram  for each of the rectangles hek or hek is equal to the square of the parallel semidiameter cs and each of the rectangles hek or hek is equal to the square of the parallel semidiameter ci and therefore the rectangles of the segments of all parallel lines are equal to one another qed  corol   the rectangle hek being constantly the same whether the point e is taken on the one side or the other of the point of contact   of the tangent parallel to hk it follows that the parts he ke of any line hk are equal  and because the rectangle hek is constant whether the point e is taken in the one or the other of the opposite hyperbolas it follows that the parts he ke are also equal  corol   and when hk comes into the position of the tangent dil the last corollary becomes il  id and im  in and lm  dn  hence also the diameter cir bisects all the parallels to dl which are terminated by the asymptote namely rh  rk  corol   from the proposition and the last corollary it follows that the constant rectangle hek or ehe is  il  and the equal constant rect hek or ehe  mln or im   il   corol   and hence il  the parallel semidiameter cs  for the rect ehe  il  and the equal rect ehe  im   il  theref il   im   il  or im    il  but by cor   prop    im    cs  and therefore il  cs  and so the asymptotes passes through the opposite angles of all the inscribed parallelograms  proposition xxv the rectangle of any two lines drawn from any

cpaq  diagram  for by prop    the rect gek or cge  rect paq or cpa but the parallelograms cgek cpaq being equiangular are as the rectangles cge cpa and therefore the parallelogram gk  pq that is all the inscribed parallelograms are equal to one another qed  corol   because the rectangle gek or cge is constant therefore ge is reciprocally as cg or cg cp pa ge and hence the asymptote continually approaches toward the curve but never meets it for ge decreases continually as cg increases and t is always of some magnitude except when cg is supposed to be infinitely great for then ge is infinitely small or nothing so that the asymptote cg may be considered as a tangent to the curve at a point infinitely distant from c  diagram  corol   if the abscisses cd ce cg etc taken on the one

reciprocals of arithmeticals are harmonicals  proposition xxvii every inscribed triangle formed by any tangent and the two intercepted parts of the asymptotes is equal to a constant quantity namely double the inscribed parallelogram  that is the triangle cts    paral gk  diagram  for since the tangent ts is bisected by the point of contact e and ek is parallel to tc and ge to ck therefore ck ks

radii ch ci ck then the sectors chi cik etc or the spaces dhie eikg etc will be all equal among themselves or the sectors chi chk etc or the spaces dhie dhkg etc will be in arithmetical progression  and therefore these sectors or spaces will be analogous to the logarithms of the lines or bases cd ce cg etc namely chi or dhie the log of the ratio of cd to ce or of ce to cg etc or of ei to dh or of gk to ei etc and chk or dhkg the log of the ratio of cd to cg etc or of gk to dh etc  of the parabola proposition i the abscisses are proportional to the squares of their ordinates  let avm be a section through the axis of the cone and agih a parabolic section by a plane perpendicular to the former and parallel to the side un of the cone also let afh be the common intersection of the two planes or the axis of the parabola and fg hi ordinates perpendicular to it  diagram  then i say that af ah fg  hi   for through the ordinates fg hi draw the circular sections kgl min parallel to the base of the cone having kl mn for their diameters to which fg hi are ordinates as well as to the axis of the parabola  then by similar triangles af ah fl hn but because of the parallels kf  mh therefore af ah kffl mhhn but by the circle kffl  fg  and mhhn  hi  therefore af ah fg  hi  qed  corol   hence the third proportional eg ae or hi ah is a constant quantity and is equal to the parameter of the axis by cor   prop   of the ellipse  or ae eg eg p the parameter  or the rectangle pae  eg   corol   hence also as the property is the same for the ordinates on both sides of the diameter it follows that the ordinates dh hi on both sides of the axis are equal or that the double ordinates are bisected by the axis and that the whole figure made up of all the double ordinates is also bisected by the axis  proposition ii as the parameter of the axis is to the sum of any two ordinates so is the difference of those ordinates to the difference of their abscisses  that is p gh  de

tangent is equal to the absciss of the ordinate to the point of contact  diagram  corol   hence the tangents to all parabolas which have the same abscisses meet the axis produced in the same point for if the absciss am be the same in all the external axis ai which is equal to it will be the same also  corol   and hence also a tangent is easily drawn to the curve  for if the point of contact c be given draw the ordinate cm and produce ma till ai be  am then join ic the tangent  or if the point   be given take am  ai and draw the ordinate mc which will give the point of contact c to which draw

intersection of the tangent and axis  that is fc  ft  diagram  for draw the ordinate dc to the point of contact  then by cor   prop   at  ad therefore ft  af  ad but by prop   fc  af  ad therefore by

the tangent at the vertex ah is a mean proportional between af and ad  for because fht is a right angle therefore ah is a mean between af at or between af ad because ad  at likewise fh is a mean between fa ft or between fa fc  corol   the tangent tc makes equal angles with fc and the axis ft or with the line ick drawn parallel to the axis  for because ft  fc therefore the fct  ftc  its altern

reflected to the focus f that is all rays parallel to the axis are reflected to the focus or burning point  proposition vii if an ordinate be drawn to the point of contact of any tangent and another ordinate produced to cut the tangent it will be as the difference of the ordinates is to the difference added to the external part so is double the first ordinate to the sum of the ordinates  that is

property we can easily draw a tangent to the curve from any given point   namely draw ihg perpendicular to the axis and take ik a mean proportional between ih ig then draw kc parallel to the axis and c will be the point of contact through which and the given point   the tangent ic is to be drawn  proposition viii if there be any tangent and a double ordinate drawn from the point of contact and also any line parallel to the axis limited by the tangent and double ordinate then shall the curve divide that line in the same ratio as the line divides the double ordinate  that is ie ek ck kl

difference of the abscisses and the parameter of that diameter or a third proportional to any absciss and its ordinate  proposition xi if a line be drawn parallel to any tangent and cut the curve in two points then if two ordinates be drawn to the intersections and a third to the point of contact these three ordinates will be in arithmetical progression or the sum of the extremes will be equal to

are bisected by the diameter and their squares proportional to the abscisses so all the other properties of the axis and its ordinates and abscisses before demonstrated will likewise hold good for any diameter and its ordinates and abscisses and also those of the parameters understanding the parameter of any diameter as a third proportional to any absciss and its ordinate some of the most material of which are demonstrated in the following propositions  proposition xiii the parameter of any diameter is equal to four times the line drawn from the focus to the vertex of that diameter  that is  fc

 prop   fh   faft therefore p p faft ft  or by equal p p fa ft or fc but by prop   p   fa and therefore p   ft or  fc qed  corol hence the parameter p of the diameter cm is equal to  fa   ad or to p   ad that is the parameter of the axis added to  ad  proposition xiv if an ordinate to any diameter pass through the focus it will be equal to half its parameter and its absciss equal to one fourth of the same parameter  that is cm  p and me  p  diagram  for join fc and draw the tangent ct by the parallels cm  ft and by prop   fc  ft also by the last prop fc  p therefore cm  p again by the defin cm

be a tangent and any line drawn from the point of contact and meeting the curve in some other point as also another line parallel to the axis and limited by the first line and the tangent then shall

double ordinate cl meet in the same point of the diameter of that double ordinate produced and the diameter drawn through the intersection of two tangents bisects the line connecting the points of

and space described before entering upon the following problems it will be convenient here to lay down a synopsis of the theorems which express the several relations between any forces and their corresponding times velocities and spaces described which are all comprehended in the following    theorems  let f f be any two constant accelerative forces acting on any body during the respective times t t at the end of which are generated the velocities v v and described the spaces s s then because the spaces are as the times and velocities conjointly and the velocities as the forces and times we shall have  i in constant forces   ss  tvtv  t  ft f  v f  v  f   vv  ftft  st  s t  fsfs   tt  f v fv  sv  s v  f s fs   ff  t v tv  t  s t s  v v  s and if one of the forces as f be the force of gravity at the surface of the earth and be called   and its time t be    then it is known by experiment that the corresponding space s is         feet and consequently its velocity v   s     which call   g namely g         feet or     inches then the above four theorems in this case become as follows    s  tv   gft   v   gf   v    gft    s t    gfs   t  v  gf    s v  s gf   f  v  gt  s gt   v   gs and from these are deduced the following four theorems for variable forces viz  ii in variable forces   s  vv  gf  vt  0 v    gfs v    gft    t  s v  v  gf    f  vv  gs  v  gt in these four theorems the force f though variable is supposed to be constant for the indefinitely small time t and they are to be used in all cases of variable forces as the former ones in constant forces namely from the circumstances of the problem under consideration deduce an expression for the value of the force f which substitute in one of these theorems which shall be proper to the case in hand and the equation thence resulting will determine the corresponding values of the other quantities required in the problem  note that the motive force m of a body is equal to fq the product of the accelerative force and the quantity of matter in it and therefore m will be found by substituting m q for f in the theorems above  also the momentum or quantity of motion is q v the product of the velocity and matter  it is also to be observed that the theorems equally hold good for the destruction of motion and velocity by means of retarding forces as for the generation of the same by means of accelerating forces  and to the following problems which are all resolved by the application of these theorems it has been thought proper to subjoin their solutions for the better information and convenience of the student  the following table of the most common and useful forms of fluxions and fluents is inserted as it will be found very useful for assigning the fluents found in many of the following

begins to return down again and the time of its ascent  here f    0 as before  then by theor    feet or nearly    miles the distance moved  and by theor    the time of ascent  problem iii if a ball be projected up a smooth inclined plane which rises   foot in  0 and ascend  00 feet before it stop required the time of ascent and the velocity of projection  first by theor   v    gfs    x        x   0 x  0         0       0  feet per second the velocity  and by theor    seconds the time in motion  problem iv if a ball be observed to ascend up a smooth inclined plane  00 feet in ten seconds before it stop to return back again required the velocity of projection and the angle of the planes inclination  first by theor   v    s t   00 0   0 feet per sec the velocity  and by theor    that is the length of the plane is to its height as     to     therefore         00       the height of the plane or the fine of elevation to radius  00 which answers to      the angle of elevation of the plane  problem v by a mean of several experiments i have found that a cast iron ball of   inches diameter impinging perpendicularly on the face or end of a block of elm wood or in the direction of the fibers with a velocity of   00 feet per second penetrated    inches deep into its substance it is proposed then to determine the time of the penetration and the resisting force of the wood as compared to the force of gravity supposing that force to be a constant quantity  first by theor    part of a second the time  and by th    that is the resisting force of the wood is to the force of gravity as       to    but this number will be different according to the diameter of the ball and its density or specific gravity for since f is as v  s by theor   the density and size of the ball remaining the same if the density or specific gravity n vary and all the rest be constant it is evident that f will be as n and therefore f as nv  s when the size of the ball only is constant but when only the diameter d varies all the rest being constant the force of the blow will vary as d  or as the magnitude of the ball and the resisting surface or force of resistance varies as d  therefore f is as d  d  or as d only when all the rest are constant consequently f is as dnv  s when they are all variable  and so ff  dnv s  dnv  s and ss  dnv f  dnv  f where f denotes the strength or firmness of the substance penetrated and is here supposed to be the same for all balls and velocities in the same substance which it is either accurately or nearly so see pa     etc of my tracts vol    hence taking the numbers in the problem it is  the value of f for elm wood where the specific gravity of the ball is taken   which is a little less than that of solid cast iron as it ought on account of the air bubble that is cast in all balls  problem vi to find how far a    lb ball of cast iron will penetrate into a block of sound elm when fired with a velocity of   00 feet per second  here because the substance is the

about   to   which is not probable as oak is a much firmer and harder wood but it is to be suspected that mr robinss great penetration was owing to the splitting of his timber in some degree  problem viii a    pounder ball being fired into a bank of firm earth with a velocity of   00 feet per second penetrated    feet it is required then to ascertain the comparative resistances of elm and earth  comparing the numbers here with those in prob   it is  nearly    nearly that is elm resists about   times more than earth  problem ix to determine how far a leaden bullet of of an inch diameter will penetrate dry elm supposing it fired with a velocity of   00 feet per second and that the lead does not change its figure by the stroke against the wood  here d  n     n    then by the numbers and theorem in prob   it is  inches nearly the depth of penetration  but as mr robins found this penetration by experiment to be only   inches it follows either that his timber must have resisted about twice as much or else which is very probable that the defect in his penetration arose from the change of figure in the leaden ball from the blow against the wood  problem x a one pound ball projected with a velocity of   00 feet per second having been found to penetrate    inches deep into dry elm it is required to ascertain the time of passing through every single inch of the    and the velocity lost at each of them supposing the resistance of the wood constant or uniform  the velocity v being   00 feet or   00 x      000 inches and velocities and times being as the roots of the spaces in constant retarding forces as well as in accelerating ones and t being  part of a second the whole time of passing through the    inches therefore as            v veloc lost time in the    st    d    d

body as an inch plank in passing through it is very small also we can conceive such a plank shot through without oversetting it and may easily compute the height and breadth of such a plank as will just stand without being overset by the ball in passing through it  problem xi to determine the circumstances of space penetration velocity and time arising from a ball moving with a given velocity

force at the point p   diagram  then we have the three following equations x  r    g f    gr  x  the force at p or the velocity per second that would be generated by the force there tv   x and vv   fx     gr  x x   the fluents of the last equation give v     gr  x but when x  a the velocity v  0 therefore by correction  or  a general expression for the velocity at any point p  when x  r this gives  for the greatest velocity or the velocity when the body strikes the earth  when a is very great in respect of r the last velocity becomes    r  a very nearly or nearly   gr only which is accurately the greatest velocity by falling from an infinite height and this when r       miles is    0  miles per second also the velocity acquired in falling from the distance of the sun or   000 diameters of the earth is    0  miles per second and the velocity acquired in falling from the distance of the moon or  0 diameters is       miles per second  again to find the time since tv   x therefore  the correct fluent of which gives  arc to diameter a and verse a  x or the time of falling to any point p     r a g x ab  bp and when x  r this becomes  for the whole time of falling to the surface at s which is evidently infinite when a or ac is infinite although the velocity is then only the finite quantity   gr  when the height above the earths surface is given  g because r is then nearly  a and ad nearly  ds the time t for the distance g will be nearly r  gr  x  ds     gr x   gr   n as it ought to be  if a body at the distance of the moon at a fall to the earths surface at s then r       miles a   0 r and t      0    da   h       the time of falling from the moon to the earth  when the attracting body is considered as a point c the whole time of descending to c will be    r a g x abdc      a r a g  problem xiii the force of attraction below the earths surface being directly as the distance from the center it is proposed to determine the circumstances of velocity time and space fallen by a heavy body from the surface through a perforation made straight to the center of the earth abstracting from the effect of the earths rotation and supposing it to be a homogeneous sphere of      miles radius  put r  ac the radius of the earth x  cp the distance fallen v  the velocity at p t  the time there g         half the force at a f  the force at p   then ca cp   g f and the three equations are rf    gx and vv   fx and tv   x hence f    gxr and vv   gxx r the correct fluent of which gives  the velocity at the point p where pd and ce are perpendicular to ca so that the velocity at any point p is as the perpendicular pd at that point  diagram  when the body arrives at c then  feet or       miles per second which is the greatest velocity or that at the center c  again for the time  and the fluents give t  r  g x arc to cosine x r     gr x arc ad so that the time of descent to any point p is as the corresponding arc ad  when p arrives at c the above becomes t     gr x quadrant ae  ae  ac r  g     0  r  g       seconds       for the time of falling to the center c  the time of falling to the center is the same quantity    0  r  g from whatever point in the radius ac the body begins to move for let n be any given distance from c at which the motion commences then by correction  and hence  the fluents of which give t  r  g x arc to cosine x n which when x  0 gives t  r  g x quadrant     0  r  g for the time of descent to the center c  as an equal force acting in contrary directions generates or destroys an equal quantity of motion in the same time it follows that after passing the center the body will just ascend to the opposite surface at b in the same time in which it fell to the center from a then from b it will return again in the same manner through c to a and so vibrate continually between a and b the velocity being always equal at equal distances from c on both sides and the whole time of a double oscillation or of passing from a and arriving at a again will be quadruple the time of passing over the radius ac or    x       r  g   h        problem xiv to find the time of a pendulum vibrating in the arc of a cycloid  diagram  let s be the point of suspension sa  the arc sb or sc the length of the pendulum ca  ab  sb or sc the semicycloid ad  ds the diameter of its generating circle to which fke hig are perpendiculars   to any point g draw the tangent gp also draw gq parallel and pq perpendicular to ad then pg is parallel to the chord ai by the nature of the curve and by the nature of forces the force of gravity force in direct gp gp gq ai ah ad ai in like manner the force of grav force in curve at e ad ak that is the accelerative force in the curve is as the corresponding chord ai or ak of the circle or as the arc ag or ae of the cycloid since ag is always   ai so that the process and conclusions for the velocity and time of describing any arc in this case will be the same as in the last problem  from whence it follows that the time of a semivibration in all arcs ag ae etc is the same constant quantity    0  r  g     0  a    g     0  l  g and the time of a whole vibration from b to c or from c to b is       l  g where l  as  ab is the length of the pendulum g         feet or     inches and       the circumference of a circle whose diameter is    since the time of a bodys falling by gravity through l or half the length of the pendulum is l  g which being in proportion to       l  g as   to       therefore the diameter of a circle is to its circumference as the time of falling through half the length of a pendulum to the time of one vibration  if the time of the whole vibration be   second this equation arises          l  g and hence l    g        g      and g         x l        l so that if one of these g or l be given by experiment these equations will give the other when g for instance is supposed to be        feet or     inches then is l  g            the length of a pendulum to vibrate seconds or if l     the length of the seconds pendulum for the latitude of london then is g        l     0  inches      0   00 feet or nearly        feet for the space descended by gravity in the first second of time in the latitude of london  hence the times of vibration of pendulums are as the square roots of their lengths and the number of vibrations made in a given time reciprocally as the square roots of the lengths and hence the length of a pendulum vibrating n times in a minute or  0 is l        x  0  n     0  0 nn  when a pendulum vibrates in a circular arc as the length of the string is constantly the same the time of vibration will be longer than in a cycloid but the two times will approach nearer together as the circular arc is smaller so that when it is very small the times of vibration will be nearly equal and hence    inches is the length of a pendulum vibrating seconds in the very small arc of a circle  problem xv to find the velocity and time of a heavy body descending down the arc of a circle or vibrating in the arc by a line fixed in the center  let d be the beginning of the descent c the center and a the lowest point of the circle draw de and pq perpendicular to ac then the velocity in p being the same as in q by falling through eq it will be  when a  ae x  aq and g          diagram  but the fluxion of the time t is  ap  v and  where r  the radius ac therefore  where d    r the diameter or  etc  but the fluent of  is   a x arc to rad a and verse x or it is the arc whose rad is   and verse   x a which call a and let the fluents of the succeeding terms without the coefficients be b c d e etc then will the fluxion of any one as q at n distance from a be q  xna  xp which suppose also  the fluxion of   hence by equating the coefficients of the like terms  and  which being substituted the fluential terms become   but when x  a those terms become barely  which being subtracted and x taken  0 there arises for the whole time of descending down da or the corrected value of   when the arc is small as in the vibration of the pendulum of a clock all the terms of the series may be omitted after the second and then the time of a vibration t is nearly     0  r  g x    a  r and therefore the times of vibration of a pendulum in different arcs are as   r  a or   times the radius added to the versed sine of the arc  if d be the degrees of the pendulums vibration on each side of the lowest point of the small arc the radius being r the diameter d and        p then is the length of that arc a  prd    0 but the versed sine in terms of the arc is a  a   r  a    r   etc  a  d  a   d   etc therefore a d  a  d   a   d   etc  p d   0   p d   0   etc or only  p d   0  the first term by rejecting all the rest of the terms on account of their smallness or a d  a  r nearly  d       this value then being substituted for a d or a  r in the last near value of the time it becomes t     0  r  g x    d     0 nearly and therefore the times of vibration in different small arcs are as     0  d  or as     0 added to the square of the number of degrees in the arc  hence it follows that the time lost in each second by vibrating in a circle instead of the cycloid is d     0 and consequently the time lost in a whole day of    hours or    x  0 x  0 seconds is    d  nearly in like manner the seconds lost per day by vibrating in the arc of degrees is      therefore if the pendulum keep true time in one of these arcs the seconds lost or gained per day by vibrating in the other will be    d     so for example if a pendulum measure true time in an arc of   degrees it will lose    seconds a day by vibrating   degrees and    seconds a day by vibrating   degrees and so on  and in like manner we might proceed for any other curve as the ellipse hyperbola parabola etc  problem xvi to determine the time of a body descending down the chord of a circle  let c be the center ab the vertical diameter ap any chord down which a body is to descend from p to a and pq perpendicular to ab now as the natural force of gravity in the vertical direction ba is to the force urging the body down the plane pa as the length of the plane ap is to its height aq therefore the velocity in pa and qa will be equal at all equal perpendicular distances below pq and consequently the time in pa time in qa pa qa ba pa but time in ba time in qa ba qa ba pa hence as three of the terms in each proportion are the same the fourth terms must be equal namely the time in ba  the time pa  diagram  and in like manner the time in bp  the time in ba so that in general the times of descending down all the chords ba bp br bs etc or pa ra sa etc are all equal and each equal to the time of falling freely through the diameter which time is   r g where g         feet and r  the radius ac for g   r     r g  scholium by comparing this with the results of the two preceding problems it will appear that the times in the cycloid and in the arc of a circle and in any chord of the circle are respectively as the three quantities      a  r etc and       or nearly as the three quantities      a  r        the first and last being constant but the middle one or the time in the circle varying with the extent of the arc of vibration also the time in the cycloid is the least but in the chord the greatest for the greatest value of the series in prob    when a  r or the arc ad is a quadrant is    0   and in that case the proportion of the three times is as the numbers      0          moreover the time in the circle approaches to that in the cycloid as the arc decreases and they are very nearly equal when that arc is very small  problem xvii to find the time and velocity of a chain consisting of very small links descending from a smooth horizontal plane the chain being  00 inches long and   inch of it hanging off the plane at the commencement of motion  put a    inch the length at the beginning l   00 the whole length of the chain x  any variable length off the plane   then x is the motive force to move the body and x l  f the accelerative force  hence vv    gfs    g x x l x x    gxx l  the fluents give v     gx  l but v  o when x  a therefore by correction  and  the velocity for any length x and when the chain just quits the plain x  l and then the greatest velocity is  inches or          feet per second  again t or  the correct fluent of which is  the time for any length x and when x  l   00 it is  seconds the time when the last of the chain just quits the plane  problem xviii to find the time and velocity of a chain of very small links quitting a pulley by passing freely over it the whole length being  00 inches and the one end hanging   inches below the other at the beginning  put a    l   00 and x  bd any variable difference of the two parts ab ac  then x l  f and vv or   gfs    g  x l  x  gxx l  hence the correct fluent is  and  the general expression of the velocity and when x  l or c arrives at a it is  inches or          feet for the greatest velocity when the chain just quits the pulley  diagram  again t or  and the correct fluent is  the general expression for the time and when x  l it becomes  seconds the whole time when the chain just quits the pulley  so that the velocity and time at quitting the pulley in this prob and the plane in the last prob are the same the distance descended    being the same in both for although the weight l moved in this latter case be double of what it was in the former the moving force x is also double because here the one end of the chain shortens as much as the other end lengthens so that the space descended x is doubled and becomes x and hence the accelerative force x l or f is the same in both and of course the velocity and time the same for the same distance descended  problem xix to find the number of vibrations made by two weights connected by a very fine thread passing freely over a tack or a pulley while the less weight is drawn up to it by the descent of the heavier weight at the other end  suppose the motion to commence at equal distances below the pulley at b and that the weights are   and   pounds  put a  ab half the length of the thread b     inc or        feet the seconds pend x  b w  bw any space passed over z  the number of vibrations   diagram  then  is the accelerating force and hence v or   gfs    gfx and t or x v  x  gfx but by the nature of pendulums  the vibrations per second made by either weight namely the longer or shorter according as the upper or under sign is used if the threads were to continue of that length for   second hence then as  the fluxion of the number of vibrations  now when the upper sign  takes place the fluent is  and when x  a the same then becomes z  b gf x log         b g x log                x log             the whole number of vibrations made by the descending weight  but when the lower sign or  takes place the fluent is b  gf x arc to rad   and verse   x a which when x  a gives  the whole number of vibrations made by the lesser or ascending weight  schol it is evident that the whole number of vibrations in each case is the same whatever the length of the thread is and that the greater number is to the less as    0  to hyp log       farther the number of vibrations performed in the same time t by an invariable pendulum constantly of the same length a is b gf      0 for the time of descending the space a or the fluent of t  x  gfx when x  a is t  a gf and by the nature of pendulums a b   vibr  the number of vibrations performed in   second hence   t b a t b a  b gf the constant number of vibrations  so that the three numbers of vibrations namely of the ascending constant and descending pendulums are proportional to the numbers    0    and hyp log      or as    0    and      whatever be the length of the thread  problem xx to determine the circumstances of the ascent and descent of two unequal weights suspended at the two ends of a thread passing over a pulley the weight of the thread and of the pulley being considered in the solution let l  the whole length of the thread a  the weight of the same b  a w the dif of lengths at first d  w  w the dif of the two weights c  a with applied to the circumference such as to be equal to its whole with and friction reduced to the circumference s  w  w  a  c the sum of the weights moved   diagram  then the weight of b is ab l and d  ab l is the moving force at first but if x denote any variable space descended by w or ascended by w the difference of the lengths of the thread will be altered   x so that the difference will then be b    x and its weight  consequently the motive force there will be  and theref  the accelerating force there hence then  the fluents of which give  or  the general expression for the velocity putting  and when x  b or w becomes as far below w as it was above it at the beginning it is barely v    bdg s for the velocity at that time also when a the weight of the thread is nothing the velocity is only   dgx s as it ought  again for the time t or  the fluents of which give  the general expression for the time of descending any space x  and if the radicals be expanded in a series and the log of it be taken the same time will become  which therefore becomes barely sx dg when a the weight of the thread is nothing as it ought  problem xxi to find the velocity and time of vibration of a small weight fixed to the middle of a line or fine thread void of gravity and stretched by a given tension the extent of the vibration being very small  diagram  let l  ac half the length of the thread a  cd the extent of the vibration x  ce any variable distance from c w  with of the small body fixed to the middle w  a with which hung at each end of the thread will be equal to the constant tension at each end acting in the direction of the thread   now by the nature of forces ae ce w the force in direction ea the force in direction ec or because ac is nearly  ae the vibration being very small taking ac instead of ae it is ac ce w w x l the force in ec arising from the tension in ea which will be also the same for that in eb therefore the sum is  w x l  the whole motive force in ec arising from the tensions on both sides consequently  w x lw  f the accelerative force there hence the equation of the fluxions is vv or   gfs    gw xx lw and the fluents v      gw x  lw but when x  a this is    gw a  lw and should be  o therefore the correct fluents are  and  the velocity of the little body w at any point e and when x  o it is v    a gw  lw for the greatest velocity at the point c  now if we suppose w    grain w    lb troy or    00 grains and   l  ab    feet the velocity c becomes  so that if a    0 inc the greatest veloc is  ft per sec if a    inc the greatest veloc is       0 ft per sec if a    inc the greatest veloc is       0 ft per sec to find the time t it is t or  hence the correct fluent is t  wlw g x arc to cosine x a and radius   the time in de and when x  o the whole time in dc or of half a vibration is     wlw g and consequently the time of a whole vibration through d d is    0  wlw g  using the foregoing numbers namely w    w     00 and   l    feet this expression for the time is  the number of vibrations per second but if w    there would be   0 vibrations per second and if w   00 there would be         vibrations per second  problem xxii to determine the same as in the last problem when the distance cd bears some sensible proportion to the length ab the tension of the thread however being still supposed a constant quantity  diagram  using here the same notation as in the last problem and taking the true variable length ae for ac it is ae or  the whole motive force from the two equal tensions w in ae and eb and therefore  is the accelerative force at e therefore the fluxional equation is vv or  and the fluents  but when x  a these are  therefore the correct fluents are  and hence  the general expression for the velocity at e and when e arrives at c it gives the greatest velocity there  which when w     00 w      l    feet and cd    inches or a foot is  feet per second which came out       0 in the last problem by using always ac for ae in the value of f but when the extent of the vibrations is very small as   0 of an inch as it commonly is this greatest velocity here will be   x    00 x        x     00    nearly which in the last problem was    to find the time it is  making  to find the fluent the easier multiply the numerator and denominator both by  so shall  expand now the quantity  in a series and put d  c  l so shall  now the fluent of the first term  is  the arc to sine x a and radius   which arc call a and let p q be the fluents of any other two successive terms without the coefficients the distance of q from the first term a being n then it is evident that q  x p  x n a and p  x n a assume therefore  then is q or  then comparing the coefficients of the like terms we find      en and b    n    ea  from which are obtained e     n and b    n     n a  consequently  the general equation between any two successive terms and by means of which the series may be continued as far as we please and hence neglecting the coefficients putting a  the first term namely the arc whose sine is x a and b c d etc the following terms the series is as follows  now when x  o this series  0 and when x  a the series becomes p  a a       a b       a c    etc where p        or the series is   so that by taking in the coefficients the general time of passing over any distance de will be  etc  and hence taking x  0 and doubling the time of a whole vibration or double the time of passing over cd will be equal to  which when a  0 or c  l becomes only p wlw g the same as in the last problem as it ought  taking here the same numbers as in the last problem viz l     a  w    w     00 g         then  and the series is   00     000    00000  etc   00   0 therefore00 0    x  00   0 00 0          is the time of one whole vibration and consequently     vibrations are performed in a second which were   0 in the last problem  problem xxiii it is proposed to determine the velocity and the time of vibration of a fluid in the arms of a canal or bent tube  let the tube abcdef have its two branches ac ge vertical and the lower part cde in any position whatever the whole being of a uniform diameter or width throughout let water or quicksilver or any other fluid be poured in till it stand in equilibrio at any horizontal line bf then let one surface be pressed or pushed down by shaking from b to c and the other will ascend through the equal space fg after which let them be permitted freely to return the surfaces will then continually vibrate in equal times between ac and eg the velocity and times of which oscillations are therefore required  diagram  when the surfaces are any where out of a horizontal line as at p and q the parts of the fluid in qdr on each side below qr will balance each other and the weight of the part in pr which is equal to  pf gives motion to the whole so that the weight of the part  pf is the motive force by which the whole fluid is urged and therefore with of  pf  whole with is the accelerative force which weights being proportional to their lengths if l be the length of the whole fluid or axis of the tube filled and a  fg or bc then is a l the accelerative force putting therefore x  gp any variable distance v the velocity and t the time then pf  a  x and  the accelerative force hence vv or   gfs    g l  ax  xx the fluents of which give v     g l   ax  x  and  is the general expression for the velocity at any term and when x  a it becomes v    a g l for the greatest velocity at b and f  again for the time we have t or  the fluents of which give t  l g x arc to versed sine x  a and radius   the general expression for the time and when x  a it becomes t  p l g for the time of moving from g to f p being        and consequently p l g the time of a whole vibration from g to e or from c to a and which therefore is the same whatever ab is the whole length l remaining the same  and the time of vibration is also equal to the time of the vibration of a pendulum whose length is l or half the length of the axis of the fluid so that if the length l be    inches it will oscillate in   second  schol this reciprocation of the water in the canal is nearly similar to the motion of the waves of the sea for the time of vibration is the same however short the branches are provided the whole length be the same so that when the height is small in proportion to the length of the canal the motion is similar to that of a wave from the top to the bottom or hollow and from the bottom to the top of the next wave being equal to two vibrations of the canal the whole length of a wave from top to top being double the length of the canal hence the wave will move forward by a space nearly equal to its breadth in the time of two vibrations of a pendulum whose length is  l half the length of the canal or one fourth of the breadth of a wave or in the time of one vibration of a pendulum whose length is the whole breadth of the wave since the times of vibration are as the square roots of their lengths consequently waves whose breadth is equal to    inches or        feet will move over      feet in a second or     feet in a minute or nearly   miles and a quarter in an hour and the velocity of greater or less waves will be increased or diminished in the subduplicate ratio of their breadths  problem xxiv to determine the time of filling the ditches of a work with water at the top by a sluice of   feet square the head of water above the sluice being  0 feet and the dimensions of the ditch being  0 feet wide at bottom    at top   deep and  000 feet long  the capacity of the ditch is    000 cubic feet  but g  0   g   0 g the velocity of the water through the sluice the area of which is   square feet therefore   0 g is the quantity per second running through it and consequently   0 g    000         0 g       or      nearly is the time filling the ditch  problem xxv to determine the time of emptying a vessel of water by a sluice in the bottom of it or in the side near the bottom the height of the aperture being very small in respect of the altitude of the fluid  put a  the area of the aperture or sluice   g     feet the force of gravity d  the whole depth of water x  the variable alt of the surface above the aperture a  the area of the surface of the water   then g x   g   gx the velocity with which the fluid will issue at the sluice and hence a a   gx   a gxa the velocity with which the surface of the water will descend at the altitude x or the space it would descend in   second with the velocity there now in descending the space x the velocity may be considered as uniform and uniform descents are as their times therefore   a gxa x   a x  a gx the time of descending x space or the fluxion of the time of exhausting that is t  a x  a gx  then when the nature or figure of the vessel is given there will be given a in terms of x which value of a being substituted into this fluxion of the time the fluent of the result will be the time of exhausting sought  so if for example the vessel be any prism or every where of the same breadth then a is a constant quantity and therefore the fluent is  a  a x g but when x  d this becomes  a  a d g and should be o therefore the correct fluent is  for the time of the surface descending till the depth of the water be x and when x  o the whole time of exhausting is barely a  a d g  and hence if a be  0000 square feet a    square foot and d   0 feet the time is      seconds or  b        again if the vessel be a ditch or canal of  0 feet broad at the bottom    at the top   deep and  000 feet long then is  the breadth of the surface of the water when its depth in the canal is x and consequently  is the surface at that time consequently t or  is the fluxion of the time the correct fluent of which when x  o is  nearly or  h         the whole time of exhausting by a sluice of   foot square  problem xxvi to determine the time of emptying any ditch or inundation etc by a cut or notch from the top to the bottom of it  let ab  x the variable height of water at any time ac  b the breadth of the cut d  the whole or first depth of water a  the area of the surface of the water in the ditch g         feet   diagram  the velocity at any point d is as bd that is as the ordinate de of a parabola bec whose base is ac and altitude ab therefore the velocities at all the points in ab are as all the ordinates of the parabola consequently the quantity of water running through the cut abgc in any time is to the quantity which would run through an equal aperture placed all at the bottom in the same time as the area of the parabola abc to the area of the paralellogram abgc that is as   to    but g x   g   gx the velocity at ac therefore x   gx x bx     bx gx is the quantity discharged per second through abgc and consequently   bx gx a is the velocity per second of the descending surface hence then   bx gx a  x    a x  bx gx  t the fluxion of the time of descending  now when a the surface of the water is constant or the ditch is equally broad throughout the correct fluent of this fluxion gives  for the general time of sinking the surface to any depth x and when x  0 this expression is infinite which shows that the time of a complete exhaustion is infinite  but if d    feet b    feet a     x  000    000 and it be required to exhaust the water down to   0 of a foot deep then x    0 and the above expression becomes  or just   hours for that time and if it be required to depress it   feet or till   foot depth of water remain in the ditch the time of sinking the water to that point will be        again if the ditch be the same depth and length as before but  0 feet broad at bottom and    at top then the descending surface will be a variable quantity and by prob    it will be  hence in this case the fluxion of the time or  a x  bx gx becomes  the correct fluent of which is  for the time of sinking the water to any depth x  now when x  0 this expression for the complete exhaustion becomes infinite  but if x    foot the time t is        and when x    0 foot the time is  h  0     problem xxvii to determine the time of filling the ditches of a fortification   feet deep with water through the sluice of a trunk of   feet square the bottom of which is level with the bottom of the ditch and the height of the supplying water is   feet above the bottom of the ditch  let acdb represent the area of the vertical sluice being a square of   square feet and ab level with the bottom of the ditch and suppose the ditch filled to any height ae the surface being then at of  diagram  put a    the height of the head or supply b     ab  ac g         a  the area of a horizontal section of the ditches x  a  ae the height of the head above of   then g x   g   gx the velocity with which the water presses through the part aefb and therefore   gx x aefb    b gx  a  x is the quantity per second running through aefb also by the last problem the quantity running per second through ecdf is   gx x ecdf     b gx  b  a  x consequently the sum of the two or b gx  a    b  x is the quantity per second running in by the whole sluice acdb hence then  is the rate or velocity per second with which the water rises in the ditches and so  the fluxion of the time of filling to any height ae putting c  a    b  now when the ditches are of equal width throughout a is a constant quantity and in that case the correct fluent of this fluxion is  the general expression for the time of filling to any height ae or a  x not exceeding the height ac of the sluice and when x  ac  a  b  d suppose then  is the time of filling to cd the top of the sluice  again for filling to any height gh above the sluice x denoting as before a  ag the height of the head above gh   gx will be the velocity of the water through the whole sluice ad and therefore   b  gx the quantity per second and   b  gxa  v the rise per second of the water in the ditches consequently v  x   t   x v  a    b  g x x x the general fluxion of the time the correct fluent of which being o when x  a  b  d is t  a  b  g  d  x the time of filling from cd to gh  then the sum of the two times namely that of filling from ab to cd and that of filling from cd to gh is  for the whole time required and using the numbers in the problem this becomes  a the time in terms of a the area of the length and breadth or horizontal section of the ditches and if we suppose that area to be  00000 square feet the time required will be      or  h       and if the sides of the ditch slope a little so as to be a little narrower at the bottom than at top the process will be nearly the same substituting for a its variable value as in prob    and    and the time of filling will be very nearly the same as that above determined  problem xxviii but if the water from which the ditches are to be filled is the tide which at low water is below the bottom of the trunk and rises to   feet above the bottom of it by a regular rise of one foot in half an hour it is required to ascertain the time of filling it to   feet high as before in the last problem  let acdb represent the sluice and when the tide has risen to any height gh below cd the top of the sluice without the ditches let of be the mean height of the water within and  diagram  put b     ab  ac g         a  horizontal section of the ditches x  ag z  ae   then  the veloc of the water through aefb and  the mean veloc through eghf theref  is the quantity per second through aefb and  is the same through eghf conseq  is the whole through aghb per sec this quantity divided by the surface a gives  the velocity per second with which of or the surface of the water in the ditches rises

water in the ditches when the tide is at cd or   feet high without or in the first hour and half of time  again to find the time after the above when of arrives at cd or when the water in the ditches

etc or  etc  and when z     ac it gives x       for the height of the tide without when the ditches are filled to the top of the sluice or   feet high which answers to  h        lastly to find the time of rising the remaining   feet above the top of the sluice let  x  cg the height of the tide above cd z  ce the height in the ditches above cd and the other dimensions as before  diagram  then  the velocity with which the water runs through the whole sluice ad consequently  is the quantity per second running through the sluice and  the velocity of z or the rise of the water in the ditches per second hence  and  is the fluxional equation where n  a    0  g  m     00 0   to find the fluent assume z  a x    b x    c x    d x   etc then x  z  x  a x    b x    c x   etc  etc nz     na x x

therefore the correct fluent is  etc or z  nearly and when z    x      or   the heights above the top of the sluice answering to   and   above the bottom of the ditches that is for the water to rise to the height of   feet within the ditches it is necessary for the tide to rise to   without which answers to  h    minutes and so long it would take to fill the ditches   feet deep with water their horizontal area being  00000 square feet  moreover when x    then z       the height above the top of the sluice to which add   the height of the sluice and the sum      or nearly   feet is the depth of water in the ditches in   hours and a half or when the tide has risen to the height of   feet without the ditches  of the motion of bodies in fluids problem xxix to determine the force of fluids in motion and the circumstances attending bodies moving in fluids    it is evident that the resistance to a plane moving perpendicularly through an infinite fluid at rest is equal to the pressure or force of the fluid upon the plane at rest and the fluid moving with the same velocity and in the contrary direction to that of the plane in the former case but the force of the fluid in motion must be equal to the weight or pressure which generates that motion and which it is known is equal to the weight or pressure of a column of the fluid whose base is equal to the plane and its altitude equal to the height through which a body must fall by the force of gravity to acquire the velocity of the fluid and that altitude is for the sake of brevity called the altitude due to the velocity so that if a denote the area of the plane v the velocity and n the specific gravity of the fluid then the altitude due to the velocity v being v   g the whole resistance or motive force m will be a x n x v   g  anv   g g being        feet and hence caeteris paribus the resistance is as the square of the velocity    this ratio of the square of the velocity may be otherwise derived thus the force of the fluid in motion must be as the force of one particle multiplied by the number of them but the force of a particle is as its velocity and the number that strikes the plane in a given time is also as the velocity therefore the whole force is as v x v or v  that is as the square of the velocity    if the direction of motion instead of being perpendicular to the plane as above supposed were inclined to it in any angle the sine of that angle being s to the radius   then the resistance to the plane or the force of the fluid against the plane in the direction of the motion as assigned above will be diminished in the triplicate ratio of radius to the sine of the angle of inclination or in the ratio of   to s  for ab being the direction of the plane and bd that of the motion making the angle abd whose sine is s the number of particles or quantity of the fluid striking the plane will be diminished in the ratio of   to s or of radius to the sine of the angle b of inclination and the force of each particle will also be diminished in the same ratio of   to s so that on both these accounts the whole resistance will be diminished in the ratio of   to s  or in the duplicate ratio of radius to the sine of the said angle but again it is to be considered that this whole resistance is exerted in the direction be perpendicular to the plane and any force in the direction be is to its effect in the direction ae parallel to bd as ae to bf that is as   to s so that finally on all these accounts the resistance in the direction of motion is diminished in the ratio of   to s  or in the triplicate ratio of radius to the fine of inclination hence comparing this with article   the whole resistance or the motive force on the plane will be m  anv  s   g    also if w denote the weight of the body whose plane face a is resisted by the absolute force m then the retarding force f or m w will be anv  s   gw    and if the body be a cylinder whose face or end is a and diameter d or radius r moving in the direction of its axis because then s    and a  pr   pd  where p        the resisting force m will be npd  v    g  npr  v   g and the retarding force f  npd  v    gw  npr  v   gw    this is the value of the resistance when the end of the cylinder is a plane perpendicular to its axis or to the direction of motion but were its face a conical surface or an elliptic section or any other figure every where equally inclined to the axis the fine of inclination being s then the number of particles of the fluid striking the face being still the same but the force of each opposed to the direction of motion diminished in the duplicate ratio of radius to the fine of inclination the resisting force m will be npd  v  s    g  npr  v  s   g but if the body were terminated by an end or face of any other form as a spherical one or such like where every part of it has a different inclination to the axis then a farther investigation becomes necessary such as in the following proposition  problem xxx to determine the resistance of a fluid to any body moving in it of a curved end as a sphere or a cylinder with a hemispherical end etc    let bead be a section through the axis ca of the solid moving in the direction of that axis to any point of the curve draw the tangent eg meeting the axis produced in g also draw the perpendicular ordinates of of indefinitely near to each other and draw ae parallel to cg putting cf  x of  y be  z s  fine g to radius   and p        then   py is the circumference whose radius is of or the circumference described by the point e in revolving about the axis ca and   py x ee or   pyz is the fluxion of the surface or the surface described by ee in the said revolution about ca and which is the quantity represented by a in art   of the last problem hence nv  s   g x   pyz or pnv  s   g x yz is the resistance on that ring or the fluxion of the resistance to the body whatever the figure of it may be and the fluent of which will be the resistance required  diagram    in the case of a spherical form putting the radius ca or cb  r we have  and yz or of x e  ce x a  rx therefore the general fluxion  becomes  the fluent of which or  is the resistance to the spherical surface generated by be and when x or cf is  r or ca it becomes pnv  r   g for the resistance on the whole hemisphere which is also equal to pnv  d    g where d    r the diameter    but the perpendicular resistance to the circle of the same diameter d or bd by art   of the preceding problem is pnv  d    g which being double the former shows that the resistance to the sphere is just equal to half the direct resistance to a great circle of it or to a cylinder of the same diameter    since pd  is the magnitude of the globe if n denote its density or specific gravity its weight w will be  pd  n and therefore the retardive force f or m w  pnv  d    g x   pn d     nv    gn d which is also  v   gs by art   of the general theorems in page     hence then   n n d    s and s  n  n x    d which is the space that would be described by the globe while its whole motion is generated or destroyed by a constant force which is equal to the force of resistance if no other force acted on the globe to continue its motion and if the density of the fluid were equal to that of the globe the resisting force is such as acting constantly on the globe without any other force would generate or destroy its motion in describing the space    d by that accelerating or retarding force    hence the greatest velocity that a globe will acquire by descending in a fluid by means of its relative weight in the fluid will be found by making the resisting force equal to that weight for after the velocity is arrived at such a degree that the resisting force is equal to the weight that urges it it will increase no longer and the globe will afterward continue to descend with that velocity uniformly now n and n being the separate specific gravities of the globe and fluid n  n will be the relative gravity of the globe in the fluid and therefore w  pd  n  n the weight by which it is urged also m  pnv  d    g is the resistance consequently pnv  d    g     pd  n  n when the velocity becomes uniform from which is found  for the said uniform or greatest velocity  and by comparing this form with that in art   of the general theorems in page     it will appear that its greatest velocity is equal to the velocity generated by the accelerating force  in describing the space    d or equal to the velocity generated by gravity in freely describing the space  or the specific gravity of the globe be double that of the fluid then      the natural force of gravity and then the globe will attain its greatest velocity in describing    d or    of its diameter  it is farther evident that if the body be very small it will very soon acquire its greatest velocity whatever its density may be  ex if a leaden ball of   inch diameter descend in water and in air of the same density as at the earths surface the three specific gravities being as    and   and    00 then  feet is the greatest velocity per second the ball can acquire by descending in water and  nearly  is the greatest velocity it can acquire in air  but if the globe were only   00 of an inch diameter the greatest velocities it could acquire would be only   0 of these namely    00 of a foot in water and    feet nearly in air and if the ball were still farther diminished the greatest velocity would also be diminished and that in the subduplicate ratio of the diameter of the ball  problem xxxi to determine the relations of velocity space and time of a ball moving in a fluid in which it is projected with a given velocity    let a  the first velocity of projection x the space described in any time t and v the velocity then now by art   of the last problem the accelerative force f    nv    gn d where n is the density of the ball n that of the fluid and d the diameter therefore the general equation vv    gfs becomes vv    nv  n d x and hence v v    n n d x   bx putting b for   n n d and the correct fluent of this is log a  log v or log a v  bx or put c             the number whose hyp log is   then is a v  cbx and the velocity v  a cbx  acbx    the velocity v at any time being the c bx part of the first velocity therefore the velocity lost in any time will be the    c bx part or the  part of the first velocity  ex   if a globe be projected with any velocity in a medium of the same density with itself and it describe a space equal to   d or   of its diameters then x    d and   n n d     d therefore bx     and the velocity lost is  or nearly of the projectile velocity  ex   if an iron ball of   inches diameter were projected with a velocity of   00 feet per second to find the velocity lost after moving through  00 feet of air we should have d       a    00 x   00 n    n 00   and therefore  and  feet per second having lost  0  feet or nearly of its first velocity  ex   if the earth revolved about the sun in a medium as dense as the atmosphere near the earths surface and it were required to find the quantity of motion lost in a year then since the earths mean density is about   and its distance from the sun   000 of its diameters we have   000 x              diameters  x and  hence  parts are lost of the first motion in the space of a year and only the       part remains  ex   if it be required to determine the distance moved x when the globe has lost any part of its motion as suppose and the density of the globe and fluid equal the general equation gives x     x log a v    d  x log of             d so that the globe loses half its motion before it has described twice its diameter    to find the time t we have t  s v  x v  cbx x a now to find the fluent of this put z  cb x then is bx  log z and bx  z z or x  z bz consequently t or cbx x a  zx a  z ab and hence t  z ab  cbx  ab but as t and x vanish together and when x  0 the quantity cbx  ab    ab therefore by correction  the time sought where b    n n d and v  a cb x the velocity  ex if an iron ball of   inches diameter were projected in the air with a velocity of   00 feet per second and it were required to determine in what time it would pass over  00 yards or   00 feet and what would be its velocity at the end of that time we should have as in ex   above  and bx    00             hence   b        and   a     00 and   v  cbx  a         00     0 nearly consequently v    0 is the velocity and t   b   v    a       x    0     00         seconds is the time required or   and nearly  problem xxxii to determine the relations of space time and velocity when a globe descends by its own weight in an infinite fluid  the foregoing notation remaining viz d  diameter n and n the density of the ball and fluid and v s t the velocity space and time in motion we have pd   the magnitude of the ball and pd  n  n  its weight in the fluid also m  pnd  v    g  its resistance from the fluid consequently    pd  n  n  pnd  v    g is the force by which the ball is urged which being divided by pn d  the quantity of matter moved gives f     nn    nv    gn d for the accelerative force    hence vv    gfs and  putting b    n n d and  or ab    g the fluent of which is  an expression for the space s in terms of the velocity v    but now to determine v in terms of s put c             then since  therefore  or  and hence  the velocity sought    the greatest velocity is to be found as in art   of prob  0 by making f or    nn    nv    gn d  0 which gives  the same value is also obtained by making the fluxion of v  or a  ac  bs  o and the same value of v is obtained by making s infinite for then c  bs  0 but this velocity a cannot be attained in any finite time and it only denotes the velocity to which the general value of v or  continually approaches it is evident however that it will approximate toward it the faster the greater b is or the less d is and that the diameters being very small the bodies descend by nearly uniform velocities which are directly in the subduplicate ratio of the diameters see also art   prob  0 for other observations on this head    since c bs is the number whose log is    bs it will be  etc putting e    bs    ns n d hence    ce  e  e   e   etc and  and when n is very great in respect of n then all the terms after the first being very small v will be nearly  nearly that is the velocity freely generated by gravity as it ought    to find the time t we have  then to find the fluent of this fluxion put  hence  and  consequently  and therefore the fluent is  which is the general expression for the time    when n is very great in respect of n then as in art   v    abs and log  and therefore t     bs       s ab  s g the same as the time of descending freely by gravity as it ought  ex if it were required to determine the time and velocity by descending in air  000 feet the ball being of lead and   inch diameter  here n     n     00 d      and s   000 hence  and  conseq  the velocity and  the time  note if the globe be so light as to ascend in the fluid it is only necessary to change the signs of the first two terms in the value of f or the accelerating force by which it becomes f  nn       nv    gn d and then proceeding in all respects as before  scholium to compare this theory contained in the last four problems with experiment i shall here extract the few following numbers from extensive tables of velocities and resistances resulting from a course of many hundred very accurate experiments made by me in the course of the year      of which a particular account will be given elsewhere  in the first column are contained the mean uniform or greatest velocities acquired in air by globes hemispheres cylinders and cones all of the same diameter and the altitude of the cone nearly equal to the diameter also when urged by the several weights expressed in avordupois ounces and standing on the same line with the velocities each in their proper columns so in the first line the numbers show that when the greatest or uniform velocity was accurately   feet per second the bodies were urged by these weights according as their different ends went foremost namely by0  oz when the vertex of the cone went foremost by0  oz when the base of the cone went foremost by0  oz for a whole sphere by0  oz for a cylinder by0  oz for the flat side of the hemisphere and by0 0oz for the round or unequal side of the hemisphere also at the bottom of all are placed the mean proportions of the resistances of these figures in the nearest whole numbers note the common diameter of all the figures was      or   inches so that the area of the circle of that diameter is just    square inches or    of a square foot and the altitude of the cone was   inches also the diameter of the small hemisphere was   inches and consequently the area of its base is    square inches or of a square foot nearly  the mean height of the barometer at the times of making the experiments was nearly  0  inches and of the thermometer    and consequently the weight of a cubic foot of air was equal to   oz nearly in those circumstances  velocity per sec

                             0     0            0               0  0                             0                    0  0                 0  000          0                0                                                                                                                   00                              0                  0    0  0      0  0              0        propor numb                           0  from this table of resistances several practical inferences may be drawn as    that the resistance is nearly as the surface the resistance increasing but a very little above that proportion in the greater surfaces thus by comparing together the numbers in the  th and last columns for the bases of the two hemispheres the areas of which are in the proportion of    to    or as   to   very nearly but the numbers in those two columns expressing the resistances are nearly as   to   or as   to  0 as far as to the velocity of    feet after which the resistances on the greater surface increase gradually more and more above that proportion and the mean resistances are as   0 to     or as   to  0    this circumstance therefore agrees nearly with the theory    the resistance to the same surface is nearly as the square of the velocity but gradually increases more and more above that proportion as the velocity increases this is manifest from all the columns and therefore this circumstance also nearly agrees with the theory in small velocities    when the hinder parts of bodies are of different forms the resistances are different though the fore parts be alike owing probably to the different pressures of the air on the hinder parts thus the resistance to the fore part of the cylinder is less than that on the flat base of the hemisphere or of the cone because the hinder part of the cylinder is more pressed or pushed by the following air than those of the other two figures    the resistance on the base of the hemisphere is to that on the unequal side nearly as   to   instead of   to   as the theory assigns the proportion and therefore in this particular the theory is attended with a considerable error    the resistance on the base of the cone is to that on the vertex nearly as     0 to   instead of   to   as the theory in pa     art   requires it to be so that the theory in this instance gives less than half the true experimented resistance    hence we can find the altitude of a column of air whose pressure shall be equal to the resistance of a body moving through it with any velocity  let a  the area of the section of the body similar to any of those in the table perpendicular to the direction of motion r  the resistance to the velocity in the table and x  the altitude sought of a column of air whose base is a and its pressure r then ax  the content of the column in feet and   ax or    ax its weight in ounces therefore    ax  r and x  x r a is the altitude sought in feet namely of the quotient of the resistance of any body divided by its transverse section which is a constant quantity for all similar bodies however different in magnitude since the resistance r is as the section a as we have found in art   when a     of a foot as in all the figures in our table except the small hemisphere then x  x r a becomes x      r where r is the resistance in our table to the similar body if for example we take the unequal side of the large hemisphere whose resistance is    oz to a velocity of    feet per second then r     and x      r        feet is the altitude of the column of air whose pressure is equal to the resistance on a spherical surface with a velocity of    feet and to compare the above altitude with that which is due to the given velocity it will be              the altitude due to the velocity    which is near double the altitude that is equal to the pressure and as the altitude is proportional to the square of the velocity therefore in small velocities the resistance to any spherical surface is equal to the pressure of a column of air on its great circle whose altitude is      or    of the altitude due to its velocity    hence we may infer the great resistance suffered by military projectiles for we find in the table that a globe of   inches diameter which is equal to the size of an iron ball weighing    lb moving with a velocity of only    feet per second meets with a resistance equal to the pressure of of an ounce weight and therefore computing only according to the square of the velocity the least resistance that such a ball would meet with when moving with a velocity of   00 feet would be equal to the pressure of     lb and that independent of the pressure of the atmosphere itself on the fore part of the ball which would be   0 lb more as there would be no pressure from the atmosphere on the hinder part in the case of so great a velocity as   00 feet per second so that the whole resistance would not be less than about  00 lb to such a velocity    having said in the last article that the pressure of the atmosphere is taken entirely off the hinder part of the ball moving with a velocity of   00 feet per second which must happen when the ball moves faster than the particles of air can follow by rushing into the place quitted and left void by the ball or when the ball moves faster than the air rushes into a vacuum from the pressure of the incumbent air let us therefore inquire what this velocity is now the velocity with which any fluid issues depends upon its altitude above the orifice and is indeed equal to the velocity acquired by a heavy body in falling freely through that altitude but supposing the height of the barometer to be  0 inches or   feet the height of an uniform atmosphere all of the same density as at the earths surface would be   x    x     or       feet therefore                          feet which is the velocity sought and therefore with a velocity of   00 feet per second or any velocity above      feet the ball must continually leave a vacuum behind it and so must sustain the whole pressure of the atmosphere on its fore part as well as the resistance arising from the vis inertia of the particles of air struck by the ball    upon the whole we find that the resistance of the air as determined by our experiments differs very widely both in respect to the quantity of it on all figures and in respect to the proportions of it on oblique surfaces from the same as determined by the preceding theory which is the same as that of sir isaac newton and most modern philosophers neither should we succeed better if we have recourse to the theory given by professor gravesande or others as similar differences and inconsistencies still occur  we conclude therefore that all the theories of the resistance of the air hitherto given are very erroneous and i have only laid down the preceding one till further experiments on this important subject shall enable us to deduce from them another that shall be more consonant to the true
