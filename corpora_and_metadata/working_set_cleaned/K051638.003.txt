clarissa  or the history of a young lady comprehending the most important concerns of private life and particularly showing the distresses that may attend the misconduct both of parents and children in relation to marriage  published by the editor of pamela  vol iii  london printed for s richardson and sold by john osborn in paternoster row andrew millar over against catharinestreet in the strand j and j rivington in st pauls churchyard and by j leake at bath  mdccxlviii  the history of miss clarissa harlowe letter i miss clarissa harlowe to miss how tuesday night i think myself obliged to thank you my dear miss how for your condescension in taking notice of a creature who has occasioned you so much scandal  i am grieved on this account as much i verily think as for the evil itself  tell me  but yet i am afraid to know  what your mamma said  i long and yet i dread to be told what the young ladies my companions now never more perhaps to be so say of me  they cannot however say worse of me than i will of myself selfaccusation shall flow in every line of my narrative where i think i am justly censurable if any thing can arise from the account i am going to give you for extenuation of my fault for that is all a person can hope for who cannot excuse herself i know i may expect it from your friendship though not from the charity of any other since by this time i doubt not every mouth is opened against me and all that know clarissa harlowe condemn the fugitive daughter  after i had deposited my letter to you written down to the last hour as i may say i returned to the ivy summer house first taking back my letter from the loose bricks and there i endeavored as coolly as my situation would permit to recollect and lay together several incidents that had passed between my aunt and me and comparing them with some of the contents of my cousin dollys letter i began to hope that i need not be so very apprehensive as i had been of the next wednesday and thus i argued with myself  wednesday cannot possibly be the day they intend although to intimidate me they may wish me to think it is  for the settlements are unsigned nor have they been offered me to sign i can choose whether i will or will not put my hand to them hard as it will be to refuse if my father tender them to me  besides did not my father and mother propose if i made compulsion necessary to go to my uncles themselves in order to be out of the way of my appeals whereas they intend to be present on wednesday and however affecting to me the thought of meeting them and all my friends in full assembly is perhaps it is the very thing i ought to wish for since my brother and sister had such an opinion of my interest in them that they got me excluded from their presence as a measure which they thought previously necessary to carry on their designs  nor have i reason to doubt but that as i had before argued with myself i shall be able to bring over some of my relations to my party and being brought face to face with my brother that i shall expose his malevolence and of consequence weaken his power  then supposing the very worst challenging the minister as i shall challenge him he will not presume to proceed nor surely will mr solmes dare to accept my refusing and struggling hand and finally if nothing else will do nor procure me delay i can plead scruples of conscience and even pretend prior obligation for my dear i have given mr lovelace room to hope as you will see in one of my letters in your hands that i will be no other mans while he is single and gives me not wilful and premeditated cause of offense against him and this in order to reinin his resentments on the declared animosity of my brother and uncles and as i shall appeal or refer my scruples on this head to the good dr lewin it is impossible but that my mamma and aunt if nobody else should be affected with this plea  revolving cursorily these things i congratulated myself that i had resolved against going away with mr lovelace  i told you my dear that i would not spare myself and i enumerate these particulars as an argument to condemn the action i have been so unhappily betrayed into an argument that concludes against me with the greater force as i must acknowledge that i was apprehensive that what my cousin dolly mentions as from betty and from my sister was told her that she should tell me in order to make me desperate and perhaps to push me upon some such step as i have been drawn in to take as the most effectual means to ruin me with my father and uncles  god forgive me if i judge too hardly of their views  but if i do not i must say that they laid a wicked snare for me and that i have been caught in it  and doubly may they triumph if they can triumph in the ruin of a sister who never wished or intended hurt to them  as the above kind of reasoning had lessened my apprehensions as to the wednesday it added to those i had of meeting him  now as it seemed not only the nearest but the heaviest evil principally indeed because nearest for little did i dream foolish creature that i was and every way beset of the event proving what it has proved i expected a contention with him it is true as he had not my letter but i thought it would be very strange as i mentioned in one of my former see vol ii p      if i who had so steadily held out against characters so venerable against authorities so sacred as i may say when i thought them unreasonably exerted should not find myself more equal to such a trial as this especially as i had so much reason to be displeased with him for not having taken away my letter  on what a crisis on what a point of time may ones fate depend had i had but two hours more to consider of the matter and to attend to and improve upon these new lights as i may call them  but then perhaps i might have given him a meeting  fool that i was what had i to do to give him hope that i would personally acquaint him with the reason for my change of mind if i did change it  o my dear an obliging temper is a very dangerous temper  by endeavoring to gratify others it is evermore disobliging itself  when the bell rang to call the servants to dinner betty came to me and asked if i had any commands before she went to hers repeating her hint that she should be employed adding that she believed it was expected that i should not come up till she came down or till i saw my aunt or miss hervey  i asked her some questions about the cascade which had been out of order and lately mended and expressed a curiosity to see how it played in order to induce her how cunning to cheat myself as it proved to go thither if she found me not where she left me it being at a part of the garden most distant from the ivy summer house  she could hardly have got into the house when i heard the first signal  o how my heart fluttered  but no time was to be lost i stepped to the gardendoor and seeing a clear coast unbolted the readyunlocked door  and there was he all impatience waiting for me  a panic next to fainting seized me when i saw him my heart seemed convulsed and i trembled so that i should hardly have kept my feet had he not supported me  fear nothing dearest creature said he  let us hasten away  the chariot is at hand  and by this sweet condescension you have obliged me beyond expression or return  recovering my spirits a little as he kept drawing me after him o mr lovelace said i i cannot go with you  indeed i cannot  i wrote you word so  let go my hand and you shall see my letter it has lain there from yesterday morning till within this halfhour  i bid you watch to the last for a letter from me lest i should be obliged to revoke the appointment and had you followed the direction you would have found it  i have been watched my dearest life said he half out of breath  i have been watched in every step i took and my trusty servant has been watched too ever since saturday and dared not to come near your wall  and here we shall be discovered in a moment  speed away my charmer  this is the moment of your deliverance  if you neglect this opportunity you never can have such another  what is it you mean sir  let go my hand for i tell you struggling vehemently that i will sooner die than go with you   good god said he with a look of wildness and surprise what is it i hear  but still drawing me after him as he retreated farther from the door it is no time to argue  by all that is good you must go  surely you cannot doubt my honor nor give me cause to question your own  as you value me mr lovelace urge me no farther i come fixed and resolved let me give you the letter i had written my further reasons shall follow and they will convince you that i ought not to go  nothing madam can convince me  by all that is sacred i will not leave you to leave you now is to lose you for ever  am i to be thus compelled interrupted i with equal indignation and vehemence  let go my hands  i am resolved not to go with you  and i will convince you that i ought not  all my friends expect you madam  all your own are determined against you  wednesday next is the day the important perhaps the fatal day would you stay to be solmess wife  can this be your determination at last  no never never will i be that mans  but i will not go with you  draw me not thus  how dare you sir  i would not have seen you but to tell you so  i had not met you but for fear you would have been guilty of some rashness  and once more i will not go  what mean you  striving with all my force to get from him  what can have possessed my angel quitting my hands and with a gentler voice that after so much illusage from your relations vows so solemn on my part an affection so ardent you stab me with a refusal to stand by your own appointment  it signifies nothing talking mr lovelace i will give you my reasons at a better opportunity i cannot go with you now  and once more urge me no farther  surely i am not to be compelled by every body  i see how it is said he with a dejected but passionate air  what a severe fate is mine  at length your spirit is subdued  your brother and sister have prevailed and i must give up all my hopes to a wretch so truly despicable   once more i tell you interrupted i i never will be his  all may end on wednesday differently from what you expect   and it may not  and then good heaven   it is to be their last effort as i have reason to believe   and i have reason to believe so too  since if you tarry you will inevitably be solmess wife  not so interrupted i  i have obliged them in one point  they will be in good humor with me i shall gain time at least  i am sure i shall  i have several ways to gain time  and what madam will gaining time do  it is plain you have not a hope beyond that  it is plain you have not by putting all upon that precarious issue  o my dearest dearest life let me beseech you not to run a risque of this consequence i can convince you that it will be more than a risque if you go back that you will on wednesday next be solmess wife  prevent therefore now that it is in your power to prevent the fatal mischiefs that will follow such a dreadful certainty  while i have any room for hope it concerns your honor mr lovelace as well as mine if you have the proper value for me and wish me to believe you have that my conduct in this great point shall justify my prudence  your prudence madam when has that been questionable yet what stead has either your prudence or your duty stood you in with people so strangely determined  and then he pathetically enumerated the different instances of the harsh treatment i had met with imputing all to the malice and caprice of a brother who set everybody against him and insisting that i had no other way to effect a reconciliation with my father and uncles than by putting myself out of the power of my brothers inveterate malice  your brothers whole reliance proceeded he has been upon your easiness to bear his insults  your whole family will seek to you when you have freed yourself from this disgraceful oppression  when they know you are with those who can and will right you they will give up to you your own estate  why then putting his arm round me and again drawing me with a gentle force after him do you hesitate a moment  now is the time  fly with me then i beseech you my dearest creature trust your persecuted adorer  have we not suffered in the same cause if any imputations are cast upon you give me the honor as i shall be found to deserve it to call you mine and when you are so shall i not be able to protect both your person and character  urge me no more mr lovelace i conjure you  you yourself have given me a hint which i will speak plainer to than prudence perhaps on any other occasion would allow me to speak  i am convinced that wednesday next if i had time i would give you my reasons is not intended to be the day we had both so much dreaded and if after that day shall be over i find my friends to be determined in mr solmess favor i will then contrive some way to meet you with miss how who is not your enemy and when the solemnity has passed i shall think that step a duty which till then will be criminal to take since now my fathers authority is unimpeached by any greater  dearest madam   nay mr lovelace if you now dispute  if after this more favorable declaration than i had the thought of making you are not satisfied i shall know what to think both of your gratitude and generosity  the case madam admits not of this alternative i am all gratitude upon it i cannot express how much i should be delighted with the charming hope you have given me were you not next wednesday if you stay to be another mans think dearest creature what an heightening of my anguish the distant hope you bid me look up to is taken in this light  depend upon it i will die sooner than be mr solmess if you would have me rely upon your honor why should you doubt of mine  i doubt not your honor madam your power is all i doubt you never never can have such another opportunity  dearest creature permit me  and he was again drawing me after him  whither sir do you draw me  leave me this moment  do you seek to keep me till my return shall grow dangerous or impracticable  i am not satisfied with you at all indeed i am not  this moment let me go if you would have me think tolerably of you  my happiness madam both here and hereafter and the safety of all your implacable family depend upon this moment  to providence mr lovelace and to the law will i leave the safety of my friends  you shall not threaten me into a rashness that my heart condemns  shall i to promote your happiness as you call it destroy all my future peace of mind  you trifle with me my dear life just as our better prospects begin to open the way is clear just now it is clear  but you may be prevented in a moment  what is it you doubt  may i perish eternally if your will shall not be a law to me in every thing  all my relations expect you your own appointment calls upon you  next wednesday  dearest creature  think of next wednesday  and what is it i urge you to but to take a step that sooner than any other will reconcile you to all you have most reason to value in your family  let me judge for myself sir do not you who blame my friends for endeavoring to compel me yourself seek to compel me i will not bear it  your earnestness gives me greater apprehensions and greater reluctance  let me go back then  let me before it is too late go back that it may not be worse for both what mean you by this forcible treatment  is it thus that i am to judge of the entire submission to my will which you have so often vowed  unhand me this moment or i will cry out for help  i will obey you my dearest creature  and quitted my hand with a look full of tender despondency that knowing the violence of his temper halfconcerned me for him yet i was hastening from him when with a solemn air looking upon his sword but catching as it were his hand from it he folded both his arms as if a sudden thought had recovered him from an intended rashness  stay one moment  but one moment stay o best beloved of my soul  your retreat is secure if you will go the key lies down at the door  but o madam next wednesday and you are mr solmess  fly me not so eagerly  hear me but a few words  when near the gardendoor i stopped and was the more satisfied as i saw the key there by which i could let myself in again at pleasure but being uneasy lest i should be missed i told him i could stay no longer i had already stayed too long that i would write to him all my reasons and depend upon it mr lovelace said i just upon the point of stooping for the key in order to return i will die rather than have that man you know what i have promised if i find myself in danger  one word madam however one word more approaching me his arms still folded as if as i thought he would not be tempted to mischief  remember only that i come at your appointment to redeem you at the hazard of my life from your gaolers and persecutors with a resolution god is my witness or may he for ever blast me that was his shocking imprecation to be a father uncle brother and as i humbly hoped in your own good time a husband to you all in one but since i find you are so ready to cry out for help against me which must bring down upon me the vengeance of all your family i am contented to run all risques  i will not ask you to retreat with me i will attend you into the garden and into the house if i am not intercepted  nay be not surprised madam the help you would have called upon i will attend you to  i will face them all but not as a revenger if they provoke me not too much you shall see what i can further bear for your sake and let us both see if expostulation and the behavior of a gentleman to them will not procure me the treatment due to a gentleman from them  had he offered to draw his sword upon himself i was prepared to have despised him for supposing me such a poor novice as to be intimidated by an artifice so common but this resolution uttered with so serious an air of accompanying me in to my friends made me gasp almost with terror  what mean you mr lovelace said i  i beseech you leave me leave me sir i beseech you  excuse me madam i beg you to excuse me  i have long enough skulked like a thief about these lonely walls  long too long have i borne the insults of your brother and others of your relations absence but heightens malice i am desperate i have but this one chance for it for is not the day after tomorrow wednesday i have encouraged virulence by my tameness  yet tame i will still be  you shall see madam what i will bear for your sake my sword shall be put sheathed into your hands and he offered it to me in the scabbard  my heart if you please shall afford a sheath to theirs  life is nothing if i lose you  be pleased madam to show me the way into the garden i will attend you though to my fate but too happy be it what it will if i receive it in your presence lead on dear creature  you shall see what i can bear for you  and he stooped and took up the key and offered it to the lock  but dropped it again without opening the door upon my earnest expostulation to him  what can you mean mr lovelace said i  would you thus expose yourself  would you thus expose me  is this your generosity  is everybody to take advantage thus of the weakness of my temper  and i wept i could not help it  he threw himself upon his knees at my feet  who can bear said he with an ardour that could not be feigned his own eyes glistening as i thought who can bear to behold such sweet emotion  o charmer of my heart and respectfully still kneeling he took my hand with both his pressing it to his lips command me with you command me from you in every way i am all implicit obedience  but i appeal to all you know of your relations cruelty to you and of their determined malice against me and as determined favor to the man you tell me you hate  and oh madam if you did not hate him i should hardly think there would be a merit in your approbation place it where you would  i appeal to everything you know to all you have suffered whether you have not reason to be apprehensive of that wednesday which is my terror  whether you can possibly have such another opportunity  the chariot ready my friends with impatience expecting the result of your own appointment a man whose will shall be entirely your will imploring you thus on his knees imploring you  to be your own mistress that is all nor will i ask for your favor but as upon full proof i shall appear to deserve it fortune alliances unobjectible  o my beloved creature pressing my hand once more to his lips let not such an opportunity slip you never never will have such another  i bid him rise he rose and i told him that were i not thus unaccountably hurried by his impatience i doubted not to convince him that both he and i had looked upon next wednesday with greater apprehension than was necessary and was proceeding to give him my reasons but he broke in upon me   had i madam but the shadow of a probability to hope what you hope i would be all obedience and resignation but the license is actually got the parson is provided that pedant brand is the man o my dearest creature do these preparations mean only a trial  you know not sir were the worst to be intended and weak as you think me what a spirit i have you know not what i can do and how i can resist when i think myself meanly or unreasonably dealt with nor do you know what i have already suffered what i have already borne knowing to whose unbrotherly instigations all is to be ascribed   i may expect all things madam interrupted he from the nobleness of your mind scorning unreasonable compulsion but your spirits may fail you from the invincible temper of a father so positive to a daughter so dutiful what may not be apprehended fainting will not save you they will not perhaps be sorry for such an effect of their barbarity what will expostulations signify against a ceremony performed must not all the dreadful all follow that is torture to my heart but to think of  nobody to appeal to of what avail will your resistance be against the consequences of a rite witnessed to by the imposers of it and those your nearest relations  i was sure i said of procuring a delay at least many ways i had to procure delay  nothing could be so fatal to us both as for me now to be found with him  my apprehensions on this score i told him grew too strong for my heart  i should think very hardly of him if he sought to detain me longer but his acquiescence should engage my gratitude  and then stooping to take up the key to let myself into the garden he started and looked as if he had heard somebody near the door on the inside clapping his hand on his sword  this frighted me so that i thought i should have sunk down at his feet but he instantly reassured me he thought he said he had heard a rustling against the door but had it been so the noise would have been stronger it was only the effect of his apprehension for my minds sake  and then taking up the key he presented it to me  if you will go madam  yet i cannot cannot leave you  i must enter the garden with you  forgive me but i must enter the garden with you  and will you will you thus ungenerously sir take advantage of my fears  of my wishes to prevent mischief  i vain fool to be concerned for everyone nobody for me  dearest creature interrupted he holding my hand as i tremblingly offered to put the key to the lock  let me if you will go open the door  but once more consider should you prevail for that delay which seems to be your only dependence whether you may not be closer confined i know they have already had that in consideration will you not in this case be prevented from corresponding either with miss how or with me  who then shall assist you in your escape if escape you would  from your chamberwindow only permitted to view the garden you must not enter into how will you wish for the opportunity you now have if your hatred to solmes continue  but alas that cannot continue  if you go back it must be from the impulses of a yielding which you will call a dutiful heart tired and teazed out of your own will  i have no patience sir to be thus restrained  must i never be at liberty to follow my own judgment  be the consequence what it may i will not be thus constrained  and then freeing my hand i again offered the key to the door  down the ready kneeler dropped between me and that and can you can you madam once more on my knees let me ask you look with an indifferent eye upon the evils that may follow provoked as i have been and triumphed over as i shall be if your brother succeeds my own heart shudders at times at the thoughts of what must happen and can yours be unconcerned let me beseech you dearest creature to consider all these things and lose not this only opportunity  my intelligence   never mr lovelace interrupted i pin so much faith upon the sleeve of a traitor  your base intelligencer is but a servant he may pretend to know more than he has grounds for in order to earn the wages of corruption you know not what contriveances i can find out  i was offering the key to the lock when starting from his knees with a voice of affrightment loudly whispering and as if out of breath they are at the door my beloved creature and taking the key from me he flew to it and fluttered with it as if he would doublelock it and instantly a voice from within cried out bursting against the door as if to break it open and repeating its violent pushes are you there  come up this moment  this moment  here they are  here they are both together  your pistol this moment  your gun  then another push and another  he at the same moment drew his sword and clapping it naked under his arm took both my trembling hands in his and drawing me swiftly after him fly fly my charmer this moment is all you have for it said he  your brother  your uncles or this solmes  they will instantly burst the door  fly my dearest life if you would not be more cruelly used than ever  if you would not see two or three murders committed at your feet fly fly i beseech you  o lord  help help cried the fool all amaze and confusion frighted beyond the power of controuling  now behind me now before me now on this side now on that turned i my affrighted face in the same moment expecting a furious brother here armed servants there an enraged sister screaming and a father armed with terror in his countenance more dreadful than even the drawn sword which i saw or those i apprehended i ran as fast as he yet knew not that i ran my fears which at the same time that they took all power of thinking from me adding wings to my feet my fears which probably would not have suffered me to know what course to take had i not had him to urge and draw me after him especially as i beheld a man who must have come out of the gardendoor keeping us in his eye running backward and forward beckoning and calling out to others whom i supposed he saw although the turning of the wall hindered me from seeing them and whom i imagined to be my brother my father and their servants  thus terrified i was got out of sight of the door in a very few minutes and then although quite breathless between running and apprehension he put my arm under his his drawn sword in the other hand and hurried me on still faster my voice however contradicting my action crying no no no all the while straining my neck to look back as long as the walls of the garden and park were within sight and till he brought me to his uncles chariot where attending were two armed servants of his own and two of lord ms on horseback  here i must suspend my relation for a while for now i am come to this sad period of it my indiscretion stares me in the face and my shame and my grief give me a compunction that is more poignant methinks than if i had a dagger in my heart  to have it to reflect that i should so inconsiderately give in to an interview which had i known either myself or him or in the least considered the circumstances of the case i might have supposed would put me into the power of his resolution and out of that of my own reason  for might i not have believed that he who thought he had cause to apprehend that he was on the point of losing a person who had cost him so much pains and trouble would not hinder her if possible from returning that he who knew i had promised to give him up for ever if insisted on as a condition of reconciliation would not endeavor to put it out of my power to do so  in short that he who had artfully forborne to send for my letter for he could not be watched my dear lest he should find in it a countermand to my appointment as i myself could apprehend although i profited not by the apprehension would want a device to keep me with him till the danger of having our meeting discovered might throw me absolutely into his power to avoid my own worse usage and the mischiefs which might have ensued perhaps in my very sight had my friends and he met  but if it shall come out that the person within the garden was his corrupted implement employed to frighten me away with him do you think my dear that i shall not have reason to hate him and myself still more  i hope his heart cannot be so deep and so vile a one i hope not but how came it to pass that one man could get out at the gardendoor and no more how that that man kept aloof as it were and pursued us not nor run back to alarm the house  my fright and my distance would not let me be certain but really this single man had the air of that vile joseph leman as i recollect  o why why my dear friends  but wherefore blame i them when i had argued myself into a hope not improbable that even the dreadful trial i was to undergo so soon might turn out better than if i had been directly carried away from the presence of my once indulgent parents who might possibly intend that trial to be the last i should have had  would to heaven that i had stood it however  then if i had afterward done what now i have been prevailed upon or perhaps foolishly frightened to do i should not have been stung so much by inward reproach as now i am and this would have been a great evil avoided  you know my dear that your clarissas mind was ever above justifying her own failings by those of others god forgive those of my friends who have acted cruelly by me but their faults are their own and not excuses for mine and mine began early for i ought not to have corresponded with him  o the vile incroacher how my indignation at times rises at him thus to lead a young creature too much indeed relying upon her own strength from evil to evil  this last evil although the remote ye sure consequence of my first  my prohibited correspondence by a father at least early prohibited  how much more properly had i acted with regard to that correspondence had i once for all when he was forbid to visit me and i to receive his visits pleaded the authority i ought to have been bound by and denied to write to him  but i thought i could proceed or stop as i pleased i supposed it concerned me more than any other to be the arbitress of the quarrels of unruly spirits  and now i find my presumption punished  punished as other sins frequently are by itself  as to this last rashness now that it is too late i plainly see how i ought to have conducted myself  as he knew i had but one way of transmitting to him the knowledge of what befell me as he knew that my fate was upon a crisis with my friends and that i had in my letter to him reserved the liberty of revoking i should not have been solicitous whether he had got my letter or not when he had come and found i did not answer his signal he would presently have resorted to the loose bricks and there been satisfied by the date of my letter that it was his own fault that he had it not before but governed by the same pragmatical motives which induced me to correspond with him at first i was again afraid truly with my foolish and busy prescience and indeed he pretends now that i had reason for it as you shall hear in its place but which then i could only fear and not be sure of that the disappointment would have thrown him into the way of receiving fresh insults from the same persons which might have made him guilty of some violence to them and so to save him an apprehended rashness i have rushed into a real one myself and what vexes me more is that it is plain to me now by all his behavior that he had as great a confidence in my weakness as i had in my own strength and so in a point entirely relative to my honor he has triumphed can i have patience to look at him for he has not been mistaken in me while i have in myself  tell me my dear miss how tell me truly if your unforced heart does not despise me  it must for your mind and mine were ever one and i despise myself  and well i may for could the giddiest and most inconsiderate girl in england have done worse than i shall have appear to have done in the eye of the world since my crime will be known without the provocations and without the artifices of the betrayer too indeed my dear he is a very artful man while it will be a high aggravation that better things were expected from me than from many others  you charge me to marry the first opportunity  ah my dear another of the blessed effects of my folly  that is as much in my power now as  as i am myself  for can i give a sanction immediately to his deluding arts  can i avoid being angry with him for tricking me thus as i may say and as i have called it to him out of myself  for compelling me to take a step so contrary to all my resolutions and assurances given to you so dreadfully inconvenient to myself so disgraceful and so grievous as it must be to my dear mamma were i to be less regardful of any other  you dont know nor can you imagine my dear how i am mortified  how much i am sunk in my own opinion  i that was proposed for an example truly to others  o that i were again in my fathers house stealing down with a letter to you my heart beating with expectation of finding one from you  this is the wednesdaymorning i dreaded so much that i once thought of it as my doomsday but of the monday it is plain i ought to have been most apprehensive had i stayed and had the worst i dreaded happened my friends would then have been answerable if any bad consequences had followed  but now i have this one consolation left me a very sad one you will say that i have cleared them of blame and taken it all upon myself  you will not wonder to see this narrative so dismally scrawled it is owing to different pens and ink all bad and written by snatches of time my hand trembling too with fatigue and grief  i will not add to the length of it by the particulars of his behavior to me and of our conversation at st albans and since because those will come in course in the continuation of my story which no doubt you will expect from me  only thus much i will say that he is extremely respectful even obsequiously so at present though i am so much dissatisfied with him and myself that he has hitherto had no great cause to praise my complaisance to him indeed i can hardly at times bear the seducer in my sight  the lodgings i am in are inconvenient i shall not stay in them so it signifies nothing to tell you how to direct to me hither and where my next may be as yet i know not  he knows that i am writing to you and has offered to send my letter when finished by a servant of his but i thought i could not be too cautious as i am now situated in having a letter of this importance conveyed to you who knows what such a man may do so very wicked a contriver the contrivance if a contrivance so insolently mean  but i hope it is not a contrivance neither yet be that as it will i must say that the best of him and of my prospects with him are bad and yet having enrolled myself among the toolate repenters who shall pity me  nevertheless i will dare to hope for a continued interest in your affections i shall be miserable indeed if i may not and to be remembered in your daily prayers i am my dearest friend  your everaffectionate cl harlowe  letter ii mr lovelace to joseph leman sat april   honest joseph at length your beloved young lady has consented to free herself from the cruel treatment she has so long borne she is to meet me without the gardendoor at about four oclock on monday afternoon as i told you she had promised she has confirmed her promise thank god she has confirmed her promise  i shall have a chariotandsix ready in the byroad fronting the private path to harlowepaddock and several of my friends and servants not far off armed to protect her if there be occasion but every one charged to avoid mischief that you know ha always been my principal care  all my fear is that when she comes to the point the overniceness of her principles will make her waver and want to go back although her honor is my honor you know and mine is hers if she should and i should be unable to prevail upon her all your past service will avail nothing and she will be lost to me for ever the prey then of that cursed solmes whose vil stinginess will never permit him to do good to any the servants of the family  i have no doubt of your fidelity honest joseph nor of your zeal to serve an injured gentleman an an oppressed young lady you see by the confdence i repose in you that i have not more partcularly on this very important occasion in which your assistance may crown the work for if she wavers a little innocent contrivance will be necessary  be very mindful therefore of the following directions take them into your heart this will probably be your last trouble until my beloved and i are joined in holy wedlock and then we will be sure to take care of you you know what i have promised no man ever reproached me for breach of word  these then honest joseph are they  contrive to be in the garden in disguise if possible and unseen by your young lady if you find the gardendoor unbolted you will know that she and i are together although you should not see her go out at it it will be locked but my key shall be on the ground at the bottom of the door without that you may open it with yours as it may be needful  if you hear our voices parleying keep at the door till i cry hem hem twice but be watchful for this signal for i must not hem very loud lest she should take it for a signal perhaps in struggling to prevail upon the dear creature i may have an opportunity to strike the door hard with my elbow or heel to confirm you  then you are to make a violent burst against the door as if you would break it open drawing backward and forward the bolt in a hurry then with another push but with more noise than strength lest the lock give way cry out as if you saw some of the family come up come up instantly  here they are here they are hasten  this instant hasten and mention swords pistols guns with as terrible a voice as you can cry out with then shall i prevail upon her no doubt if loath before to fly if i cannot i will enter the garden with her and the house too be the consequence what it will but so frighted there is no question but she will fly  when you think us at a sufficient distance and i shall raise my voice urging her swifter flight that you may guess at that then open the door with your key but you must be sure to open it very cautiously lest we should not be far enough off i would not have her know you have a hand in this matter out of my great regard to you  when you have opened the door take your key out of the lock and put it in your pocket then stooping for mine put it in the lock on the inside that it may appear as if the door was opened by herself with a key they will suppose of my procuring it being new and left open by us  they should conclude she is gone off by her own consent that they may not pursue us that they may see no hopes of tempting her back again in either case mischief might happen you know  but you must take notice that you are only to open the door with your key in case none of the family come up to interrupt us and before we are quite gone for if they do you will find by what follows that you must not open the door at all let them on breaking it open or by getting over the wall find my key on the ground if they will  if they do not come to interrupt us and if you by help of your key come out follow us at a distance and with uplifted hands and wild and impatient gestures running backward and forward for fear you should come too near us and as if you saw somebody coming to your assistance cry out for help help and to hasten then shall we be soon at the chariot  tell the family that you saw me enter a chario with her a dozen or more men on horseback attending us all armed some with blunderbusses as you believe and that we took the quite contrary way to that we shall take  you see honest joseph how careful i am as wel as you to avoid mischief  observe to keep at such a distance that she may not discover who you are take long strides to alter your gaite and hold up your head honest joseph and she will not know it to be you mens airs and gaites are as various and as peculiar as their faces pluck a stake out of one of the hedges and tug at it though it may come easy this if she turn back will took terrible and account for your not following us faster then returning with it shouldered brag to the family what you would have done could you have overtaken us rather than your young lady should have been carried off by such a  and you may call me names and curse me and these airs will make you look valiant and in earnest you see honest joseph i am always contriving to give you reputation no man suffers by serving me  but if our parley should last longer than i wish and if any of her friends miss her before i cry hem hem twice then in order to save yourself which is a very great point with me i will assure you make the same noise as above but as i directed before open not the door with your key on the contrary wish for a key with all your heart but for fear any of them should by accident have a key about them keep in readiness half a dozen little gravelstones no bigger than peace and thrust two or three slily into the keyhole which will hinder their key from turning round it is good you know joseph to provide against every accident in such an important case as this and let this be your cry instead of the other if any of my enemies come in your sight as you seem to be trying to burst the door open sir or madam as it may prove o lord hasten o lord hasten mr lovelace  mr lovelace  and very loud  and that shall quicken me more than it shall those you call to  if it be betty and only betty i shall think worse of your art of making love see vol ii p      than of your fidelity if you cannot find a way to amuse her and put her upon a false scent  you must tell them that your young lady seemed to run as fast off with me as i with her this will also confirm to them that all pursuit is in vain an end will be hereby put to solmess hopes and her friends after a while will be more studious to be reconciled to her than to get her back so you will be an happy instrument of great good to all round and this will one day be acknowleged by both families you will then be every ones favorite and every good servant for the future will be proud to be likend to honest joseph leman  if she should guess at you or find you out i have it already in my head to write a letter for you to copy see letter xx in this volume  which occasionally produced will set you right with her  this one time be diligent be careful this will be the crown of all and once more depend for a recompense upon the honor of  your assured friend r lovelace you need not be so much afraid of going too far with betty if you should make a match with her she is a very likely creature though a vixen as you say i have an admirable receipt to cure a termagant wife  never fear joseph but thou shall be master of thine own house if she be very troublesome i can teach thee how to break her heart in a twelvemonth and honestly too  or the precept would not be mine  i enclose a new earnest of my future favor    letter iii to robert lovelace esquier his honor

leman  letter iv mr lovelace to john belford esquire st albans monday night i snatch a few moments while my beloved is retired as i hope to rest to perform my promise no pursuit  nor have i apprehensions of any though i must make my charmer dread that there will be one  and now let me tell thee that never was joy so complete as mine  but let me inquire is not the angel flown away   o no she is in the next apartment  securely mine  mine for ever  o ecstasy  my heart will burst my breast to leap into her bosom  i knew that the whole stupid family were in a combination to do my business for me i told thee that they were all working for me like so many underground moles and still more blind than the moles are said to be unknowing that they did so i myself the director of their principal motions which falling in with the malice of their little hearts they took to be all their own  but did i say my joy was perfect  o no  it receives some abatement from my disgusted pride for how can i endure to think that i owe more to her relations persecutions than to her favor for me  or even as far as i know to her preference of me to another man  but let me not indulge this thought were i to do so it might cost my charmer dear  let me rejoice that she has passed the rubicon that she cannot return that as i have ordered it the flight will appear to the implacables to be altogether with her own consent and that if i doubt her love i can put her to trials as mortifying to her niceness as glorious to my pride  for let me tell thee dearly as i love her if i thought there was but the shadow of a doubt in her mind whether she preferred me to any man living i would show her no mercy   tuesday daydawn but on the wings of love i fly to my charmer who perhaps by this time is rising to encourage the tardy dawn i have not slept a wink of the hour and half i lay down to invite sleep it seems to me that i am not so much body as to require such vulgar renovation  but why as in the chariot as in the inn at alighting all heartbursting grief my dearest creature so persecuted as thou were persecuted  so much in danger of the most abhorred compulsion  yet grief so unsuspectably sincere for an escape so critical  take care  take care o beloved of my soul for jealous is the heart in which love has erected a temple to thee  yet it must be allowed that such a sudden transition must affect her  must ice her over  when a little more used to her new situation when her hurries are at an end when she sees how religiously i shall observe all her injunctions she will undoubtedly have the gratitude to distinguish between the confinement she has escaped from and the liberty she has reason to rejoice in  she comes she comes  and the sun is just rising to attend her  adieu  be half as happy as i am for all diffidences like nightfogs before the sun exhale at her approach and next myself thou will be the happiest man in the world   letter v miss clarissa harlowe to miss how wednesday april    i will pursue my melancholy story  being thus hurried to the chariot it would have been to no purpose to have refused entering into it had he not in my fright lifted me in as he did and it instantly drove away a full gallop and stopped not till it brought us to st albans which was just as the day shut in  i thought i should have fainted several times by the way with liftedup hands and eyes god protect me said i often to myself  can it be i that am here  my eyes running over and my heart ready to burst with sighs as involuntary as my flight  how different how inexpressibly different the gay wretch visibly triumphing as i could not but construe his almost rapturous joy in the success of his arts but overflowing with complimental flourishes yet respectfully distant his address all the way we flew for that rather than galloping was the motion of the horses which took as i believe a roundabout way to prevent being traced  i have reason to think there were other horsemen at his devotion three or four different persons above the rank of servants galloping by us nowandthen on each side of the chariot but he took no notice of them and i had too much grief mingled with indignation notwithstanding all his blandishments to ask any questions about them or any thing else  think my dear what were my thoughts on alighting from the chariot having no attendant of my own sex no clothes but what i had on and those little suited for such a journey as i had already taken and was still further to take neither hood nor hat nor any thing but a handkerchief about my neck and shoulders fatigued to death my mind still more fatigued than my body and in such a foam the horses that every one in the inn we put up at guessed they could not do otherwise that i was a young giddy creature who had run away from her friends this it was easy to see by their whispering and gaping more of the people of the house also coming in to view us as it were by turns than was necessary for the attendance  the gentlewoman of the inn whom he sent in to me showed me another apartment and seeing me ready to faint brought me hartshorn and water and then upon my desiring to be left alone for half an hour retired for i found my heart ready to burst on revolving every thing in my thoughts and the moment she was gone fastening the door i threw myself into an old great chair and gave way to a violent flood of tears which a little relieved me  mr lovelace sooner than i wished sent up the gentlewoman who pressed me in his name to admit my brother or to come down to him for he had told her i was his sister and that he had brought me against my will and without warning from a friends house where i had been all the winter in order to prevent my marrying against the consent of my friends to whom he was now conducting me and that having given me no time for a travellingdress i was greatly offended at him  so my dear your frank your openhearted friend was forced to countenance this tale which indeed suited me the better because i was unable for some time to talk speak or look up and so my dejection and grief and silence might very well pass before the gentlewoman and her niece who attended me as a fit of sullenness  the room i was in being a bedchamber i chose to go down at his repeated message attended by the gentlewoman of the inn to that in which he was he approached me with great respect yet not exceeding a brotherly politeness where a brother is polite and calling me his dearest sister asked after the state of my mind and hoped i would forgive him for never brother half so well loved a sister as he me  a wretch  how naturally did he fall into the character although i was so much out of mine  unthinking creatures have some comfort in the shortness of their views in their unapprehensiveness and that they penetrate not beyond the present moment in short that they are unthinking  but for a person of my thoughtful disposition who has been accustomed to look forward as well to the possible as to the probable what comfort can i have in my reflections  but let me give you the particulars of our conversation a little before and after our suppertime joining both in one  when we were alone he besought me i cannot say but with all the tokens of a passionate and respectful tenderness to be better reconciled to myself and to him he repeated all the vows of honor and inviolable affection that he ever made me he promised to be wholly governed by me in every future step he asked me to give him leave to propose whether i chose to set out next day to either of his aunts  i was silent i knew not what to say nor what to do  whether i chose to have private lodgings procured me in either of those ladies neighborhood as were once my thoughts  i was still silent  whether i chose to go to either of lord ms seats that of berks or that in the county we were in  in lodgings i said anywhere where he was not to be  he had promised this he owned and he would religiously keep to his word as soon as he found all danger of pursuit over and that i was settled to my mind  but if the place were indifferent to me london was the safest and the most private and his relations should all visit me there the moment i thought fit to admit them his cousin charlotte particularly should attend me as my companion if i would accept of her as soon as she was able to go abroad  mean time would i go to his aunt lawrances his aunt sadleir was a melancholy woman i should be the most welcome guest she ever received  i told him i wished not to go immediately however and in the frame i was in and likely not to be out of to any of his relations that my reputation was concerned to have him absent from me  that if i were in some private lodging the meaner the less to be suspected as it would be known that i went away by his means and he would be supposed to have provided me handsome accommodations it would be most suitable both to my mind and my situation that this might be best i should think in the country for me in town for him  and no matter how soon he was known to be there  if he might deliver his opinion he said since i declined going to any of his relations london was the only place in the world to be private in every newcomer in a countrytown or village excited a curiosity a person of my figure and many compliments he made me would excite more even messages and letters where none used to be brought would occasion inquiry he had not provided a lodging anywhere supposing i would choose to go either to london where accommodations of that sort might be fixed upon in an hours time or to his aunts or to lord ms hertfordshire seat where was housekeeper an excellent woman mrs greme such another as my norton  to be sure i said if i were pursued it would be in their first passion and some one of his relations houses would be the place they would expect to find me at  i knew not what to do  my pleasure should determine him he said be it what it would only that i were safe was all he was solicitous about he had lodgings in town but he did not offer to propose them he knew i would have more objection to go to them than i could have to go to lord ms or to his aunts   no doubt of it i replied with an indignation in my manner that made him run over with professions that he was far from proposing them or wishing for my acceptance of them and again he repeated that my honor and safety were all he was solicitous about assuring me that my will should be a law to him in every particular  i was too peevish and too much afflicted and indeed too much incensed against him to take well any thing he said  i thought myself i said extremely unhappy i knew not what to determine upon my reputation now no doubt utterly ruined destitute of clothes fit to be seen by anybody my very indigence as i might call it proclaiming my folly to every one who saw me who would suppose that i had been taken at advantage or had given an undue one and had no power over either my will or my actions that i could not but think i had been dealt artfully with that he had seemed to have taken what he might suppose the just measure of my weakness founded on my youth and inexperience that i could not forgive myself for meeting him that my heart bled for the distresses of my father and mother on this occasion that i would give the world and all my hopes in it to have been still in my fathers house whatever had been my usage that let him protest and vow what he would i saw something low and selfish in his love that he could study to put a young creature upon making such a sacrifice of her duty and conscience when a person actuated by a generous love must seek to oblige the object of it in every thing essential to her honor and to her peace of mind  he was very attentive to all i said never offering to interrupt me once his answer to every article almost methodically showed his memory  what i had said he told me had made him very grave and he would answer accordingly  he was grieved at his heart that he had so little share in my favor or confidence as he had the mortification to find by what i had said he had  as to my reputation he must be very sincere with me that could not suffer half so much by the step i so much regretted to have taken as by the confinement and equally foolish and unjust treatment i had met with from my relations that every mouth was full of blame of them of my brother and sister particularly and of wonder at my patience that he must repeat what he had written to me he believed more than once that my friends themselves expected that i should take a proper opportunity to free myself from their persecutions why else did they confine me that my exalted character would still bear me out with those who knew me who knew my brothers and sisters motives and who knew the wretch they were for compelling me to have  with regard to clothes who as matters were circumstanced could expect that i should be able to bring away any others than those i had on at the time for present use or wear all the ladies of his family would take a pride to supply me for future the product of the best looms not only in england but throughout the world were at my command  if i wanted money as no doubt i must he should be proud to supply me would to god he might presume to hope there were but one interest between us   and then he would fain have had me to accept of  00 l bank note which unawares to me he put into my hand but which you may be sure i refused with warmth  he was inexpressibly grieved and surprised he said to hear me say he had acted artfully by me he came provided according to my confirmed appointment a wretch to upbraid me thus to redeem me from my persecutors and little expected a change of sentiment and that he should have so much difficulty to prevail upon me as he had met with that perhaps i might think his offer to go into the garden with me and to face my assembled relations was a piece of art only but that if i did i wronged him for to this hour seeing my excessive uneasiness he wished with all his soul he had been permitted to accompany me in it was always his maxim to brave a threatened danger  threateners where they have an opportunity to put in force their threats were seldom to be feared  but had he been assured of a private stab or of as many deaths wounds as there were persons in my family made desperate as he should have been by my return he would have attended me into the house  so my dear what i have to do is to hold myself inexcusable for meeting such a determined and audacious spirit that is all  i have hardly any question now that he would have contrived some way or other to have got me away had i met him at a midnight hour as once or twice i had thoughts to do  and that would have been more terrible still  he concluded this part of his talk with saying that he doubted not but that had he attended me in he should have come off in everyones opinion so well that he should have had general leave to renew his visits  he went on  he must be so bold as to tell me he said that he should have paid a visit of this kind but indeed accompanied by several of his trusty friends had i not met him  and that very afternoon too  for he could not tamely let the dreadful wednesday come without some effort to change their determinations  what my dear was to be done with such a man  that therefore for my sake as well as for his own he had reason to wish a disease so desperate had been attempted to be overcome by as desperate a remedy we all know said he that great ends are sometimes brought about by the very means by which they are endeavored to be frustrated  my present situation i am sure thought i affords a sad evidence of this truth  i was silent all this time my blame was indeed turned inward sometimes too i was halffrighted at his audaciousness at others had the less inclination to interrupt him being excessively fatigued and my spirits sunk to nothing with the view even of the best prospects with such a creature  this gave him opportunity to proceed and that he did assuming a still more serious air  as to what further remained for him to say in answer to what i had said he hoped i would pardon him but upon his soul he was concerned infinitely concerned he repeated his color and his voice rising that it was necessary for him to observe how much i chose rather to have run the risque of being solmess wife than to have it in my power to reward a man who i must forgive him had been as much insulted on my account as i had been on his  who had watched my commands and pardon me madam every changeable motion of your pen all hours in all weathers and with a cheerfulness and ardor that nothing but the most faithful and obsequious passion could inspire   i now miss began to revive into a little more warmth of attention   and all madam for what how i stared  only to prevail upon you to free yourself from ungenerous and base oppression   sir sir indignantly said i   hear me but out dearest madam  my heart is full  i must speak what i have to say  to be told for your words are yet in my ears and at my heart that you would give the world and all your hopes in it to have been still in your cruel and gloomy fathers house   not a word sir against my papa  i will not bear that   whatever had been your usage  and you have a credulity madam against all probability if you believe you should have avoided being solmess wife that i have put you upon sacrificing your duty and conscience  yet dearest creature see you not the contradiction that your warmth of temper has surprised you into when the reluctance you showed to the last to leave your persecutors has cleared your conscience from the least reproach of this sort   o sir sir are you so critical then are you so light in your anger as to dwell upon words   and indeed my dear i have since thought that his anger was not owing to that sudden impetus which cannot be easily bridled but rather was a sort of manageable anger let loose to intimidate me  forgive me madam  i have just done  have i not in your own opinion hazarded my life to redeem you from oppression  yet is not my reward after all precarious  for madam have you not conditioned with me and most sacredly hard as the condition is will i observe it that all my hope must be remote that you are determined to have it in your power to favor or reject me totally as you please   see my dear in every respect my condition changed for the worse is it in my power to take your advice if i should think it ever so right to take it   and have you not furthermore declared proceeded he that you will engage to renounce me for ever if your friends insist upon that cruel renunciation as the terms of being reconciled to you  but nevertheless madam all the merit of having saved you from an odious compulsion shall be mine i glory in it though i were to lose you for ever  as i see i am but too likely to do from your present displeasure and especially if your friends insist upon the terms you are ready to comply with  that you are your own mistress through my means is i repeat my boast  as such i humbly implore your favor  and that only upon the conditions i have yielded to hope for it  as i do now thus humbly the proud wretch falling on one knee your forgiveness for so long detaining your ear and for all the plaindealing that my undesigning heart would not be denied to utter by my lips  o sir pray rise  let the obliged kneel if one of us must kneel  but nevertheless proceed not in this strain i beseech you you have had a great deal of trouble about me but had you let me know in time that you expected to be rewarded for it at the price of my duty i should have spared you much of it  far be it from me sir to depreciate merit so extraordinary but let me say that had it not been for the forbidden correspondence i was teazed by you into and which i had not continued every letter for many letters intended to be the last but because i thought you a sufferer from my friends i had not been either confined or maltreated nor would my brothers lowmeant violence have had a foundation to work upon  i am far from thinking my case would have been so very desperate as you imagine had i stayed my father loved me at bottom he would not see me before and i wanted only to see him and to be heard and a delay of his sentence was the least thing i expected from the trial i was to stand  you are boasting of your merits sir let merit be your boast nothing else can attract me if personal considerations had principal weight with me either in solmess disfavour or in your favor i should despise myself if you value yourself upon them in preference to the person of the poor solmes i shall despise you  you may glory in your fancied merits in getting me away but the cause of your glory i tell you plainly is my shame  make to yourself a title to my regard which i can better approve of or else you will not have so much merit with me as you have with yourself  but here like the first pair i at least driven out of my paradise are we recriminating no more shall you need to tell me of your sufferings and your merits  your all hours and all weathers for i will bear them in memory as long as i live and if it be impossible for me to reward them be ever ready to own the obligation all that i desire of you now is to leave it to myself to seek for some private abode to take the chariot with you to london or elsewhere and if i have any further occasion for your assistance and protection i will signify it to you and be still further obliged to you  you are warm my dearest life  but indeed there is no occasion for it had i any views unworthy of my faithful love for you i should not have been so honest in my declarations  then he began again to vow the sincerity of his intentions  but i took him up short i am willing to believe you sir it would be insupportable but to suppose there were a necessity for such solemn declarations at this he seemed to collect himself as i may say into a little more circumspection if i thought there were i would not sit with you here in a public inn i assure you although cheated hither as far as i know by methods you must excuse me sir that the very suspicion that it may be so gives me too much vexation for me to have patience either with you or with myself  but no more of this just now let me but know i beseech you good sir bowing i was very angry if you intend to leave me or if i have only escaped from one confinement to another   cheated hither as far as you know madam let you know and with that air too charming though grievous to my heart if you have only escaped from one confinement to another  amazing perfectly amazing  and can there be a necessity for me to answer this  you are absolutely your own mistress  it were very strange if you were not the moment you are in a place of safety i will leave you  one condition only give me leave to beg your consent to it is this that you will be pleased now you are so entirely in your own power to renew a promise voluntarily made before voluntarily or i would not now presume to request it for although i would not be though capable of growing upon concession yet i cannot bea to think of losing the ground your goodness had given me room to hope i had gained that make up how you please with your relations you will never marry any other man while i am living and single unless i should be so wicked as to give new caus for high displeasure  i hesitate not to confirm this promise sir upon your own condition in what manner do you expec me to confirm it   only madam by your word  then i never will  he had the assurance i was now in his power to salute me as a sealing of my promise as he called it his motion was so sudden that i was not aware of it it would have looked affected to be very angry yet i could not be pleased considering this as a leading freedom from a spirit so audacious and incroaching and he might see that i was not  he passed all that by with an air peculiar to himself  enough enough dearest madam  and let me beg of you but to conquer this dreadful uneasiness which gives me to apprehend but tootoo much for my jealous love to bear and it shall be my whole endeavor to deserve your favor and to make you the happiest woman in the world as i shall be the happiest of men  i broke from him to write to you my preceding letter but refused to send it by his servant as i told you the gentlewoman of the inn helped me to a messenger who was to carry what you should give him to lord ms seat in hertfordshire directed for mrs greme the housekeeper there and early in the morning for fear of pursuit we were to set out that way and there he proposed to exchange the chariotandsix for a chaiseandpair of his own which happened to be at that seat as it would be a lessnoticed conveyance  i looked over my little stock of money and found it to be no more than seven guineas and some silver the rest of my stock was but fifty guineas and that five more than i thought it was when my sister chalenged me as to the sum i had by me see vol i p          and those i left in my escritoire little thinking to be prevailed upon to go away with him  indeed my case abounds with a shocking variety of indelicate circumstances among the rest i was forced to account to him who knew i could have no clothes but what i had on how i came to have linen with you for he could not but know i sent for it lest he should imagine i had an early design to go away with him and made that a part of the preparation  he most heartily wished he said for my minds sake that your mamma would have afforded me her protection and delivered himself upon this subject with equal freedom and concern  there are my dear miss how a multitude of punctilios and decorums which a young creature must dispense with who in such a situation makes a man the intimate attendant of her person i could now i think give twenty reasons stronger than any i have heretofore mentioned why women of the least delicacy should never think of incurring the danger and disgrace of taking the step i have been drawn in to take but with horror and aversion and why they should look upon the man who shall tempt them to it as the vilest and most selfish of seducers  before five oclock tuesday morning the maidservant came up to tell me my brother was ready and that breakfast also waited for me in the parlour i went down with a heart as heavy as my eyes and received great acknowlegements and compliments from him on being so soon dressed and ready as he interpreted it to continue our journey  he had the thought which i had not for what had i to do with thinking who had it not when i stood most in need of it to purchase for me a velve hood and a handsome short cloak trimmed with silver without saying any thing to me he must reward himself the artful incroacher said before the landlady and her maids and niece for his forethought and would salute his pretty sullen sister  he too his reward and as he said a tear with it while he assured me still before them a vile wretch that i had nothing to fear from meeting with parents who so dearly loved me  how could i be complaisant my dear to such a man as this   as soon as the chariot drove on he asked me whether i had any objection to go to lord ms hertfordshire seat his lordship he said was at his berkshire one  i told him i chose not to go as yet to any of his relations for that would indicate a plain defiance to my own  my choice was to go to a private lodging and for him to be at a distance from me at least till i heard how things were taken by my friends  for that although i had but little hopes of a reconciliation as it was yet if they knew i was in his protection or in that of any of his friends which would be looked upon as the same thing there would not be room for any at all  i should govern him as i pleased he solemnly assured me in every thing but he still thought london was the best place for me and if i were once safe there and in a lodging to my liking he would go to m hall but as i approved not of london he would urge it no further  he proposed and i consented to put up at an inn in the neighborhood of the lawn as he called lord ms seat in this county since i chose not to go thither and here i got two hours to myself which i told him i should pass in writing another letter to you meaning my narrative which i had begun at st albans fatigued as i was and in one to my sister to apprize the family whether they were solitous about it or not that i was well and to beg that my clothes some particular books and the fifty guineas i had left in my escritoire might be sent me  he asked if i had considered whither to have them directed  indeed not i i told him i was a stranger to   so was he he interrupted me but it struck him by chance  wicked storyteller  but added he i will tell you madam how it shall be managed  if you dont choose to go to london it is nevertheless best that your relations should think you there for then they will absolutely despair of finding you if you write be pleased to direct to be left for you at mr osgoods near sohosquare who is a man of reputation and they will go very safe and this will effectually amuse them  amuse them my dear  amuse whom  my father  my uncles  but it must be so  all his expedients ready you see   i had no objection to this and i have written accordingly but what answer i shall have or whether any that is what gives me no small anxiety  this however is one consolation that if i have an answer and although my brother should be the writer it cannot be more severe than the treatment i have of late received from him and my sister  mr lovelace staid out about an hour and half and then came in impatiently sending up to me no less than four times to express his desire of my company but i sent him word as often that i was busy and at last that i should be so till dinner was ready so he hastened that as i heard him nowandthen with a hearty curse upon the cook and waiters  this is another of his perfections i ventured afterward to check him for his free words as we sa at dinner  having heard him swear at his servant when below whom nevertheless he owns to be a good one it is a sad life said i these innkeepers live mr lovelace  no pretty well i believe  but why madam think you that fellows who eat and drink at other mens cost or they are sorry whelps of innkeepers should be entitled to pity  because of the soldiers they are obliged to quarter who are generally i believe wretched profligates bless me said i how i heard one of them swear and curse just now at a modest meek man as i judge by his low voice and gentle answers  well do they make it a proverb  like a trooper  he bit his lip arose turned upon his heel stepped to the glass and looked confidently abashed if i may so say  ay madam said he these troopers are sad swearing fellows i think their officers should chastise them for it  i am sure they deserve chastisement replied i  for swearing is a most unmanly vice and cursing as poor and low a one since it proclaims the profligates want of power and his wickedness at the same time for could such a one punish as he speaks he would be a fiend  charmingly observed by my soul madam  the next trooper i hear swear and curse i will tell him what an unmanly and what a poor whelp he is  mrs greme came to pay her duty to me as mr lovelace called it and was very urgent with me to go to her lords house letting me know what handsome things she had heard her lord and his two nieces and all the family say of me and what wishes for several months past they had put up for the honor she now hoped soon would be done them all  this gave me some satisfaction as it confirmed from the mouth of a very good sort of woman all that mr lovelace had told me  upon inquiry about a private lodging she recommended me to a sisterinlaw of hers eight miles from thence  where i now am and what pleased me the better was that mr lovelace of whom i could see she was infinitely observant obliged her of his own motion to accompany me in the chaise himself riding on horseback with his two servants and one of lord ms and here we arrived about four oclock  but as i told you in my former the lodgings are inconvenient and mr lovelace found great fault with them telling mrs greme who had said they were not worthy of us that they came not up even to her description of them that as the house was a mile from a town it was not proper for him to be so far distant from me lest any thing should happen and yet the apartments were not separate and distinct enough for me to like he was sure  this must be agreeable enough from him you will believe  mrs greme and i had a good deal of talk in the chaise about him she was very easy and free in her answers to all i asked and has a very serious turn i find  i led her on to say to the following effect some part of it not unlike what his uncles dismissed bailiff had said before by which i find that all the servants opinion of him is alike  that mr lovelace was a generous man that it was hard to say whether the servants of her lords family loved or feared him most that her lord had a very great affection for him that his two noble aunts were no less fond of him that his two cousins montague were as goodnatured young ladies as ever lived that his uncle and aunts had proposed several ladies to him before he made his addresses to me and even since despairing to move me and my friends in his favor  but that he had no thoughts of marrying at all she had heard him say if it were not to me that as well her lord as his sisters were a good deal concerned at the contempts and illusage he received from my family but admired my character and wished to have him married to me although i were not to have a shilling in preference to any other person from the opinion that they had of the influence i should have over him that to be sure she said mr lovelace was a wild gentleman but that was a distemper which would cure itself that her lord delighted in his company whenever he could get it but that they often fell out and his lordship was always forced to submit indeed was halfafraid of him she believed  for he would do as he pleased she mingled a thousand pities often that he acted not up to the talents lent him  yet would have it that he had fine qualities to found a reformation upon and when the happy day came would make amends for all and of this all his friends were so assured that they wished for nothing so earnestly as for his marriage  this indifferent as it is is better than my brother says of him  the people of the house here are very honestlooking industrious folks mrs sorlings is the gentlewomans name the farm seems wellstockd and thriving she is a widow has two sons men grown who vie with each other which shall take most pains in promoting the common good and they are both of them i already see more respectful to two modest young women their sisters than my brother was to his sister i believe i must stay here longer than at first i thought i should  i should have mentioned that before i set out for this place i received your kind letter every thing is kind from so dear a friend i own you might well be surprised i was myself as by this time you will have seen  after i had determined too so strongly against going away  i have not the better opinion of mr lovelace for his extravagant volubility he is too full of professions he says too many fine things of me and to me true respect true value i think lies not in words words cannot express it the silent awe the humble the doubting eye and even the hesitating voice better show it by much than as shakespeare says  the rattling tongue of saucy and audacious eloquence   the man to be sure is at times all upon the ecstatic one of his phrases but to my shame and confusion i know too well what to attribute it to in a great measure  to his triumph my dear in one word it needs no further explanation and to give it that word perhaps equally exposes my vanity and condemns my folly  we have been alarmed with notions of a pursuit founded upon a letter from his intelligencer  how do different circumstances sanctify or condemn an action  what care ought we to take not to confound the distinctions of right and wrong when self comes into the question i condemned in him the corrupting of a servant of my papas and now i am glad to give a kind of indirect approbation of it by inquiring what he hears by that or any other way of the manner in which my relations took my flight a preconcerted forward and artful flight to be sure it must appear to them  that is a sad thing  yet how as i am situated can i put them right  most heavily he says they take it but show not so much grief as rage  and he can hardly have patience to hear of the virulence and menaces of my brother against himself  then a merit is made to me of his forbearance  what a satisfaction am i robbed of my dearest friend by this rash action i can now too late judge of the difference there is in being an offended rather than an offending person  what would i give to have it once more in my power to say i suffered wrong rather than did wrong that others were more wanting in their kindness to me than i in duty where duty is owing to them   fie upon me for meeting the seducer  let all end as happily as it now may i have laid up for myself remorse for my whole life  what more concerns me is that every time i see this man i am still at a greater loss than before what to make of him i watch every turn of his countenance and i think i see very deep lines in it he looks with more meaning i verily think than he used to look yet not more serious not less gay  i dont know how he looks  but with more confidence a great deal than formerly and yet he never wanted that  but here is the thing i behold him with fear now as knowing the power my indiscretion has given him over me and well may he look more elate when he sees me deprived of all the selfsupposed significance which adorns and exalts a person who has been accustomed to respect and who now by a conscious inferiority allows herself to be overcome and in a state of obligation as i may say to her new protector  i shall send this as my former by a poor man who travels every day with pedlary matters who will leave it at mrs knollyss as you direct  if you hear any thing of my father and mother and of their health and how my friends were affected by my unhappy step pray be so good as to write me a few lines by the messenger if his waiting for them can be known to you  i am afraid to ask you whether upon reading that part of my narrative already in your hands you think any sort of extenuation lies for  your unhappy clarissa harlowe  letter vi mr lovelace to john belford esquire tuesday wedn apr       thou claimest my promise that i will be as particular as possible in all that passes between me and my goddess indeed i never had a more illustrious subject to exercise my pen upon and moreover i have leisure for by her good will my access would be as difficult to her as that of the humblest slave to an eastern monarch nothing then but inclination to write can be wanting and since our friendship and thy obliging attendance upon me at the white heart will not excuse that i will endeavor to keep my word  i parted with thee and thy brethren with a full resolution thou know to rejoin ye if she once again disappointed me in order to go together attended by our servants for shewsake to her gloomy father and demand audience of the tyrant upon the freedoms taken with my character and to have tried by fair means if fair would do to make them change their resolutions and treat her with less inhumanity and me with more civility  i told thee my reasons for not going in search of a letter of countermand i was right for if i had i should have found such a one and had i received it she would not have met me did she think that after i had been more than once disappointed i would not keep her to her promise that i would not hold her to it when i had got her in so deeply  the moment i heard the door unbolt i was sure of her that motion made my heart bound to my throat but when that was followed with the presence of my charmer flashing upon me all at once in a flood of brightness sweetly dressed though all unprepared for a journey i trod air and hardly thought myself a mortal  thou shall judge of her dress as at the moment she appeared to me and as upon a nearer observation she really was i am a critic thou know in womens dresses  many a one have i taught to dress and helped to undress but there is such a native elegance in this lady that she surpasses all that i could imagine surpassing  but then her person adorns what she wears more than dress can adorn her and that is her excellence  expect therefore a faint sketch of her admirable person with her dress  her waxlike flesh for after all flesh and blood i think she is by its delicacy and firmness answers for the soundness of her health thou have often heard me launch out in praise of her complexion i never in my life beheld a skin so illustriously fair the lily and the driven snow it is nonsense to talk of her lawn and her laces one might indeed compare to those but what a whited wall would a woman appear to be who had a complexion which would justify such unnatural comparisons but this lady is allalive allglowing all charming flesh and blood yet so clear that every meandring vein is to be seen in all the lovely parts of her which custom permits to be visible  thou have heard me also describe the wavy ringlets of her shining hair needing neither art nor powder of itself an ornament defying all other ornaments wantoning in and about a neck that is beautiful beyond description  her headdress was a brusselslace mob peculiarly adapted to the charming air and turn of her features a skyblue ribband illustrated that  but although the weather was somewhat sharp she had not on either hat or hood for besides that she loves to use herself hardily by which means and by a temperance truly exemplary she is allowed to have given high health and vigor to an originally tender constitution she seems to have intended to show me that she was determined not to stand to her appointment o jack that such a sweet girl should be a rogue  her morninggown was a pale primrosecolourd paduasoy the cuffs and robings curiously embroidered by the fingers of this evercharming ariadne in a running pattern of violets and their leaves the light in the flowers silver gold in the leaves a pair of diamond snaps in her ears a white handkerchief wrought by the same inimitable fingers concealed  o belford what still more inimitable beauties did it not conceal  and i saw all the way we rode the bounding heart by its throbbing motions i saw it dancing beneath the charming umbrage  her ruffles were the same as her mob her apron a flowered lawn her coat white satin quilted blue satin her shoes braided with the same color without lace for what need has the prettiest foot in the world of ornament neat buckles in them and on her charming arms a pair of black velvet glovelike muffs of her own invention for she makes and gives fashions as she pleases her hands velvet of themselves thus uncovered the freer to be grasped by those of her adorer  i have told thee what were my transports when the undrawn bolt presented to me my longexpected goddess  her emotions were more sweetly feminine after the first moments for then the fire of her starry eyes began to sink into a lessdazling languor she trembled nor knew she how to support the agitations of a heart she had never found so ungovernable she was even fainting when i clasped her in my supporting arms what a precious moment that how near how sweetly near the throbbing partners  by her dress i saw as i observed before how unprepared she was for a journey and not doubting her intention once more to disappoint me i would have drawn her after me then began a contention the most vehement that ever i had with lady it would pain thy friendly heart to be told the infinite trouble i had with her i begged i prayed on my knees i begged and prayed her yet in vain to answer her own appointment and had i not happily provided for such a struggle knowing whom i had to deal with i had certainly failed in my design and as certainly would have accompanied her in without thee and thy brethren and who knows what might have been the consequence  but my honest agent answering my signal though not quite so soon as i expected in the manner thou know i had laid down to him they are coming they are coming  fly fly my beloved creature cried i drawing my sword with a flourish as if i would have slain half an hundred of them and seizing her trembling hands i drew her after me so swiftly that my feet winged by love could hardly keep pace with her feet agitated by fear  and so i became her emperor  i will tell thee all when i see thee and thou shall then judge of my difficulties and of her perverseness and thou will rejoice with me at my conquest over such a watchful and openeyd charmer  but see thou not now as i think i do the windoutstripping fairone flying from her love to her love  is there not such a game  nay flying from friends she was resolved not to abandon to the man she was determined not to go off with  the sex the sex all over  charming contradiction  hah hah hah hah  i must here lay down my pen to hold my sides for i must have my laugh out now the fit is upon me  i believe  i believe  hah hah hah  i believe jack my dogs conclude me mad for here has one of them popt in as if to see what ailed me or whom i had with me  the whoreson caught the laugh as he went out  hah hah hah  an impudent dog  o jack knew thou my conceit and were but thy laugh joined to mine i believe it would hold me for an hour longer  but o my bestbeloved fairone repine not thou at the arts by which thou suspectest thy fruitless vigilance has been overwatched  take care that thou provokest not new ones that may be still more worthy of thee if once thy emperor decrees thy fall thou shall greatly fall thou shall have cause if that comes to pass which may come to pass for why would thou put off marriage to so long a day as till thou had reason to be convinced of my reformation dearest thou shall have cause never fear to sit down more dissatisfied with thy stars than with thyself and come the worst to the worst glorious terms will i give thee thy garrison with general prudence at the head and governor watchfulness bringing up the rear shall be allowed to march out with all the honors due to so brave a resistance and all thy sex and all mine that hear of my stratagems and thy conduct shall acknowledge the fortress as nobly won as defended  thou will not dare methinks i hear thee say to attempt to reduce such a goddess as this to a standard unworthy of her excellencies it is impossible lovelace that thou should intend to break through oaths and protestations so solemn  that i did not intend it is certain that i do intend it i cannot my heart my reverence for her will not let me say but know thou not my aversion to the state of shackles  and is she not in my power  and will thou lovelace abuse that power which   which what puppy  which i obtained not by her own consent but against it  but which thou had never obtained had she not esteemed thee above all men  and which i had never taken so much pains to obtain had i not loved her above all women  so far upon a par jack  and if thou pleadest honor ought not honor to be mutual if mutual does it not imply mutual trust mutual confidence  and what have i had of that from her to boast of  thou know the whole progress of our warfare for a warfare it has truly been and far very far from an amorous warfare too doubts mistrusts upbraidings on her part humiliations the most abject on mine obliged to assume such airs of reformation that every varlet of ye has been afraid i should reclaim in good earnest and have thou not thyself frequently observed to me how aukwardly i returned to my usual gaiety after i had been within a mile of her fathers gardenwall although i had not seen her  does she not deserve to pay for all this  to make an honest fellow look like an hypocrite what a vile thing is that  then thou know what a false little rogue she has been how little conscience she has made of disappointing me  have thou not been a witness of my ravings on this score  have i not in the height of them vowed revenge upon the faithless charmer  and if i must be forsworn whether i answer her expectations or follow my own inclinations as cromwell said if it must be my head or the kings and the option in my own power can i hesitate a moment which to choose  then i fancy by her circumspection and her continual grief that she expects some mischief from me i dont care to disappoint anybody i have a value for  but o the noble the exalted creature who can avoid hesitating when he thinks of an offense against her  who can but pity   yet on the other hand so loath at last to venture though threatened to be forced into the nuptial fetters with a man whom to look upon as a rival is to disgrace myself  so sullen now she has ventured  what title has she to pity and to a pity which her pride would make her disclaim  but i resolve not any way i will see how her will works and how my will leads me on i will give the combatants fair play and i find every time i attend her that she is less in my power  i more in hers  yet a foolish little rogue to forbid me to think of marriage till i am a reformed man till the implacables of her family change their natures and become placable  it is true when she was for making those conditions she did not think that without any she should be cheated out of herself for so the dear soul as thou may hear in its place phrases it  how it swells my pride to have been able to outwit such a vigilant charmer  i am taller by half a yard in my imagination than i was  i look down upon everybody now  last night i was still more extravagant  i took off my hat as i walked to see if the lace were not scorched supposing it had brushed down a star and before i put it on again in mere wantonness and heartsease i was for buffeting the moon in short my whole soul is joy when i go to bed i laugh myself asleep and i awake either laughing or singing  yet nothing nearly in view neither  for why  i am not yet reformed enough  i told thee at the time if thou remembrest how capable this restriction was of being turned upon the overscrupulous dear creature could i once get her out of her fathers house and were i disposed to punish her for her familys faults and for the infinite trouble she herself had given me little thinks she that i have kept an account of both and that when my heart is soft and all her own i can but turn to my memoranda and harden myself at once  o my charmer look to it  abate of thy haughty airs  value not thyself upon thy sincerity if thou art indifferent to me  i will not bear it now  art thou not in my power  nor if thou love me think that the female affectation of denying thy love will avail thee now with a heart so proud and so jealous  remember moreover that all thy familysins are upon thy head   but ah jack when i see my angel when i am admitted to the presence of this radiant beauty what will become of all this vapouring   but be my end what it may i am obliged by thy penetration fairone to proceed by the sap  fair and softly  a wife at any time  that will be always in my power  when put to the university the same course of initial studies will qualify the yonker for the one line or for the other the genius ought to point out the future lawyer divine or physician  so the same cautious conduct with such a vigilance will do either for the wife or for the nowife when i reform i will marry it is time enough for the one the lady must say  for the other say i  but how i ramble  this it is to be in such a situation that i know not what to resolve upon  i will tell thee my inclinings as i procced the pros and the cons i will tell thee  but being got too far from the track i set out in i will close here but perhaps may write every day something and send it as opportunity offers  regardless however in all i write as i shall be of connection accuracy or of any thing but of my own imperial will and pleasure  letter vii miss how to miss clarissa harlowe wednesday night april    i have your narrative my dear you are the same noble creature you ever were above disguise above art above extenuating a failing  the only family in the world yours surely that could have driven such a daughter into such extremities  but you must not be so very much too good for them and for the case  you lay the blame so properly and so unsparingly upon your meeting him that nothing can be added to that subject by your worst enemies were they to see what you have written  i am not surprised now i have read your narrative that so bold and so contriving a man  i am forced to break off   you stood it out much better and longer  here again comes my bustling jealous mother  dont be so angry at yourself did you not do for the best at the time as to your first fault the answering his letters it was almost incumbent upon you to assume the guardianship of such a family when the bravo of it had run riot as he did and brought himself into danger  except your mamma who is kept down have any of them common sense   forgive me my dear  here is that stupid uncl antony of yours a pragmatical conceited positive  he came yesterday in a fearful pucker and puffed and blowed and stumped about our hall and parlour while his message was carried up  my mamma was dressing herself these widows are as starched as the batchelors she would not see him in a dishabille for the world  what can she mean by it  his errand was to set her against you and to show their determined rage on your going away the issue proved it to be so too evidently  the odd creature desired to speak with her alone i am not used to such exceptions whenever any visits are made to my mamma  when my mamma was primmd out down she came to him  the door was locked upon themselves the two positive heads were put together  close together i suppose  for i hearkened but could hear nothing distinctly though they both seemed full of their subject  i had a good mind once or twice to have made them open the door  could i have been sure of keeping but tolerably my temper i would have demanded admittance  but i was afraid if i had obtained it that i should have forgot it was my mammas house and been for turning him out of it  to come to rave against and abuse my dearest dearest saultless friend and the ravings to be listened to  and this in order to justify themselves the one for contributing to drive her out of her fathers house the other for refusing her a temporary asylum till the reconciliation could have been effected which her dutiful heart was set upon  and which it would have become the love my mamma had ever pretended for you to have mediated for  could i have had patience  the issue as i said showed what the errand was  its first appearance after the old fusty fellow was marched off you must excuse me my dear was in a kind of gloomy harlowelike reservedness in my mamma which upon a few resenting flirts of mine was followed by a rigorous prohibition of correspondence  this put us you may suppose upon terms not the most agreeable i desired to know if i were prohibited dreaming of you  for my dear you have all my sleeping as well as waking hours  i can easily allow for your correspondence with your wretch at first and yet your motives were excellent by the effect this prohibition has upon me since if possible it has made me love you better than before and i am more desirous than ever of corresponding with you  but i have still a more laudable motive  i should think myself the unworthiest of creatures could i be brought to slight a dear friend and such a meritorious one in her distress  i would die first  and so i told my mamma and i have desired her not to watch me in my retired hours nor to insist upon my lying with her constantly which she now does more earnestly than ever  twere better i told her that the harlowebetty were borrowed to be set over me  mr hickman who greatly honors you has unknown to me interposed so warmly in your favor with my mamma that it makes for him no small merit with me  i cannot at present write to every particular unless i would be in set defiance  teaze teaze teaze for ever the same thing though answered fifty times over is every hour to be repeated  lord bless me what a life must my poor papa  but i must remember to whom i am writing  if this everactive evermischievous monkey of a man  this lovelace  contrived as you suspect  but here comes my mamma again  ay stay a little longer my mamma if you please  i can but be suspected i can but be chidden for making you wait and chidden i am sure to be whether i do or not in the way you are antonyd into  bless me  how impatient  i must break off   a charming dialoguebut i am sent for down in a very peremptory manner i assure you  what an incoherent letter will you have when i can get it to you but now i know where to send it mr hickman shall find me a messenger yet if he be detected poor soul he will be harlowedoff as well as his meek mistress   thursday april    i have this moment your continuationletter and a little absence of my arguseyed mamma   dear creature  i can account for all your difficulties a person of your delicacy  and with such a man  i must be brief   the mans a fool my dear with all his pride and with all his complaisance and affected regards to your injunctions yet his ready inventions   sometimes i think you should go to lady bettys  i know not what to advise you to  i could if you were not so intent upon reconciling yourself to your relations but they are implacable you can have no hopes from them  your uncles errand to my mamma may convince you of that and if you have an answer to your letter to your sister that will confirm you i dare say  you need not to have been afraid of asking me whether i thought upon reading your narrative any extenuation could lie for what you have done i have told you above my mind as to that  and i repeat that i think your provocations and inducements considered you are free from blame at least the freest that ever young creature was who took such a step  but you took it not  you were driven on one side and possibly tricked on the other  if any young person on earth shall be circumstanced as you were and shall hold out so long as you did against her persecutors on one hand and her seducer on the other i will forgive her for all the rest  all your acquaintance you may suppose talk of nobody but you some indeed bring your admirable character against you but nobody does or can acquit your father and uncles  everybody seems apprized of your brothers and sisters motives it is no doubt the very thing they aimed to drive you to by the various attacks they made upon you unhoping as they might do all the time the success they knew that if once you were restored to favor love suspended would be love augmented and that you must defeat and expose them and triumph by your amiable qualities and great talents over all their arts  and now i hear they enjoy their successful malice  your father is all rage and violence he ought i am sure to turn his rage inward all your family accuse you of acting with deep art and are put upon supposing that you are actually every hour exulting over them with your man in the success of it  they all pretend now that your trial of wednesday was to be the last  advantage would indeed my mamma owns have been taken of your yielding if you had yielded but had you not been to be prevailed upon they would have given up their scheme and taken your promise for renouncing lovelace  believe them who will they own however that a minister was to be present mr solmes was to be at hand and your father was previously to try his authority over you in order to make you sign the settlements  all of it a romantic contrivance of your wildheaded foolish brother i make no doubt  is it likely that he and bell would have given way to your restoration to favor on any other terms than those their hearts had been so long set upon  how they took your flight when they found it out may be better supposed than described  your aunt hervey it seems was the first that went down to the ivy summer house in order to acquaint you that their search was over betty followed her and they not finding you there went on toward the cascade according to a hint of yours  returning by the gardendoor they met a servant they dont say it was that joseph leman but it is very likely that it was he running as he said from pursuing mr lovelace a great hedgestake in his hand and out of breath to alarm the family  if it were this fellow and if he were employed in the double agency of cheating them and cheating you what shall we think of the wretch you are with  run away from him my dear if so  no matter to whom  or marry him if you cannot  your aunt and all your family were accordingly alarmed by this fellow evidently when too late for pursuit they got together and when a posse ran to the place of interview and some of them as far as to the tracks of the chariotwheels without stopping and having heard the mans tale upon the spot a general lamentation a mutual upbraiding and rage and grief were echoed from the different persons according to their different tempers and conceptions and they returned like fools as they went  your brother at first ordered horses and armed men to be got ready for a pursuit solmes and your uncle tony were to be of the party but your mamma and your aunt hervey dissuaded them from it for fear of adding evil to evil not doubting but lovelace had taken measures to support himself in what he had done and especially when the servant declared that he saw you run with him as fast as you could set foot to ground and that there were several armed men on horseback at a small distance off   my mammas absence was owing to her suspicion that the knollyss were to assist in our correspondence she made them a visit upon it she does every thing at once and they have promised that no more letters shall be left there without her knowledge  but mr hickman has engaged one filmer a husbandman in the lane we call finchlane near us to receive them thither you will be pleased to direct yours under cover to mr john soberton and mr hickman himself will call for them there and there shall leave mine it goes against me too to make him so useful to me  he looks already so proud upon it  i shall have him who knows give himself airs  he had best consider that the favor he has been long aiming at may put him into a very dangerous a very ticklish situation he that can oblige may disoblige  happy for some people not to have it in their power to offend  i will have patience if i can for a while to see if these bustlings in my mamma will subside  but upon my word i will not long bear this usage  sometimes i am ready to think that my mamma carries it thus on purpose to tire me out and to make me the sooner marry if i find it to be so and that hickman in order to make a merit with me is in the low plot i will never bear him in my sight  plotting wretch as i doubt your man is i wish to heaven that you were married that you might brave them all and not be forced to hide yourself and be hurried from one inconvenient place to another i charge you omit not to lay hold on any handsome opportunity that may offer for that purpose  here again comes my mamma  we look mighty glum upon each other i can tell ou she had not best harlowe me at this rate  will not bear it   i have a vast deal to write i know not what to write first yet my mind is full and seems to run over  i am got into a private corner of the garden to e out of her way  lord help these mothers  do they think they can prevent a daughters writing or doing any thing she has a mind to do by suspicion watchfulness and scolding  they had better place  confidence in one by half  a generous mind scorns o abuse a generous confidence  you have a nice a very nice part to act with his wretch  who yet has i think but one plain path before him i pity you  but you must make he best of the lot you have been forced to draw yet i see your difficulties  but if he do not offer to abuse your confidence i would have you seem at least to place some in him  if you think not of marrying soon i approve of your resolution to fix somewhere out of his reach and if he know not where to find you so much the better yet i verily believe they would force you back could they but come at you if they were not afraid of him  i think by all means you should demand of both your trustees to be put in possession of your own estate mean time i have sixty guineas at your service i beg you will command them before they are gone i will take care you shall be further supplied i dont think you will have a shilling or a shillings worth of your own from your relations unless you extort it from them  as they believe you went off by your own consent they are surpised it seems and glad that you have left your jewels and money behind you and ha contrived for clothes so ill very little likelihoo this shows of their answering your requests  indeed everybody not knowing what i now know must be at a loss to account for your flight as the will call it and how my dear can one report i with any tolerable advantage to you  to say y did not intend it when you met him who will believ it  to say that a person of your known steadness and punctilio was overpersuaded when y gave him the meeting how will that sound  t say you were tricked out of yourself and people we to give credit to it how disreputable  and wh unmarried and yet with him he a man of such  character what would it not lead a censuring wor to think  i want to see how you put it in your letter for yo clothes  you may depend i repeat upon all the little spitful and disgraceful things they can offer instead  what you write for so pray accept the sum i tender what will seven guineas do  and i will fi a way to send you also any of my clothes and line for present supply i beg my dearest miss harlow that you will not put your anna how upon a fo with lovelace in refusing to accept of my offer  you do not oblige me i shall be apt to think that yo rather incline to be obliged to him than to favor m and if i find this i shall not know how to reconc it with your delicacy in other respects  pray inform me of every thing that passes betwee you and him my cares for you however needles from your own prudence make me wish you t continue to be very minute if any thing occur tha you would tell me of if present fail not to put down in writing although from your natural diffidenc it should not appear to you altogether so worthy  your pen or of my knowing a standerby may so more of the game than one that plays great consequences like great folks are generally attended and even made great by small causes and little incidents  upon the whole i do not now think it is in your power to dismiss him when you please i apprized you beforehand that it would not i repeat therefore that were i you i would at least seem to place some confidence in him so long as he is decent you may very visibly observable to such delicacy as yours must be that behavior in him which will make him unworthy of some confidence  your relations according to old antony to my mother and she to me by way of threatening that you will not gain your supposed ends upon them by your flight seem to expect that you will throw yourself into lady bettys protection and that she will offer to mediate for you and they vow that they will never hearken to any accommodation or terms that shall come from that quarter they might speak out and say from any quarter for i dare aver that your brother and sister will not let them cool  at least till their uncles have made such dispositions and your father too perhaps as they would have them make  as this letter will apprize you of an alteration in the place to which you must direct your next i send it by a friend of mr hickmans who may be depended upon he has business in the neighborhood of mrs sorlings whom he knows and will return to mr hickman this night and bring back any letter you shall have ready to send or can get ready it is moonlight he will not mind waiting for you i choose not to send by any of mr hickmans servants  at present however every hour is now or may be important and may make an alteration in your resolutions and situation necessary  i hear from where i sit my mamma calling about her and putting everybody into motion she will soon i suppose make me and my employment the subject of her inquiry  adieu my dear may heaven preserve you and restore you with honor as unsullied as your mind to  your everaffectionate anna how  letter viii miss clarissa harlowe to miss how thursday p m april    i am infinitely concerned my everdear and everkind friend that i am the sad occasion of the displeasure between your mamma and you  how many unhappy persons have i made   had i not to console myself that my error is not owing to wicked precipitation i should be the most miserable of all creatures as it is i am enough punished in the loss of my character more valuable to me than my life and in the cruel doubts and perplexities which conflicting with my hopes and each getting the victory by turns harrow up my soul between them  i think however that you should obey your mamma and decline a correspondence with so unhappy a creature  take care how you fall into my error for that began with carrying on a prohibited correspondence which i thought it in my power to discontinue at pleasure my talent is scribbling and i the readier fell into this freedom as i found delight in writing having motives too which i thought laudable and at one time the permission of all my friends to write to him vol i p         yet although i am ready sometimes to discontinue a correspondence so dear to me in order to make your mamma easy what hurt could a letter nowandthen from each do  mine occasionally filled with selfaccusation too  so much prudence and discretion as you have and lying under no temptation of following so bad an example in writing to me  i thank you most heartily for your kind offers you may be assured that i would sooner be beholden to you than to any body living to mr lovelace the last so do not think that by declining it i have an intention to lay myself under obligations to him  i am willing to hope notwithstanding what you write that i shall have my little money together with my clothes sent me by my friends they are too considerate some of them at least to permit that i should be put to such low difficulties perhaps they will not be in haste to oblige me but if not i cannot yet want  i believe you think i must not dispute with him the expenses of the road and lodgings till i can get to a fixed one but i hope soon to put an end even to those sort of obligations  small hopes indeed of a reconciliation from your account of my uncles visit to your mamma to set her against an almostfriendless creature whom once he loved but is it not my duty to try for it ought i to widen my error by obstinacy and resentment because of their resentment which must appear reasonable to them as they suppose my flight premeditated and as they are made to believe that i am capable of triumphing in it and over them with the man they hate when i have done all in my power to restore myself to their favor i shall have the less to reproach myself with  these considerations make me waver about following your advice in relation to marriage especially as he is so full of his complaisance with regard to my former conditions which he calls my injunctions and at the same time that they dispose me not to go to any of the ladies of his family whose mediation my friends as you tell me have so strenuously declared against i am ready to fix all my reliance on my cousin morden for i think that if i can be secure in a tolerable state of independence till he comes to england all must then be determined in a better manner than by any other way  yet if i cannot get this man to leave me how shall terms to my friends be proposed  if he do and they should get me back again by force which you think they would attempt but for fear of him how will the severest acts of compulsion which they can have recourse to be justified by my flight from them  and while we are together and unmarried as you observe what censures do i expose myself to  and must i then to save the poor remains of my reputation in the worlds eye watch the gracious motion from this mans lips  i will acquaint you as you desire with all that passes between us hitherto i have not discovered any thing in his behavior that is very exceptionable yet i cannot say that i think the respect he shows me an easy unrestrained and natural respect although i can hardly tell where the fault is  but he has doubtless an arrogant and incroaching spirit nor is he so polite as his education and other advantages might have made one expect him to be he seems in short to be one who has always had too much of his own will to study to accommodate himself to that of others  as to the placing of some confidence in him i shall be as ready to take your advice in this particular as in all others and as he will be to deserve it but tricked away as i was by him not only against my judgment but my inclination can he or anybody expect that i should immediately treat him with complaisance as if i acknowleged obligation to him for carrying me away  if i did must he not either think me a vile dissembler before he gained that point or afterward   indeed indeed my dear i could tear my hair on reconsidering what you write as to the probability that the dreaded wednesday was more dreaded than it needed to be to think that i should be thus tricked by this man and that in all likelihood through his vile agent joseph leman so premeditated and elaborate a wickedness as it must be  must i not with such a man be wanting to myself if i were not jealous and vigilant  yet what a life to live for a spirit so open and naturally so unsuspicious as mine  i am obliged to mr hickman for the assistance he is so kindly ready to give to our correspondence he is so little likely to make to himself an additional merit with the daughter upon it that i shall be very sorry if he risk any thing with the mother by it  i am now in a state of obligation so must rest satisfied with whatever i cannot help  whom have i the power once so precious to me of obliging  what i mean my dear is that i ought perhaps to expect that my influences over you are weakened by my indiscretion nevertheless i will not if i can help it desert myself nor give up the privilege you used to allow me of telling you what i think of any part of your conduct which i may disapprove of  you must permit me therefore severe as your mamma is against an undesigning offender to say that i think your liveliness to her inexcusable  to pass over for this time what nevertheless concerns me not a little the free treatment you almost indiscriminately give my relations  if you will not for your own sake forbear such auntings and impatiency as you repeat to me let me beseech you that you will for mine  since otherwise your mamma may apprehend that my example like a leaven is working itself into the mind of her beloved daughter and may not such an apprehension give her an irreconcilable displeasure against me  i enclose the copy of my letter to my sister which you are desirous to see you will observe that although i have not demanded my estate in form and of my trustees yet that i have hinted at leave to retire to it how joyfully would i keep my word if they would accept of the offer i renew  it was not proper i believe you will think on many accounts to own that i was carried off against my inclination  i am my dearest friend  your everobliged and affectionate cl harlowe  letter ix to miss arabella harlowe enclosed to miss how in the preceding st albans tuesday apr    my dear sister i have i confess been guilty of an action which carries with it a rash and undutiful appearance and i should have thought it an inexcusable one had i been used with less severity than i have been of late and had i not had too great reason to apprehend that i was to be made a sacrifice to a man i could not bear to think of but what is done is done  perhaps i could wish it had not  and that i had trusted to the relenting of my dear and honored parents  yet this from no other motives but those of duty to them  to whom i am ready to return if i may not be permitted to retire to the grove on conditions which i before offered to comply with  nor shall i be in any sort of dependence upon the person by whose means i have taken this truly reluctant step inconsistent with any reasonable engagement i shall enter into if i am not farther precipitated  let me not have it to say now at this important crisis that i have a sister but not a firiend in her my reputation dearer to me than life whatever you may imagine from the step i have taken is suffering a little lenity will even yet in a great measure restore it and make that pass for a temporary misunderstanding only which otherwise will be a stain as durable as life upon a creature who has already been treated with great unkindness to use no harsher a word  for your own sake therefore for my brothers sake who have thus precipitated me i must say it and for all the familys sake aggravate not my fault if on recollecting every thing you think it one nor by widening the unhappy difference expose a sister for ever  prays  your everaffectionate cl harlowe i shall take it for a very great favor to have my clothes directly sent me together with fifty guineas which you will find in my escritoire of which i enclose the key as also the divinity and miscellany classes of my little library and if it be thought fit my jewels  directed for me to be left at mr osgoods near sohosquare  till called for    letter x mr lovelace to john belford esquire mr lovelace in continuation of his last letter no vi gives an account to his friend pretty much to the same effect with the ladys of what passed between them at the inns in the journey and till their fixing at mrs sorlingss to avoid repetition those passages in his account are only extracted which will serve to embellish hers to open his views or to display the humourous talent he was noted for  at their alighting at the inn at st albans on monday night thus he writes    the people who came about us as we alighted seemed by their jawfallen faces and goggling eyes to wonder at beholding a charming young lady majesty in her air and aspect so composedly dressed yet with features so discomposed come off a journey which had made the cattle smoke and the servants sweat i read their curiosity and my beloveds uneasiness she cast a conscious glance as she alighted upon her habit which was no habit and repulsively as i may say quitting my assisting hand hurried into the house as fast as she could  ovid was not a greater master of metamorphoses than thy friend to the mistress of the house i instantly changed her into a sister brought off by surprise from a near relations where she had wintered to prevent her marrying a confounded rake i love always to go as near the truth as i can whom her father and mother her elder sister and all her loving uncles aunts and cousins abhorred this accounted for my charmers expected sullens for her displeasure when she was to join me again were it to hold for her unsuitable dress upon a road and at the same time gave her a proper and seasonable assurance of my honorable views  upon the debate between the lady and him and particularly upon that part where she upbraids him with putting a young creature upon making a sacrifice of her duty and conscience he writes     all these and still more mortifying things she said  i heard her in silence but when it came to my turn i pleaded i argued i answered her as well as i could  and when humility would not do i raised my voice and suffered my eye to sparkle with anger hoping to take advantage of that sweet cowardice which is so amiable in the sex which many of them indeed fantastically affect and to which my victory over this proud beauty is principally owing  she was not intimidated however and was going to rise upon me in her temper and would have broke in upon my defense but when a man talks to a lady upon such subjects let her be ever so much in alt it is strange if he cannot throw out a tub to the whale  if he cannot divert her from resenting one bold thing by uttering two or three full as bold but for which more favorable interpretations will lie  to that part where she tells him of the difficulty she made to correspond with him at first thus he writes    very true my precious  and innumerable have been the difficulties thou have made me struggle with but one day thou may wish that thou had spared this boast as well as those other pretty haughtinesses  that thou did not reject solmes for my sake that my glory if i valued myself upon carrying thee off was thy shame  that i have more merit with myself than with thee or anybody else what a coxcomb she makes me jack that thou wishest thyself in thy fathers house again whatever were to be the consequence  if i forgive thee charmer for these hints for these reflections for these wishes for these contempts i am not the lovelace i have been reputed to be and that thy treatment of me shows that thou think i am   in short her whole air throughout this debate expressed a majestic kind of indignation which implied a believed superiority of talents over the man she spoke to  thou have heard me often expatiate upon the pitiful figure a man must make whose wife has or believes she has more sense than himself a thousand reasons could i give why i ought not to think of marrying miss clarissa harlowe at least till i can be sure that she loves me with the preference i must expect from a wife  i begin to stagger in my resolutions ever averse as i was to the hymeneal shackles how easily will old prejudices recur  heaven give me the heart to be honest to her  there is a prayer jack  if i should not be heard what a sad thing would that be for the most admirable of women  yet as i do not often trouble heaven with my prayers who knows but this may be granted  but there lie before me such charming difficulties such scenery for intrigue for stratagem for enterprise  what a horrible thing that my talents point all that way  when i know what is honorable and just and would almost wish to be honest  almost i say for such a varlet am i that i cannot altogether wish it for the soul of me  such a triumph over the whole sex if i can subdue this lady  my maiden vow as i may call it  for did not the sex begin with me  and does this lady spare me  think thou jack that i should have spared my rosebud had i been set at defiance thus  her grandmother besought me at first to spare her rosebud and when a girl is put or puts herself into a mans power what can he wish for further while i always considered opposition and resistance as a challenge to do my worst see vol i p       0   why why will the dear creature take such pains to appear all ice to me  why will she by her pride awaken mine  have thou not seen in the above how contemptibly she treats me  what have i not suffered for her and even from her  is it tolerable to be told that she will despise me if i value myself above that odious solmes   then she cuts me short in all my ardors to vow fidelity is by a cursed turn upon me to show that there is reason in my own opinion for doubt of it  the very same reflection upon me once before see vol ii p     in my power or out of my power all one to her  so belford my poor vows are crammed down my throat before they can well rise to my lips and what can a lover say to his mistress if she will neither let him lie nor swear  one little piece of artifice i had recourse to when she pushed so hard for me to leave her i made a request to her upon a condition she could not refuse and pretended as much gratitude upon her granting it as if it were a favor of the last consequence  and what was this but to promise what she had before promised never to marry any other man while i am living and single unless i should give her cause for high disgust against me this you know was promising nothing because she could be offended at any time and was to be the sole judge of the offense but it showed her how reasonable and just my expectations were and that i was no encroacher  she consented and asked what security i expected  her word only  she gave me her word but i besought her excuse for sealing it and in the same moment since to have waited for consent would have been asking for a denial saluted her and believe me or not but as i hope to live it was the first time i had the courage to touch her charming lips with mine and this i tell thee belford that that single pressure as modestly put too as if i were as much a virgin as herself that she might not be afraid of me another time delighted me more than ever i was delighted by the ultimatum with any other woman  so precious does awe reverence and apprehended prohibition make a favor  i am only afraid that i shall be too cunning for she does not at present talk enough for me i hardly know what to make of the dear creature yet  i topt the brothers part on monday night before the landlady at st albans asking my sisters pardon for carrying her off so unprepared for a journey prated of the joy my father and mother and all our friends would have on receiving her and this with so many circumstances that i perceived by a look she gave me that went through my very reins that i had gone too far i apologizd for it indeed when alone but i could not penetrate for the soul of me whether i made the matter better or worse by it  but i am of too frank a nature my success and the joy i have because of the jewel i am half in possession of has not only unlocked my bosom but left the door quite open  this is a confounded sly sex would she but speak out as i do  but i must learn reserves of her  she must needs be unprovided of money but has too much pride to accept of any from me i would have her go to town to town if possible must i get her to consent to go in order to provide herself with the richest of silks which that can afford but neither is this to be assented to and yet as my intelligencer acquaints me her implacable relations are resolved to distress her all they can  these wretches have been most gloriously raving it seems ever since her flight and still thank heaven continue to rave and will i hope for a twelvemonth to come  now at last it is my day   bitterly do they regret that they permitted her poultryvisits and gardenwalks which gave her the opportunity they know she had though they could not find out how to concert as they suppose her preconcerted escape for as to her dining in the ivybower they had a cunning design to answer upon her in that permission as betty told joseph her lover see vol ii p  0    they lost they say an excellent pretense for more closely confining her on my threatening to rescue her if they offered to carry her against her will to old antonys moated house see vol ii p                    for this as i told thee at the heart and as i once hinted to the dear creature herself vol ii p      see also p      they had it in deliberation to do apprehending that i might attempt to carry her off either with or without her consent on some one of those connivedat excursions  but here my honest joseph who gave me the information was of admirable service to me i had taught him to make the harlowes believe that i was as communicative to my servants as their stupid james was to joseph vol ii p  00   0   0   joseph as they supposed by tampering with will this will be farther explained in letter xx of this volume  got at all my secrets and was acquainted with all my motions and having undertaken to watch all his young ladys too see vol i p                   the wise family were secure and so was my beloved and so was i  i once had it in my head and i hinted it to thee in a former see vol i p      in case such a step should be necessary to attempt to carry her off by surprise from the woodhouse as it is remote from the dwelling house this had i attempted i should certainly have effected by the help of the confraternity and it would have been an action worthy of us all  but josephs conscience as he called it stood in my way for he thought it must have been known to be done by his connivance i could i dare say have overcome this scruple as easily as i did many of his others had i not depended at one time upon her meeting me at a midnight or late hour when if she had it would have cost me a fall had she gone back at other times upon the cunning familys doing my work for me by driving her into my arms  and then i knew that james and arabella were determined never to leave off their foolish trials and provocations till by tiring her out they had either made her solmess wife or guilty of such a rashness as should throw her for ever out of the favor of both her uncles  letter xi mr lovelace in continuation i obliged the dear creature highly i could perceive by bringing mrs greme to attend her and to suffer that good womans recommendation of lodgings to take place on her refusal to go to the lawn  she must observe that all my views were honorable when i had provided for her no particular lodgings leaving it to her choice whether she would go to m hall to the lawn to london or to either of my aunts  she was visibly pleased with my motion of putting mrs greme into the chaise with her and riding on horseback myself  some people would have been apprehensive of what might pass between her and mrs greme but as all my relations know the justice of my intentions by her i was in no pain on that account especially as i had been always above hypocrisy or wanting to be thought better than i am and indeed what occasion has a man to be an hypocrite who has hitherto found his views upon the sex better answered for his being known to be a rake  why even my beloved here denied not to correspond with me though her friends had taught her to think me one  who then would be trying a new and worse character  and then mrs greme is a pious matron who would not have been biased against the truth on any consideration she used formerly while there were any hopes of my reformation to pray for me she hardly continues the good custom i doubt for her worthy lord makes no scruple occasionally to rave against me to man woman and child as they come in his way he is very undutiful as thou know surely i may say so since all duties are reciprocal but for mrs greme poor woman when my lord has the gout and is at the lawn and the chaplain not to be found she prays by him or reads a chapter to him in the bible or some other good book  was it not therefore right to introduce such a good sort of woman to my beloved and to leave them without reserve to their own talk  and very busy in talk i saw they were as they rode and felt it too  for most charmingly glowed my cheeks  i hope i shall be honest i once more say but as we frail mortals are not our own masters at all times i must endeavor to keep the dear creature unapprehensive until i can get her to our acquaintances in london or to some other safe place there should i in the interim give her the least room for suspicion or offer to restrain her or refuse to leave her at her own will she can make her appeals to strangers and call the country in upon me and perhaps throw herself upon her relations on their own terms and were i now to lose her how unworthy should i be to be the prince and leader of such a confraternity as ours  how unable to look up among men or to show my face among women  as things at present stand she dare not own that she went off against her own consent and i have taken care to make all the implacables believe that she escaped with it  she has received an answer from miss how to the letter written to her from st albans vol ii letter xlvi   whatever are the contents i know not but she was drowned in tears and i am the sufferer  miss how is a charming creature too but confoundedly smart and spiritful i am a good deal afraid of her her mother can hardly keep her in i must continue to play off old antony by my honest joseph upon that mother in order to manage that daughter and oblige my beloved to an absolute dependence upon myself vol i p       mistress how is impatient of contradiction so is miss a young lady who is sensible that she has all the maternal requisites herself to be under maternal control  fine ground for a man of intrigue to build upon  a mother overnotable a daughter oversensible and their hickman who is  overneither but merely a passive   only that i have an object still more desirable   yet how unhappy that these two young ladies lived so near each other and are so well acquainted else how charmingly might i have managed them both  but one man cannot have every woman worth having  pity though  when the man is such a very clever fellow  letter xii mr lovelace in continuation never was there such a pair of scribbling lovers as we  yet perhaps whom it so much concerns to keep from each other what each writes she will not have any thing else to do i would if she would let me i am not reformed enough for a husband  patience is a virtue lord m says slow and sure is another of his sentences if i had not a great deal of that virtue i should not have waited the harlowes own time of ripening into execution my plots upon themselves and upon their goddessdaughter  my beloved has been writing to her saucy friend i believe all that has befallen her and what has passed between us hitherto she will possibly have fine subjects for her pen if she be as minute as i am to thee  i would not be so barbarous as to permit old antony to set goody how against her did i not dread the consequences of the correspondence between the two young ladies so lively the one so vigilant so prudent both who would not wish to outwit such girls and to be able to twirl them round his finger  my charmer has written to her sister for her clothes for some gold and for some of her books what books can tell her more than she knows but i can so she had better study me  she may write she must be obliged to me at last with all her pride miss how will be ready enough indeed to supply her but i question whether she can do it without her mother who is as covetous as the grave and my agents agent antony has already given the mother a hint which will make her jealous of pecuniaries  besides if miss how has money by her i can put her mother upon borrowing it of her  nor blame me jack for contrivances that have their foundation in generosity thou know my spirit and that i should be proud to lay an obligation upon my charmer to the amount of half my estate lord m has more for me than i can ever wish for my predominant passion is girl not gold nor value i this but as it helps me to that and gives me independence  i was forced to put it into the sweet novices head as well for my sake as for hers lest we should be traceable by her direction whither to direct the sending of her clothes if they incline to do her that small piece of justice  if they do i shall begin to dread a reconciliation and must be forced to muse for a contrivance or two to prevent it and to avoid mischief for that as i have told honest joseph leman is a great point with me  thou will think me a sad fellow i doubt  but are not all rakes sad fellows  and thou to thy little power as bad as any if thou do all that is in thy head and in thy heart to do thou art worse than me for i do not i assure thee  i proposed and she consented that her clothes or whatever else her relations should think fit to send her should be directed to thee at thy cousin osgoods  let a special messenger at my charge bring me any letter or portable parcel that shall come  if not portable give me notice of it but thou wilt have no trouble of this sort from her relations i dare be sworn and in this assurance i will leave them i think to act upon their own heads a man would have no more to answer for than needs must  but one thing while i think of it it is of great importance to be attended to  you must hereafter write to me in character as i shall do to you how know we into whose hands our letters may fall it would be a confounded thing to be blown up by a train of ones own laying  another thing remember i have changed my name changed it without an act of parliament robert huntingford it is now continue esquire it is a respectable addition although every sorry fellow assumes it almost to the banishment of the usual traveling one of captain to be left till called for at the posthouse at hertford  upon naming thee she asked thy character i gave thee a better than thou deservest in order to do credit to myself yet i told her that thou were an awkward puppy and this to do credit to thee that she may not if ever she is to see thee expect a cleverer fellow than she will find yet thy apparent aukwardness befriends thee not a little for were thou a sightly varlet people would discover nothing extraordinary in thee when they conversed with thee whereas seeing a bear they are surpised to find in thee anything that is like a man felicitate thyself then upon thy defects which are so evidently thy principal perfections and which occasion thee a distinction thou would otherwise never have  the lodgings we are in at present are not convenient i was so delicate as to find fault with them as communicating with each other because i knew the lady would and told her that were i sure she was safe from pursuit i would leave her in them since such was her earnest desire the devils in it if i dont banish even the shadow of mistrust from her heart she must be an infidel against all reason and appearances if i dont  here are two young likely girls daughters of the widow sorlings that is the name of our landlady  i have only at present admired them in their dairyworks how greedily do the whole sex swallow praise  so pleased was i with the youngest for the elegance of her works that i kissed her and she made me a courtesy for my condescension and blushed and seemed sensible all over encouragingly yet innocently she adjusted her handkerchief and looked toward the door as much as to say she would not tell were i to kiss her again  her elder sister popt upon her the conscious girl blushed again and looked so confounded that i made an excuse for her which gratified both mrs betty said i i have been so much pleased with the neatness of your dairyworks that i could not help saluting your sister you have your share of merit in them i am sure  give me leave   good souls  i like them both  she courtesied too  how i love a grateful temper o that my miss harlowe were but half so acknowleging  i think i must get one of them to attend my charmer when she removes  the mother seems to be a notable woman she had not best however be too notable for were she by suspicion to give a face of difficulty to the matter it would prepare me for a trial with one or both the daughters  allow me a little rhodomontade jack  but really and truly my heart is fixed i can think of no creature breathing of the sex but my gloriana  letter xiii from mr lovelace in continuation this is wednesday the day that i was to have lost my charmer for ever  with what high satisfaction and heartsease can i now sit down and triumph over my men in straw at harloweplace yet it is perhaps best for them that she got off as she did who knows what consequences might have followed upon my attending her in or if she had not met me upon my projected visit followed by my myrmidons  but had i even gone in with her unaccompanyd i think i had but little reason for apprehension for well thou know that the tame spirits which value themselves upon reputation and are held within the skirts of the law by political considerations only may be compared to an infectious spider which will run into his hole the moment one of his threads is touched by a finger that can crush him leaving all his toils defenseless and to be brushed down at the will of the potent invader while a silly fly that has neither courage nor strength to resist no sooner gives notice by its buz and its struggle of its being entangled but out steps the selfcircumscribed tyrant winds round and round the poor insect till he covers it with his bowelspun toils and when so fully secured that it can neither move leg nor wing suspends it as if for a spectacle to be exulted over then stalking to the door of his cell turns about glotes over it at a distance and sometimes advancing sometimes retireing preys at leisure upon its vitals  but now i think of it will not this comparison do as well for the entangled girls as for the tame spirits  better of my conscience  it is but comparing the spider to us brave fellows and it quadrates  whatever our hearts are in our heads will follow begin with spiders with flies with what we will the girl is the center of gravity and we all naturally tend to it  nevertheless to recur i cannot but observe that these tame spirits stand a poor chance in a fairly offensive war with such of us mad fellows as are above all law and scorn to skulk behind the hypocritical screen of reputation  thou know that i never scrupled to throw myself among numbers of adversaries the more the safer one or two no fear will take the part of a single adventurer if not intentionally in fact holding him in while others hold in the principal antagonist to the augmentation of their mutual prowess till both are prevailed upon to compromise or one to absent so that upon the whole the lawbreakers have the advantage of the lawkeepers all the world over at least for a time till they have run to the end of their race  add to this in the question between me and the harlowes that the whole family of them must know that they have injured me  did they not at their own church cluster together like bees when they saw me enter it nor knew they which should venture out first when the service was over  james indeed was not there if he had he would perhaps have endeavored to look valiant but there is a sort of valor in the face which by its overbluster shows fear in the heart just such a face would james harlowes have been had i made them a visit  when i have had such a face and such a heart as that to deal with i have been all calm and serene and left it to the friends of such a one as i have done to the harlowes to do my work for me  i am about mustering up in my memory all that i have ever done that has been thought praiseworthy or but barely tolerable i am afraid thou can not help me to many remembrances of this sort because i never was so bad as since i have known thee  have i not had it in my heart to do some good that thou can remind me of study for me jack i have recollected several instances which i think will tell in  but see if thou can not help me to some which i may have forgot  this i may venture to say that the principal blot in my escutcheon is owing to these girls these confounded girls but for them i could go to church with a good conscience but when i do there they are everywhere does satan spread his snares for me  but now i think of it what if our governors should appoint churches for the women only and others for the men  full as proper i think for the promoting of true piety in both much better than the synagoguelattices as separate boardingschools for their education  there are already male and female dedications o churches  st swithins st stephens st thomass st georges and so forth might be appropriated to the men and the santa katharinas santa annas santa marias santa margarettas for the women  yet were it so and life to be the forfeiture of being found at the female churches i believe i should like a second clodius change my dress to come at my portia or calpurnia though one the daughter of a cato the other the wife of a caesar  but how i excurse  yet thou usedst to say thou likedst my excursions if thou do thou wilt have enough of them for i never had a subject i so much adored and with which i shall probably be compelled to have so much patience before i strike the blow if the blow i do strike  but let me call myself back to my recordationsubject  thou need not to remind me of my rosebud i have her in my head and moreover have contrived to give my fairone an hint of that affair by the agency of honest joseph leman see vol ii p                   although i have not reaped the hopedfor credit of her acknowlegement   that is the devil and it was always my hard fate  every thing i do that is good is but as i ought  every thing of a contrary nature is brought into the most glaring light against me  is this fair ought not a balance to be struck and the credit carried to my account  yet i must own too that i half grudge johnny this blooming maiden for in truth i think a fine woman too rich a jewel to hang about a poor mans neck  surely jack if i am in a fault in my universal adorations of the sex the women in general ought to love me the better for it  and so they do i thank them heartily except here and there a covetous little rogue comes cross me who under the pretense of loving virtue for its own sake wants to have me all to herself   i have rambled enough   adieu for the present  letter xiv miss clarissa harlowe to miss how thursday night april    i always loved writing and my unhappy situation gives me now enough of it and you i fear too much  i have had another very warm debate with mr lovelace it brought on the subject which you advised me not to decline when it handsomely offered and i want to have either your acquittal or blame for having suffered it to go off without effect  the impatient wretch sent up to me several times while i was writing my last to you to desire my company yet his business nothing particular only to hea him talk the man seems pleased with his own volubility and whenever he has collected together abundance of smooth things he wants me to find ears for them  yet he need not for i dont often gratify him either with giving him the praise or showing the pleasure in his verboseness that he would be fond of  when i had dispatched the letter and given it t mr hickmans friend i was going up again but h besought me to stop and hear what he had to say  nothing as i said to any new purpose  but complainings and those in a manner and with an air a i thought that bordered upon insolence  he could not live he told me unless he had more of my company and of my indulgence too than i had yet give him  hereupon i stepped into the parlour not a little out o humor with him and the more as he has very quietly taken up his quarters here without talking o removing  we began presently our angry conference h provoked me and i repeated several of the plaine things i had said before and particularly told hi that i was every hour more and more dissatisfied wit myself and with him that he was not a man who in my opinion improved upon acquaintance and that i should not be easy till he had left me to myself  he might be surprised at my warmth perhaps  but really the man looked so like a simpleton hesitating and having nothing to say for himself or that should excuse the peremptoriness of his demand upon me when he knew i was writing a letter which a gentleman waited for that i flung from him declareing that i would be mistress of my own time and of my own actions without being called to account for either  he was very uneasy till he could again be admitted into my company and when i was obliged to see him which was sooner than i liked never did man put on a more humble and respectful demeanor  he told me that he had upon this occasion been entering into himself and had found a great deal of reason to blame himself for an impatiency and inconsideration which although he meant nothing by it must be very disagreeable to one of my delicacy that having always aimed at a manly sincerity and openness of heart he had not till now discovered that both were very consistent with that true politeness which he feared he had too much disregarded while he sought to avoid the contrary extreme knowing that in me he had to deal with a lady who despised an hypocrite and who was above all flattery but from this time forth i should find such an alteration in his whole behavior as might be expected from a man who knew himself to be honored with the presence and conversation of a person who had the most delicate mind in the world  that was his flourish  i said that he might perhaps expect congratulation upon the discovery he had just now made that true politeness and sincerity were very compatible but that i who had by a perverse fate been thrown into his company had abundant reason for regret that he had not sooner found this out  since i believed very few men of birth and education were strangers to it  he knew not neither he said that he had so badly behaved himself as to deserve so very severe a rebuke  perhaps not but he might if so make another discovery from what i had said which might be to my own disadvantage since if he had so much reason to be satisfied with himself he would see what an ungenerous person he spoke to who when he seemed to give himself airs of humility which perhaps he thought beneath him to assume had not the civility to make him a compliment upon them but was ready to take him at his word  he had long with infinite pleasure the pretended flatteryhater said admired my superior talents and a wisdom in so young a lady perfectly surprising  lady he calls me at every word perhaps in compliment to himself as i endeavor to repeat his words with exactness you will be pleased once for all to excuse me for repeating this i have no title to it and i am sure i am too much mortified at present to take any pride in that or any other of his compliments  let him stand ever so low in my opinion he said he should believe all were just and that he had nothing to do but to govern himself for the future by my example and by the standard i should be pleased to give him  i told him i knew better than to value myself upon his volubility of speech as he pretended to pay so preferable a regard to sincerity he should confine himself to the strict rules of truth when he spoke of me to myself and then although he should be so kind as to imagine he had reason to make me a compliment he would have much more to pride himself in his arts that had made so extraordinary a young creature so great a fool   really my dear the man deserves not politer treatment  and then has he not made a fool an egregious fool of me  i am afraid he thinks so himself   he was surpised he was amazed at so strange a turn upon him  he was very unhappy that nothing he could do or say would give me a good opinion of him he wished i would let him know what he could do to obtain my confidence   i told him i desired his absence of all things i saw not that my friends thought it worth their while to give me disturbance therefore if he would set out for london or berkshire or whither he pleased it would be most agreeable to me and most reputable too  he would do so he said he intended to do so the moment i was in a place to my liking  in a place convenient for me  this would be so i told him when he was not here to break in upon me and make the apartments inconvenient  he did not think this place safe and as i had not had thoughts of staying here he had not been so solicitous as otherwise he should have been to injoin privacy to his servants nor to mrs greme at her leaving me and there were two or three gentlemen in the neighborhood he said with whose servants his gossiping rascals had scraped acquaintance so that he could not think of leaving me here unguarded and unattended  but fix upon any place in england where i could be out of danger and undiscovered and he would go to the furthermost part of the kings dominions if by doing so he could make me easy  i told him plainly that i should never be in humor with myself for meeting him nor with him for seducing me away that my regrets increased instead of diminished that my reputation was wounded that nothing i could do would now retrieve it and that he must not wonder if i every hour grew more and more uneasy both with myself and him that upon the whole i was willing to take care of myself and when he had left me i should best know what to resolve upon and whither to go  he wished he said he were at liberty without giving me offense or being thought to intend to infringe upon the articles that i had stipulated and insisted upon to make one humble proposal to me  but the sacred regard he was determined to pay to all my injunctions reluctantly as i had on monday last put it into his power to serve me would not permit him to make it unless i would promise to excuse him if i did not approve of it  i asked in some confusion what he would say  he prefaced and paraded on and then out came with great diffidence and many apologies and a bashfulness which sat very aukwardly upon him a proposal of speedy solemnization which he said would put all right would make my first three or four months which otherwise must be passed in obscurity and apprehension a round of visits and visitings to and from all his relations to miss how to whom i pleased and would pave the way to the reconciliation i had so much at heart  your advice had great weight with me just then as well as his reasons and the consideration of my unhappy situation but what could i say i wanted somebody to speak for me i could not all at once act as if i thought that all punctilio was at an end i was unwilling to suppose it was so soon  the man saw i was not angry at his motion i only blushed up to the ears that i am sure i did looked silly and like a fool  he wants not courage would he have had me catch at his first at his very first word  i was silent too  and do not the bold sex take silence for a mark of favor  then so lately in my fathers house having also declared to him in my letters before i had your advice that i would not think of marriage till he had passed through a state of probation as i may call it  how was it possible i could encourage with very ready signs of approbation such an early proposal especially so soon after the free treatment he had provoked from me  if i were to die i could not  he looked at me with great confidence as if notwithstanding his contradictory bashfulness he would look me through while my eye but nowandthen could glance at him he begged my pardon with great obsequiousness he was afraid i would think he deserved no other answer but that of a contemptuous silence true love was fearful of offending  take care lovelace thought i how yours is tried by that rule indeed so sacred a regard foolish man would he have to all my declarations made before i honored him   i would hear him no further but withdrew in too visible confusion and left him to make his nonsensical flourishes to himself  i will only add that if he really wishes for a speedy solemnization he never could have had a luckier time to press for my consent to it but he let it go off and indignation has taken place of it and now it shall be my point to get him at a distance from me  i am my dearest friend  your ever faithful and obliged servant cl h  letter xv mr lovelace to john belford esquire what can be done with a woman who is above flattery and despises all praise but that which flows from the approbation of her own heart  but why will this admirable creature urge her destiny why will she defy the power she is absosutely dependent upon  why will she still wish to my face that she had never left her fathers house  why will she deny me her company till she makes me lose my patience and lay myself open to her resentment  and why when she is offended does she carry her indignation to the utmost length that a scornful beauty in the very height of her power and pride can go  is it prudent think thou in her circumstances to tell me repeatedly to tell me that she is every hour more and more dissatisfied with herself and me that i am not one who improve upon her in my conversation and address couldst thou jack bear this from a captive that she shall not be easy while she is with me that she was thrown upon me by a perverse sat that she knew better than to value herself upon my volubility that if i thought she deserved the compliments i made her i might pride myself in my arts which had made a fool of so extraordinary a person that she should never forgive herself for meeting me nor me for seducing her away her very words that her regrets increase instead of diminish that she would take care of herself and since her friends thought it not worth while to pursue her she would be left to that care that i should make mrs sorlingss house more agreeable by my absence  and go to berks to town or wherever i would to the devil i suppose with all her heart  the impolitic charmer  to a temper so vindictive as she thinks mine to a freeliver as she believes me to be who has her in his power  i was before as thou know balancing now this scale now that the heaviest i only waited to see how her will would work how mine would lead me on thou see what biass hers takes  and will thou doubt that mine will be determined by it  were not her faults before this numerous enough  why will she put me upon looking back   i will sit down to argue with myself byandby and thou shall be acquainted with the result  if thou knew if thou but beheldest the abject slave she made me look like  i had given myself high airs as she called them but they were airs that showed my love for her that showed i could not live out of her company but she took me down with a vengeance she made me look about me so much advantage had she over me such severe turns upon me by my soul jack i had hardly a word to say for myself i am ashamed to tell thee what a poor creature she made me look like  but i could have told her something that would have humbled her pretty pride at the instant had she been in a proper place and proper company about her  to such a place then  and where she cannot fly me  and then to see how my will works and what can be done by the amorous seesaw now humble now proud now expecting or demanding now submitting or acquiescing  till i have tired resistance but these hints are at present enough  i may further explain myself as i go along and as i confirm or recede in my future motions  if she will revive past disobligations  if she will  but no more  no more as i said at present of threatenings  letter xvi mr lovelace in continuation and do i not see that i shall need nothing but patience in order to have all power with me for what shall we say if all these complaints of a character wounded these declarations of increasing regrets for meeting me of resentments never to be got over for my seducing her away these angry commands to leave her  what shall we say if all were to mean nothing but matrimony  and what if my forbearing to enter upon that subject come out to be the true cause of her petulance and uneasiness  i had once before played about the skirts of the irrevocable obligation but thought myself obliged to speak in clouds and to run away from the subject as soon as she took my meaning lest she should imagine it to be ungenerously urged now she was in some sort in my power as she had forbid me beforehand to touch upon it till i were in a state of visible reformation and till a reconciliation with her friends were probable but now outargued outtalented and pushed so vehemently to leave one whom i had no good pretense to hold if she would go and who could so easily if i had given her cause to doubt have thrown herself into other protection or have returned to harloweplace and solmes i spoke out upon the subject and offered reasons although with infinite doubt and hesitation  lest she should be offended at me belford why she should assent to the legal tie and make me the happiest of men and o how the mantled cheek the downcast eye the silent yet trembling lip and the heaving bosom a sweet collection of heightened beauties gave evidence that the tender was not mortally offensive  charming creature thought i but i charge thee that thou let not any of the sex know my exultation is it so soon come to this  am i already lord of the destiny of a clarissa harlowe  am i already the reformed man thou resolvedst i should be before i had the least encouragement given me is it thus that the more thou know me the less thou see reason to approve of we  and can art and design enter into a breast so celestial to banish me from thee to insist so rigorously upon my absence in order to bring me closer to thee and make the blessing dear  well do thy arts justify mine and encourage me to let loose my plotting genius upon thee  but let me tell thee charming maid if thy wishes are at all to be answered that thou have yet to account to me for thy reluctance to go off with me at a crisis when thy going off was necessary to avoid being forced into the nuptial fetters with a wretch that were he not thy aversion thou were no more honest to thy own merit than to me  i am accustomed to be preferred let me tell thee by thy equals in rank too though thy inferiors in merit but who is not so and shall i marry a woman who has given me reason to doubt the preference she has for me  no my dearest love  i have too sacred a regard for thy injunctions to let them be broke through even by thyself nor will i takein thy full meaning by blushing silence only nor shall thou give me room to doubt whether it be necessity or love that inspires this condescending impulse  upon these principles what had i to do but to construe her silence into contemptuous displeasure and i begged her pardon for making a motion which i had so much reason to fear would offend her for the future i would pay a sacred regard to her previous injunctions and prove to her by all my conduct the truth of that observation that true love is always fearful of offending   and what could the lady say to this methinks thou ask  say  why she looked vexed disconcerted teased was at a loss as i thought whether to be more angry with herself or me she turned about however as if to hide a starting tear and drew a sigh into two or three but just audible quavers trying to suppress it and withdrew leaving me master of the field  tell me not of politeness tell me not of generosity tell me not of compassion  is she not a match for me more than a match does she not outdo me at every fair weapon has she not made me doubt her love has she not taken officious pains to declare that she was not averse to solmes for any respect she had to me and her sorrow for putting herself out of his reach that is to say for meeting me  then what a triumph would it be to the harlowe pride were i now to marry this lady  a family beneath my own  no one in it worthy of an alliance with but her  my own estate not contemptible  living within the bounds of it to avoid dependence upon their betters and obliged to no man living  my expectations still so much more considerable  my person my talents  not to be despised surely  yet rejected by them with scorn  obliged to carry on an underhand address to their daughter when two of the most considerable families in the kingdom have made overtures which i have declined partly for her sake and partly because i never will marry if she be not the person to be forced to steal her away not only from them but from herself  and must i be brought to implore forgiveness and reconciliation from the harlowes  beg to be acknowleged as the son of a gloomy tyrant whose only boast is his riches as a brother to a wretch who has conceived immortal hatred to me and to a sister who was beneath my attempts or i would have had her in my own way and that with a tenth part of the trouble and pains that her sister whom she has so barbarously insulted has cost me yet not a step advanced with her and finally as a nephew to uncles who valuing themselves upon their acquired fortunes would insult me as creeping to them on that account  forbid it the blood of the lovelaces that your last and let me say not the meanest of your stock should thus creep thus fawn thus lick the dust for a wife   proceed anon  letter xvii from mr lovelace in continuation but is it not the divine clarissa harlowe let me not say my soul spurns them all but her whom i am thus by implication threatening  if virtue be the true nobility how is she ennobled and how would an alliance with her ennoble were there no drawbacks from the family she is sprung from and prefers to me  but again let me stop  is there not something wrong has there not been something wrong in this divine creature  and will not the reflections upon that wrong what though it may be construed in my favor make me unhappy when novelty has lost its charms and she is mind and person all my own  libertines are nicer if at all nice than other men they seldom meet with the stand of virtue in the women whom they attempt and by those they have met with they judge of all the rest importunity and opportunity no woman is proof against especially from a persevering lover who knows how to suit temptations to inclinations this thou know is a prime article of the rakes creed  and what methinks thou ask with surprise do thou question this most admirable of women  the virtue of a clarissa do thou question  i do not i dare not question it my reverence for her will not let me directly question it but let me in my turn ask thee  is not may not her virtue be founded rather in pride than principle  whose daughter is she  and is she not a daughter if impeccable how came she by her impeccability  the pride of setting an example to her sex has run away with her hitherto and may have made her till now invincible  but is not that pride abated  what may not both men and women be brought to do in a mortified state what mind is superior to calamity  pride is perhaps the principal bulwark of female virtue humble a woman and may she not be effectually humbled  then who says miss clarissa harlowe is the paragon of virtue is virtue itself  all who know her and have heard of her it will be answered  common bruit  is virtue to be established by common bruit only  has her virtue ever been proved  who has dared to try her virtue  i told thee i would sit down to argue with myself and i have drawn myself into the argumentation before i was aware  let me enter into a strict discussion of this subject  i know how ungenerous an appearance what i have said and what i have farther to say on this topic will have from me but am i not bringing virtue to the touchstone with a view to exalt it if it come out to be virtue  avaunt then for one moment all consideration that may arise from a weakness which some would miscall gratitude and is oftentimes the corrupter of a heart not ignoble  to the test then and i will bring this charming creature to the strictest test that all the sex who may be shown any passages in my letters and i know thou chearest the hearts of all thy acquaintance with such detached parts of mine as tend not to dishonor characters or reveal names and this gives me an appetite to oblige thee by interlardment that all the sex i say may see what they ought to be what is expected from them and if they have to deal with a person of reflection and punctilio  pride if thou wilt how careful they ought to be by a regular and uniform conduct not to give him cause to think lightly of them by favors granted which may be interpreted into natural weakness for is not a wife the keeper of a mans honor and do not her faults bring more disgrace upon a husband than even upon herself  it is not for nothing jack that i have disliked the life of shackles   to the test then as i said since now i have the question brought home to me whether i am to have a wife and whether she be to be a wife at the first or at the second hand  i will proceed fairly i will do the dear creature not only strict but generous justice for i will try her by her own judgment as well as by our principles  she blames herself for having corresponded with me a man of free character and one indeed whose first view it was to draw her into this correspondence and who succeeded in it by means unknown to herself  now what were her inducements to this correspondence  if not what her niceness makes her think blameworthy why does she blame herself  has she been capable of error  of persisting in that error  whoever was the tempter that is not the thing nor what the temptation the fact the error is now before us  did she persist in it against parental prohibition  she owns she did  was there ever known to be a daughter who had higher notions of the filial duty of the parental authority  never  what must be those inducements how strong that were too strong for duty in a daughter so dutiful  what must my thought have been of them what my hopes built upon them at the time taken in this light  well but it will be said that her principal view was to prevent mischief between her brother and her other friends and the man vilely insulted by them all  but why should she be more concerned for the safety of others than they were for their own  and had not the rencounter then happened  was a person of virtue to be prevailed upon to break through her apparent her acknowleged duty upon any consideration  much less was she to be so prevailed upon to prevent an apprehended evil only  thou lovelace the tempter thou wilt again break out and say to be the accuser  but i am not the accuser i am an arguer only and in my heart all the time acquit and worship the divine creature but let me nevertheless examine whether the acquittal be owing to her merit or to my weakness the true name for love  but shall we suppose another motive  and that is love a motive which all the world will excuse her for  but let me tell all the world that do not because they ought but because all the world is apt to be misled by it  let love then be the motive  love of whom  a lovelace is the answer  is there but one lovelace in the world  may not more lovelaces be attracted by so fine a figure by such exalted qualities  it was her character that drew me to her and it was her beauty and good sense that rivetted my chains and now all together make me think her a subject worthy of my attempts worthy of my ambition  but has she had the candor the openness to acknowledge that love  she has not  well then if love it be at bottom is there not another vice lurking beneath the shadow of that love  has she not affectation  or is it pride of heart  and what results  is then the divine clarissa harlowe capable of loving a man whom she ought not to love  and is she capable of affectation and is her virtue founded in pride  and if this answer be affirmative must she not then be a woman  and can she keep this lover at bay  can she make him who has been accustomed to triumph over other women tremble  can she so conduct herself as to make him at times question whether she loves him or any man yet not have the requisite command over the passion itself in steps of the highest consequence to her honor as she thinks i am trying her jack by her own thoughts  but suffer herself to be provoked to promise to abandon her fathers house and go off with him knowing his character and even conditioning not to marry till improbable and remote contingencies were to come to pass  what though the provocations were such as would justify any other woman yet was a clarissa to be susceptible to provocations which she thinks herself highly censurable for being so much moved by  but let us see the dear creature resolving to revoke her promise yet meeting her lover a bold and intrepid man who was more than once before disappointed by her and who comes as she must think prepared to expect the fruits of her appointment and resolved to carry her off  and let us see him actually carrying her off and having her at his mercy  may there not be i repeat other lovelaces other like intrepid persevering enterprizers although they may not go to work in the same way  and has then a clarissa herself her judge failed  in such great points failed  and may she not further fail  fail in the greatest point to which all the other points in which she has failed have but a natural tendency  nor say thou that virtue in the eye of heaven is as much a manly as a womanly grace by virtue in this place i mean chastity and to be superior to temptation my clarissa out of the question nor ask thou shall the man be guilty yet expect the woman to be guiltless and even unsuspectable  urge thou not these arguments i say since the wife by a failure may do much more injury to the husband than the husband can do to the wife and not only to her husband but to all his family by obtruding another mans children into his possessions perhaps to the exclusion of at least to a participation with his own he believing them all the time to be his in the eye of heaven therefore the sin cannot be equal besides i have read in some place that the woman was made for the man not the man for the woman virtue then is less to be dispensed with in the woman than in the man  thou lovelace methinks some better man than thyself will say to expect such perfection in a woman   yes i may i answer was not the great caesar a great rake as to women  was he not called by his very soldiers on one of his triumphant entries into rome the baldpated lecher  and warning given of him to the wives as well as to the daughters of his fellowcitizens  yet did not caesar repudiate his wife for being only in company with clodius or rather because clodius though by surprise upon her was found in hers and what was the reason he gave for it  it was this though a rake himself as i have said and only this  the wife of caesar must not be suspected   caesar was not a prouder man than lovelace   go to then jack nor say nor let anybody say in thy hearing that lovelace a man valuing himself upon his ancestry is singular in his expectations of a wifes purity though not pure himself  as to my clarissa i own that i hardly think there ever was such an angel of a woman but has she not as above already taken steps which she herself condemns steps which the world and her own family did not think her capable of taking  and for which her own family will not forgive her  nor think it strange that i refuse to hear any thing pleaded in behalf of a standard virtue from high provocations  are not provocations and temptations the tests of virtue  a standard virtue must not be allowed to be provoked to destroy or annihilate itself  may not then the success of him who could carry her thus far be allowed to be an encouragement for him to try to carry her farther  it is but to try jack  who will be afraid of a trial for this divine lady  thou know that i have more than once twice or thrice been tempted to make this trial upon young ladies of name and character but never yet found one of them to hold me out for a month nor so long as could puzzle my invention i have concluded against the whole sex upon it and now if i have not found a virtue that cannot be corrupted i will swear that there is not one such in the whole sex is not then the whole sex concerned that this trial should be made  and who is it that knows her that would not stake upon her head the honor of the whole  let her who would refuse it come forth and desire to stand in her place  i must assure thee that i have a prodigious high opinion of virtue as i have of all those graces and excellencies which i have not been able to attain myself  every free liver would not say this nor think thus  every argument he uses condemnatory of his own actions as some would think  but ingenuity was ever a signal part of my character  satan whom thou may if thou will in this case call my instigator put the good man of old upon the severest trials  to his behavior under these trials that good man owed his honor and his future rewards an innocent person if doubted must wish to be brought to a fair and candid trial  rinaldo indeed in ariosto put the mantuan knights cup of trial from him which was to be the proof of his wifes chastity the story is that whoever drank of this cup if his wife were chaste could drink without spilling if otherwise the contrary see ariostos orlando furioso book xliii  this was his argument for forbearing the experiment why should i seek a thing i should be loath to find my wife is a woman the sex is frail i cannot believe better of her than i do it will be to my own loss if i find reason to think worse but rinaldo would not have refused the trial of the lady before she became his wife and when he might have availed himself by detecting her  for my part i would not have put the cup from me though married had it been but in hope of finding reason to confirm my good opinion of my wifes honor and that i might know whether i had a snake or a dove in my bosom  to my point  what must that virtue be which will not stand a trial  what that woman who would wish to shun it  well then a trial seems necessary for the further establishment of the honor of so excellent a creature  and who shall put her to this trial  who but the man who has as she thinks already induced her in lesser points to swerve  and this for her own sake in a double sense  not only as he has been able to make some impression but as she regrets the impression made and so may be presumed to be guarded against his further attempts  the situation she is at present in it must be confessed is a disadvantageous one to her but if she overcome that will redound to her honor  shun not therefore my dear soul further trials nor hate me for making them  for what woman can be said to be virtuous till she has been tried  nor is one effort one trial to be sufficient why because a womans heart may be at one time adamant at another wax  as i have often experienced and so no doubt have thou  a fine time on it methinks thou say would the women have if they were all to be tried  but jack i am not for that neither though i am a rake i am not a rakes friend except thine and companys  and be this one of the morals of my tedious discussion  let the little rogues who would not be put to the question as i may call it choose accordingly  let them prefer to their favor good honest sober fellows who have not been used to play dogs tricks who will be willing to take them as they offer and who being tolerable themselves are not suspicious of others  but what methinks thou ask is to become of the lady if she fail  what  why will she not if once subdued be always subdued another of our libertine maxims  and what an immense pleasure to a marriagehater what rapture to thought to be able to prevail upon such a lady as miss clarissa harlowe to live with him without real change of name  but if she resist  if nobly she stand her trial   why then i will marry her to be sure and bless my stars for such an angel of a wife  but will she not hate thee  will she not refuse   no no jack  circumstanced and situated as we are i am not afraid of that  and hate me  why should she hate the man who loves her upon proof   and then for a little hint at reprizal  am i not justified in my resolutions of trying her virtue who is resolved as i may say to try mine  who has declared that she will not marry me till she has hopes of my reformation  and now to put an end to this sober argumentation will thou not thyself whom i have supposed an advocate for the lady because i know that lord m has put thee upon using the interest he thinks thou have in me to persuade me to enter the pale will thou not thyself allow me to try if i cannot awaken the woman in her  to try if she with all that glowing symmetry of parts and that full bloom of vernal graces by which she attracts every eye be really inflexible as to the grand article  let me begin then as opportunity presents  i will  and watch her every step to find one sliding one her every moment to find the moment critical and the rather as she spares not me but takes every advantage that offers to puzzle and plague me nor expects nor thinks me to be a good man if she be a woman and love me i shall surely catch her once tripping for love was ever a traitor to its harbourer and love within and i without she will be more than woman as the poet says or i less than man if i succeed not  now belford all is out the lady is mine shall be more mine  marriage i see is in my power now she is so else perhaps it had not if i can have her without who can blame me for trying if not great will be her glory and my future confidence  and well will she merit the sacrifice i shall make her of my liberty and from all her sex honors next to divine for giving a proof that there was once a woman whose virtue no trials no stratagems no temptations even from the man she hated not could overpower  now will thou see all my circulation as in a glass will thou see it  cabala however is the word this word whenever used by any of these gentlemen was agreed to imply an inviolable secret  nor let the secret escape thee even in thy dreams  nobody doubts that she is to be my wife let her pass for such when i give the word meantime reformation shall be my stalkinghorse some one of the women in london if i can get her thither my bird  and so much for this time  letter xviii miss how to miss clarissa harlowe in answer to letters viiixiv dont be so much concerned my dearest friend at the bickerings between my mamma and me we love one another dearly notwithstanding if my mamma had not me to find fault with she must find fault with somebody else and as to me i am a very saucy girl and were there not this occasion there would be some other to show it  you have heard me say that this was always the case between us  you could not otherwise have known it for when you was with us you harmonized us both and indeed i was always more afraid of you than of my mamma but then that awe is accompanied with love your reproofs as i have always found are so charmingly mild and instructive so evidently calculated to improve and not to provoke that a generous temper must be amended by them  but here now mind my mamma when you are not with us  you shall i tell you nancy  i will have it so  dont i know best  i will not be disobeyed  how can a daughter of spirit bear such language such looks too with the language and not have a longing mind to disobey  dont advise me my dear to obey my mamma in her prohibition of corresponding with you she has no reason for it nor would she of her own judgment have prohibited me that odd old ambling soul your uncle whose visits are frequenter than ever instigated by your malicious and selfish brother and sister is the occasion and they only have borrowed my mammas lips at the distance they are from you for a sort of speakingtrumpet for them the prohibition once more i say cannot come from her heart but if it did is so much danger to be apprehended from my ntinuing to write to one of my own sex as if i wrote to one of the other dont let dejection and disappointment and the course of oppression which you have run through weaken your mind my dearest creature and make you see inconveniences where there possibly cannot be any if your talent is scribbling as you call it so is mine  and i will scribble on at all opportunities and to you let em say what they will  nor let your letters be filled with the selfaccusations you mention there is no cause for them  i wish that your anna how who continues in her mothers house were but half so good as miss clarissa harlowe who has been driven out of her fathers  i will say nothing upon your letter to your sister till i see the effect it will have you hope you tell me that you shall have your money and clothes sent you notwithstanding what i write of my opinion to the contrary  i am sorry to have it to acquaint you that i have just now heard that they have sat in council upon your letter and that your mamma was the only person who was for sending you your things and was overruled i charge you therefore to accept of my offer as by my last and give me particular directions for what you want that i can supply you with besides  dont set your thoughts so much upon a reconciliation as to prevent your laying hold of any handsome opportunity to give yourself a protector such a one as the man will be who i imagine husbandlike will let nobody insult you but himself  what could he mean by letting slip such a one as that you mention  i dont know how to blame you neither how could you go beyond silence and blushes when the foolish fellow came with his observances of the restrictions which you laid him under when in another situation but as i told you above you really strike people into awe and upon my word you did not spare him  i repeat what i said in my last that you have a very nice part to act and i will add that you have a mind that is much too delicate for your part but when the lover is exalted the lady must be humbled he is naturally proud and saucy i doubt you must engage his pride which he calls his honor and that you must throw off a little more of the veil and i would have you restrain your wishes before him that you had not met him and the like  what signifies wishing my dear  he will not bear it you can hardly expect that he will  nevertheless it vexes me to the very bottom of my pride that any wretch of that sex should have such a triumph over such a lady  i cannot however but say that i am charmed with your spirit so much sweetness where sweetness is requisite so much spirit where spirit is called for  what a true magnanimity  but i doubt in your present circumstances you must endeavor after a little more of the reserve and palliate a little  that humility which he puts on when you rise upon him is not natural to him  methinks i see the man hesitating and looking like the fool you paint him under your corrective superiority  but he is not a fool dont put him upon mingling resentment with his love  you are very serious my dear in the first of the two letters before me in relation to mr hickman and me and in relation to my mamma and me but as to the latter you must not be too grave if we are not well together at one time we are not ill together at another  and while i am able to make my mamma smile in the midst of the most angry fit she ever fell into on the present occasion though sometimes she would not if she could help it it is a very good sign  a sign that displeasure can never go deep or be lasting and then a kind word or kind look to her favorite hickman sets the one in raptures and the other in tolerable humor at any time  but your case pains me at heart and with all my levity they must both sometimes partake of that pain which must continue as long as you are in a state of uncertainty and especially as i was not able to prevail for that protection for you which would have prevented the unhappy step the necessity for which we both with so much reason deplore  i have only to add and yet that is needless to tell you that i am and will ever be  your affectionate friend and servant anna how  letter xix miss clarissa harlowe to miss how you tell me my dear that my clothes and the little matter of money i left behind me will not be sent me  but i will still hope it is yet early days when their passions subside they will better consider of it and especially as i have my ever dear and excellent mamma for my friend in this request  o the sweet indulgence how has my heart bled and how does it still bleed for her  you advise me not to depend upon a reconciliation i do not depend upon it i cannot but nevertheless it is the wish next my heart and as to this man what can i do you see that marriage is not absolutely in my own power if i were inclined to prefer it to the trial which i think i ought to have principally in view to make for a reconciliation  you say he is proud and insolent indeed he is but can it be your opinion that he intends to humble me down to the level of his mean pride  and what mean you my dear friend when you say that i must throw off a little more of the veil  indeed i never knew that i wore one let me assure you that if i see any thing in mr lovelace that looks like a design to humble me his insolence shall never make me discover a weakness unworthy of a person distinguished by your friendship that is to say unworthy either of my sex or of my former self  but i hope as i am out of all other protection that he is not capable of mean or low resentments what extraordinary trouble i have given him may he not thank himself for  his character which as i have told him gave pretense to my brothers antipathy he may lay it to if he pleases  and did i ever make him any promises did i ever profess a love for him  did i ever wish for the continuance of his address  had not my brothers violence preipitated matters would not my indifference to him in all likelihood as i designed it should have tired out his proud spirit see vol i p     and made him set out for london where he used chiefly to reside and if he ad would there not have been an end of all his presions and hopes for no encouragement had i en him nor did i then correspond with him or believe me should i have begun to do so  the fatal rencounter not having then happened which drew me in afterward for others sakes fool that i was and not for my own and can you think or can he that even this but temporarilyintended correspondence which by the way my dear mamma connived at see vol i p     would have ended thus had i not been driven on one hand and teazed on the other to continue it the occasion which had at first induced it continuing what pretense then has he were i to be absolutely in his power to avenge himself on me for the faults of others and through which i have suffered more than he it cannot cannot be that i should have cause to apprehend him to be so ungenerous so bad a man  you bid me not be concerned at the bickerings between your mamma and you can i avoid concern when those bickerings are on my account  that they are raised by my uncle and my other relations surely must add to my concern  but i must observe perhaps too critically for the state my mind is in at present that the very sentences you give from your mamma as so many imperatives which you take amiss are very severe reflections upon yourself  for instance  you shall i tell you nancy implies that you had disputed her will  and so of the rest  and further let me observe with respect to what you say that there cannot be the same reason for a prohibition of correspondence with me as there was of mine with mr lovelace that i thought as little of bad consequences from him at the time as you can do from me but if obedience be a duty the breach of it is the fault however circumstances may differ surely there is no merit in setting up our own judgments against the judgments of our parents and if it be punishable so to do i have been severely punished and that is what i warned you of from my own example  yet god forgive me i advise thus against myself with very great reluctance and to say truth have not strength of mind at present to decline it myself  but if the occasion go not off i will take it into farther consideration  you give me very good advice in relation to this man and i thank you for it  when you bid me be more upon the reserve with him perhaps i may try for it but to palliate as you call it that cannot be done by my dearest miss how  your own clarissa harlowe  letter xx miss clarissa harlowe to miss how you may believe my dear miss how that the circumstance of the noise and outcry within the gardendoor on monday last gave me no small uneasiness to think that i was in the hands of a man who could by such vile premeditation lay a snare to trick me out of myself as i have so frequently called it  whenever he came in my sight the thought of this gave me an indignation that made his presence disgustful to me and the more as i fancied i beheld in his face a triumph which reproached my weakness on that account although perhaps it was only the same vivacity and placidness that generally fit upon his features  i was resolved to task him upon this subject the first time i could have patience to enter upon it with him for besides that it piqued me excessively from the nature of the artifice i expected shuffling and evasion if he were guilty that would have incensed me and if not confessedly guilty such unsatisfactory declarations as still would have kept my mind doubtful and uneasy and would upon every new offense that he might give me sharpen my disgusts to him  i have had the opportunity i waited for and will lay before you the result  he was making his court to my good opinion in very polite terms and with great seriousness lamenting that he had lost it declaring that he knew not how he had deserved to do so attributing to me a prejudice at least an indifference to him that seemed to his infinite concern hourly to increase and he besought me to let him know my whole mind that he might have an opportunity either to confess his faults and amend them or to clear his conduct to my satisfaction and thereby entitle himself to a greater share of my confidence  i answered him with quickness  then mr lovelace i will tell you one thing with a frankness that is perhaps more suitable to my character than to yours he hoped not he said which gives me a very bad opinion of you as a designing artful man  i am all attention madam  i never can think tolerably of you while the noise and voice i heard at the gardendoor which put me into the terror you took so much advantage of remains unaccounted for tell me fairly tell me heartily the whole of that circumstance and of your dealings with that wicked joseph leman and according to your explicitness in this particular i shall form a judgment of your future professions  i will without reserve my dearest life said he tell you the whole and hope that my sincerity in the relation will atone for any thing you may think wrong in the fact  i knew nothing said he of this man this leman and should have scorned a resort to so low a method as bribing the servant of any family to let me into the secrets of that family if i had not detected him attempting to corrupt a servant of mine to inform him of all my motions of all my supposed intrigues and in short of every action of my private life as well as of my circumstances and engagements and this for motives too obvious to be dwelt upon  my servant told me of his offers and i ordered him unknown to the fellow to let me hear a conversation that was to pass between them  in the midst of it and just as he had made an offer of money for a particular piece of intelligence promising more when procured i broke in upon them and by bluster calling for a knife to cut off his ears one of which i took hold of in order to make a present of it as i said to his employers i obliged him to tell me who they were  your brother madam and your uncle antony he named  it was not difficult when i had given him my pardon on naming them after i had set before him the enormity of the task he had undertaken and the honourableness of my intentions to your dear self to prevail upon him by a larger reward to serve me since at the same time he might keep your uncle and brothers favor as i desired to know nothing but what related to myself and to you in order to guard us both against the effects of an ill will which he acknowleged all his fellow servants as well as himself thought undeserved  by this means i own to you madam i frequently turned his principals about upon a pivot of my own unknown to themselves and the fellow who is always calling himself a plain man and boasting of his conscience was the easier as i condescended frequently to assure him of my honorable views and as he knew that the use i made of his intelligence prevented perhaps fatal mischiefs  i was the more pleased with his services as let me acknowledge to you madam they procured to you unknown to yourself a safe and uninterrupted egress which perhaps would not otherwise have been continued to you so long as it was to the garden and woodhouse for he undertook to them to watch all your motions and the more cheerfully for the fellow loves you as it kept off the curiosity of others see vol i p           so my dear it comes out that i myself was obliged to this deep contriver  i sat in silent astonishment and thus he went on  as to the circumstance which you madam think so hardly of me for i do freely confess that having a suspicion that you would revoke your intention of getting away and in that case as i was determined if possible to prevail upon you to adhere to your resolution apprehending that we should not have the time together that was necessary for that purpose i had ordered him to keep off every body he could keep off and to be himself within view of the gardendoor   but pray sir interrupting him how came you to apprehend that i should revoke my intention i had indeed deposited a letter to that purpose but you had it not and how as i had reserved to myself the privilege of a revocation did you know but i might have prevailed upon my friends and so have revoked upon good grounds  i will be very ingenuous madam you had made me hope that it you changed your mind you would give me a meeting to apprize me of the reasons for it i went to the loose bricks and i saw the letter there and as i knew your friends were immoveably fixed in their schemes i doubted not but the letter was to revoke or suspend your resolution and probably to serve instead of a meeting too i therefore let it lie that if you did revoke you might be under the necessity of meeting me for the sake of the expectation you had given me and as i came prepared i was resolved pardon me madam whatever were your intentions that you should not go back had i taken your letter i must have been determined by the contents of it for the present at least but not having received it and you having reason to think i wanted not resolution in a situation so desperate to make your friends a personal visit i depended upon the interview you had bid me hope for  wicked wretch said i it is my grief that i gave you opportunity to take so exact a measure of my weakness  but would you have presumed to visit the family had i not met you  indeed i would i had some friends in readiness who were to have accompanied me to them and had they refused to see me or to give me audience i would have taken my friends with me to solmes  and what did you intend to do to mr solmes  not the least hurt had the man been passive  but had he not been passive as you call it what would you have done to mr solmes  he was loath he said to tell me  yet not the least hurt to his person  i repeated my question  if he must tell me he only proposed to carry off the poor fellow and to hide him for a month or two and this he would have done let what would have been the consequence  was ever such a wretch heard of  i sighed from the bottom of my heart  but bid him proceed from the part i had interrupted him at  i ordered the fellow as i told you madam said he to keep within view of the gardendoor and if he found any parley between us and anybody coming before you could retreat undiscovered whose coming might be attended with violent effects he would cry out and this not only in order to save himself from their suspicions of him but to give me warning to make off and if possible to induce you i own it madam to go off with me according to your own appointment and i hope all circumstances considered and the danger i was in of losing you for ever that the acknowlegement of this contrivance or if you had not met me that upon solmes will not procure me your hatred for had they come as i expected as well as you what a despicable wretch had i been could i have left you to the insults of a brother and others of your family whose mercy was cruelty when they had not the pretense which this detected interview would have furnished them with  what a wretch said i  but if sir taking your own account of this strange matter to be fact anybody were coming how happened it that i saw only that man leman for i thought it was he out of the door and at a distance look after us  very lucky said he putting his hand first in one pocket then in another  i hope i have not thrown it away  it is perhaps in the coat i had on yesterday  little did i think it would be necessary to be produced  but i love to come to a demonstration whenever i can  i may be giddy  i may be heedless i am indeed  but no man as to you madam ever had a sincerer heart  he then stepping to the parlourdoor called his servant to bring him the coat he had on yesterday  the servant did and in the pocket rumpled up as a paper he regarded not he pulled out a letter written by that joseph dated monday night in which he begs pardon for crying out so soon says that his fears of being discovered to act on both sides had made him take the rushing of a little dog that always follows him through the phyllireahedge for bettys being at hand or some of his masters and that when he found his mistake he opened the door by his own key which the contriving wretch confessed he had furnished him with and inconsiderately ran out in a hurry to have apprised him that his cryingout was owing to his fright only and he added that they were upon the hunt for me by the time he returned see his letter to joseph leman no ii of this volume p    where he tells him he would contrive for him a letter of this nature to copy   i shook my head  deep deep deep said i at the best  o mr lovelace god forgive and reform you  but you are i see plainly upon the whole of your own account a very artful a very designing man  love my dearest life is ingenious night and day have i racked my stupid brains o sir thought i not stupid twere well perhaps if they were to contrive methods to prevent the sacrifice designed to be made of you and the mischief that must have ensued upon it so little hold in your affections such undeserved antipathy from your friends so much danger of losing you for ever from both causes  i have not had for the whole fortnight before last monday half an hours rest at a time and i own to you madam that i should never have forgiven myself had i omitted any contrivance or forethought that would have prevented your return without me  again i blamed myself for meeting him and justly for there were many chances to one that i had not met him and if i had not all his fortnights contrivances as to me would have come to nothing and perhaps i might nevertheless have escaped solmes  yet had he resolved to come to harloweplace with his friends and been insulted as he certainly would have been what mischiefs might have followed  but his resolution to run away with and to hide the poor solmes for a month or so o my dear what a wretch have i let run away with me instead of him  i asked him if he thought such enormities as these such defiances of the laws of society would have passed unpunished  he had the assurance to say with one of his usual gay airs that he should by this means have disappointed his enemies and saved me from a forced marriage he had no pleasure in such desperate pushes solmes he would not have personally hurt he must have fled his country for a time at least and truly if he had been obliged to do so as all his hopes of my favor must have been at an end he would have had a fellowtraveller of his own sex out of our family whom i little thought of  was ever such a wretch  to be sure he meant my brother  and such sir said i in high resentment are the uses you make of your corrupt intelligencer   my corrupt intelligencer madam interrupted he he is to this hour your brothers as well as mine by what i have ingenuously told you you may see who began this corruption let me assure you madam that there are many free things which i have been guilty of as reprizals which i would not have been the aggressor in  all that i shall further say on this head mr lovelace is this that as this vile doublefaced wretch has probably been the cause of great mischief on both sides and still continues as you own his wicked practices it is but my duty to have my friends apprized what a creature he is whom some of them encourage  what you please madam as to that  my service and your brothers are now almost over for him the fellow has made a good hand of it he does not intend to stay long in his place he is now actually in treaty for an inn which will do his business for life i can tell you further that he makes love to your sisters betty and this by my advice they will be married when he is established an innkeepers wife is every mans mistress and i have a scheme in my head to set some engines at work to make her repent her saucy behavior to you to the last day of her life  what a wicked schemer are you sir  who shall avenge upon you the still greater evils which you have been guilty of  i forgive betty with all my heart she was not my servant and but too probably in what she did obeyed the commands of her to whom she owed duty better than i obeyed those to whom i owed more  no matter for that the wretch said to be sure my dear he must design to make me afraid of him the decree was gone out  betty must smart  smart too by an act of her own choice he loved he said to make bad people their own punishers  nay madam excuse me but if the fellow if this joseph in your opinion deserves punishment mine is a complicated scheme a man and his wife cannot well suffer separately and it may come home to him too   i had no patience with him i told him so  but sir said i i see what a man i am with your rattle warns me of the snake and away i flung leaving him seemingly vexed and in confusion  letter xxi miss clarissa harlowe to miss how my plaindealing with him on seeing him again and the free dislike i expressed to his ways his manners and his contrivances as well as to his speeches have obliged him to recollect himself a little he will have it that the menaces which he threw out just now against my brother and mr solmes are only the effect of an unmeaning pleasantry he has too great a stake in his country he says to be guilty of such enterprises as should lay him under a necessity of quitting it for ever twenty things particularly he says he has suffered joseph leman to tell of him that were not and could not be true in order to make himself formidable in some peoples eyes and this purely with a view to prevent mischief he is unhappy as far as he knows in a quick invention in hitting readily upon expedients and many things are reported of him which he never said and many which he never did and others which he has only talked of as just now and which he has forgot as soon as the words have passed his lips  this may be so in part my dear no one man so young could be so wicked as he has been reported to be but such a man at the head of such wretches as he is said to have at his beck all men of fortune and fearlesness and capable of such enterprises as i have unhappily found him capable of what is not to be apprehended from him  his carelessness about his character is one of his excuses a very bad one what hope can a woman have of a man who values not his reputation  these gay wretches may in mixed conversation divert for an hour or so  but the man of probity the man of virtue is the man that is to be the partner for life what woman who could help it would submit it to the courtesy of a wretch who avows a disregard to all moral sanctions whether he will perform his part of the matrimonial obligation and treat her with tolerable politeness  with these notions and with these reflections to be thrown upon such a man myself  would to heaven  but what avail wishes now  to whom can i fly if i would fly from him  letter xxii mr lovelace to john belford esquire friday april    never did i hear of such a parcel of foolish toads as these harlowes  why belford the lady must fall if every hair of her head were a guardian angel unless they were to make a visible appearance for her or snatching her from me at unawares would draw her after them into the starry regions  all i had to apprehend was that a daughter so reluctantly carried off would offer terms to her father and would be accepted upon a mutual concedence they to give up solmes she to give up me and so i was contriving to do all i could to guard against the latter but they seem resolved to perfect the work they have begun  what stupid creatures there are in the world cunning whelp the brother not to know that he who would be bribed to undertake a base thing by one would be overbribed to retort the baseness  especially when he could be put into the way to serve himself by both  thou jack wilt never know one half of my contrivances  he here relates the conversation between him and the lady upon the subject of the noise and exclamations his agent made at the gardendoor to the same effect as in letter xx and proceeds exulting    what a capacity for glorious mischief has thy friend  yet how near the truth all of it the only deviation my asserting that the fellow made the noises by mistake and through fright and not by previous direction had she known the precise truth her pride to be so taken in would never have let her forgive me  had i been a hero i should have made gunpowder useless for i should have blown up all my adversaries by dint of stratagem turning their own devices upon them  but these fathers and mothers  lord help em  were not the powers of nature stronger than those of discretion and were not that busy dea bona to afford her genial aids till tardy prudence qualified parents to manage their future offspring how few people would have children  james and arabella may have their motives but what can be said for a father acting as this father has acted what for a mother what for an aunt what for uncles  who can have patience with such fellows and fellowesses  soon will the fairone hear how high their foolish resentments run against her and then she will have a little more confidence in me i hope then will i be jealous that she loves me not with the preference my heart builds upon then will i bring her to confessions of grateful love and then will i kiss her when i please and not stand trembling as now like an hungry hound who sees a delicious morsel within his reach the froth hanging about his vermilion jaws yet dare not leap at it for his life  but i was originally a bashful whelp  bashful still with regard to this lady  bashful yet know the sex so well  but that indeed is the reason that i know it so well  for jack i have had abundant cause when i have looked into myself by way of comparison with the other sex to conclude that a bashful man has a good deal of the soul of a woman and so like tiresias can tell what they think and what they drive at as well as themselves  the modest ones and i particularly are pretty much upon a par the difference between us is only what they think i act but the immodest ones outdo the worst of us by a bars length both in thinking and acting  one argument let me plead in proof of my assertion that even we rakes love modesty in a woman while the modest women as they are accounted that is to say the slyest love and generally prefer an impudent man whence can this be but from a likeness in nature and this made the poet say that every woman is a rake in her heart it concerns them by their actions to prove the contrary if they can  thus have i read in some of the philosophers that no wickedness is comparable to the wickedness of a woman mr lovelace is as much out in his conjecture of solomon as of socrates the passage is in ecclesiasticus chap xxv  can thou tell me jack who says this was it socrates for he had the devil of a wife  or who or is it solomon  king solomon  thou remembrest to have read of such a king do thou not solomon i learned when an infant my mother was a good woman to answer when asked who was the wisest man  but my indulgent questioner never asked me how he came by the uninspired part of his wisdom  come come jack you and i are not so very bad could we but stop where we are  he then gives the particulars of what passed between him and the lady on his menaces relating to her brother and mr solmes and of his design to punish betty barnes and joseph leman    letter xxiii miss clarissa harlowe to miss how friday april    i will now give you the particulars of a conversation that has just passed between mr lovelace and me which i must call agreeable  it began with his telling me that he had just riceived intelligence that my friends were of a sudden come to a resolution to lay aside all thoughts of pursuing me or of getting me back and that therefore he attended me to know my pleasure and what i would do or have him do  i told him that i would have him leave me directly and that when it was known to everybody that i was absolutely independent of him it would pass that i had left my fathers house because of my brothers illusage of me which was a plea that i might make with justice and to the excuse of my father as well as of myself  he mildly replied that if he could be certain that my relations would adhere to this their new resolution he could have no objection since such was my pleasure but that as he was well assured that they had taken it only from apprehensions that a more active one might involve my brother who had breathed nothing but revenge in some fatal misfortune there was too much reason to believe that they would resume their former purpose the moment they should think they safely might  this madam said he is a risque i cannot run you would think it strange if i could and yet as soon as i knew they had so given out i thought it proper to apprize you of it and to take your commands upon it  let me hear said i willing to try if he had any particular view what you think most advisable  it is very easy to say that if i durst  if i might not offend you  if it were not to break conditions that shall be inviolable with me  say then sir what you would say i can approve or disapprove as i think fit  to wave madam what i would say till i have more courage to speak out more courage  mr lovelace more courage my dear  i will only propose what i think will be most agreeable to you  suppose if you choose not to go to lady bettys that you take a turn cross the country to windsor  why to windsor  because it is a pleasant place because it lies in the way either to berkshire to oxford or to london  berkshire where lord m is at present oxford in the neighborhood of which lives lady betty london whither you may retire at your pleasure or if you will have it so whither i may go you staying at windsor and yet be within an easy distance of you if any thing should happen or if your friends should change their pacific resolution  this displeased me not but i said my only objection was the distance from miss how of whom i should be glad to be always within two or three hours reach by a messenger if possible  if i had thoughts of any other place than windsor or nearer to miss how he wanted but my commands and would seek for proper accommodations but fix as i pleased farther or nearer he had servants and they had nothing else to do but to obey me  a grateful thing then he named to me  to send for my hannah as soon as i should be fixed unless i would choose one of the young gentlewomen here to attend me both of whom as i had acknowleged were very obliging and he knew i had generosity enough to make it worth either of their whiles  this of hannah he might see i took very well i said i had thoughts of sending for her as soon as i got to more convenient lodgings as to these young gentlewomen it were pity to break in upon that usefulness which the whole family were of to each other each having her proper part and performing it with an agreeable alacrity insomuch that i liked them all so well that i could even pass my days among them were he to leave me by which means the lodgings would be more convenient to me than now they were  he need not repeat his objections to this place he said but as to going to windsor or wherever else i thought fit or as to his personal attendance or leaving me he would assure me he very agreeably said that i could propose nothing in which i thought my reputation and even my punctilio concerned that he would not cheerfully come into and since i was so much taken up with my pen he would instantly order his horse to be got ready and would set out  not to be off of my caution have you any acquaintance at windsor said i  know you of any convenient lodgings there  except with the forest replied he where i have often hunted i know the least of windsor of any place so noted and so pleasant indeed i have not a single acquaintance there  upon the whole i told him that i thought his proposal of windsor not amiss and that i would remove thither if i could get a lodging only for myself and an upperchamber for hannah for that my stock of money was but small as was easy to be conceived and i should be very loath to be obliged to anybody i added that the sooner i removed the better for that then he could have no objection to go to london or berkshire as he pleased and i should let everybody know my independence  he again proposed himself in very polite terms for my banker but i as civilly declined his offers  this conversation was to be all of it in the main agreeable he asked whether i would choose to lodge in the town of windsor or out of it  as near the castle i said as possible for the convenience of going constantly to the public worship an opportunity i had been too long deprived of  he should be very glad he told me if he could procure me accommodations in any one of the canons houses which he imagined would be more agreeable to me than any other on many accounts and as he could depend upon my promise never to have any other man but himself on the condition he had so cheerfully subscribed to he should be easy since it was now his part in earnest to set about recommending himself to my favor by the only way he knew it could be done adding with a very serious air  i am but a young man madam but i have run a long course let not your purity of mind incline you to despise me for the acknowlegement it is high time to be weary of it and to reform since like solomon i can say there is nothing new under the sun but that it is my belief that a life of virtue can afford such pleasures on reflection as will be for everblooming for ever new  i was agreeably surprised i looked at him i believe as if i doubted my ears and my eyes  his features and aspect however became his words  i expressed my satisfaction in terms so agreeable to him that he said he found a delight in this early dawning of a better day to him and in my approbation which he had never received from the success of the most favored of his pursuits  surely my dear the man must be in earnest he could not have said this he could not have thought it had he not what followed made me still readier to believe him  in the midst of my wild vagaries said he i have ever preserved a reverence for religion and for religious men i always called another cause when any of my libertine companions in pursuance of lord shaftesburys test which is a part of the rakes creed and what i may call the whetstone of infidelity endeavored to turn the sacred subject into ridicule on this very account i have been called by good men of the clergy who nevertheless would have it that i was a practical rake the decent rake and indeed i had too much pride in my shame to disown the name  this madam i am the readier to confess as it may give you hope that the generous task of my reformation which i flatter myself you will have the goodness to undertake will not be so difficult a one as you may have imagined for it has afforded me some pleasure in my retired hours when a temporary remorse has struck me for any thing i have done amiss that i should one day take delight in another course of life for without one can i dare say no durable good is to be expected from the endeavor  your example madam must do all must confirm all that he proposes one day to reform and that he has sometimes good motions see vol i p       the divine grace or favor mr lovelace must do all and confirm all you know not how much you please me that i can talk to you in this dialect  and i then thought of his generosity to his pretty rustic and of his kindness to his tenants  yet madam be pleased to remember one thing reformation cannot be a sudden work i have infinite vivacity it is that which runs away with me judge dearest madam by what i am going to confess that i have a prodigious way to journey on before a good person will think me tolerable since though i have read in some of our perfectionists enough to make a better man than myself either run into madness or despair about the grace you mention yet i cannot enter into the meaning of the word nor into the modus of its operation let me not then be checked when i mention your example for my visible reliance and instead of using such words till i can better understand them suppose all the rest included in the profession of that reliance  i told him that although i was somewhat concerned at his expression and surprised at so much darkness as for want of another word i would call it in a man of his talents and learning yet i was pleased with his ingenuity i wished him to encourage this way of thinking i told him that his observation that no durable good was to be expected from any new course where there was not a delight taken in it was just but that the delight would follow by use  and twenty things of this sort i even preached to him taking care however not to be tedious nor to let my expanded heart give him a contracted or impatient brow and indeed he took visible pleasure in what i said and even hung upon the subject when i to try him seemed to be ready to drop it once or twice and proceeded to give me a most agreeable instance that he could at times think both deeply and seriously  thus it was  he was wounded dangerously once in a duel he said in the left arm baring it to show me the scar that this notwithstanding a great effusion of blood it being upon an artery was followed by a violent fever which at last fixed upon his spirits and that so obstinately that neither did he desire life nor his friends expect it that for a month together his heart as he thought was so totally changed that he despised his former courses and particularly that rashness which had brought him to the state he was in and his antagonist who however was the aggressor into a much worse that in this space he had thoughts which at times gives him pleasure to reflect upon and although these promising prospects changed as he recovered health and spirits yet he parted with them with so much reluctance that he could not help showing it in a copy of verses truly blank ones he said some of which he repeated and advantaged by the grace which he gives to every thing he repeats i thought them very tolerable ones the sentiments however much graver than i expected from him  he has promised me a copy of the lines and then i shall judge better of their merit and so shall you the tendency of them was that since sickness only gave him a proper train of thinking and that his restored health brought with it a return of his evil habits he was ready to renounce the gifts of nature for those of contemplation  he farther declared that although all these good motions went off as he had owned on his recovery yet he had better hopes now from the influence of my example and from the reward before him if he persevered and that he was the more hopeful that he should as his present resolution was made in a full tide of health and spirits and when he had nothing to wish for but perseverance to entitle himself to my favor  i will not throw cold water mr lovelace said i on a rising flame but look to it for i shall endeavor to keep you up to this spirit i shall measure your value of me by this test and i would have you bear those charming lines of mr row for ever in your mind you who have by your own confession so much to repent of and as the scar indeed you showed me will in one instance remind you to your dying day  the lines my dear are from that poets ulysses you have heard me often admire them and i repeated them to him habitual evils change not on a sudden but many days must pass and many sorrows conscious remorse and anguish must be felt to curb desire to break the stubborn will and work a second nature in the soul ere virtue can resume the place she lost it is else dissimulation    he had often read these lines he said but never tasted them before  by his soul the unmortified creature swore and as he hoped to be saved he was now in earnest in his good resolutions he had said before i repeated these lines from row that habitual evils could not be changed on a sudden but he hoped he should not be thought a dissembler if he were not enabled to hold his good purposes since ingratitude and dissimulation were vices that of all others he abhorred  may you ever abhor them said i they are the most odious of all vices  i hope my dear miss how i shall not have occasion in my future letters to contradict these promising appearances should i have nothing on his side to combat with i shall be very far from being happy from the sense of my fault and the indignation of all my relations so shall not fail of condign punishment for it from my inward remorse on account of my forfeited character but the least ray of hope could not dart in upon me without my being willing to lay hold of the very first opportunity to communicate it to you who take so generous a share in all my concerns  nevertheless you may depend upon it my dear that these agreeable assurances and hopes of his begun reformation shall not make me forget my caution not that i think at worst any more than you that he dare to harbor a thought injurious to my honor but he is very various and there is an apparent and even an acknowlegd unfixedness in his temper which at times gives me some uneasiness i am resolved therefore to keep him at distance from my person and my thoughts as much as i can for whether all men are or are not incroachers i am sure mr lovelace is one  hence it is that i have always cast about and will continue to cast about what ends he may have in view from this proposal or from that report in a word though hopeful of the best i will always be fearful of the worst in every thing that admits of doubt for it is better in such a situation as mine to apprehend without cause than to subject myself to surprise for want of forethought  mr lovelace is gone to windsor having left two servants to attend me he purposes to be back tomorrow  i have written to my aunt hervey to supplicate her interest in my behalf for my clothes books and money signifying to her that could i be restored to the favor of my family and be allowed a negative only as to any man who might be proposed to me and be used like a daughter a niece and a sister i would still stand by my offer to live single and submit as i ought to a negative from my father intimating nevertheless that it were perhaps better after the usage i have received from my brother and sister that i might be allowed to be distant from them as well for their sakes as my own meaning as i suppose it will be taken at my dairyhouse  offering to take my fathers directions as to the manner i should live in the servants i should have and in every thing that should show the dutiful subordination that i was willing to conform to  my aunt will know by my letter to my sister how to direct to me if she be permitted to favor me with a line  i am equally earnest with her in this letter as i was with my sister in that i wrote to her to obtain for me a speedy reconciliation that i may not be further precipitated intimating that by a timely lenity all may pass for a misunderstanding only which otherwise will be thought equally disgraceful to them and to me appealing to her for the necessity i was under to do what i did  here i close for the present with the assurance that i am  your everobliged and affectionate clarissa harlowe  letter xxiv mr lovelace to john belford esquire friday april    thou have often reproached me jack with my vanity without distinguishing the humorous turn that accompanies it and for which at the same time that thou robbest me of the merit of it thou admirest me highly envy gives thee the indistinction nature inspires the admiration unknown to thyself it inspires it but thou art too clumsy and too shortsighted a mortal to know how to account even for the impulses by which thou thyself art moved  well but this acquits thee not of my charge of vanity lovelace methinks thou say  and true thou say for i have indeed a confounded parcel of it but if men of parts may not be allowed to be vain who should and yet upon second thoughts men of parts have the least occasion of any to be vain since the world so few of them are there in it are ready to find them out and extol them if a fool can be made sensible that there is a man who has more understanding than himself he is ready enough to conclude that such a man must be a very extraordinary creature  and what at this rate is the general conclusion to be drawn from the promises  is it not that no man ought to be vain but what if a man cannot help it  this perhaps may be my case but there is nothing on which i value myself so much as upon my inventions and for the soul of me i cannot help letting it be seen that i do yet this vanity may be a means perhaps to overthrow me with this sagacious lady  she is very apprehensive of me i see i have studied before her and miss how as often as i have been with them to pass for a giddy thoughtless fellow what a folly then to be so expatiatingly sincere in my answer to her home put upon the noises within the garden  but such success having attended that contrivance success jack has blown many a man up my cursed vanity got uppermost and kept down my caution the menace to have secreted solmes and that other that i had thoughts to run away with her foolish brother and of my project to revenge her upon the two servants so much terrified my beloved that i was forced to sit down to muse how to retrieve myself with her  some favorable incidents at the time tumbled in from my agent in her family at least such as i was determined to make favorable and therefore i desired admittance and this before she could resolve any thing against me that is to say while her admiration of my intrepidity kept resolution in suspense  accordingly i prepared myself to be all gentleness all obligingness all serenity and as i have nowandthen and always had more or less good motions pop up in my mind i encouraged and collected every thing of this sort that i had ever had from novicehood to maturity not long in recollecting jack in order to bring the dear creature into good humor with me and who knows thought i if i can hold it and proceed but i may be able to lay a foundation fit to build my grand scheme upon  love thought i is not naturally a doubter fear is i will try to banish the latter nothing then but love will remain credulity is the god of loves prime minister and they never are asunder  he then acquaints his friend with what passed between him and the lady in relation to his advices from harloweplace and to his proposal about lodgings pretty much to the same purpose as in hers preceding  when he comes to mention his proposal of the windsor lodgings thus he expresses himself    now belford can it enter into thy leaden head what i meant by this proposal  i know it cannot and so i will tell thee  to leave her for a day or two with a view to serve her by my absence would as i thought look like confiding in her favor  i could not think of leaving her thou know while i had reason to believe her friends would pursue us and i began to apprehend that she would suspect that i made a pretense of that intentional pursuit to keep about her and with her but now that they had declared against it and that they would not receive her if she came back again a declaration she had better hear first from me than from miss how or any other what should hinder me from giving her this mark of my obedience especially as i could leave will who is a clever fellow and can do any thing but write and spell and my uncles jonas not as guards to be sure but as attendants only the latter to be dispatched to me occasionally by the former whom i could acquaint with my motions  then i wanted to inform myself why i had not congratulatory letters from my aunts and from my cousins montague to whom i had written glorying in my beloveds escape which letters as they should be worded might possibly be made necessary to show as matters proceed  as to windsor i had no design to carry her particularly thither but somewhere it was proper to name as she condescended to ask my advice about it london i durst not but very cautiously and so as to make it her own option for i must tell thee that there is such a perverseness in the sex that when they ask your advice they do it only to know your opinion that they may oppose it though had not the thing in question been your choice perhaps it had been theirs  i could easily give reasons against windsor after i had pretended to be there and this would have looked the better as it was a place of my own nomination and shown her that i had no fixed scheme  never was there in woman such a sagacious such an allalive apprehension as in this  yet it is a grievous thing to an honest man to be suspected  then in my going or return i can call upon mrs greme she and my beloved had a great deal of talk together if i knew what it was about and that either upon their first acquaintance was for benefiting herself by the other i might contrive to serve them both without hurting myself for these are the most prudent ways of doing friendships and what are not followed by regrets though the served should prove ungrateful then mrs greme corresponds by pen and ink with her farmer sister where we are something may possibly arise that way either of a convenient nature which i may pursue or an inconvenient which i may avoid  always be careful of backdoors is a maxim with me in all my exploits whoever knows me knows that i am no proud man i can talk as familiarly to servants as to principals when i have a mind to make it worth their while to oblige me in any thing  then servants are but as the common soldiers in an army they do all the mischief frequently without malice and merely good souls for mischiefsake  i am most apprehensive about miss how she has a confounded deal of wit and wants only a subject to show as much roguery and should i be outwitted with all my sententious boasting conceit of my own nostrummongership  i love to plague thee who art a pretender to accuracy and a surfaceskimmer in learning with outoftheway words and phrases i should certainly hang drown or shoot myself  poor hickman  i pity him for the prospect he has with such a virago  but the fellows a fool god wot and now i think of it it is absolutely necessary for complete happiness in the married state that one should be a fool an argument i once held with this very miss how  but then the fool should know that he is so else the obstinate one will disappoint the wise one  but my agent joseph has helped me to secure this quarter  letter xxv mr lovelace in continuation but is it not a confounded thing that i cannot fasten an obligation upon ths proud beauty i have two motives in endeavoring to prevail upon her to accept money and raiment from me one the real pleasure i should have in the accommodating the haughty maid and to think there was something near her and upon her that i could call mine the other in order to abate her severity and humble her a little  nothing sooner brings down a proud spirit than a sense of lying under pecuniary obligations this has always made me solicitous to avoid laying myself under any such yet sometimes formerly have i been put to it and cursed the tardy revolution of the quarterly periods and yet i ever made shift to avoid anticipations i never would eat the calf in the cows belly as lord ms phrase is for what is that but to hold our lands upon tenantcourtesy the vilest of all tenures to be denied a foxchace for fear of breaking down a fence upon my own grounds to be clamoured at for repairs studied for rather than really wanted to be prated to by a bumkin with his hat on and his arms folded as if he defied your expectations of that sort his foot firmly fixed as if upon his own ground and you forced to take his arch leers and stupid gybes intimating by the whole of his conduct that he has had it in his power to oblige you and if you behave civilly may oblige you again  i who think i have a right to break every mans head i pass by if i like not his looks to bear this  i no more could do it than i could borrow of an insolent uncle or inquisitive aunt who would thence think themselves entitled to have an account of all my life and actions laid before them for their review and censure  my charmer i see has a pride like my own but she has no distinction in her pride nor knows the pretty fool that there is nothing nobler nothing more delightful than for lovers to be conferring and receiving obligations from one another in this very farmyard to give thee a familiar instance i have more than once seen this remark illustrated a strutting rascal of a cock have i beheld chuck chuck chuck chucking his mistress to him when he has found a single barleycorn taking it up with his bill and letting it drop five or six times still repeating his chucking invitation and when two or three of his feathered ladies strive who shall be the first for it o jack a cock is a grandsignor of a bird he directs the bill of the foremost to it and when she has got the dirty pearl he struts over her with an erected crest and an exulting chuck  a chuckawaww circling round her with dropped wings sweeping the dust in humble courtship while the obliged she halfshy halfwilling by her cowring tail halfstretchd wings yet seemingly affrighted eyes and contracted neck lets one see that she knows the barleycorn was not all he called her for  when he comes to that part of his narrative where he mentions the proposing of the ladys maid hannah or one of the young gentlewomen to attend her thus he writes    now belford can thou imagine what i meant by proposing hannah or one of the girls here for her attendant i will give thee a month to guess  thou will not pretend to guess thou say  well then i will tell thee  believing she would certainly propose to have that favorite wench about her as soon as she was a little settled i had caused the girl to be inquired after with an intent to make interest some how or other that a months warning should be insisted on by her master or mistress or by some other means which i had not determined upon to prevent her coming to her but fortune fights for me the wench is luckily ill a violent rheumatic disorder which has obliged her to leave her place confines her to her chamber poor hannah how i pity the girl these things are very hard upon industrious servants  i intend to make the poor maid a small present on the occasion  i know it will oblige my charmer  and so jack pretending not to know any thing of the matter i pressed her to send for the wench she knew i had always a regard for this servant because of her honest love to her lady but now i have a greater regard for her than ever calamity though a poor servants calamity will rather increase than diminish good will with a truly generous master or mistress  as to one of the young sorlingss attendance there was nothing at all in proposing that for if either of them had been chosen by her and permitted by the mother two chances in that it would have been only till i had fixed upon another and if afterward they had been loath to part i could easily have given my beloved a jealousy which would have done the business or to the girl who would have quitted her country dairy such a relish for a london one as would have made it very convenient for her to fall in love with will or perhaps i could have done still better for her with lord ms chaplain who is very desirous of standing well with his lords presumptive heir  a blessing on thy honest heart lovelace thou wilt say for thou art for providing for everybody  he gives an account of the serious part of their conversation with no great variation from the ladys account of it and when he comes to that part of it where he bids her remember that reformation cannot he a sudden thing he asks his friend    is not this fair play is it not dealing ingenuously then the observation i will be bold to say is founded in truth and nature but there was a little touch of policy in it besides that the lady if i should fly out again should not think me too gross an hypocrite for as i plainly told her i was afraid that my fits of reformation were but fits and sallies but i hoped her example would fix them into habits but it is so discouraging a thing to have my monitress so very good  i protest i know not how to look up at her now as i am thinking if i could pull her down a little nearer to my own level that is to say could prevail upon her to do something that would argue imperfection something to repent of we should jog on much more equally and be better able to comprehend one another and so the comfort would be mutual and the remorse not all on one side  he acknowleges that he was greatly affected and pleased with the ladys serious arguments at the time but even then was apprehensive that his temper would not hold thus he writes    this lady says serious things in so agreeable a manner and then her voice is all harmony when she touches a subject she is pleased with that i could have listened to her for half a day together but yet i am afraid if she falls as they call it she will lose a good deal of that pathos of that noble selfconfidence which gives a good person as i now see a visible superiority over one not so good  but after all belford i would fain know why people call such free livers as you and me hypocrites  that is a word i hate and should take it very ill to be called by it for myself i have as good motions and perhaps have them as frequently as anybody all the business is they dont hold or to speak more in character i dont take the care some do to conceal my lapses  letter xxvi miss how to miss clarissa harlowe sat april    though pretty much pressed in time and oppressed by my mammas watchfulness i will write a few lines upon the new light that has broke in upon your gentleman and send it by a particular hand  i know not what to think of him upon it  he talks well but judge him by rowes lines he is certainly a dissembler odious as the sin of hypocrisy and as he says that other of ingratitude are to him  and pray my dear let me ask you could he have triumphed as it is said he has done over so many of our sex had he not been egregiously guilty of both sins  his ingenuity is the thing that staggers me yet is he cunning enough to know that whoever accuses himself first blunts the edge of an adversarys accusation  he is certainly a man of sense there is more hope of such a one than of a fool and there must be a beginning to a reformation these i will allow in his favor  but this i think is the only way to judge of his specious confessions and selfaccusations  does he confess any thing that you knew not before or that you are not likely to find out from others  if nothing else what does he confess to his own disadvantage you have heard of his duels you have heard of his seductions all the world has  he owns therefore what it would be to no purpose to conceal and his ingenuity is a salvo  why this madam is no more than mr lovelace himself acknowleges  well but what is now to be done  you must make the best of your situation and as you say so say i i hope that will not be bad for i like all that he has proposed to you of windsor and his canons house his readiness to leave you and go himself in quest of a lodging likewise looks well  and i think there is nothing can be so properly done as whether you get to a canons house or not that the canon joins you together in wedlock as soon as possible  i much approve however of all your cautions of all your vigilance and of every thing you have done but of your meeting of him yet in my disapprobation of that i judge by the event only for who would have divined it would have concluded as it did but he is the devil by his own account and had he run away with the wretched solmes and your more wretched brother and been himself transported for life he should have had my free consent for all three  what use does he make of that joseph leman  his ingenuousness i must once more say confounds me but if my dear you can forgive your brother i dont know whether you ought to be angry at him on that account yet i have wished fifty times since he got you away that you were rid of him whether it were by a burning fever by hanging by drowning or by a broken neck provided it were before he laid you under a necessity to go into mourning for him  i repeat my hithertorejected offer may i send it safely by your old man  i have reasons for not sending it by hickmans servant unless i had a bank note or notes inquiring for such may cause distrust my mamma is so busy so inquisitive  i dont love suspicious tempers  and here she is continually in and out  i must break off mr hickman begs his most respectful compliments to you and offer of services i told him i would oblige him because minds in trouble take kindly anybodys civilities but that he must not imagine he obliged me by this since i should think the man or woman either blind or stupid who admired not a person of your exalted merit for her own sake and wished not to serve her without view to other reward than the honor of serving her  to be sure that was his principal motive with great daintiness he said it but with a kiss of his hand and a bow to my feet he hoped that that fine ladys being my friend did not lessen the merit of the reverence he really had for her believe me ever what you shall ever find me  your faithful and affectionate anna how  letter xxvii miss clarissa harlowe to miss how sat afternoon i detain your messenger while i write in answer to yours my poor old man not being very well  you dishearten me a good deal about this man i may be too willing from my sad circumstances to think the best of him  if his pretenses to reformation are but pretenses what must be his intent but can the heart of man be so very vile can he dare he mock the almighty  but may i not from one very sad reflection think better of him that i am thrown too much in his power to make it necessary for him except he were to intend the very utmost villainy by me to be such a shocking hypocrite  he must at least be in earnest at the time he gives the better hopes surely he must  you yourself must join with me in this hope or you could not wish me to be so dreadfully yoked  but after all i had rather be independent of him and of his family although i have an high opinion of them much rather at least till i see what my own may be brought to  otherwise i think it were best for me at once to cast myself into lady bettys protection all would then be conducted with decency and perhaps many mortifications would be spared me but then i must be his at all adventures and be thought to defy my own family and shall i not see the issue of one application first  and yet i cannot make this till i am settled somewhere and at a distance from him  mrs sorlings showed me a letter this morning which she had received from her sister greme last night in which hoping i will forgive her forward zeal if her sister thinks fit to show her letter to me she wishes for all the noble familys sake and she hopes she may say for my own that i will be pleased to yield to make his honor as she calls him happy she grounds her officiousness as she calls it upon what he was so condescending her word also to say to her yesterday in his way to windsor on her presuming to ask if she might soon give him joy that no man ever loved a woman as he loved me that no woman ever so well deserved to be beloved that in every conversation he admired me still more that he loved me with such a purity as he had never believed himself capable of or that a mortal creature could have inspired him with looking upon me as all soul as an angel sent down to save his and a great deal more of this sort but that he apprehended my consent to make him happy was at a greater distance than he wished and complained of my too severe restrictions upon him before i honored him with my confidence which restrictions must be as sacred to him as if they were parts of the marriagecontract etc  what my dear shall i say to this  how shall i take it mrs greme is a good woman mrs sorlings is a good woman and this letter agrees with the conversation i thought and still think so agreeable  yet what means the man by foregoing the opportunities he has had to declare himself  what mean his complaints of my restrictions to mrs greme he is not a bashful man  but you say i inspire people with an awe of me  an awe my dear  as how   i am quite petulant at times to find that i am bound to see the workings of this subtle or this giddy spirit which shall i call it  how am i punished as i frequently think for my vanity in hoping to be an example to young persons of my sex let me be but a warning and i will now be contented for be my destiny what it may i shall never be able to hold up my head again among my best friends and worthiest companions  it is one of the cruellest circumstances that attends the faults of the inconsiderate that she makes all who love her unhappy and gives joy only to her own enemies and to the enemies of her family  what an useful lesson would this afford were it properly inculcated at the time that the tempted mind was balancing upon a doubtful adventure  you know not my dear the worth of a virtuous man and nobleminded as you are in most particulars you partake of the common weakness of human nature in being apt to slight what is in your own power  you would not think of using mr lovelace were be your suitor as you do the much worthier mr hickman  would you you know who says in my mammas case much will bear much shall bear all the world through vol i p     mr hickman i fancy would be glad to know the ladys name who made such an observation he would think it hardly possible but such a one should benefit by her own remark and would be apt to wish his miss how acquainted with her  gentleness of heart surely is not despicable in a man why if it be is the highest distinction a man can arrive at that of a gentleman  a distinction which a prince may not deserve for manners more than birth fortune or title are requisite in this character manners are indeed the essenee of it and shall it be generally said and miss how not be an exception to it as once you wrote vol ii p     that our sex are best dealt with by boistrous and unruly spirits  forgive me my dear and love me as you used to do for although my fortunes are changed my heart is not nor ever will while it bids my pen tell you that it must cease to beat when it is not as much yours as  your clarissa harlowes  letter xxviii miss clarissa harlowe to miss how saturday evening mr lovelace has seen diverse apartments at windsor but not one he says that he thought fit for me or in any manner answering my description  he had been very solicitous to keep to the letter of my instructions which looks well and the better i liked him as although he proposed that town he came back dissuading me from it for he said that in his journey from thence he had thought windsor although of his own proposal a wrong choice because i coveted privacy and that was a place generally visited and admired  i told him that if mrs sorlings thought me not an encumbrance i would be willing to stay there a little longer provided he would leave me and go to lord ms or to london which ever he thought best  he hoped he said that he might suppose me absolutely safe from the insults or attempts of my brother and therefore if it would make me easier he would obey for a few days at least  he again proposed to send for hannah  i told him i designed to do so through you and shalll beg of you my dear to cause the honest creature to be sent to your faithful robert i think knows where she is perhaps she will be permitted to quit her place directly by allowing a months wages which i will repay her  he took notice of the serious humor he found me in and of the redness of my eyes i had just been answering your letter and had he not approached me on his coming off his journey in a very respectful manner had he not made an unexceptionable report of his inquiries and been so ready to go from me at the very first word i was prepared notwithstanding the good terms we parted upon when he set out for windsor to have given him a very unwelcome reception for the contents of your last letter had so affected me that the moment i saw him i beheld with indignation the seducer who had been the cause of all the evils i suffer and have suffered  he hinted to me that he had received a letter from lady betty and another as i understood him from one of the miss montagues if they take notice of me in them i wonder that he did not acquaint me with the contents i am afraid my dear that his relations are among those who think i have taken a rash and inexcusable step it is not to my credit to let even them know how i have been frighted out of myself and who knows but they may hold me unworthy of their alliance if they may think my flight a voluntary one  o my dear how uneasy to us are our reflections upon every doubtful occurrence when we know we have been prevailed upon to do a wrong thing   sunday morning what an additional concern must i have in my reflections upon mr lovelaces hatred of all my relations  he calls some of them implacable but i am afraid that he is as implacable himself as the most inveterate of them  i could not forbear with great earnestness to express my wishes for a reconciliation with them and in order to begin a treaty for that purpose to reurge his departure from me he gave himself high airs upon the occasion not doubting he said that he was to be the preliminary sacrifice and then he reflected in a very free manner upon my brother nor spared my father himself  so little consideration for me my dear  yet it had always as i told him been his polite way to treat my family with contempt wicked creature that i was to know it and yet to hold correspondence with him   but let me tell you sir said i that whatever your violent temper and contempt of me may drive you to say of my brother i will not hear my father spoken ill of it is enough surely that i have tormented his worthy heart by my disobedience and that his once beloved child has been spirited away from him  to have his character reflected upon by the man who has been the cause of all is what i will not bear  he said many things in his own defense but not one as i told him that could justify a daughter to hear or a man to say who pretended what he pretended to that daughter  and then seeing me very sincerely angry he begged my pardon though not in a very humble manner but to change the subject he took notice of the two letters he had received one from lady betty lawrance the other from miss montague and read me passages out of both  why did not the man show them to me last night was he afraid of giving me too much pleasure  lady betty in hers expresses herself in the most obliging manner in relation to me she wishes him so to behave as to encourage me to make him soon happy she desires her compliments to me and expresses her impatience to see as her niece so celebrated a lady those are her high words she shall take it for an honor she says to be put into a way to oblige me she hopes i will not too long delay the ceremony because that performed will be to her and to lord m and lady sarah a sure pledge of her nephews merits and good behavior  she says she was always sorry to hear of the hardships i had met with on his account that he will be the most ungrateful of men if he make not all up to me and that she thinks it incumbent upon all their family to supply to me the lost favor of my own and for her part nothing of that kind she bids him assure me shall be wanting  her ladyship observes that the treatment he had received from my family would have been more unaccountable than it was with such natural and accidental advantages as he had had it not been owing to his own careless manners but she hopes that he will convince the harlowefamily that they had thought worse of him than he had deserved since now it was in his power to establish his character for ever which she prays god to enable him to do as well for his own honor as for the honor of their house was the magnificent word she concludes with desiring to be informed of our nuptials the moment they are celebrated that she may be with the earliest in felicitating me on the happy occasion  but her ladyship gives me no direct invitation to attend her before marriage which i might have expected from what he had told me  he then showed me part of miss montagues more sprightly letter congratulating him upon the honor he had obtained of the confidence of so admirable a lady those are her words confidence my dear nobody indeed as you say will believe otherwise were they to be told the truth and you see that miss montague and all his family i suppose think the step i have taken an extraordinary one she also wishes for his speedy nuptials and to see her new cousin at m hall as do lord m she tells him and her sister and in general all the wellwishers of their family  whenever his happy day shall be passed she proposes she says to attend me and to make one in my train to m hall if his lordship shall continue so ill of the gout as at present but that should he get better he will himself attend me she is sure and conduct me thither and afterward quit either of his three seats to us till we shall be settled to our mind  this young lady says nothing in excuse for not meeting me on the road or at st albans as he had made me expect she would yet mentions her having been indisposed he had also told me that lord m was ill of the gout which miss montagues letter confirms   letter xxix miss clarissa harlowe in continuation you may believe my dear that these letters put me in good humor with him he saw it in my countenance and congratulated himself upon it but yet i wondered that i could not have the contents of them communicated to me last night  he then urged me to go directly to lady bettys on the strength of her letter  but how said i can i do that were i out of all hope of a reconciliation with my friends which yet however improbable to be brought about is my duty to attempt as her ladyship has given me no particular invitation  that he was sure was owing to her doubt that it would be accepted else she had done it with the greatest pleasure in the world  that doubt itself i said was enough to deter me since her ladyship who knew so well the boundaries of the fit and the unfit by her not expecting i would accept of an invitation had she given it would have reason to think me very forward if i had accepted it and much more forward to go without it then said i i thank you sir i have no clothes fit to go anywhere or to be seen by anybody  o i was fit to appear in the drawingroom were full dress and jewels to be excused and should make the most amiable  extraordinary he must mean figure there he was astonished at the elegance of my dress by what art he knew not but i appeared to such advantage as if i had a different suit every day besides his cousins montague would supply me with all i wanted for the present and he would write to miss charlotte accordingly if i would give him leave  do you think me the jay in the fable said i  would you have me visit the owners of the borrowed dresses in their own clothes  surely mr lovelace you think i have either a very low or a very confident mind  would i choose to go to london for a few days only in order to furnish myself with clothes  not at his expense i was not prepared to wear his livery yet  i could not have appeared in earnest to him in my displeasure at his artful contrivances to get me away if i were not occasionally to show my real fretfulness upon the destitute condition he has reduced me to when people set out wrong together it is very difficult to avoid recriminations  he wished he knew but my mind  that should direct him in his proposals and it would be his delight to observe it whatever it was  my mind was that he should leave me out of hand  how often must i tell him so   if i were anywhere but here he would obey me he said if i insisted upon it but if i would assert my right that would be infinitely preferable in his opinion to any other measure but one which he durst only hint at for then admitting his visits or refuseing them as i pleased granting a correspondence by letter only it would appear to all the world that what i had done was but in order to do myself justice  how often must i tell you sir that i will not litigate with my papa  do you think that my unhappy circumstances will alter my notions of my own duty so far as it is practicable for me to perform it  how can i obtain possession without litigation and but by my trustees one of them will be against me the other is abroad this must take up time were i disposed to fall upon this measure  and what i want is present independence and your immediate absence  upon his soul the wretch swore he did not think it safe for the reasons he had before given to leave me here  he hoped i would think of some place to which i should like to go but he must take the liberty to say that he hoped his behavior had not been so exceptionable as to make me so very earnest for his absence in the interim and the less surely as i was almost eternally shutting up myself from him although he presumed he said to assure me that he never went from me but with a corrected heart and with strengthened resolutions of improving by my example  eternally shutting myself up from you repeated i  i hope sir that you will not pretend to take it amiss that i expect to be uninvaded in my retirements i hope you do not think me so weak a creature novice as you have found me in a very capital instance as to be fond of occasions to hear your fine speeches especially as no differing circumstances require your overfrequent visits nor that i am to be addressed to as if i thought hourly professions needful to assure me of your honor  he seemed a little disconcerted  you know mr lovelace proceeded i why i am so earnest for your absence it is that i may appear to the world independent of you and in hopes by that means to find it less difficult to set on foot a reconciliation with my friends and now let me add in order to make you easier as to the terms of that hopedfor reconciliation that since i find i have the good fortune to stand so well with your relations i will from time to time acquaint you by letter when you are absent with every step i shall take and with every overture that shall be made to me but not with an intention to render myself accountable to you neither as to my acceptance or nonacceptance of those overtures they know that i have a power given me by my grandfathers will to bequeath the estate he left me together with my share of the effects in a way that may affect them though not absolutely from them this consideration i hope will procure me some from them when their passion subsides and they know i am independent of you  charming reasoning  and let him tell me that the assurance i had given him was all he wishedfor it was more than he could ask  what a happiness to have a woman of honor and generosity to depend upon  had he on his first entrance into the world met with such a one he had never been other than a man of strict virtue  but all he hoped was for the best since in that case he had never perhaps had the happiness now in his view because his relations had been always urging him to marry and that before he had the honor to know me  and now as he had not been so bad as some peoples malice reported him to be he hoped he should have more merit in his repentance than if he had never erred  i said i took it for granted that he assented to the reasoning he seemed to approve and would leave me and then i asked him what he really and in his most deliberate mind would advise me to in my present situation he must needs see i said that i was at a great loss what to resolve upon entirely a stranger to london having no adviser no protector at present  himself he must give me leave to tell him greatly deficient in practice if not in the knowledge of those decorums which i had apprehended were indispensable in the character of a man of birth fortune and education  he imagines himself i find to be a very polite man and cannot bear to be thought otherwise he put up his lip  i am sorry for it madam  a man of breeding a man of politeness give me leave to say coloring is much more of a black swan with you than with any lady i ever met with  then that is your misfortune mr lovelace as well as mine at present  every woman of discernment i am confident knowing what i know of you now would say as i say i had a mind to mortify a pride that i am sure deserves to be mortifyd that your politeness is not regular nor constant it is not habit it is too much seen by fits and starts and sallies and those not spontaneous you must be reminded into them  o lord o lord  poor i  was the light yet the halfangry wretchs selfpitying expression   i proceeded  upon my word sir you are not the accomplished man which your talents and opportunities would have led one to expect you to be  you are indeed in your noviciate he had in a former conversation used that word as to every laudable attainment   letter xxx miss clarissa harlowe in continuation i was going on to tell him more of my mind since the subject was introduced and treated by him so lightly but he interrupted me  dear dear madam spare me i am sorry that i have lived to this hour for nothing at all but surely you could not have quitted a subject so much more agreeable and so much more suitable i will say to our present situation if you had not too cruel a pleasure in mortifying a man who before looked up to you with a diffidence in his own merits too great to permit him to speak half his mind to you  be pleased but to return to the subject we were upon and at another time i will gladly embrace correction from the only mouth in the world so qualified to give it  you talk of reformation sometimes mr lovelace and in so talking acknowledge errors but i see you can very ill bear the reproof which perhaps you are not solicitous to avoid giving occasion for  far be it from me to take delight in finding fault i should be glad for both our sakes since my situation is what it is that i could do nothing but praise you but failures which affect a mind that need not be very delicate to be affected by them are too grating to be passed over in silence by a person who wishes to be thought in earnest in her own duties  i admire your delicacy madam again interrupted he  although i suffer by it yet would i not have it otherwise indeed i would not when i consider of it it is an angelic delicacy which sets you above all our sex and even above your own it is natural to you madam so you may not think it extraordinary  but there is nothing like it on earth said the flatterer  what company has he kept  but let us return to the former subject  you were so good as to ask me what i would advise you to do  i want but to make you easy i want but to see you fixed to your liking  your faithful hannah with you  your reconciliation with those with whom you wish to be reconciled set on foot and in a train  and now let me mention to you different proposals in hopes that some one of them may be acceptable to you  i will go to mrs how or to miss how or to whomsoever you would have me go and endeavor to prevail upon them to receive you  do you incline to go to florence to your cousin morden  i will furnish you with the opportunity of going thither either by sea to leghorn or by land through france  perhaps i may be able to procure one of the ladies of my family to attend you either charlotte or patty would rejoice in such an opportunity of seeing france and italy as for myself i will only be your escorte in disguise if you will have it so even in your livery that your punctilio may not receive offense by my attendance  i told him i would consider of all he had said but that i hoped for a line or two from my aunt hervey if not from my sister to both of whom i had written which if i were to be so favored might help to determine me mean time if he would withdraw i would particularly consider of this proposal of his in relation to my cousin morden and if it held its weight with me so far as to take your opinion upon it he should know my mind in an hours time  he withdrew with great respect and in an hours time returned  and then i told him it was unnecessary to trouble you for your opinion about it my cousin morden was soon expected i could not admit of his accompanying me in any shape or upon any condition it was highly improbable that i should obtain the favor of either of his cousins company and if that could be done it would be the same thing in the worlds eye as if he went himself  this led us into another convesation which shall be the subject of my next  letter xxxi miss clarissa harlowe in continuation mr lovelace told me that on the supposition that his proposal in relation to my cousin morden might not be accepted he had been studying to find out if possible somewhat that might be agreeable and which might convince me that he preferred my satisfaction to his own  he then offered to go himself and procure my hannah to come and attend me as i had declined the service of either of the young mrs sorlingss he was extremely solicitous he said that i should have a servant in whose integrity i might confide  i told him that you would be so kind as to send to engage hannah if possible  if any thing he said should prevent her from comeing suppose he himself waited upon miss how to desire her to lend me her servant till i was provided to my mind  i said your mammas high displeasure at the step i had taken as she supposed voluntarily had deprived me of any open assistance of that sort from you  he was amazed so much as mrs how herself used to admire me and so great an influence as miss was supposed to have over her mamma and deserved to have that that lady should take upon herself to be so much offended with me he wished that the man who took such pains to keep up and inflame the passions of my father and uncles were not at the bottom of this mischief too  i was afraid i said that my brother was or else my uncle antony i dared to say would not have taken such pains to set mrs how against me as i understood he had done  since i had declined visiting his aunts he asked me if i would admit of a visit from his cousin montague and accept of a servant of hers for the present  that was not i said an unacceptable proposal but i would first see if my friends would send me my clothes that i might not make such a giddy and runaway appearance to any of his relations  if i pleased he would make another journey to windsor to make more particular inquiry among the canons or in any worthy family  were not his objections as to the publicness of the place i asked him as strong now as before  i remember my dear in one of your former letters you mentioned london as the privatest place to be in see vol ii p      and i said that since he made such pretenses against leaving me here as showed he had no intention to do so and since he engaged to go from me and to leave me to pursue my own measures if i were elsewhere and since his presence made these lodgings inconvenient to me i should not be disinclined to go to london did i know anybody there  as he had several times proposed london to me i expected that he would eagerly have embraced that motion from me but he took not ready hold of it yet i thought his eye approved of it  we are both great watchers of each others eyes and indeed seem to be more than halfafraid of each other  he then made a grateful proposal to me that i would send for my mrs norton to attend me  he saw by my eyes he said that he had at last been happy in an expedient which would answer both our wishes why says he did not i think of it before  and snatching my hand shall i write madam shall i send shall i go and fetch the good woman myself  after a little consideration i told him that this was indeed a grateful motion but that i apprehended it would put her to a difficulty which she would not be able to get over as it would make a woman of her known prudence appear to countenance a fugitive daughter in opposition to her parents and as her coming to me would deprive her of my mammas favor without its being in my power to make it up to her  o my beloved creature said he generously enough let not this be an obstacle i will do every thing for the good woman you wish to have done  let me go for her  more coolly than perhaps his generosity deserved i told him it was impossible but i must soon hear from my friends i should not mean time embroil anybody with them not mrs norton especially from whose interest in and mediation with my mamma i might expect some good were she to keep herself in a neutral state that besides the good woman had a mind above her fortune and would sooner want than be beholden to anybody improperly  improperly said he  have not persons of merit a right to all the benefits conferred upon them  mrs norton is so good a woman that i shall think she lays me under an obligation if she will put it in my power to serve her although she were not to augment it by giving me the opportunity at the same time of contributing to your pleasure and satisfaction  how could this man with such powers of right thinking be so far depraved by evil habits as to disgrace his talents by wrong acting  is there not room after all thought i at the time for hope as he so lately led me to hope that the example it will behove me for both ou sakes to endeavor to set him may influence him to a change of manners in which both may find their account  give me leave sir said i to tell you there is a strange mixture in your mind you must have taken pains to suppress many good motions and reflections as they arose or levity must have been surprisingly predominant in it  but as to the subject we were upon there is no taking any resolutions till i hear from my friends  well madam i can only say i would find out some expedient if i could that should be agreeable to you but since i cannot will you be so good as to tell me what you would wish to have done nothing in the world but i will comply with excepting leaving you here at such a distance from the place i shall be in if any thing should happen and in a place where my gossiping rascals have made me in a manner public for want of proper cautions at first  these vermin added he have a pride they can hardly reinin when they serve a man of family they boast of their masters pedigree and descent as if they were related to him nor is any thing they know of him or of his affairs a secret to one another were it what would hang him  if so thought i men of family should take care to give them subjects worth boasting of  i am quite at a loss said i what to do or whither to go would you mr lovelace in earnest advise me to think of going to london  and i looked at him with stedfastness but nothing could i gather from his looks  at first madam said he i was for proposing london as i was then more apprehensive of pursuit but as your relations seem cooler on that head i am the more indifferent about the place you go to  so as you are pleased  so as you are easy i shall be happy  this indifference of his to london i cannot but say made me like going thither the better i asked him to hear what he would say if he could recommend me to any particular place in london  no he said none that was fit for me or that i should like his friend belford indeed had very handsome lodgings near sohosquare at a relations a lady of virtue and honor these as mr belford was generally in the country he could borrow till i were better accommodated  i was resolved to refuse these at the first mention as i should any other he had named nevertheless i will see thought i if he has really thoughts of these for me if i break off the talk here and he resume this proposal with earnestness in the morning i shall apprehend that he is less indifferent than he seems to be about my going to london and that he has already a lodging in his eye for me  and then i will not go at all  but after such generous motions from him i really think it a little barbarous to act and behave as if i thought him capable of the blackest and most ungrateful baseness but his character his principles are so faulty  he is so light so vain so various that there is no certainty that he will be next hour what he is this then my dear i have no guardian now no father no mother nothing but god and my vigilance to depend upon and i have no reason to expect a miracle in my favor  well sir said i rising to leave him something must be resolved upon but i will postpone this subject till tomorrow morning  he would fain have engaged me longer but i said i would see him as early as he pleased in the morning he might think of any convenient place in london or near it mean time  and so i retired from him as i do from my pen hoping for better rest for the few hours that will remain for that desirable refreshment than i have had of a long time  cl harlowe  letter xxxii miss clarissa harlowe in continuation monday morning april    late as i went to bed i have had very little rest sleep and i have quarreled and although i court it it will not be friends i hope its fellowirreconcileables at harloweplace enjoy its balmy comforts else that will be an aggravation of my fault my brother and sister i dare say want it not  mr lovelace who is an early riser as well as i joined me in the garden about six and after the usual salutations asked me to resume our last nights subject it was upon lodgings at london he said  i think you mentioned one to me sir  did you not  yes madam but watching the turn of my countenance rather as what you would be welcome to than perhaps approve of  i believe so too to go to town upon an uncertainty i own is not agreeable but to be obliged to any gentleman of your acquaintance when i want to be thought independent of you and to a gentleman especially to whom my friends are to direct to me if they vouchsafe to take notice of me at all is an absurd thing to mention  he did not mention it as what he imagined i would accept but only to confirm to me what he had said that he himself knew of none fit for me  has not your family madam some one tradesman they deal with who has conveniences of this kind i would make it worth such a persons while to keep the secret of your being at his house traders are dealers in pins said he and will be more obliged by a penny customer than a pound present because it is in their way  yet will refuse neither  my fathers tradesmen i said would no doubt be the first employed to find me out so that proposal was as absurd as the other  we had a good deal of discourse upon the same topic but at last the result of all was this  he wrote a letter to one mr doleman a married man of fortune and character i excepting to mr belford desiring him to provide decent apartments ready furnished for i had told him what they should be for a single woman consisting of a bedchamber another for a maidservant with the use of a dining room or parlour this he gave me to peruse and then sealed it up and dispatched it away in my presence by one of his own servants who having business in town is to bring back an answer  i attend the issue of it holding myself in readiness to set out for london unless you advise the contrary i will only add that i am  your everaffectionate cl harlowe  letter xxxiii mr lovelace to john belford esquire sat sunday monday he gives in several letters the substance of what is contained in the last of the ladys  he tells his friend that calling at the lawn in his way to m hall for he owns that he went not to windsor he found the letters from lady betty lawrance and his cousin montague which mrs greme was about sending to him by a special messenger  he gives the particulars from mrs gremes report of what passed between the lady and her as in p       and makes such declarations to mrs greme of his honor and affection to the lady as put her upon writing the letter to her sister sorlings the contents of which are given by the lady in p          he then accounts as follows for the serious humor he found her in on his return    upon such good terms when we parted i was surpised to find so solemn a brow upon my return and her charming eyes red with weeping but when i had understood she had received letters from miss how it was easy to imagine that that little devil had put her out of humor with me  this gives me infinite curiosity to find out the subject of their letters but this must not be attempted yet an invasion in an article so sacred would ruin me beyond retrieve yet it vexes me to the heart to think that she is hourly writing her whole mind on all that passes between her and me  i under the same roof with her  yet kept at such awful distance that i dare not break into a correspondence that may perhaps be a means to blow me and all my devices up together  would it be very wicked jack to knock her messenger of the head as he is carrying my beloveds letters or returning with miss howes to attempt to bribe him and not succeed would utterly ruin me and the man seems to be one used to poverty oee who can sit down satisfied with it and enjoy it contented with handtomouth conveniences and not aiming to live better tomorrow than he does today and than he did yesterday such a one is above temptation unless it could come clothed in the guise of truth and trust what likelihood of corrupting a man who has no hope no ambition  yet the rascal has but halflife and groans under that  should i be answerable in his case for a whole one  but hang the fellow  let him live  were i a king or a minister of state an antonio perez antonio perez was first minister of philip ii king of spain by whose command he caused don juan de escovedo to be assassinated which brought on his own ruin through the perfidy of his viler master geddess tracts  it were another thing and yet on second thoughts am not i a rake as it is called and who ever knew a rake to stick at any thing but thou know jack that the greatest half of my wickedness is vapor to show my invention and that i could be mischievous if i would  he collects the ladys expressions which his pride cannot bear  such as that he is a stranger to the decorums which she thought inseparable from a man of birth and education and that he is not the accomplished man he imagines himself to be and threatens to remember them against her  he values himself upon his proposals and speeches which he gives to his friend pretty much to the same purpose that the lady does in her four last letters  when he recites his endeavoring to put her upon borrowing a servant from miss how till hannah could come he writes as follows    thou see belford that my charmer has no notion that miss how herself is but a puppet danced upon my wires at second or third hand to outwit and impel as one pleases two such girls as these who think they know every thing and by taking advantage of the pride and ill nature of the old ones of both families to play them off likewise at the very time that they think they are doing me spiteful displeasure what charming revenge  then the sweet lady when i wished that her brother was not at the bottom of mrs howes resentment to tell me that she was afraid he was or her uncle would not have appeared against her to that lady  pretty dear how innocent  but dont think me the cause neither of her familys malice and resentment it is all in their hearts i work but with their materials they if left to their own wicked direction would perhaps express their revenge by fire and faggot that is to say by the private dagger or by lord chief justices warrants by law and so forth i only point the lightning and teach it where to dart without the thunder in other words i only guide the effects the cause is in their malignant hearts and while i am doing a little mischief i prevent a great deal  thus he exults on her mentioning london  i wanted her to propose london herself this made me again mention windsor if you would have a woman do one thing you must always propose another  the sex the very sex as i hope to be saved  why they lay one under a necessity to deal doubly with them and when they find themselves outwitted they cry out upon an honest fellow who has been too hard for them at their own weapons  i could hardly contain myself my heart was at my throat  down down said i to myself exuberant exultation  a sudden cough befriended me i again turned to her all as indifferencedover as a girl at the first longexpected question who waits for two more i heard out the rest of her speech and when she had done instead of saying any thing of london i proposed to her to send for her mrs norton  as i knew she would be afraid of lying under obligations had she accepted of my offer i could have proposed to do so much for the good woman and her son as would have made her resolve that i should do nothing  this however not merely to avoid expense but there was no such thing as allowing of the presence of mrs norton i might as well have had her mother or aunt hervey with her hannah had she been able to come and had she come i could have done well enough with what do i keep fellows idling in the country for but to fall in love and even to marry whom i would have them marry  how unequal is a modest woman to the adventure when she throws herself into the power of a rake  punctilio will at any time stand for reasons with such a one she cannot break through a welltested modesty none but the impudent little rogues who can name the parson and the church before you can ask them for either and undress and go to bed before you the next hour should think of running away with a man  i am in the right train now every hour i doubt not will give me an increasing interest in the affections of this proud beauty  i have just carried unpoliteness far enough to make her afraid of me and to show her that i am no whiner every instance of politeness now will give me double credit with her my next point will be to make her acknowledge a lambent flame a preference of me to all other men at least and then my happy hour is not far off an acknowleged love sanctifies every freedom and one freedom begets another and if she call me ungenerous i can call her cruel the sex love to be called cruel many a time have i complained of cruelty even in the act of yielding because i knew it gratified their pride  mentioning that he had only hinted at mr belfords lodgings as an instance to confirm what he had said that he knew of none in london fit for her he says    i had a mind to alarm her with something furthest from my purpose for as much as she disliked my motion i intended nothing by it mrs osgood is too pious a woman and would have been more her friend than mine  i had a view moreover to give her an high opinion of her own sagacity i love when i dig a pit to have my prey tumble in with secure feet and open eyes then a man can look down upon her with an oho charmer how came you there   monday april    i have just now received a fresh piece of intelligence from my agent honest joseph leman thou know the history of poor miss betterton of nottingham james harlowe is plotting to revive the resentments of that family against me the harlowes took great pains some time ago to get to the bottom of that story but now the foolish devils are resolved to do something in it if they can my head is working to make this booby squire a plotter and a clever fellow in order to turn his plots to my advantage supposing the lady shall aim to keep me at arms length when in town and to send me from her  but i will in proper time let thee see josephs letter and what i shall answer to it see letters xlvxlvi of this volume  to know in time a designed mischief is with me to disappoint it and to turn it upon the contrivers head  joseph is plaguey squeamish again but i know he only intends by his qualms to swell his merits with me o belford belford what a vile corruptible rogue whether in poor or in rich is human nature   letter xxxiv miss how to miss clarissa harlowe in answer to letters xxvii to xxxii inclusive tuesday april    you have a most implacable family another visit from your uncle antony has not only confirmed my mamma an enemy to our correspondence but has almost put her upon treading in their steps  but to other subjects  you plead generously for mr hickman  perhaps with regard to him i may have done as i have often done in singing or music  begun a note or key too high and yet rather than begin again proceed though i strain my voice or spoil my tune  but this is evident the man is more observant for it and you have taught me that the spirit which is the humbler for illusage will be insolent upon better so good and grave mr hickman keep your distance a little longer i beseech you you have erected an altar to me and i hope you will not refuse to bow to it  but you ask me if i would treat mr lovelace were he to be in mr hickmans place as i do mr hickman  why really my dear i believe i should not  i have been very sagely considering this point of behavior in general on both sides in courtship and i will very heartily tell you the result i have concluded that politeness even to excess is necessary on the mens part to bring us to listen to their first addresses in order to induce us to bow our necks to a yoke so unequal but upon my conscience i very much doubt whether a little intermingled insolence is not requisite from them to keep up that interest when once it has got footing men must not let us see that we can make fools of them and i think that smooth love that is to say a passion without rubs in other words a passion without passion is like a sleepy stream that is hardly seen to give motion to a straw so that sometimes to make us fear and even for a short space to hate the wretch is productive of the contrary extreme  if this be so lovelace than whom no man was ever more polite and obsequious at the beginning has hit the very point for his turbulence since his readiness to offend and his equal readiness to humble himself as he is known to be a man of sense and of courage too must keep a womans passion alive and at last tire her into a nonresistance that shall make her as passive as a tyrant husband would wish her to be  i verily think that the different behavior of our two heroes to their heroines makes out this doctrine to demonstration i am so much accustomed for my own part to hickmans whining creeping submissive courtship that i now expect nothing but whine and cringe from him and am so little moved with his nonsense that i am frequently forced to go to my harpsichord to keep me awake and to silence his humdrum  whereas lovelace keeps up the ball with a witness and all his address and conversation is one continual game at racket  your frequent quarrels and reconciliations verify this observation and i really believe that could hickman have kept my attention alive after the lovelace manner only that he had preserved his morals i should have married the man by this time but then he must have set out accordingly for now he can never never recover himself that is certain but must b dangler to the end of the courtship chapter and what is still worse for him a passive to the end of his life  poor hickman perhaps you will say i have been called your echo  poor hickman say i  you wonder my dear that mr lovelace took not notice to you of his aunts and cousins letters to him overnight i dont like his keeping such a material and relative circumstance as i may call it one moment from you by his communicating the contents of them to you next day when you was angry with him it looks as if he withheld them for occasional pacifiers and if so must he not have had a forethought that he might give you cause for anger of all the circumstances that have happened since you have been with him i think i like this the least this alone my dear small as it might look to an indifferent eye in mine warrants all your cautions yet i think that mrs gremes letter to her sister sorlings his repeated motions for hannahs attendance and for that of one of the widow sorlingss daughters and above all for that of mrs norton are agreeable counterbalances were it not for those circumstances i should have said a great deal more of the other yet the foolish man to let you know overnight that he had such letters  i cannot tell what to make of him  i am pleased with what these ladies write and the more as i have caused them to be again sounded and find that the whole family are as desirous as ever of your alliance  i think there can be no objection to your going to london there as in the center you will be in the way of hearing from everybody and sending to anybody and then you will put all his sincerity to the test as to his promised absence and suchlike  but really my dear i think you have nothing for it but marriage you may try that you may say you have tried what your relations can be brought to but the moment they refuse your proposals submit to the yoke and make the best of it he will be a savage indeed if he makes you speak out yet it is my opinion that you must bend a little for he cannot bear to be thought slightly of  this was one of his speechcs once i believe designed for me  a woman who means one day to favor a man should show the world for her own sake that she distinguishes her adorer from the common herd  shall i give you another fine sentence of his and in the true libertine style as he spoke it throwing out his challenging hand  d  n him if he would marry indelicate as some persons thought him to be the first princess on earth if he but thought she balanced a minute in her choice of him or of an emperor  all the world in short expect you to have this man they think that you left your fathers house for this very purpose the longer the ceremony is delayed the worse appearance it will have in the worlds eye and it will not be the fault of some of your relations if a slur be not thrown upon your reputation while you continue unmarried your uncle antony in particular speaks rough and vile things grounded upon the morals of his brotherorson but hitherto your admirable character has antidoted the poison the speaker is despised and every ones indignation raised against him  i have written through many interruptions and you will see the first sheet creased and rumpled occasioned by putting it into my bosom on my mammas sudden coming upon me we have had one very pretty debate i will assure you but it is not worth while to trouble you with the particulars  but upon my word  no matter though   your hannah cannot attend you the poor girl left her place about a fortnight ago on account of a rheumatic disorder which has confined her to her room ever since she burst into tears when kitty carried to her your desire of having her and called herself doubly unhappy that she could not wait upon a mistress whom she so dearly loved  were my mamma to have answered my wishes i should have been sorry mr lovelace had been the first proposer of my kitty for your attendant till hannah could come to be altogether among strangers and a stranger to attend you every time you remove is a very disagreeable thing but your considerateness and bounty will make you faithful ones wherever you go  you must take your own way but if you suffer any inconvenience either as to clothes or money that is in my power to supply i will never forgive you my mamma if that be your objection need not know any thing of the matter  your next letter i suppose will be from london pray direct it and your future letters till further notice to mr hickman at his own house he is entirely devoted to you dont take so heavily my mammas partiality and prejudices i hope i am past a baby  heaven preserve you and make you as happy as i think you deserve to be prays  your everaffectionate anna how  letter xxxv miss clarissa harlowe to miss how wedn morn april    i am glad my dear friend that you approve of my removal to london  the disagreement between your mamma and you gives me inexpressible affliction i hope i think you both more unhappy than you are but i beseech you let me know the particulars of the debate you call a very pretty one i am well acquainted with your dialect when you acquaint me with the whole be your mamma ever so severe upon me i shall be easier a great deal  faulty people should rather deplore the occasion than resent the anger that is but the consequence of their fault  if i am to be obliged to anybody in england for money it shall be to you your mother need not know of your kindness to me you say  but she must know it if it be done and if she challenge my beloved friend upon it  for would you either falsify or prevaricate  i wish your mamma could be made easy on this head  forgive me my dear  but i know  yet once she had a better opinion of me  o my inconsiderate rashness  excuse me once more i pray you  pride when it is native will show itself sometimes in the midst of mortifications  but my stomach is down already  i am unhappy that i cannot have my worthy hannah  i am as sorry for the poor creatures illness as for my own disappointment by it come my dear miss how since you press me to be beholden to you and would think me proud if i absolutely refused your favor pray be so good as to send her two guineas in my name  if i have nothing for it as you say but matrimony it yields a little comfort that his relations do not despise the fugitive as persons of their rank and qualitypride might be supposed to do for having been a sugitive  but o my cruel thrice cruel uncle to suppose  but my heart checks my pen and will not let it proceed on an intimation so extremely shocking as that which he supposes  yet if thus they have been persuaded no wonder if they are irreconcilable this is all my hardhearted brothers doings  his surmisings  god forgive him prays his injured sister and  your everobliged and affectionate friend cl h  letter xxxvi miss clarissa harlowe to miss how thursday april  0 mr lovelaces servant is already returned with an answer from his friend mr doleman who has taken pains in his inquiries and is very particular mr lovelace brought me the letter as soon as he had read it and as he now knows that i acquaint you with every thing that offers i desired him to let me send it to you for your perusal be pleased to return it by the first opportunity you will see by it that his friends in town have a notion that we are actually married  to robert lovelace esquire tuesday night april    dear sir i am extremely rejoiced to hear that we shall so soon have you in town after so long an absence you will be the more welcome still if what report says be true which is that you are actually married to the fair lady upon whom we have heard you make such encomiums mrs doleman and my sister both wish you joy if you are and joy upon your near prospect if you are not i have been in town for this week past to get help if i could from my paralytic complaints and am in a course for them  which nevertheless did not prevent me from making the desired inquiries this is the result  you may have a first floor wellfurnished at a mercers in bedfordstreet covent garden with what conveniences you please for servants and these either by the quarter or month the terms according to the conveniences required  mrs doleman has seen lodgings in norfolkstreet and others in cecilstreet but though the prospects to the thames and surryhills look inviting from both these streets yet i suppose they are too near the city  the owner of those in norfolkstreet would have half the house go together it would be too much for your description therefore and i suppose that you will hardly when you think fit to declare your marriage be in lodgings  those in cecilstreet are neat and convenient the owner is a widow of good character but she insists that you take them for a twelvemonth certain  you may have good accommodations in doverstreet at a widows the relict of an officer in the guards who dying soon after he had purchased his commission to which he had a good title by service and which cost him most part of what he had she was obliged to let lodgings  this may possibly be an objection but she is very careful she says that she takes no lodgers but of figure and reputation she rents two good houses distant from each other only joined by a large handsome passage the innerhouse is the genteelest and is very elegantly furnished but you may have the use of a very handsome parlour in the outerhouse if you choose to look into the street  a little garden belongs to the innerhouse in which the old gentlewoman has displayed a true female fancy and crammed it with vases flowerplots and figures without number  as these lodgings seemed to me the most likely to please you i was more particular in my inquiries about them the apartments she has to let are in the innerhouse they are a dining room two neat parlours a withdrawingroom two or three handsome bedchambers one with a pretty light closet in it which looks into the little garden all furnished in taste  a dignified clergyman his wife and maidendaughter were the last who lived in them they have but lately quitted them on his being presented to a considerable churchpreferment in ireland the gentlewoman says that he took the lodgings but for three months certain but liked them and her usage so well that he continued in them two years and left them with regret though on so good an account she bragged that this was the way of all the lodgers she ever had who staid with her four times as long as they at first intended  i had some knowledge of the colonel who was always looked upon as a man of honor his relict i never saw before i think she has a masculine air and is a little forbidding at first but when i saw her behavior to two agreeable maiden gentlewomen her husbands nieces whom for that reason she calls doubly hers and heard their praises of her i could impute her very bulk to good humor since we seldom see your four peevish people plump she lives very reputably and is as i find aforehand in the world  if these or any other of the lodgings i have mentioned be not altogether to your ladys mind she may continue in them the less while and choose others for herself  the widow consents that you should take them for a month only and what of them you please the terms she says she will not fall out upon when she knows what your lady expects and what her servants are to do or yours will undertake for she observed that servants are generally worse to deal with than their masters or mistresses  the lady may board or not as she pleases  as we suppose you married but that you have reason from familydifferences to keep it private for the present i thought it not amiss to hint as much to the widow but as uncertainty however and asked her if she could in that case accommodate you and your servants as well as the lady and hers she said she could and wished by all means it were to be so since the circumstance of a persons being single if not as well recommended as this lady was one of her usual exceptions  if none of these lodgings please you need not doubt very handsome ones in or near hanoversquare sohosquare goldensquare or in some of the new streets about grosvenorsquare and mrs doleman her sister and myself most cordially join to offer to your good lady the best accommodations we can make for her at uxbridge and also for you if you are the happy man we wish you to be till she fits herself more to her mind  let me add that the lodgings at the mercers those in cecilstreet those at the widows in doverstreet any of them may be entered upon at a days warning  i am my dear sir  your sincere and affectionate friend and servant tho doleman   you will easily guess my dear when you have read the letter which lodgings i made choice of but first to try him as in so material a point i thought i could not be too circumspect i seemed to prefer those in norfolkstreet for the very reason the writer gives why he thought i would not that is to say for its neighborhood to a city so wellgoverned as london is said to be nor should i have disliked a lodging in the heart of it having heard but indifferent accounts of the liberties sometimes taken at the other end of the town  then seeming to incline to the lodgings in cecilstreet  then to the mercers but he made no visible preference and when i asked his opinion of the widowgentlewomans he said he thought these the most to my taste and convenience but as he hoped that i would think lodgings necessary but for a very little while he knew not which to give his vote for  i then fixed upon the widows and he has written accordingly to mr doleman making my compliments to his lady and sister for their kind offer  i am to have the dining room the bedchamber with the light closet of which if i stay any time at the widows i shall make great use and a servants room and we propose to set out on saturday morning as for a maidservant poor hannahs illness is a great disappointment to me but as he says i can make the widow satisfaction for one of hers till i can get one to my mind and you know i want not much attendance  mr lovelace has just now of his own accord given me five guineas for poor hannah i send them enclosed be so good as to cause them to be conveyed to her and to let her know from whom they came  he has obliged me much by this little mark of his considerateness indeed i have the better opinion of him ever since he proposed her return to me  i have just now another instance of his considerateness he came to me and said that on second thoughts he could not bear that i should go up to town without some attendant were it but for the look of the thing to the widow and her nieces who according to his friends account lived so genteelly and especially as i required him to leave me soon after i arrived there and so would be left alone among sttrangers he therefore thought that i might engage mrs sorlings to lend me one of her two maids or to let one of her daughters go up with me and stay till i were provided and if the latter the young gentlewoman no doubt would be glad of so good an opportunity to see a little of the curiosities o the town and would be a proper attendant to me on the same occasions  i told him as i had done before that the servants and the two young gentlewomen were so equally useful in their way and servants in a busy farm were so little to be spared that i should be loath to take them off of their laudable employments nor should i think much of diversions for one while and so the less want an attendant out of doors  and now my dear lest any thing should happen in so variable a situation as mine to overcloud my prospects which at present are more promising than ever yet they have been since i quitted harloweplace i will snatch the opportunity to subscribe myself  your not unhopeing and everobliged friend and servant cl harlowe  letter xxxvii mr lovelace to john belford esquire thursday april  0 he begins with communicating to him the letter he wrote to mr doleman to procure suitable lodgings in town and which he sent away by the ladys approbation and then gives him a copy of the answer to it see p     upon which he thus expresses himself    thou know the widow thou know her nieces thou know the lodgings and did thou ever read a letter more artfully couched than this of tom doleman every possible objection anticipated every accident provided against  every little of it plot proof  who could forbear smiling to see my charmer like a farcical dean and chapter choose what was before chosen for her and sagaciously as they go in form to prayers that god would direct their choice pondering upon the different proposals as if she would make me believe she has a mind for some other the dear sly rogue looking upon me too with a view to discover some emotion in me that i can tell her lay deeper than her eye could reach though it had been a sunbeam  no confidence in me fairone none at all it is plain thou will not if i were inclined to change my views encourage me by a generous reliance on my honor  and shall it be said that i a master of arts in love shall be overmatchd by so unpractised a novice  but to see the charmer so far satisfied with my contrivance as to borrow my friends letter in order to satisfy miss how likewise  silly little rogues to walk out into bypath on the strength of their own judgments  when nothing but experience can teach them how to disappoint us and learn them grandmotherwisdom when they have it indeed then may they sit down like so many cassandras and preach caution to others who will as little mind them as they did their instructresses whenever a fine handsome confident fellow such a one as thou know who comes cross them  but belford did thou not mind that sly rogue dolemans naming doverstreet for the widows place of abode  what do think could be meant by that  it is impossible thou should guess so not to puzzle thee about it  suppose the widow sinclairs in doverstreet should be inquired after by some officious person in order to come at characters miss how is as sly as the devil and as busy to the full and neither such a name nor such a house can be found in that street nor a house to answer the description then will not the keenest hunter in england be at a fault  but how will thou do methinks thou ask to hinder the lady from resenting the fallacy and mistrusting thee the more on that account when she finds it out to be in another street  pho never mind that either i shall have a way for it or we shall thoroughly understand one another by that time or if we dont she will know enough of me not to wonder at such a peccadillo  but how will thou hinder the lady from apprising her friend of the real name  she must first know it herself monkey must she not  well but how will thou do to hinder her from knowing the street and her friend from directing letters thither which will be the same thing as if the name were known  let me alone for that too  it thou further objectest that tom doleman is too great a dunce to write such a letter in answer to mine  can thou not imagine that in order to save honest tom all this trouble i who know the town so well could send him a copy of what he should write and leave him nothing to do but transcribe  what now say thou to me belford  and suppose i had designed this task of inquiry for thee and suppose the lady excepted against thee for no other reason in the world but because of my value for thee what say thou to the lady jack  this it is to have leisure upon my hands  what a matchless plotter thy friend stand by and let me swell  i am already as big as an elephant and ten times wiser mightier too by far have i not reason to snuff the moon with my proboscis  lord help thee for a poor for a very poor creature  wonder not that i despise thee heartily  since the man who is disposed immoderately to exalt himself cannot do it but by despising everybody else in proportion  i shall make good use of the dolemanic hint of being married but i will not tell thee all at once nor indeed have i thoroughly digested that part of my plot when a general must regulate himself by the motions of a watchful adversary how can he say beforehand what he will or what he will not do  widow sinclair  did thou not say lovelace   ay sinclair jack  remember the name sinclair i repeat she has no other and her features being broad and fullblown i will suppose her to be of highland extraction as her husband the colonel mind that too was a scot as brave as honest  i never forget the minutiae in my contrivances in all doubtable matters the minutiae closely attended to and provided for are of more service than a thousand oaths vows and protestations made to supply the neglect of them and when jealousy has actually got into the working mind  thou would wonder if thou knew one half of my providence to give thee but one i have already been so good as to send up a list of books to be procured for the ladys closet mostly at secondhand and thou know that the women there are all well read but i will not anticipate  besides it looks as if i were afraid of leaving any thing to my old friend chance which has many a time been an excellent second to me and ought not to be affronted or despised especially by one who has the art of making unpromising incidents turn out in his favor  letter xxxviii miss how to miss clarissa harlowe wednesday april    i have a piece of intelligence to give you which concerns you much to know  your brother having been assured that you ar not married has taken a resolution to find you out waylay you and carry you off a friend of his a captain of a ship undertakes to get you on shipboard and to sail away with you either by hull or leith in the way to one of your brothers houses  they are very wicked for in spite of all your virtues they conclude you to be ruined but if they can be assured when they have you that you are not they will secure you till they can bring you out mrs solmes and mean time in order to give mr lovelace full employment they talk of a prosecution which will be set up against him for some crime or other that they have got a notion of which they think if it do not cost him his life will make him fly his country  this is very early news miss bell told it in confidence and with mighty triumph over lovelace to miss lloyd who is at present her favorite though as much your admirer as ever miss lloyd being very apprehensive of the mischief which might follow such an attempt told it to me with leave to apprize you privately of it  and yet neither she nor i would be sorry perhaps if lovelace were to be fairly hanged  that is to say if you my dear had no objection to it but we cannot bear that such an admirable creature should be made the tennisball of two violent spirits  much less that you should be seized and exposed to the brutal treatment of wretches who have no bowels  if you can engage mr lovelace to keep his temper upon it i think you should acquaint him with it but not to mention miss lloyd perhaps his wicked agent may come at the intelligence and reveal it to him but i leave it to your own discretion to do as you think fit in it  all my concern is that this dareing and foolish project if carried on will be a means of throwing you more into his power than ever  but as it will convince you that there can be no hope of a reconciliation i wish you were actually married let the cause for the prosecution hinted at be what it will short of murder or a rape  your hannah was very thankful for your kind present she heaped a thousand blessings upon you for it she has mr lovelaces too by this time  i am pleased with mr hickman i can tell you  for he has sent her two guineas by the person who carries mr lovelaces five as from an unknown hand nor am i or you to know it the manner more than the value i am pleased with him for but he does a great many things of this sort and is as silent as the night for nobody knows of them till the gratitude of the benefited will not let them be concealed he is nowandthen my almoner and i believe always adds to my little benefactions  but his time is not come to be praised for these things nor does he seem to want that encouragement  the man has certainly a good mind nor can we expect in one man every good quality but he is really a silly fellow my dear to trouble his head about me when he sees how much i despise his whole sex and must of course make a common man look like a fool were he not to make himself look like one by wishing to pitch his tent so oddly our likings and dislikings as i have often thought are seldom governed by prudence or with a view to happiness the eye my dear the wicked eye  has such a strict alliance with the heart  and both have such enmity to the understanding  what an unequal union the mind and body all the senses like the family at harloweplace in a confederacy against that which would animate and give honor to the whole were it allowed its proper precedence  permit me i beseech you before you go to london to send you fortyeight guineas  i mention that sum to oblige you because by accepting back the two to hannah i will hold you indebted to me fifty  surely this will induce you  you know that i cannot want the money i told you that i have near double that sum and that the half of it is more than my mamma knows i am mistress of with so little money as you have what can you do at such a place as london  you dont know what occasion you may have for messengers intelligence and suchlike  if you dont oblige me i shall not think your stomach so much down as you say it is and as in this one particular i think it ought to be  as to the state of things between my mamma and me you know enough of her temper not to need to be told that she never espouses or resents with indifference yet will she not remember that i am her daughter no truly i am all my papas girl  she was very sensible surely of the violence of my poor papas temper that she can so long remember that when acts of tenderness and affection seem quite forgotten some daughters would be tempted to think that control sat very heavy upon a mother who can endeavor to exert the power she has over a child and regret for years after death that she had not the same over a husband  if this manner of expression becomes not me of my mother it will be somewhat extenuated by the love i always bore my father and by the reverence i shall ever pay to his memory for he was a fond father and perhaps would have been as tender a husband had not my mamma and he been too much of one temper to agree  the misfortune was in short that when one was out of humor the other would be so too yet neither of their tempers comparatively bad notwithstanding all which i did not imagine girl as i was in my papas lifetime that my mammas part of the yoke sat so heavy upon her neck as she gives me room to think it did whenever she is pleased to disclaim her part of me  both parents as i have often thought should be very careful if they would secure to themselves the undivided love of their children that of all things they should avoid such durable contentions with each other as should distress their children in choosing their party when they would be glad to reverence both as they ought  but here is the thing there is not a better manager of her affairs in the sex than my mamma and i believe a notable wife is more impatient of control than an indolent one an indolent one perhaps thinks she has somewhat to compound for while women of the other character i suppose know too well their own significance to think highly of that of anybody else all must be their own way in one word because they are useful they will be more than useful  i do assure you my dear were i a man and a man who loved my quiet i would not have one of these managing wives on any consideration i would make it a matter of serious inquiry beforehand whether my mistresss qualifications if i heard she was notable were masculine or feminine ones if indeed i were an indolent supine mortal who might be in danger of becoming the property of my steward i would then perhaps choose to marry for the qualifications of a steward  but setting my mamma out of the question because she is my mamma have i not seen how lady hartley pranks up herself above all her sex because she knows how to manage affairs that do not belong to her sex to manage affairs that can do no credit to her as a woman to understand practically i mean for the theory of them may not be amiss to be known  indeed my dear i do not think a manwoman a pretty character at all and as i said were i a man i would sooner choose for a dove though it were fit for nothing but as the play says to go tame about house and breed than a wife that is setting at work my insignificant self present perhaps every busy hour my neverresting servants those of the stud not excepted and who with a besom in her hand as i may say would be continually filling me with apprehensions that she wanted to sweep me out of my own house as useless lumber  were indeed the mistress of the family like the wonderful young lady i so much and so justly admire to know how to confine herself within her own respectable rounds of the needle the pen the housekeepers bills the dairy for her amusement to see the poor fed from superfluities that would otherwise be wasted and exert herself in all the really useful branches of domestic management then would she move in her proper sphere then would she render herself amiably useful and respectably necessary then would she become the mistresswheel of the family whatever you think of your anna how i would not have her be the masterwheel and everybody would love her as everybody did you before your insolent brother came back flushed with his unmerited acquirements and turned all things topsyturvy  if you will be informed of the particulars of our contention after you have known in general that your unhappy affair was the subject why then i think i must tell you  yet how shall i  i feel my cheek glow with mingled shame and indignation  know then my dear  that i have been  as i may say  that i have been beaten  indeed it is true  my mamma thought fit to slap my hands to get from me a sheet of a letter she caught me writing to you which i tore because she should not read it and burnt it before her face  i know this will trouble you so spare yourself the labor to tell me it does  mr hickman came in presently after i would not see him i am either too much a woman to be beat or too much a child to have an humble servant  so i told my mother what can one oppose but sullens when it would be unpardonable so much as to think of lifting up a finger  in the harlowestyle she will be obeyed she says and even mr hickman shall be forbid the house if he contributes to the carryingon of a correspondence which she will not suffer to be continued  poor man he stands a whimsical chance between us but he knows he is sure of my mamma but not of me it is easy then for him to choose his party were it not his inclination to serve you as it surely is and this makes him a merit with me which otherwise he would not have had notwithstanding the good qualities which i have just now acknowleged in his favor for my dear let my faults in other respects be what they may i will pretend to say that i have in my own mind those qualities which i praised him for and if we are to come together i could for that reason better dispense with them in him  so if a husband who has a bountifultemperd wife is not a niggard nor seeks to restrain her but has an opinion of all she does that is enough for him as on the contrary if a bountifultemperd husband has a frugal wife it is best for both for one to give and the other to give except they have the prudence and are at so good an understanding with each other as to compare notes they may perhaps put it out of their power to be just good frugal doctrine my dear  but this way of putting it is middling the matter between what i have learnt of my mammas overprudent and your enlarged notions  but from doctrine to fact   i shut myself up all that day and what little i did eat at alone but at night she sent up kitty with a command upon my obedience to attend her at supper  i went down but most gloriously in the sullens yes and no were great words with me to every thing she asked of me for a good while  that behavior she told me should not do for her  beating should not with me i said  my bold resistance she told me had provoked her to slap my hand and she was sorry to have been so provoked but again insisted that i would either give up my correspondence absolutely or let her see all that passed in it  i must not do either i told her it was unsuitable both to my inclination and to my honor at the instigation of base minds to give up a friend in distress  she rung all the maternal changes upon the words duty obedience filial obligation and soforth  i told her that a duty too rigorously and unreasonably exacted had been your ruin if you were ruined if i were of age to be married i hoped she would think me capable of making or at least of keeping my own friendships such a one especially as this with a young lady whose friendship she herself till this distressful point of time had thought the most useful and edifying that i ever had contracted  the greater the merit the worse the action the finer the talents the more dangerous the example  there were other duties i said besides that of a child to a parent and i hoped i need not give up a suffering friend especially at the instigation of those by whom she suffered i told her that it was very hard to annex such a condition as that to my duty when i was persuaded that both duties might be performed without derogating from either that an unreasonable command she must excuse me i must say it though i were slapt again was a degree of tyranny and i could not have expected that at these years i should be allowed no will no choice of my own where a woman only was concerned and the devilish sex not in the question  what turned most in favor of her argument was that i desired to be excused from letting her read all that passes between us she insisted much upon this and since she said you were in the hands of the most intriguing man in the world and a man who had made a jest of her favorite hickman as she has been told she knows not what consequences unthought of by you or me may flow from such a correspondence  so you see my dear that i fare the worse on mr hickmans account my mamma might see all that passes between us did i not know that it would cramp your spirit and restrain the freedom of your pen as it would also the freedom of my own and were she not moreover so firmly attached to the contrary side that inferences consequences strained deductions censures and constructions the most partial would for ever be hawled in to teaze me and would perpetually subject us to the necessity of debating and canvassing  besides i dont choose that she should know how much this artful wretch has outwitted as i may call it a lady so much his superior  the generosity of your heart and the greatness of your mind a mind above selfish considerations full well i know but do not offer to dissuade me from this correspondence  mr hickman immediately on the contention above offered his service and i accepted of it as you will see by my last he thinks though he has all honor for my mamma that she is unkind to us both he was pleased to tell me with an air as i thought that he not only approved of our correspondence but admires the steadiness of my friendship and having no opinion of your man but a great one of me thinks that my advice or intelligence from time to time may be of use to you and on this presumption said that it would be a thousand pities that you should suffer for want of either  mr hickman pleased me in the main by his speech and it is well the general tenor of it was agreeable  otherwise i can tell him i should have reckoned with him for his word approve for it is a style i have not yet permitted him to talk to me in  and you see my dear what these men are  no sooner do they find that you have favored them with the power of doing you an agreeable service but they take upon them to approve forsooth of your actions  by which is implied a right to disapprove if they think fit  i have told my mamma how much you wish to be reconciled to your relations and how independent you are on mr lovelace  mark the end of the latter assertion she says  and as to reconciliation she knows nothing will do and will have it that nothing ought to do but your returning back without presuming to condition with them and this if you do she says will best show your independence on lovelace  you see my dear what your duty is in my mammas opinion  i suppose your next directed to mr hickman at his own house will be from london  heaven preserve you in honor and safety is my prayer  what you do for change of clothes i cannot imagine  it is amazing to me what your relations can mean by distressing you as they seem resolved to do i see they will throw you into his arms whether you will or not  i send this by robert for dispatchsake and can only repeat the hitherto rejected offer of my best services adieu my dearest friend believe me ever  your affectionate and faithful anna how  letter xxxix miss clarissa harlowe to miss how thursday april  0 i should think myself utterly unworthy of your friendship did my own concerns heavy as they are so ingross me that i could not find leisure for a few lines to declare to my beloved friend my sincere disapprobation of her conduct in an instance where she is so generously faulty that the consciousness of that very generosity may hide from her the fault which i more than any other have reason to deplore as being the unhappy occasion of it  you know you say that your account of the contentions between your mamma and you will trouble me and so you bid me spare myself the labor to tell you that they do  you did not use my dear to forbid me thus beforehand you was wont to say you loved me the better for my expostulations with you on that acknowleged warmth and quickness of your temper which your own good sense taught you to be apprehensive of what though i have so miserably fallen and am unhappy if ever i had any judgment worth regarding it is now as much worth as ever because i can give it as freely against myself as against anybody else and shall i not when there seems to be an infection in my fault and that it leads you likewise to resolve to carry on a correspondence against prohibition expostulate with you upon it when whatever consequences flow from your disobedience but widen my error which is as the evil root from which such bad branches spring  the mind that can glory in being capable of so noble so firm so unshaken a friendship as that of my dear miss how a friendship which no casualty or distress can lessen but which increases with the misfortunes of its friend  such a mind must be above taking amiss the wellmeant admonitions of that distinguished friend i will not therefore apologize for my freedom on this subject and the less need i when that freedom is the result of an affection in the very instance so absolutely disinterested that it tends to deprive myself of the only comfort left me  your acknowleged sullens your tearing from your mammas hands the letter she thought she had a right to see and burning it as you own before her face your refusal to see the man who is so willing to obey you for the sake of your unhappy friend and this purely to vex your mamma can you think my dear upon this brief recapitulation of hardly one half of the faulty particulars you give that these faults are excusable in one who so well knows her duty  your mamma had a good opinion of me once is not that a reason why she should be more regarded now when i have as she believes so deservedly forfeited it a prejudice in favor is as hard to be totally overcome as a prejudice in disfavour in what a strong light then must that error appear to her that should so totally turn her heart against me herself not a principal in the case  there are other duties you say besides that of a child to a parent but that must be a prior duty to all other duties a duty anterior as i may say to your very birth and what duty ought not to give way to that when they come in competition  you are persuaded that both duties may be performed without derogating from either she thinks otherwise what is the conclusion to be drawn from these premises  when your mamma sees how much i suffer in my reputation from the step i have taken from whom she and all the world expected better things how much reason has she to be watchful over you one evil draws another after it and how knows she or any body where it may stop  does not the person who will vindicate or seek to extenuate a faulty step in another in this light must your mamma look upon the matter in question between you give an indication either of a culpable will or a weak judgment  and may not she apprehend that the censorious will think that such a one might probably have equally failed under the same inducements and provocations to use your own words in a former letter applied to me  can there be a stronger instance in human life than mine has so early furnished within a few months past not to mention the uncommon provocations to it which i have met with of the necessity of the continuance of a watchful parents care over a daughter let that daughter have obtained ever so great a reputation for her prudence  is not the space from sixteen to twentyone that which requires this care more than any time of a young womans life for in that period do we not generally attract the eyes of the other sex and become the subject of their addresses and not seldom of their attempts and is not that the period in which our conduct or misconduct gives us a reputation or disreputation that almost inseparably accompanies us throughout our whole future lives  are we not then most in danger from ourselves because of the distinction with which we are apt to behold particulars of that sex  and when our dangers multiply both from within and without do not our parents know that their vigilance ought to be doubled  and shall that necessary increase of care sit uneasy upon us because we are grown up to stature and womanhood  will you tell me if so what is the precise stature and age at which a good child shall conclude herself absolved from the duty she owes to a parent  and at which a parent after the example of the dams of the brute creation is to lay aside all care and tenderness for her offspring  is it so hard for you my dear to be treated like a child and can you not think it as hard for a good parent to imagine herself under the unhappy necessity of so treating her womangrown daughter  do you think if your mamma had been you and you your mamma and your daughter had struggled with you as you did with her that you would not have been as apt as your mamma was to have slapt your daughters hands to have made her quit her hold to you and give up the prohibited paper  it is a great truth that your mamma told you that you provoked her to this harshness and a great condescension in her and not taken notice of by you as it deserved to say that she was sorry for it  at every age on this side matrimony for then we come under another sort of protection though that is far from abrogating the filial duty it will be found that the wings of our parents are our most necessary and most effectual safeguard to preserve us from the vulturs the hawks the kites and the other villainous birds of prey that hover over us with a view to seize and destroy us the first time we are caught wandering out of the eye or care of our watchful and natural guardians and protectors  hard as you may suppose it to be denied the continuance of a correspondence once so much approved even by the reverend denier  yet if your mamma think that my fault is of such a nature as that a correspondence with me will cast a shade upon your reputation all my own friends having given me up  that hardship is to be submitted to and must it not make her the more strenuous to support her own opinion when she sees the first fruits of this tenaciousness of your side is to be gloriously in the sullens as you call it and in a disobedient opposition  i know my dear you mean an humorousness in that expression which in most cases gives a delightful poignancy both to your conversation and correspondence  but indeed my dear this case will not bear it  will you give me leave to add to this tedious expostulation that i by no means approve of some of the things you write in relation to the manner in which your father and mother lived  at times  only at times i dare say though perhaps too often   your mamma is answerable to anybody rather than to her child for whatever was wrong in her conduct if any thing was wrong toward mr how a gentleman of whose memory i will only say that it ought to be revered by you  but yet should you not examine yourself whether your displeasure at your mamma had no part in your revived reverence for your papa at the time you wrote  no one is perfect and although your mamma may not be so right to remember disagreeablenesses against the departed yet should you not want to be reminded on whose account and on what occasion she remembered them  you cannot judge nor ought you to attempt to judge of what might have passed between both to keep awake and imbitter disagreeable remembrances in the survivor  letter xl miss clarissa harlowe in continuation but this subject must not be pursued another might with more pleasure though not with more approbation upon one of your lively excursions it is upon the high airs you give yourself upon the word approve  how comes it about i wonder that a young lady so noted for a predominating generosity should not be uniformly generous  that your generosity should fail in an instance where policy prudence gratitude would not permit it to fail mr hickman as you confess has indeed a worthy mind if i had not long ago known that he would never have found an advocate in me for the favor of my anna how often and often have i been concerned when i was your happy guest to see him after a conversation in which he had wellsupported his part in your absence sink at once into silence the moment you came into company  i have told you of this before and i believe i hinted to you once that the superciliousness you put on only to him was capable of a construction which at the time would have very little gratified your pride to have had made since it was as much in his favor as in your own disfavour  mr hickman my dear is a modest man i never see a modest man but i am sure if he has not wanted opportunities that he has a treasure in his mind which requires nothing but the key of encouragement to unlock it to make him shine while a confident man who to be confident must think as meanly of his company as highly of himself enters with magisterial airs upon any subject and depending upon his assurance to bring himself off when found out talks of more than he is master of  but a modest man  o my dear shall not a modest woman distinguish and wish to consort with a modest man  a man before whom and to whom she may open her lips secure of his good opinion of all she says and of his just and polite regard for her judgment and who must therefore inspire her with an agreeable confidence  what a lot have i drawn  we are all apt to turn teachers  but surely i am better enabled to talk to write upon these subjects than ever i was  but i will banish myself if possible from an address which when i began to write i was determined to confine wholly to your own particular  my dearest dearest friend how ready are you to tell us what others should do and even what a mother should have done but indeed you once i remember advanced that as different seize required different talents to master them so in the writingway a person might not be a bad critic upon the works of others although he might himself be unable to write with excellence but will you permit me to account for all this readiness of finding fault by placing it to human nature which being sensible of the defects of human nature that is to say of its own defects loves to be correcting but in exercising that talent chooses rather to turn its eye outward than inward  in other words to employ itself rather in the outdoor search than in the indoor examination  and here give me leave to add and yet it is with tender reluctance that although you say very pretty things of notable wives and although i join with you in opinion that husbands may have as many inconveniences to encounter with as conveniences to boast of from women of that character yet lady hartley perhaps would have had milder treatment from your pen had it not been dipped in gall with a mother in your eye  letter xli miss clarissa harlowe in continuation and now my dear a few words as to the prohibition laid upon you a subject that i have frequently touched upon but cursorily because i was afraid to trust myself with it knowing that my judgment if i did would condemn my practice  you command me not to attempt to dissuade you from this correspondence and you tell me how kindly mr hickman approves of it and how obliging he is to me to permit it to be carried on under cover to him  but this does not quite satisfy me  i am a very bad casuist and the pleasure i take in writing to you who are the only one to whom i can disburden my mind may make me as i have hinted very partial to my own wishes  else if it were not an artful evasion beneath an open and frank heart to wish to be complied with i would be glad methinks to be permitted still to write to you and only have such occasional returns by mr hickmans pen as well as cover as might set me right when i am wrong confirm me when right and guide me where i doubt this would enable me to proceed in the difficult path before me with more assuredness for whatever i suffer from the censures of others if i can preserve your good opinion i shall not be altogether unhappy let what will befall me  and indeed my dear i know not how to forbear writing i have now no other employment or diversion and i must write on although i were not to send it to anybody you have often heard me own the advantages i have found from writing down every thing of moment that befalls me and of all i think and of all i do that may be of future use to me  for besides that this helps to form one to a style and opens and expands the ductile mind every one will find that many a good thought evaporates in thinking many a good resolution goes off driven out of memory perhaps by some other not so good but when i set down what i will do or what i have done on this or that occasion the resolution or action is before me either to be adhered to withdrawn or amended and i have entered into compact with myself as i may say having given it under my own hand to improve rather than go backward as i live longer  i would willingly therefore write to you if i might the rather as it would be more inspiriting to have some end in view in what i write some friend to please besides merely seeking to gratify my passion for scribbling  but why if your mamma will permit our correspondence on communicating to her all that passes in it and if she will condescend to one only condition may it not be complied with  would she not do you think my dear be prevailed upon to have the communication made to her in confidence  if there were any prospect of a reconciliation with my friends i should not have so much regard for my pride as to be afraid of anybodys knowing how much i have been outwitted as you call it i would in that case when i had left mr lovelace acquaint your mamma and all my own friends with the whole of my story it would behove me so to do for my own reputation and for their satisfaction  but if i have no such prospect what will the communication of my reluctance to go away with mr lovelace and of his arts to frighten me away avail me  your mamma has hinted that my friends would insist upon my returning to them as a proof of the truth of my plea to be disposed of without condition at their pleasure if i scrupled this my brother would rather triumph over me than keep my secret  mr lovelace whose pride already so ill brooks my regrets for meeting him when he thinks if i had not i must have been mr solmess wife would perhaps treat me with indignity  and thus deprived of all refuge and protection i should become the scoff of men of intrigue and be thought a greater disgrace than ever to my sex  since love and consequential marriage will find more excuses than perhaps ought to be found for actions premeditatedly rash  but if your mamma will receive the communications in confidence pray show her all that i have written or shall write if my past conduct deserves not heavy blame i shall then perhaps have the benefit of her advice as well as yours and if i shall wilfully deserve blame for the time to come i will be contented to be denied yours as well as hers for ever  as to cramping my spirit as you call it were i to sit down to write what i know your mamma must see that my dear is already cramped and do not think so unhandsomely of your mamma as to fear that she would make partial constructions against me neither you nor i can doubt but that had she been left unprepossessedly to herself she would have shown favor to me and so i dare say would my uncle antony  nay my dear i can extend my charity still further for i am sometimes of opinion that were my brother and sister absolutely certain that they had ruined me beyond recovery in the opinion of both my uncles so far as that they need not be apprehensive of my clashing with their interests they would not oppose a pardon although they might not wish a reconciliation  especially if i would make a few sacrifices to them  which i assure you i should be inclined to make were i wholly free and independent of this man  you know i never valued myself upon worldly acquisitions nor upon my grandfathers bequests but as they enlarged my power to do things i loved to do and if i were denied the power i must as i now do curb my inclination  do not however think me guilty of an affectation in what i have said of my brother and sister severe enough i am sure it is in the most favorable sense and an indifferent person will be of opinion that they are much better warranted than ever for the sake of the familyhonour to seek to ruin me in the favor of all my friends  but to the former topic  try my dear if your mamma will upon the condition abovegiven permit our correspondence on seeing all we write but if she will not what a selfishness would there be in my love to you were i to wish you to forego your duty for my sake  and now one word as to the freedom i have treated you with in this tedious expostulatory address i presume upon your forgiveness of it because few friendships are founded on such a basis as ours  which is freely to give reproof and thankfully to receive it as occasions arise that so either may have opportunity to clear up mistakes to acknowledge and amend errors as well in behavior as in words and deeds and to rectify and confirm each other in the judgment each shall form upon persons things and circumstances and all this upon the following consideration that it is much more eligible as well as honorable to be corrected with the gentleness of an undoubted friend than by continuing either blind or wilful to expose ourselves to the censures of an envious and perhaps malignant world  but it is as needless i dare say to remind you of this as it is to repeat my request that you will not in your turn spare the follies and the faults of  your everaffectionate cl harlowe subjoined to the above i said that i would avoid writing any thing of my own particular affairs in the above address if i could  i will write one letter more to inform you how we stand but my dear you must permit that one which will require your advice and your answer to it and the copy of one i have written to my aunt to be the last that shall pass between us while the prohibition continues  i fear i very much fear that my unhappy situation will draw me in to be guilty of evasion of little affectations and of curvings from the plain simple truth which i was wont to value myself upon but allow me to say and this for your sake and in order to lessen your mothers fears of any ill consequences that she might apprehend from our correspondence that if i am at any time guilty of a failure in these respects i will not go on in it but repent and seek to recover my lost ground that i may not bring error into habit  i have deferred going to town at mrs sorlingss earnest request but have fixed my removal to monday as i shall acquaint you in my next i have already made a progress in that next but having an unexpected opportunity will send this by itself    letter xlii miss how to miss clarissa harlowe friday morn april    my mamma will not comply with your condition my dear i hinted it to her as from myself  but the harlowes excuse me have got her entirely in with them it is a scheme of mine she told me to draw her into your party against your parents  which for her own sake she is very careful about  dont be so much concerned about my mamma and me once more i beg of you we shall do well enough together now a fallingout now a fallingin it used to be so when you were not in the question  yet do i give you my sincere thanks for every line of your reprehensive letters which i intend to read as often as i find my temper rises  i will freely own that i winced a little at first reading them but i see that in every reperusal i shall love and honor you still more if possible than before  yet i think i have one advantage over you and which i will hold through this letter and through all my future letters that is that i will treat you as freely as you treat me and yet will never think an apology necessary to you for my freedom  but this is the effect of your gentleness of temper with a little sketch of implied reflection on the warmth of mine  gentleness in a woman you hold to be no fault  nor do i a little due or provoked warmth  but what is this but praising on both sides what neither of us can help nor perhaps wish to help you can no more go out of your road than i can go out of mine it would be a pain to either to do so  what then is it in eithers approving of her own natural bias but making a virtue of necessity  but one observation i will add that were your character and my character to be truly drawn mine would be allowed to be the most natural shades and lights are equally necessary in a fine picture yours would be surrounded with such a flood of brightness with such a glory that it would indeed dazzle but leave one heartless to imitate it  o may you not suffer from a base world for your gentleness while my temper by its warmth keeping all imposition at distance though less amiable in general affords me not reason as i have mentioned heretofore to wish to make an exchange with you  i should indeed be inexcuseable to open my lips by way of contradiction to my mamma had i such a fine spirit as yours to deal with  truth is truth my dear  why should narrowness run away with the praises due to a noble expansion of heart  if everybody would speak out as i do that is to say give praise where only praise is due dispraise where due likewise shame if not principle would mend the world  nay shame would introduce principle in a generation or two  very true my dear  do you apply  i dare not  for i fear you almost as much as i love you  i will give you an instance nevertheless which will anew demonstrate that none but very generous and nobleminded people ought to be implicitly obeyed you know what i said above that truth is truth  inconveniences will sometimes arise from having to do with persons of modesty and scrupulousness mr hickman you say is a modest man he put your corrective packet into my hand with a very fine bow and a selfsatisfyd air well consider what you say of this honest man byandby my dear his strut was not gone off when in came my mamma as i was reading it  when some folks find their anger has made them considerable they will be always angry or seeking occasions for anger  why now mr hickman  why now nancy as i was putting the packet into my bosom at her entrance  you have a letter brought you this instant  while the modest man with his pausing brayings madda  maddam looked as if he knew not whether he had best to run and leave me and my mamma to fight it out or to stand his ground and see fair play  it would have been poor to tell a lie for it  she flung away i went out at the opposite door to read it leaving mr hickman to exercise his white teeth upon his thumbnails  when i had read your letters i went to find out my mamma i told her the generous contents and that you desired that the prohibition might be adhered to  i proposed your condition as from myself and was rejected as above  she supposed she was finely painted between two young creatures who had more wit than prudence and instead of being prevailed upon by the generosity of your sentiments made use of your opinion only to confirm her own and renewed her prohibitions charging me to return no other answer but that she did renew them adding that they should stand till your relations were reconciled to you hinting as if she had engaged for as much and expected my compliance  i thought of your reprehensions and was meek though not pleased and let me tell you my dear that as long as i can satisfy my own mind that good is intended and that it is hardly possible that evil should ensue from our correspondence as long as i know that this prohibition proceeds originally from the same spightful minds which have been the occasion of all these mischiefs as long as i know that it is not your fault if your relations are not reconciled to you and that upon conditions which no reasonable people would refuse  you must give me leave with all deference to your judgment and to your excellent lessons which would reach almost every other case of this kind but the present to insist upon your writing to me and that minutely as if this prohibition had not been laid  it is not from humor from perverseness that i insist upon this i cannot express how much my heart is in your concerns and you must in short allow me to think that if i can do you service by writing i shall be better justified by continuing to write than my mamma is by her prohibition  but yet to satisfy you all i can i will as seldom return answers while the interdict lasts as may be consistent with my notions of friendship and the service i owe you and can do you  as to your expedient of writing by hickman and now my dear your modest man comes in and as you love modesty in that sex i will do my endeavor by a proper distance to keep him in your favour i know what you mean by it my sweet friend it is to make that man significant with me as to the correspondence that shall go on i do assure you be as scrupulous as you please  so that that will not suffer if i do not close with your proposal as to him  i think i must tell you that it will be honor enough for him to have his name made use of so frequently betwixt us this of itself is placing a confidence in him that will make him walk bolt upright and display his white hand and his fine diamond ring and most mightily lay down his services and his pride to oblige and his diligence and his fidelity and his contrivances to keep our secret and his excuses and his evasions to my mamma when challenged by her with fifty ands beside and will it not moreover give him pretense and excuse oftener than ever to padnag it hither to good mrs howes fair daughter  but to admit him into my company tete a tete and into my closet as often as i would wish to write to you i only to dictate to his pen  my mamma all the time supposing that i was going to be heartily in love with him  to make him master of my sentiments and of my heart as i may say when i write to you  indeed my dear i will not nor were i married to the best he in england would i honor him with the communication of my correspondencies  no my dear it is sufficient surely for him to parade it in the character of our letterconveyer and to be honored in a cover and never fear but modest as you think him he will make enough of that  you are always blaming me for want of generosity to this man and for abuse of power but i profess my dear i cannot tell how to help it do dear now let me spread my plumes a little and nowandthen make myself feared this is my time you know since it will be no more to my credit than to his to give myself those airs when i am married he has a joy when i am pleased with him that he would not know but for the pain my displeasure gives him  this i am satisfied will be the consequence if i do not make him quake nowandthen he will endeavor to make me fear all the animals in the creation are more or less in a state of hostility with each other the wolf that runs away from a lion will devour a lamb the next moment i remember that i was once so enraged at a gamechicken that was continually pecking at another a poor humble one as i thought him that i had the offender caught and without more ado in a pet of humanity wrung his neck off what followed this execution  why that other grew insolent as soon as his insulter was gone and was continually pecking at one or two under him peck and be hanged said i  i might as well have preserved the first for i see it is the nature of the beast  excuse my flippancies i wish i were with you i would make you smile in the midst of your gravest airs as i used to do  o that you had accepted of my offer to attend you  but nothing that i offer will you accept  take care you will make me very angry with you and when i am you know i value nobody  for dearly as i love you i must be and cannot always help it  your saucy anna how  letter xliii miss clarissa harlowe to miss how friday april    mr lovelace communicated to me this morning early from his intelligencer the news of my brothers scheme i like him the better for making very light of it and for his treating it with contempt and indeed had i not had the hint of it from you i should have suspected it to be some contrivance of his in order to hasten me to town where he has long wished to be himself  he read me the passage in that lemans letter pretty much to the effect of what you wrote to me from miss lloyd with this addition that one singleton a matter of a scots vessel is the man who is to be the principal in this act of violence  i have seen him he has been twice entertained at harloweplace as my brothers friend he has the air of a very bold and fearless man and i fancy it must be his project as my brother i suppose talks to everybody of the rash step i have taken having not spared me before he had this seeming reason to censure me  this singleton lives at leith so perhaps i am to be carried to my brothers house not far from that port  putting these passages together i am not a little apprehensive that the design lightly as mr lovelace from his fearless temper treats it may be attempted to be carried into execution and of the consequences that may attend it if it be  i asked mr lovelace seeing him so frank and cool what he would advise me to do  shall i ask you madam what are your own thoughts  why i return the question said he is because you have been so very earnest that i should leave you as soon as you are in london that i know not what to propose without offending you  my opinion is said i that i should studiously conceal myself from the knowledge of everybody but miss how and that you should leave me out of hand since they will certainly conclude that where one is the other is not far off and it is easier to trace you than me  you would not surely wish said he to fall into your brothers hands by such a violent measure as this  i propose not to throw myself officiously in their way but should they have reason to think i avoided them would not that whet their diligence to find you and their courage to attempt to carry you off and subject me to insults that no man of spirit can bear  lord bless me said i to what has this one fatal step that i have been betrayed into   dearest madam let me beseech you to forbear this harsh language when you see by this new scheme how determined they were upon carrying their old ones had you not been betrayed as you call it have i offered to defy the laws of society as this brother of yours must do if any thing be intended by this project  i hope you will be pleased to observe that there are as violent and as wicked enterprizers as myself  but this is so very wild a project that i think there can be no room for apprehensions from it  i know your brother well when at college he had always a romantic turn but never had a head for any thing but to puzzle and confound himself a half invention and a whole conceit and without any talents to do himself good or others harm but as those others gave him the power by their own folly built upon his presumption  this is very volubly run off sir  but violent spirits are but too much alike at least in their methods of resenting you will not presume to make yourself a less innocent man surely who had determined to brave my whole family in person if my folly had not saved you the rashness and them the insult   dear madam  still must it be folly rashness  it is as impossible for you to think tolerably of anybody out of your own family as it is for any one in it to deserve your love  forgive me dearest creature  if i did not love you as no man ever loved a woman i might appear more indifferent to preferences so undeservedly made  but let me ask you madam what have you borne from me  what cause have i given you to treat me with so much severity and so little confidence  and what have you not borne from them  my general character may have been against me but what of your own knowledge have you against me  i was startled but i was resolved not to desert myself  is this a time mr lovelace is this a proper occasion to give yourself these high airs to me a young creature destitute of protection  it is a surprising question you ask me had i aught against you of my own knowledge  i can tell you sir  and away i would have flung  he snatched my hand and besought me not to leave him in displeasure  he pleaded his passion for me and my severity to him and partiality for those from whom i had suffered so much and whose intended violence he said was now the subject of our deliberation  i was forced to hear him  you condescended dearest creature said he to ask my advice  it is very easy give me leave to say to advise you what to do i hope i may on this new occasion speak without offense notwithstanding your former injunctions  you see that there can be no hope of reconciliation with your relations  can you madam consent to honor with your hand a wretch whom you have never yet obliged with one voluntary favor   what a recriminating what a reproachful way my dear was this of putting a question of this nature   i expected not from him at the time either the question or the manner  i am ashamed to recollect the confusion i was thrown into  all your advice in my head at the moment yet his words so prohibitory he confidently seemed to enjoy my confusion indeed my dear he knows not what respectful love is and gazed upon me as if he would have looked me through  he was still more declarative afterward indeed as i shall mention byandby but it was halfextorted from him  my heart struggled violently between resentment and shame to be thus teazed by one who seemed to have all his passions at command at a time when i had very little over mine till at last i burst into tears and was going from him in high disgust when throwing his arms about me with an air however the most tenderly respectful he gave a stupid turn to the subject  it was far from his heart he said to take so much advantage of the straight which the discovery of my brothers foolish project had brought me into as to renew without my permission a proposal which i had hitherto discountenanced and which for that reason   and then he came with his halfsentences apologizing for what he had hardly half proposed  surely he had not the insolence to intend to teaze me to see if i could be brought to speak what became me not to speak  but whether he had or not it did teaze me insomuch that my very heart was fretted and i broke out at last into fresh tears and a declaration that i was very unhappy and just then recollecting how like a tame fool i stood with his arms about me i flung from him with indignation but he seized my hand as i was going out of the room and upon his knees besought my stay for one moment and then tendered himself in words the most clear and explicit to my acceptance as the most effectual means to disappoint my brothers scheme and set all right  but what could i say to this  extorted from him as it seemed to me rather as the effect of his compassion than of his love what could i say  i paused i looked silly i am sure i looked very silly he suffered me to pause and look silly waiting for me to say something and at last ashamed of my confusion and aiming to make an excuse for it i told him that i desired he would avoid such measures as might add to an uneasiness which was so visible upon reflecting on the irreconcileableness of my friends and what unhappy consequences might follow from this unaccountable project of my brother  he promised to be governed by me in every thing and again the wretch asked me if i forgave him for the humble suit he had made to me what had i to do but to try for a palliation of my confusion since it served me not  i told him i had hopes it would not be long before mr morden arrived and doubted not that he would be the readier to engage in my favor when he found that i made no other use of his mr lovelaces assistance than to free myself from the addresses of a man so disagreeable to me as mr solmes i must therefore wish that every thing might remain as it was till i could hear from my cousin  this although teazed by him as i was was not a denial you see my dear but he must throw himself into a heat rather than try to persuade which any other man in his situation i should think would have done and this warmth obliged me to adhere to my seeming negative  this was what he said with a vehemence that must harden any womans mind who had a spirit above being frighted into passiveness  good god  and will you madam still resolve to show me that i am to hope for no share in your favor while any the remotest prospect remains that you will be received by my bitterest enemies at the price of my utter rejection  this was what i returned with warmth and with a salving art too  you have seen mr lovelace how much my brothers violence can affect me but you will be mistaken if you let loose yours upon me with a thought of terrifying me into measures the contrary of which you have acquiesced with  he only besought me to suffer his future actions to speak for him and if i saw him worthy of any favor that i would not let him be the only person within my knowledge who was not entitled to my consideration  you refer to a future time mr lovelace so do i for the future proof of a merit you seem to think for the past time wanting and justly you think so and i was again going from him  one word more he begged me to hear  he was determined studiously to avoid all mischief and every step that might lead to mischief let my brothers proceedings short of a violence upon my person be what they would but if any attempt that should extend to that were to be made would i have him to be a quiet spectator of my being seized or carried back or aboard by this singleton or in case of extremity was he not permitted to stand up in my defense  stand up in my defense mr lovelace  i should be very miserable were there to be a call for that but do you think i might not be safe and private in london  by your friends description of the widows house i should think i might be safe there  the widows house he replied as described by his friend being a backhouse within a frontone and looking to a garden rather than a street had the appearance of privacy but if when there it was not approved it would be easy to find another more to my liking  though as to his part the method he would advise should be to write to my uncle harlowe as one of my trustees and wait the issue of it here at mrs sorlingss fearlesly directing it to be answered hither to be afraid of little spirits was but to encourage insults he said the substance of the letter should be to demand as a right what they would refuse if requested as a courtesy to acknowledge that i had put myself too well he said did their treatment justify me into the protection of the ladies of his family by whose orders and lord ms he himself would appear to act but that it was upon my own terms which laid me under no obligation to them for the favor it being no more than they would have granted to any one of my sex equally distressed if i approved not of this method happy should he think himself he said if i would honor him with the opportunity of making such a claim in his own name  but this was a point with his buts again that he durst but just touch upon he hoped however that i would think their violence a sufficient inducement for me to take such a wishedfor resolution  inwardly vexed i told him that he himself had proposed to leave me when i was in town that i expected he would and that when i was known to be absolutely indepdent i should consider what to write and what to do but that while he was hanging about me i neither would nor could  he would be very sincere with me he said this project of my brothers had changed the face of things he must before he left me see how i liked the london widow and her family if i chose to go thither they might be people whom my brother might buy but if he saw they were persons of integrity he then might go for a day or two or so but he must needs say he could not leave me longer  do you propose sir said i to take up your lodgings in the same house  he did not he said as he knew the use i intended to make of his absence and my punctilio  and yet the house where he had lodgings was newfronting but he could go to his friend belfords in soho or perhaps to the same gentlemans house at edgware and return on mornings till he had reason to think this wild project of my brothers laid aside but no farther till then would he venture  the result of all was to set out on monday next for town i hope it will be in a happy hour  i cannot my dear say too often how much i am  your everobliged cl harlowe  letter xliv mr lovelace to john belford esquire friday april    as it was not probable that the lady could give so particular an account of her own confusion in the affecting scene she mentions on his offering himself to her acceptance the following extracts are made from his of the above date    and now belford what will thou say if like the fly buzzing about the bright taper i had like to have sindgd the silken wings of my liberty  never was man in greater danger of being caught in his own snares  all his views anticipated all his schemes untried and not having brought the admirable creature to town nor made an effort to know if she be really angel or woman  i offered myself to her acceptance with a suddenness it is true that gave her no time to wrap herself in reserve and in terms less tender than fervent tending to upbraid her for her past indifference and reminding her of her injunctions  for it was her brothers plot not love of me that had inclined her to dispense with them  i never beheld so sweet a confusion what a glory to the pencil could it do justice to it and to the mingled impatience which visibly informed every feature of the most meaning and most beautiful face in the world she hemmed twice or thrice her look now so charmingly silly then so sweetly significant till at last the lovely teazer teazed by my hesitating expectation of her answer out of all power of articulate speech burst into tears and was turning from me with precipitation when taking the liberty of folding her in my happy arms  o think not best beloved of my heart think not that this motion which you may believe to be so contrary to your former injunctions proceeds from a design to avail myself of the cruelty of your relations if i have disobliged you by it and you know with what respectful tenderness i have presumed to hint it it shall be my utmost care for the future  there i stopped   then she spoke but with vexation  i am  i am  very unhappy  tears trickling down her crimson cheeks and her sweet face as my arms still incircled the finest waist in the world sinking upon my shoulder the dear creature so absent that she knew not the honor she permitted me  but why but why unhappy my dearest life said i  all the gratitude that ever overflowed the heart of the most obliged of men  justice to myself there stopped my mouth for what gratitude did i owe her for obligations so involuntary  then recovering herself and her usual reserves and struggling to free herself from my clasping arms how now sir said she with a cheek more indignantly glowing and eyes of a fiercer luster  i gave way to her angry struggle  but absolutely overcome by so charming a display of innocent confusion i caught hold of her hand as she was flying from me and kneeling at her feet o my angel said i quite destitute of reserve and hardly knowing the tenor of my own speech and had a parson been there i had certainly been a gone man receive the vows of your faithful lovelace  make him yours and only yours for ever  this will answer every end  who will dare to form plots and stratagems against my wife that you are not so is the ground of all their foolish attempts and of their insolent hopes in solmess favor  o be mine  i beseech you thus on my knee i beseech you to be mine  we shall then have all the world with us and everybody will applaud an event that everybody expects  was the devil in me  i no more intended all this ecstatic nonsense than i thought the same moment of flying in the air  all power is with this charming creature  it is i not she at this rate that must fail in the arduous trial  did thou ever before hear of a man uttering solemn things by an involuntary impulse in defiance of premeditation and of all his own proud schemes but this sweet creature is able to make a man forego every purpose of his heart that is not favorable to her  and i verily think i should be inclined to spare her all further trial and yet no trial has she had were it not for the contention that her vigilance has set on foot which shall overcome the other thou know my generosity to my uncontending rosebud  and sometimes do i qualify my ardent aspirations after even this very fine creature by this reflection  that the charmingst woman on earth were she an empress can excel the meanest in the customary visibles only  such is the equality of the dispensation to the prince and the peasant in this prime gift woman  well but what was the result of this involuntary impulse on my part would thou not think i was taken at my offer  an offer so solemnly made and on one knee too  no such thing  the pretty trifler let me off as easily as i could have wished  her brothers project and to find that there were no hopes of a reconciliation for her and the apprehension she had of the mischiefs that might ensue  these not my offer nor love of me were the causes to which she ascribed all her sweet confusion  high treason the ascription against my sovereign pride  to make marriage with me but a secondplace refuge  and as good as to tell me that her confusion was owing to her concern that there were no hopes that my enemies would accept of her intended offer to renounce a man who had ventured his life for her and was still ready to run the same risk in her behalf  i reurged her to make me happy  but i was to be postponed to her cousin mordens arrival on him are now placed all her hopes  i raved but to no purpose  another letter was to be sent or had been sent to her aunt hervey to which she hoped an answer  yet sometimes i think that fainter and fainter would have been her procrastinations had i been a man of courage  but so fearful was i of offending   a confounded thing the man to be so bashful the lady to want so much courting  how shall two such come together no kind mediatress in the way  but i cannot help it i must be contented it is seldom however that a love so ardent meets with a spirit so resigned in the same person but true love i am now convinced only wishes nor has it any active will but that of the adorable object  but o the charming creature again to mention london of herself  had singletons plot been of my own contriving it could not have been a happier expedient to hasten her thither after she had deferred her journey  for what reason deferred it i cannot divine  i enclose the letter from joseph leman which i mentioned to thee in mine of monday last letter xxxiii p      with my answer to it i cannot resist the vanity that urges me to the communication otherwise it were better perhaps that i suffer thee to imagine that this ladys stars fight against her and dispense the opportunities in my favor which are only the consequences of my own superlative invention  letter xlv joseph leman to robert lovelace esquire he acquaints mr lovelace of the prosecution intended to be set up against him by his matters for a rape upon miss betterton whom by a stratagem he had got into his hands and who afterward died in childbed the child still living but as joseph says not regarded by his honor in the least his masters he says call it a very vile affair but god forbid that he should without his honors leave he hears he says that his honor went abroad to avoid the prosecution which the ladys relations otherwise would have set on foot and that his masters will not rest till they get the bettertons to commence it  joseph tells him that this was one of the stories which squire solmes was to tell his young lady of would she have heard him see vol ii p         he desires him to let him know if his honors life is in danger from this prosecution and hopes if it be that he will not be hanged like as a common man but only have his head cut off or so and that he will natheless think of his faithful joseph leman before his head shall be condemned because afterward he understands that all will be the kings or the shreeves  he then acquaints him that captain singleton and his young master and young mistress are often in close conference together and that his young master said before his face to the captain that his blood boiled over for revenge upon his honor and at the same time praised him joseph to the captain for his fidelity and for his good head although he looked so seely and then he offers his services in order to prevent mischief and to deserve his bounty and his favor as to the blue boar inn which he hears so good an account of   and then the blue boar is not all neither says joseph since and please your honor the pretty sow god forgive me for jesting in so serious a matter runs in my head likewise i believe i shall love her mayhap more than your honor would have me for she begins to be kind and goodhumoured and listens and please your honor like as if she was among beans when i talk about the blue boar and all that  pray your honor forgive the jesting of a poor plain man we common folks have our joys and please your honor like as our betters have and if we be sometimes snubbed we can find our underlings to snub again and if not we can get a wise mayhap and snub her so are masters some how or other ourselves  he then tells him how much his conscience smites him for what he has done since but for the stories his honor taught him it would have been impossible for his old masters and his lady to have been so hardhearted as they were notwithstanding the malice of his young master and young mistress  and here is the sad thing proceeds he they cannot come to clear up matters with my dearest young lady because as your honor has ordered it they have these stories as if bribed out of your honors servant which must not be known for fear your honor should kill him and me too and blacken the bribers  ah your honor  i doubt your honor as that i am a very vile fellow  lord bless my soul and did not intend it  but if my dearest young lady should come to harm and please your honor the horsepond at the blue boar  but lord preserve me from all bad mischiefs and all bad ends i pray the lord  for though your honor is kind to me in worldly polf yet what shall a man get to lose his soul as holy scripture says and please your honor  but natheless i am in hope of repentance hereafter being but a young man if i do wrong through ignorance your honor being a great man and a great wit and i a poor creature not worthy notice and your honor able to answer for all but howsoever i am  your honors faithful servant in all duty joseph leman april    and    letter xlvi mr lovelace to joseph leman april    he tells him that the affair of miss betterton was a youthful frolic that there was no rape in the case  that he went not abroad on her account that she loved him and he loved her yet that she was but a tradesmans daughter the father grown rich and aiming at a new line of gentry that he never pretended marriage to her that indeed they would have had her join to prosecute him and that she owed her death to her friends barbarity because she would not the boy he says is a fine boy no father need to be ashamed of him that he had twice unknown to the aunt who had the care of him been to see him and would have provided for him had there been occasion but that the whole family were fond of the child though they were so wicked as to curse the father  these he says were his rules in all his amors to shun common women to marry off a former mistress before he took a new one to set the mother above want if her friends were cruel to maintain a lady handsomely in her lyingin to provide for the little one according to the mothers degree and to go in mourning for her if she died in childbed  he challenges joseph to find out a man of more honor than himself in these respects no wonder he tells him that the women love him as they do  there is no room to fear for either his head or his neck he tells him from this affair a lady dying in childbed eighteen months ago no process begun in her lifetime herself refusing to prosecute pretty circumstances joseph to found an indictment for a rape upon  again i say i loved her she was taken from me by her brutal friends while our joys were young  but enough of dear miss betterton  dear i say  for death indears  rest to her worthy soul  there joseph off went a deep sigh to the memory of miss betterton  he encourages him in his jesting  jesting says he better becomes a poor man than qualms all we say all we do all we wish for is a jest he that makes it not so is a sad fellow and has the worst of it  whoever grudges a poor man joy ought to have none himself  he applauds him for his love to his young lady professes his honorable designs by her values himself upon his word and appeals to him on this head you know joseph says he that i have gone beyond my promises to you i do to everybody and why  because it is the best way of showing that i have not a grudging or narrow spirit a just man will keep his promise a generous man will go beyond it that is my rule  he lays it wholly at the ladys door that they are not married and laments the distance see keeps him at which he attributes to miss how who he says is for ever putting her upon contrivances which is the reason he tells him that has obliged him to play off the people at harloweplace upon mrs how by his assistance  he then takes advantage of the hints joseph gives him of singleton and james harlowes close conferences  since singleton says he who has dependencies upon james harlowe is taught to have so good an opinion of you joseph cannot you still pretending an abhorrence of me and of my contrivances propose to singleton to propose to james harlowe who so much thirsts for revenge upon me to assist him with his whole ships crew upon occasion to carry off his sister to leith where both have houses or elsewhere  you may tell them that if this can be effected it will make me raving mad and bring your young lady into all their measures you can inform them as from my servant of the distance she keeps me at in hopes of procuring her fathers forgiveness by cruelly giving me up if insisted upon that as the only secret my servant has kept from you is the place we are in you make no doubt that a two guinea bribe will bring that out and also an information when i shall be at distance from her that the enterprise may be safely conducted you may tell them still as from my servant that we are about removing from inconvenient lodgings to others more convenient which is true and that i must be often absent from her  if they listen to your proposal you will promote your interest with betty by telling it to her as a secret betty will tell arabella of it arabella will be overjoyed at any thing that will help forward her revenge upon me and will reveal it if her brother do not to her uncle antony he probably will whisper it to mrs how she can keep nothing from her daughter though they are always jangling her daughter will acquaint my beloved with it and if it will not or if it will come to my ears from some of those you can write it to me as in confidence by way of preventing mischief which is the study of us both i can then show it to my beloved then will she be for placing a greater confidence in me that will convince me of her love which now i am sometimes ready to doubt she will be for hastening to the safer lodgings i shall have a pretense to stay about her person as a guard she will be convinced that there is no expectation of a reconciliation you can give james and singleton continual false scents as i shall direct you so that no mischief can possibly happen  and what will be the happy happy thrice happy consequence  the lady will be mine in an honorable way we shall all be friends in good time the two guineas will be an agreeable addition to the many gratuities i have helped you to by like contrivances from this stingy family your reputation both for head and heart will be heightened the blue boar will also be yours nor shall you have the least difficulty about raising money to buy the stock if it be worth your while to have it  betty will likewise then be yours you have both saved money it seems the whole harlowe family whom you have so faithfully served tis serving them surely to prevent the mischief which their violent son would have brought upon them will throw you in somewhat toward housekeeping i will still add to your store so nothing but happiness before you  crow joseph crow a dunghill of your own in view servants to snub at your pleasure a wise to quarrel with or to love as your humor leads you landlord and landlady at every word to be paid instead of paying for your eating and drinking  but not thus happy only in yourself  happy in promoting peace and reconciliation between two good families in the long run without hurting any christian soul  o joseph honest joseph what envy will you raise  and who would be squeamish with such prospects before him  this one labor crowns your work if you can get but such a design entertained by them whether they prosecute it or not it will be equally to the purpose of  your loving friend r lovelace  letter xlvii miss clarissa harlowe to mrs hervey inclosed in her last to miss how thursday april  0 honored madam having not had the favor of an answer to a letter i took the liberty to write to you on the   th i am in some hopes that it may have miscarried for i had much rather it should than to have the mortification to think that my aunt hervey deemed me unworthy of the honor of her notice  in this hope having kept a copy of it and not being able to express myself in terms better suited to the unhappy circumstance of things i transcribe and enclose what i then wrote the contents of this letter are given p   0      and i humbly beseech you to favor the contents of it with your interest  hitherto it is in my power to perform what i undertake for in this letter and it would be very grievous to me to be precipitated upon measures which may render the desirable reconciliation more difficult  if madam i were permitted to write to you with the hopes of being answered i could clear my intention with regard to the step i have taken although i could not acquit myself perhaps to some of my severest judges of an imprudence previous to it  you i am sure would pity me if you knew all i could say and how miserable i am in the forfeiture of the good opinion of all my friends  i flatter myself that their favor is yet retrievable but whatever be the determination at harloweplace do not you my dearest aunt deny me the favor of a few lines to inform me if there can be any hope of a reconciliation upon terms less shocking than those heretofore endeavored to be imposed upon me or if which god forbid i am to be for ever reprobated  at least my dear aunt procure for me the justice of my wearing apparel and the little money and other things which i wrote to my sister for and mention in the enclosed to you that i may not be destitute of common conveniences or be under a necessity to owe an obligation for such where at present however i would least of all owe it  allow me to say that had i designed what happened i might as to the money and jewels at least have saved myself some of the mortifications which i have suffered and which i still farther apprehend if my request be not complied with  if you are permitted to encourage an eclaircissement of what i hint i will open my whole heart to you and inform you of every thing  if it be any pleasure to have me mortified be pleased to let it be known that i am extremely mortified and yet it is entirely from my own reflections that i am so  having nothing to find fault with in the behavior of the person from whom every evil was apprehended  the bearer having business your way will bring me your answer on saturday morning if you favor me according to my hopes i knew not that i should have this opportunity till i had wrote the above  i am my dearest aunt  your everdutiful cl harlowe be pleased to directed for me if i am to be favored with a few lines to be left at mr osgoods near sohosquare and nobody shall ever know of your goodness to me if you desire it to be kept a secret    letter xlviii miss how to miss clarissa harlowe sat april    i cannot for my life account for your wretchs teazing ways but he certainly doubts your love of him in this he is a modest man as well as somebody else and tacitly confesses that he does not deserve it  your israelitish hankerings after the egyptian onions testifyd still more in your letter to your aunt your oftenrepeated regrets for meeting him for being betrayed away by him these he cannot bear  i have been retrospecting the whole of his conduct and comparing it with his general character and find that he is more consistently more uniformly mean revengeful and proud than either of us once imagined  from his cradle as i may say as an only child and a boy humoursome spoiled mischievous the governor of his governors  a libertine in his riper years hardly regardful of appearances and despising the sex in general for the faults of particulars of it who made themselves too cheap to him  what has been his behavior in your family a clarissa in view from the time your foolish brother was obliged to take a life from him but defiance for defiances  getting you into his power by terror by artifice what politeness can be expected from such a man  well but what in such a situation is to be done  why you must despise him  you must hate him  if you can  and run away from him  but whither  especially now that your brother is laying foolish plots to put you in a still worse condition as it may happen  but if you cannot despise and hate him  if you care not to break with him you must part with some punctilios and if the so doing bring not on the solemnity you must put yourself into the protection of the ladies of his family  their respect for you is of itself a security for his honor if there could be any room for doubt and at least you should remind him of his offer to bring one of the miss montagues to attend you at your new lodgings in town and accompany you till all is happily over  this you will say will be as good as declaring yourself to be his and so let it you ought not now to think of any thing else but to be his does not your brothers project convince you more and more of this  give over then my dearest friend any thoughts of this hopeless reconciliation which has kept you balancing thus long you own in the letter before me that he made very explicit offers though you give me not the very words  and he gave his reasons i perceive with his wishes that you should accept them which very few of the sorry fellows do whose plea is generally but a compliment to our selflove  that we must love them however presumptuous and unworthy because they love us  were i in your place and had your charming delicacies i should perhaps do as you do no doubt but i should expect that the man should urge me with respectful warmth that he should supplicate with constancy and that all his words and actions should tend to the one principal point  nevertheless if i suspected art or delay founded upon his doubts of my love i would either condescend to clear up his doubts or renounce him for ever  and in this last case i your anna how would exert myself and either find you a private refuge or resolve to share fortunes with you  what a wretch to be so easily answered by your reference to the arrival of your cousin morden but i am afraid that you was too scrupulous  for did he not resent that reference  could we have his account of the matter i fancy my dear i should think you overnice overdelicate had you laid hold of his acknowleged explicitness he would have been as much in your power as now you seem to be in his  you wanted not to be told that the person who had been tricked into such a step as you had taken must of necessity submit to many mortifications  but were it to me a girl of spirit as i am thought to be i do assure you i would in a quarter of an hour all the time i would allow to punctilio in such a case as yours know what he drives at since either he must mean well or ill if ill the sooner you know it the better if well whose modest is it he distresses but that of his own wife  and methinks you should endeavor to avoid all exasperating recriminations as to what you have heard of his failure in morals especially while you are so happy as not to have occasion to speak of them by experience  i grant that it gives a worthy mind some satisfaction in having borne its testimony against a bad one but if the testimony be not seasonably borne and when the faulty person be fitted to receive the correction it may probably rather harden or make an hypocrite than reclaim him  i am pleased however as well as you with his making light of your brothers wise project  poor creature  and must master jemmy harlowe with his halfwit pretend to plot and contrive mischief yet rail at lovelace for the same things  a witty villain deserves hanging at once and without ceremony if you please but a halfwitted one deserves broken bones first and hanging afterward i think lovelace has given his character in few words  be angry at me if you please but as sure as you are alive now that this poor creature whom some call your brother finds he has succeeded in making you fly your fathers house and that he has nothing to fear but your getting into your own and into an independence of him but he thinks himself equal to any thing and so has a mind to fight lovelace with his own weapons  dont you remember his pragmatical triumph as told you by your aunt and prided in by that saucy betty barnes from his own foolish mouth see vol ii p  00  0    0   0    i expect nothing from your letter to your aunt i hope lovelace will never know the contents of it in every one of yours i see that he as warmly resents as he dares the little confidence you have in him i should resent it too were i him and knew i deserved better  dont be scrupulous about clothes if you think of putting yourself into the protection of the ladies of his family they know how matters stand between you and your relations and love you never the worse for their cruelty  as to money why will you let me offer in vain  i know you will not demand possession of your estate but give him a right to demand it for you and that will be still better  adieu my dear  may heaven guide and direct you in all your steps is the daily prayer of  your everaffectionate and faithful anna how  letter xlix mr belford to robert lovelace esquire friday april    thou lovelace have been long the entertainer i the entertained nor have i been solicitous to animadvert as thou wentest along upon thy inventions and their tendency for i believed that with all thy airs the unequalled perfections and fine qualities of this lady would always be her protection and security but now that i find thou have so far succeeded as to induce her to come to town and to choose her lodgings in a house the people of which will too probably damp and suppress any honorable motions which may arise in thy mind in her favor i cannot help writing and that professedly in her behalf  my inducements to this are not owing to virtue  but if they were what hope could i have of affecting thee by pleas arising from it  nor would such a man as thou art be deterred were i to remind thee of the vengeance which thou may one day expect if thou insultest a woman of her character family and fortune  neither are gratitude and honor motives to be mentioned in a womans favor to men such as we are who consider all those of the sex as fair prize whom we can obtain a power over for our honor and honor in the general acceptance of the word are two things  what then is my motive  why the true friendship that i bear thee lovelace which makes me plead thy own sake and thy familys sake in the justice thou owe to this incomparable creature who however so well deserves to have her sake to be mentioned as the principal consideration  last time i was at m hall thy noble uncle so earnestly pressed me to use my interest to persuade thee to enter the pale and gave me so many familyreasons for it that i could not help engaging myself heartily on his side of the question and the rather as i knew that thy own intentions with regard to this fine woman were then worthy of her and of this i assured his lordship who was halfafraid of thee because of the ill usage thou receivedst from her family but now that the case is altered let me press the matter home to thee from other considerations  by what i have heard of this ladys perfections from every mouth as well as from thine and from every letter thou have written where will thou find such another woman and why should thou tempt her virtue  why should thou be for trying where there is no reason to doubt  were i in thy case and designed to marry and if i preferred a lady as i know thou do this to all the women in the world i should dread to make further trial knowing what we know of the sex for fear of succeeding and especially if i doubted not that if there were a woman in the world virtuous at heart it is she  and let me tell thee lovelace that in this ladys situation the trial is not a fair trial  considering the depth or thy plots and contrivances considering the opportunities which i see thou must have with her in spite of her own heart all her relations follies acting in concert though unknown to themselves with thy wicked scheming head considering how destitute of protection she is considering the house she is to be in where she will be surrounded with thy implements specious wellbred and genteel creatures not easily to be detected when they are disposed to preserve appearances especially by a young inexperienced lady wholly unacquainted with the town considering all these things i say  what glory what cause of triumph will thou have if she should be overcome  thou too a man born for intrigue full of invention intrepid remorseless able patiently to watch for thy opportunity not hurried as most men by gusts of violent passion which often nip a project in the bud and make the snail that was just putting out its horns to meet the inviter withdraw into its shell  a man who has no regard to his word or oath to the sex the lady scrupulously strict to her word incapable of art or design apt therefore to believe well of others  it would be a miracle if she stood such an attempter such attempts and such snares as i see will be laid for her and after all i see not when men are so frail without importunity that so much should be expected from women daughters of the same fathers and mothers and made up of the same brittle compounds education all the difference nor where the triumph is in subduing them  may there not be other lovelaces thou ask who attracted by her beauty may endeavor to prevail with her  no there cannot i answer be such another man person mind fortune and thy character as above given taken in  if thou imaginedst there could such is thy pride that thou would think the worse of thyself  but let me touch upon thy predominant passion revenge for love what can be the love of a rake is but second to that as i have often told thee though it has set thee into raving at me  what poor pretenses for revenge are the difficulties thou had in getting her off allowing that she had run a risque of being solmess wife had she staid her injunctions so cruelly turned upon her and her preference of the single life  if these are other than pretenses why thankest thou not those who threw her into thy power  besides are not the pretenses thou make for further trial most ingratefully as well as contradictorily founded upon the supposition of error in her occasioned by her favor to thee  and let me for the utter confusion of thy poor pleas of this nature ask thee  would she in thy opinion had she willingly gone off with thee have been entitled to better quarter  for a mistress indeed she might but would thou for a wife have had cause to like her half so well as now  that she loves thee wicked as thou art and cruel as a panther there is no reason to doubt yet what a command has she over herself that such a penetrateing selfflatterer as thyself art sometimes ready to doubt it though persecuted on the one hand as she was by her own family and attracted on the other by the splendour of thine every one of whom wishes for and courts her to rank herself among them  thou will perhaps think that i have departed from my proposition and pleaded the ladys sake more than thine in the above  but no such thing all that i have written is more in thy behalf than in hers  since she may make thee happy  but it is next to impossible i should think if she preserves her delicacy that thou can make her so i need not give my reasons thou wilt have ingenuity enough i dare say were there occasion for it to subscribe to my opinion  i plead not for the state from any great liking to it myself nor have i at present thoughts of entering into it but as thou art the last of thy name as thy family is of note and figure in thy country and as thou thyself think that thou shall one day marry is it possible let me ask thee that thou can have such another opportunity as thou now have if thou let this slip a lady in her family and fortune not unworthy of thine own tho thou art so apt from pride of ancestry and pride of heart to speak slightly of the families thou dislikest so celebrated for beauty and so noted at the same time for prudence for soul i will say instead of sense and for virtue  if thou art not so narrowminded an elf as to prefer thy own single satisfaction to posterity thou who should wish to beget children for duration wilt not postpone till the rakes usual time that is to say till diseases or years or both lay hold of thee since in that case thou would entitle thyself to the curses of thy legitimate progeny for giving them a being altogether miserable a being which they will be obliged to hold upon a worse tenure than that tenantcourtesy which thou call the worst see p      to wit upon the doctors courtesy thy descendents also propagating if they shall live and be able to propagate a wretched race that shall intail the curse or the reason for it upon remote generations  wicked as the sober world accounts us we have not yet it is to be hoped got over all compunction although we find religion against us we have not yet presumed to make a religion to suit our practices we despise those who do and we know better than to be even doubters in short we believe a future state of rewards and punishments but as we have so much youth and health in hand we hope to have time for repentance that is to say in plain english nor think thou me too grave lovelace thou art grave sometimes though not often we hope to live to sense as long as sense can relish and purpose to reform when we can sin no longer  and shall this admirable woman suffer for her generous endeavors to set on foot thy reformation and for insisting upon proofs of the sincerity of thy professions before she will be thine  upon the whole matter let me wish thee to consider well what thou art about before thou go a step farther in the path which thou have chalked out for thyself to tread and art just going to enter into hitherto all is so far right that if the lady mistrusts thy honor she has no proofs be honest to her then in her sense of the word none of thy companions thou know will offer to laugh at what thou do and if they should on thy entering into a state which has been so much ridiculed by thee and by all of us thou have one advantage it is this that thou can not be ashamed  deferring to the postday to close my letter i find one left for my cousin osgood to be forwarded to the lady it was brought within these two hours by a particular hand and has a harloweseal upon it as it may therefore be of importance i dispatch it with my own by my servant posthaste this letter was from her sister arabella see let liii   i suppose you will soon be in town without the lady i hope farewell  be honest and be happy j belford sat apr    letter l mrs hervey to miss clarissa harlowe  in answer to letter xlvii dear niece it would be hard not to write a few lines so much pressed to write to one i ever loved your former letter i received yet was not at liberty to answer it i break my word to answer you now  strange informations are every day received about you the wretch you are with we are told is every hour triumphing and defying  must not these informations aggravate you know the uncontroulableness of the man he loves his own humor better than he loves you  though so fine a creature as you are i warned you over and over no young lady was ever more warned  miss clarissa harlowe to do such a thing  you might have given your friends the meeting if you had held your aversion it would have been complied with as soon as i was entrusted myself with their intention to give up the point i gave you a hint  a dark one perhaps see vol ii p  0    but who would have thought  o miss  such an artful slight  such cunning preparation  but you want to clear up things  what can you clear up are you not gone off  with a lovelace too  what my dear would you clear up  you did not design to go you say why did you meet him then chariotandsix horsemen all prepared by him o my dear how art produces art  will it be believed  if it would what power will he be thought to have had over you  he  who  lovelace  the vilest of libertines  over whom  a clarissa harlowe  was your love for such a man above your reason  above your resolution  what credit would a belief of this if believed bring you  how mend the matter  oh that you had stood the next meeting   i will tell you all that was intended if you had  it was indeed imagined that you would not have been able to resist your fathers entreaties and commands he was resolved to be all condescension if anew you had not provoked him i love my clary harlowe said he but an hour before the killing tideings were brought him i love her as my life i will kneel to her if nothing else will do to prevail upon her to oblige me  your father and mother reverse to what should have been would have humbled themselves to you and if you could have denied them and refused to sign the settlements previous to the meeting they would have yielded although with regret  but it was presumed so naturally sweet your temper so selfdenying as they thought you that you could not have withstood them notwithstanding all your dislike of the one man without a greater degree of headstrong passion for the other than you had given any of us reason to expect from you  if you had the meeting on wednesday would have been a lighter trial to you you would have been presented to all your assembled friends with a short speech only that this was the young creature till very lately saultless condescending and obliging now having cause to glory in a triumph over the wills of father mother uncles the most indulgent over family interests family views and preferring her own will to everybodys and this for a transitory preference to person only the morals of the men not to be compared with each others  thus complied with and perhaps blessed by your father and mother and the consequences of your disobedience deprecated in the solemnest manner by your inimitable mother your generosity would have been appealed to since your duty would have been found too weak an inducement and you would have been bid to withdraw for one halfhours consideration then would the settlements have been again tendered for your signing by the person least disobliging to you by your good norton perhaps she perhaps seconded by your father again and if again refused you would again have been led in to declare such your refusal some restrictions which you yourself had proposed would have been insisted upon you would have been permitted to go home with me or with your uncle antony  which not agreed upon because they hoped you might be prevailed with there to tarry till the arrival of your cousin morden or till your father could have borne to see you or till assured that the views of lovelace were at an end  this the intention your father so set upon your compliance so much in hopes that you would have yielded that you would have been prevailed upon by methods so condescending and so gentle no wonder that he in particular was like a distracted man when he heard of your flight  of your flight so premeditated  with your ivy summer house dinings your arts to blind me and all of us  naughty naughty young creature  i for my part would not believe it when told of it your uncle hervey would not believe it we rather expected we rather feared a still more desperate adventure there could be but one more desperate and i was readier to have the cascade first resorted to than the garden backdoor  your mamma fainted away while her heart was torn between the two apprehensions  your father poor man your father was beside himself for near an hour to this day he can hardly bear your name yet can think of nobody else your merits my dear but aggravate your fault  something of fresh aggravation almost every hour  how can any favor be expected  i am sorry for it but am afraid nothing you ask will be complied with  why mention you my dear the saving you from mortifications who have gone off with a man what a poor pride is it to stand upon any thing else  i dare not open my lips in your favor nobody dare your letter must stand by itself this has caused me to send it to harloweplace expect therefore great severity may you be enabled to support the lot you have chosen o my dear how unhappy have you made everybody can you expect to be happy your father wishes you had never been born your poor mother  but why should i afflict you there is now no help  you must be changed indeed if you are not very unhappy yourself in the reflections your thoughtful mind must suggest to you  you must now make the best of your lot yet not married it seems  it is in your power you say to perform whatever you shall undertake to do you may deceive yourself you hope that your reputation and your friends favor may be retrieved never never both i doubt if either every offended person and that is all who loved you and are related to you must join to restore you when can these be of one mind in a case so notoriously wrong  it would be very grievous you say to be precipitated upon measures that may make the desirable reconciliation more difficult is it now my dear a time for you to be afraid of being precipitated at present if ever there can be no thought of reconciliation the upshot of your precipitation must first be seen there may be murder yet as far as we know will the man you are with part willingly with you if not what may be the consequence if he will lord bless me what shall we think of his reasons for it  i will fly this thought i know your purity  but my dear are you not out of all protection  are you not unmarryd  have you not making your daily prayers useless thrown yourself into temptation and is not the man the most wicked of plotters  you have hitherto you say and i think my dear with an air unbecoming your declared penitence no fault to find with the behavior of a man from whom every evil was apprehended like caesar to the roman augur which i heard you tell of who had bid him beware of the ides of march the ides of march said caesar seeing the augur among the crowd as he marched in state to the senate house which he never was to return from alive the ides of march are come but they are not past the augur replied make the application my dear may you be able to make this reflection upon his good behavior to the last of your knowledge of him may he behave himself better to you than he ever did to anybody else whom he had power over amen  no answer i beseech you i hope your messenger will not tell anybody that i have written to you and i dare say you will not show what i have written to mr lovelace  for i have written with the less reserve depending upon your prudence  you have my prayers  my dolly knows not that i write nobody does not even mr hervey  dolly would have several times written but having defended your fault with heat and with a partiality that alarmed us such a fall as yours my dear must be alarming to all parents she has been forbidden on pain of losing our favor for ever and this at your familys request as well as by her fathers commands  you have the poor girls hourly prayers however i will tell you though she knows not that i do as well as those of  your truly afflicted aunt d hervey friday april    letter li miss clarissa harlowe to miss how with the preceding sat morn april    i have just now received the enclosed from my aunt hervey be pleased my dear to keep her secret of having written to the unhappy wretch her niece  i may go to london i see or where i will no matter what becomes of me  i was the willinger to suspend my journey thither till i heard from harloweplace i thought if i could be encouraged to hope for a reconciliation i would let this man see that he should not have me in his power but upon my own terms if at all  but i find i must be his whether i will or not and perhaps through still greater mortifications than those great ones which i have already met with  and must i be so absolutely thrown upon a man with whom i am not at all satisfied  my letter is sent you see to harloweplace my heart aches for the reception it may meet with there one comfort only arises to me from its being sent that my aunt will clear herself by the communication from the supposition of having corresponded with the poor creature whom they have all determined to reprobate it is no small part of my misfortune that i have weakened the confidence one dear friend has in another and made one look cool upon another my poor cousin dolly you see has reason to regret this as well as my aunt miss how my dear miss how is but too sensible of the effects of my fault having had more words with her mother on my account than ever she had on any other yet the man who has drawn me into all this evil i must be thrown upon  much did i consider much did i apprehend before my fault supposing i were to be guilty of it but i saw it not in all its shocking lights  and now to know that my father an hour before he received the tidings of my supposed flight owned that he loved me as his life that he would have been all condescension that he would  oh my dear how tender how mortifyinglytender now in him my aunt need not have been afraid that it should be known that she has sent me such a letter as this  a father to kneel to a daughter  there would not indeed have been any bearing of that  what i should have done in such a case i know not death would have been much more welcome to me than such a fight on such an occasion in behalf of a man so very very disgustful to me but i had deserved annihilation had i suffered my father to kneel in vain  yet had but the sacrifice of inclination and personal preference been all less than kneeling should have done my duty should have been the conqueror of my inclination but an aversion  an aversion so very sincere  the triumph of a cruel and ambitious brother ever so uncontrollable joined with the insults of an envious sister bringing wills to theirs which otherwise would have been favorable to me the marriageduties so very strong so solemnly to be engaged for the marriageintimacies permit me to say to you my friend what the purest although with apprehension must think of so very intimate myself one who never looked upon any duty much less a voluntarilyvowd one with indifference could it have been honest in me to have given my hand to an odious hand and to have consented to such a more than reluctant such an immiscible union if i may so call it  for life too  did i not think more and deeper than most young creatures think did i not weigh did i not reflect i might perhaps have been less obstinate  delicacy may i presume to call it thinking weighing reflection are not blessings i have not found them such in the degree i have them i wish i had been able in some very nice cases to have known what indifference was yet not to have my ignorance imputable to me as a fault oh my dear the finer sensibilities if i may suppose mine to be such make not happy  what a method had my friends intended to take with me  this i dare say was a method chalked out by my brother he i suppose was to have presented me to all my assembled friends as the daughter capable of preferring her own will to the wills of them all it would have been a sore trial no doubt would to heaven however i had stood it  let the issue have been what it would would to heaven i had stood it  there may be murder my aunt says this looks as if she knew of singletons rash plot such an upshot as she calls it of this unhappy affair heaven avert  she flies a thought that i can less dwell upon  a cruel thought  but she has a poor opinion of the purity she compliments me with if she thinks that i am not by gods grace above temptation from this sex although i never saw a man whose person i could like before this man yet his faulty character allowed me but little merit from the indifference i pretended to on his account but now i see him in nearer lights i like him less than ever  indeed i never liked him so little as now upon my word i think i could hate him if i do not already hate him sooner than any man i ever thought tolerably of  a good reason why because i have been more disappointed in my expectations of him although they never were so high as to have made him my choice in preference to the single life had that been permitted me still if the giving him up for ever will make my path to reconciliation easy and if they will signify as much to me they shall see that i never will be his for i have the vanity to think my soul his souls superior  you will say i rave forbid to write to my aunt and taught to despair of reconciliation you my dear must be troubled with my passionate resentments what a wretch was i to meet him and thereby to leave it not in my power to stand the general meeting with my friends  all would now have been over  and who can tell when my present distresses will  rid of both men i had been now perhaps at my aunt herveys or at my uncle antonys wishing for my cousin mordens arrival who might have accommodated all  i intended indeed to have stood it  and if i had how know i by whose name i might now have been called for how should i have resisted a condescending a kneeling father had he been able to have kept his temper with me  yet my aunt says he would have relented if i had not perhaps he would have been moved by my humility before he could have shown such undue condescension such temper as he would have received me with might have been improved upon in my favor and that he had designed ultimately to relent how it clears my friends at least to themselves and condemns me o why were my aunts hints i remember them now so very dark  yet i intended to have returned after the interview and then perhaps she would have explained herself  o this artful this designing lovelace  yet i must repeat that most ought i to blame myself for meeting him  but far far be banished from me fruitless recrimination far banished because fruitless let me wrap myself about in the mantle of my own integrity and take comfort in my unfaulty intention since it is now too late to look back let me collect all my fortitude and endeavor to stand those shafts of angry providence which it will not permit me to shun that whatever the trials may be which i am destined to undergo i may not behave unworthily in them but come out amended by them  join with me in this prayer my beloved friend for your own honors sake as well as for loves sake join with me in it lest a deviation on my side should with the censorious cast a shade upon a friendship which has no body no levity in it and whose basis is improvement as well in the greater as lesser duties  cl harlowe  letter lii miss clarissa harlowe to miss how saturday p m april    o my best my only friend now indeed is my heart broken  it has received a blow it never will recover think not of corresponding with a wretch who now seems absolutely devoted how can it be otherwise if a parents curses have the weight i always attributed to them and have heard so many instances of their being followed by  yes my dear miss how superadded to all my afflictions i have the consequences of a fathers curse to struggle with how shall i support this reflection  my past and my present situation so much authorizing my apprehensions  i have at last a letter from my unrelenting sister would to heaven i had not provoked it by my second letter to my aunt hervey it lay ready for me it seems the thunder slept till i awakened it i enclose the letter itself transcribe it i cannot there is no bearing the thoughts of it for shocking reflection the curse extends to the life

mr osgoods near sollosquare friday april    it was expected you would send again to me or to my aunt hervey the enclosed has lain ready for you therefore by direction you will have no answer from anybody write to whom you will and as often as you will and what you will  it was designed to bring you back by proper authority or to send you whither the disgraces you have brought upon us all should be in the likeliest way after a while to be forgotten but i believe that design is over so you may range securely nobody will think it worth while to give themselves any trouble about you yet my mamma has obtained leave to send you your clothes of all sorts but your clothes only this is a favor you will see by the within letter not designed you and now not granted for your sake but because my poor mother cannot bear in her sight any thing you used to wear read the enclosed and tremble  arabella harlowe   to the most ungrateful and undutiful of daughters harloweplace sat april    sister that was for i know not what name you are permitted or choose to go by  you have filled us all with distraction my father in the first agitations of his mind on discovering your wicked your shameful elopement imprecated on his knees a fearful curse upon you tremble at the recital of it  no less than that you may meet your punishment both here and hereafter by means of the very wretch in whom you have chosen to place your wicked confidence  your clothes will not be sent you you seem by leaving them behind you to have been secure of them whenever you demanded them but perhaps you could think of nothing but meeting your fellow  nothing but how to get off your forward self  for everything seems to have been forgot but what was to contribute to your wicked flight  yet you judged right perhaps that you would have been detected had you endeavored to get off your clothes  cunning creature not to make one step that we could guess at you by  cunning to effect your own ruin and the disgrace of all the family  but does the wretch put you upon writing for your things for fear you should be too expensive to him  that is it i suppose  was there ever a giddier creature  yet this is the celebrated the blazing clarissa  clarissa what  harlowe no doubt  and harlowe it will be to the disgrace of us all   your drawings and your pieces are all taken down as is also your own wholelength picture in the vandyke taste from your late parlour they are taken down and thrown into your closet which will be nailed up as if it were not a part of the house there to perish together for who can bear to see them yet how did they use to be shown to everybody the former for the magnifying of your dainty fingerworks the latter for the imputed dignity dignity now in the dust of your boasted figure this picture is drawn as big as the life by mr highmore and is in his possession  and this by those fond parents whom you have run away from with so much yet with so little contrivance  my brother vows revenge upon your libertine  for the familys sake he vows it  not for yours  for he will treat you he declares like a common creature if ever he sees you and doubts not that this will be your fate  my uncle harlowe renounces you for ever  so does my uncle antony  so does my aunt hervey  so do i base unworthy creature  the disgrace of a good family and the property of an infamous rake as questionless you will soon find yourself if you are not already  your books since they have not taught you what belongs to your family to your sex and to your education will not be sent you your money neither nor yet the jewels so undeservedly made yours for it is wished you may be seen a beggar along london streets  if all this is heavy lay your hand to your heart and ask yourself why you have deserved it  every gentleman whom your pride taught you to reject with scorn mr solmes excepted who however has reason to rejoice that he missed you triumphs in your shameful elopement and now knows how to account for his being refused  your worthy norton is ashamed of you and mingles her tears with your mammas both reproaching themselves for their shares in you and in so fruitless an education  everybody in short is ashamed of you but none more than  arabella harlowe   letter live miss how to miss clarissa harlowe tuesday april    be comforted be not dejected do not despond my dearest and bestbeloved friend god almighty is just and gracious and gives not his assent to rash and inhuman curses if he did malice envy and the blackest passions in the blackest hearts would triumph and the best blasted by the malignity of the worst would be miserable in both worlds  this malediction shows only what manner of spirit they are of and how much their sordid views exceed their parental love it is all rage and disappointment my dear disappointment in designs proper to be frustrated and all you have to grieve for is that their own rashness will turn upon their own hearts god almighty cannot succeed a curse so presumptuous as to be carried into his futurity  fie upon them  fie upon them will all the world say who shall come to the knowledge of such overflowing venom  and the more when all shall know that what they resent so outrageously is oweing to themselves  my mother blames them for this wicked letter and she pities you and of her own accord wished me to write to comfort you for this once for she says it is pity your heart which was so noble and when the sense of your fault and the weight of a parents curse are so strong upon you should be quite broken  lord bless me how your aunt writes  can there be two rights and two wrongs in palpable cases  but my dear she must be wrong so they all have been justify themselves now as they will they can only justify themselves to themselves from selfish principles resolving to acquit not fairly to try themselves did your unkind aunt in all the tedious progress of your contentions with them give you the least hope of their relenting  her dark hints i now recollect as well as you but why was any thing good or hopeful to you to be darkly hinted  how easy was it for her who pretended always to love you so well for her who can give such flowing license to her pen for your hurt to have given you one word one line in confidence of their pretended change of measures  but dont mind their afterpretences my dear  all of them serve but for tacit confessions of their vile usage of you i will keep your aunts secret never fear i would not on any consideration that my mother should see it  you will now see that you have nothing left but to overcome all scrupulousness and marry as soon as you have opportunity determine upon this my dear  i will give you a motive for it regarding myself for this i have resolved and this i have vowed o friend the best beloved of my heart be not angry with me for it that so long as your happiness is in suspense i will never think of marrying in justice to the man i shall have i have vowed this for my dear must i not be miserable if you are so and what an unworthy wife must i be to any man who cannot have interest enough in my heart to make his obligingness a balance for an affliction he has not caused  i would show lovelace your sisters abominable letter were it to me i enclose it it shall not have a place in this house this will enter him of course into the subject which now you ought to have most in view let him see what you suffer for him he cannot prove base to such an excellence i should never enjoy my head or my senses should this man prove a villain to you with a merit so exalted you may have punishment more than enough for your involuntary fault in that husband  i would not have you be too sure that their project to seize you is over the words intimating that it is over in the letter of that abominable arabella seem calculated to give you security  she only says she believes that design is over  and i do not yet find from miss lloyd that it is disavowd so it will be best when you are at london to be private and to let every direction be to a third place for fear of the worst for i would not for the world have you fall into the hands of such flaming and malevolent spirits by surprise  i will myself be content to direct to you at some third place and that i may have it to averr to my mother or to any other if occasion be that i know not where you are  besides this measure will make you less apprehensive of the consequences of their violence should they resolve to attempt to carry you off in spite of lovelace  i would have you direct to mr hickman even your answer to this i have a reason for it besides my mamma notwithstanding this particular indulgence is very positive  i would not have you dwell on the shocking occasion i know how it must affect you but dont let it try to make light of it forget it you cant and pursue other subjects  the subjects before you and let me know your progress and what he says so far may you enter into this hateful subject to this abominable letter and diabolical curse i expect that this will aptly introduce the grand topic between you without needing a mediator  come my dear when things are at worst they must mend good often comes when evil is expected happily improved upon this very curse may turn to a blessing  but if you despond there can be no hopes of cure  dont let them break your heart for that it is plain to me is now what some people have in view to do  how poor to withold from you your books your jewels and your money  the latter is all you can at present want since they will vouchsafe to send your clothes  i send fifty guineas by the bearer enclosed in single papers in my norriss miscellanies i charge you as you love me return them not  i have more at your service so if you like not your lodgings or his behavior when you get to town leave both out of hand  i would advise you to write to mr morden without delay if he intends for england it may hasten him and you will do very well till he can come but surely lovelace is bewitched if he takes not his happiness from your consent before that of mr mordens is made needful by his arrival  come my dear be comforted all is hastening to be well this very violence shows that it is suppose yourself to be me and me to be you you may  for your distress is mine and then give to yourself those consolations which in that case you would give me nothing but words has passed vehement and horrid as those are the divine goodness will not let them be more can you think that heaven will seal to the black passions of its depraved creatures manage with your usual prudence the stake before you and all will be still happy  i have as great apprehensions as you of the weight of a parents curse but not of the curse of those parents who have more to answer for than the child in the very errors they so much resent to entitle those horrid words to efficacy the parents views should be pure should be altogether justifiable and the childs ingratitude and undutifulness without excuse and her choice too as totally inexcusable  this is the true light as i humbly conceive that this matter should appear to you in and to everybody if you let not despondency seize you you will strengthen you will add more day to this but glimmering light from  your everaffectionate and faithful anna how i hurry this away by robert i will inquire into the truth of your aunts pretenses about their change of measures had you not gone away    letter lv miss clarissa harlowe to miss how wednesday morning april    your letter my beloved miss how gives me great comfort how sweetly do i experience the truth of the wise mans observation that a faithful friend is the medicine of life  your messenger finds me just setting out for london the chaise at the door already i have taken leave of the good widow who has obliged me with the company of her eldest daughter at mr lovelaces request while he rides by us the young gentlewoman is to return in two or three days with the chaise in its way to my lord ms hertfordshire seat  i received this dreadful letter on sunday when mr lovelace was out he saw on his return my extreme anguish and dejection and he was told how much worse i had been for i had fainted away twice  i think it has touched my head as well as my heart  he would fain have seen it but i would not permit that because of the threatenings he would have found in it against himself as it was the effect it had upon me made him break out into execrations and menaces i was so ill that he himself advised me to delay going to town on monday as i proposed to do  he is extremely regardful and tender of me all that you supposed would follow this violent letter from him has followed it he has offered himself to my acceptance in so unreservd a manner that i am concerned i have written so freely and so diffidently of him pray my dearest friend keep to yourself every thing that may appear disreputable of him from me  i must own to you that his kind behavior and my lowspiritedness cooperating with your former advice and my unhappy situation made me that very sunday evening receive unreservedly his declarations and now indeed i am more in his power than ever  he presses me every hour for fresh tokens of my esteem for him and confidence in him he owns that he doubted the one and was ready to despair of the other and as i have been brought to some verbal concessions if he should prove unworthy i am sure i shall have great reason to blame this violent letter for i have no resolution at all abandoned thus of all my natural friends and only you to pity me and you restrained as i may say i have been forced to turn my desolate heart to such protection as i could find  all my comfort is that your advice repeatedly given to the same purpose in your kind letter before me warrants me upon the strength of that i now set out the more cheerfully to london for before a heavy weight hung upon my heart and although i thought it best and safest to go yet my spirit sunk i know not why at every motion i made toward a preparation for it  i hope no mischief will happen on the road  i hope these violent spirits will not meet  every one is waiting for me  pardon me my best my kindest friend that i return your norris in these more promising prospects i cannot have occasion for your favor besides i have some hope that with my clothes they will send me what i wrote for although it is denied me in the letter if they do not and if i should have occasion i can but signify my wants to so ready a friend but i had rather methinks you should have it still to say if challenged that nothing of this nature has been either requested or done i say this with a view entirely to my future hopes of recovering your mammas favor which next to that of my own father and mother i am most solicitous to recover  i must add one thing more notwithstanding my hurry and that is mr lovelace offered to attend me to lord ms or to send for his chaplain yesterday he pressed me to consent to this proposal most earnestly and even seemed more desirous to have the ceremony pass here than at london for when there i had told him it was time enough to consider of so weighty and important a matter now upon the receipt of your kind your consolatory letter methinks i could almost wish it had been in my power to comply with his earnest solicitations but this dreadful letter has unhinged my whole frame then some little punctilio surely is necessary no preparation made no articles drawn no license ready grief so extreme no pleasure in prospect nor so much as in wish  o my dear who could think of entering into so solemn an engagement who so unprepared could seem to be so ready  if i could flatter myself that my indifference to all the joys of this life proceeded from proper motives and not rather from the disappointments and mortifications my pride has met with how much rather i think should i choose to be wedded to my shroud than to any man on earth  indeed i have at present no pleasure but in your friendship continue that to me i beseech you if my heart rises hereafter to more it must be built on that foundation  my spirits sink again on setting out excuse this depth of vapourish dejection which forbids me even hope the cordial that keeps life from stagnating and which never was denied me till within these eightandforty hours  but it is time to relieve you  adieu my best beloved and kindest friend pray for your  cl harlowe  letter lvi miss how to miss clarissa harlowe thursday april    i am sorry you returned my norris but you must be allowed to do as you please so must i in return we must neither of us perhaps expect absolutely of the other what is the rightest to be done and yet few folks so young better know what that rightest is i cannot separate myself from you my dear although i give a double instance of my vanity in this particular compliment to myself  i am most heartily rejoiced that your prospects are so much mended and that as i hoped good has been produced out of evil what must the man have been what must have been his views had he not taken such a turn upon a letter so vile and treatment so unnatural himself principally the occasion of it  you know best your motives for suspending but i wish you had taken him at offers so earnest why should you not have permitted him to send for lord ms chaplain if punctilio only was in the way and want of a license and of proper preparations and suchlike my service to you my dear and there is ceremony tantamount to your ceremony  dont dont my dear friend again be so very melancholy a decliner as to prefer a shroud when the matter you wish for is in your power and when as you have said justly heretofore persons cannot die when they will  but it is a strange perverseness in human nature that we covet at a distance what when near we flight  you have now but one point to pursue that is marriage let that be compassed leave the rest to providence and follow as that leads you will have a handsome man a genteel man he would be a wise man if he were not vain of his endowments and wild and intriguing but while the eyes of many of our sex taken by so specious a form and so brilliant a spirit encourage that vanity you must be contented to stay till gray hairs and prudence enter upon the stage together you would not have every thing in the same man  i believe mr hickman treads no crooked paths but he hobbles most ungracefully in a strait one yet hickman though he pleases not my eye nor diverts my ear will not as i believe disgust the one nor shock the other your man as i have lately said will always keep up attention you will always be alive with him though perhaps more from fears than hopes while hickman will neither say any thing to keep one awake nor yet by shocking adventures make ones slumbers uneasy  i believe i now know which of the two men so prudent a person as you would at first have chosen nor doubt i that you can guess which i would have made choice of if i might but proud as we are the proudest of us all can only refuse and many of us accept the but halfworthy for fear a still worse should offer  if the men had chosen for spirits like their own although mr lovelace at the long run might have been too many for me i dont doubt but i should have given heartake for heartake for one halfyear at least while you with my dullswift would have glided on as serenely as calmly as accountably as the succceding seasons and varying no otherwise than as they to bring on new beauties and conveniences to all about you  i was going on in this style  but my mamma broke in upon me with a prohibitory aspect she gave me leave but for one letter only  she has seen your odious uncle and they have been in close conference again  she has vexed me i must lay this by till i hear from you again not knowing where to send it  direct me to a third place as i desired in my former  i told my mother on her challenging me that i was writing indeed and to you but it was only to amuse myself for i protested that i knew not where to send to you  i hope that your next may inform me of your nuptials although the next to that were to acquaint me that he was the ungratefullest monster on earth as he must be if not the kindest husband in it  my mamma has vexed me but so on revising i wrote before  but she has unhinged me as you call it  pretended to catechize hickman i assure you for contributing to our supposed correspondence catechize him severely too upon my word  i believe i have a sneaking kindness for the sneaking fellow for i cannot endure that anybody should treat him like a fool but myself  i believe between you and me the good lady forgot herself i heard her loud  she possibly imagined that my papa was come to life again  yet the mans meekness might have sooner convinced her i should have thought for my papa it seems would talk as loud as she  i suppose though within a few yards of each other as if both were out of their way and were hollowing at half a miles distance to get in again  i know you will blame me for this sauciness  but i told you i was vexed and if i had not a spirit my parentage on both sides might be doubted  you must not chide me too severely however because i have learned of you not to defend myself in an error  and i own i am wrong  and that is enough you will not be so generous in this case as you are in every other if you dont think it is  adieu my dear  i must i will love you and love you for ever so subscribes your  anna how  letter lvii from the same enclosed in the above thursday april    i have been making inquiry as i told you i would whether your relations had really before you left them resolved upon that change of measures which your aunt mentions in her letter  and by laying together several pieces of intelligence some drawn from my mamma by your uncle antonys communications some from miss lloyd by your sisters and some by a third way that i shall not tell you of i have reason to think the following a true state of the case  that there was no intention of a change of measures till within two or three days of your going away on the contrary your brother and sister though they had no hope of prevailing with you in solmess favor were resolved never to give over their persecutions till they had pushed you upon taking some step which by help of their good offices should be deemed inexcusable by the halfwitted souls they had to play upon  but that at last your mamma tired with and perhaps ashamed of the passive part she had acted thought fit to declare to miss bell that she was determined to try to put an end to the familyfeuds and to get your uncle harlowe to second her endeavors  this alarmed your brother and sister and then a change of measures was resolved upon solmess offers were however too advantageous to be given up and your fathers condescension was now to be their sole dependence and as they give out your last trial  and indeed my dear this must have succeeded i verily think with such a daughter as they had to deal with could that father who never i dare say kneeled in his life but to god have so far condescended as your aunt writes he would  but then my dear what would this have done  perhaps you would have given lovelace the meeting in hopes to pacify him and prevent mischief supposing that they had given you time and not hurried you directly into the state but if you had not met him you see that he was resolved to visit them and well attended too and what must have been the consequence  so that upon the whole we know not but matters may be best as they are however undesirable that best is  i hope your considerate and thoughtful mind will make a good use of this hint who would not with patience sustain even a great evil if she could persuade herself that it was kindly dispensed in order to prevent a still greater  especialy if she could sit down as you can and acquit her own heart  permit me one further observation  do we not see from the above state of the matter what might have been done before by the worthy person of your family had she exerted the mother in behalf of a child so meritorious yet so much oppressed  adieu my dear i will be ever yours  anna how miss harlowe in her answer to the first of the two last letters chides her friend for giving so little weight to her advice in relation to her behavior to her mother  it may be proper to insert here the following extracts from that answer though a little before their time  i will not repeat says see what i have before written in mr hickmans behalf i will only remind you of an observation i have made to you more than once that you have outlived your first passion and had the second man been an angel he would not have been more than indifferent to you  my motives for suspending proceeds she were not merely ceremonious ones i was really very ill i could not hold up my head the contents of my sisters letters had pierced my heart and was i my dear to be as ready to accept his offer as if i were afraid he never would repeat it  to the second letter among other things she says  so my dear you seem to think that there was a fate in my error the cordial the considering friend is seen in the observation you make on this occasion yet since things have happened as they have would to heaven i could hear that all the world acquitted my father or at least my mother for her character before these familyfeuds broke out was everyones admiration dont let anybody say from you so that it may come to her ear that she might by a timely exertion of her fine talents have saved her unhappy child you will observe my dear that in her own good time when she saw that there was not likely to be an end to my brothers persecutions she was resolved to exert herself but the pragmatical daughter by the fatal meeting precipitated all and frustrated her indulgent designs o my dear i am now convinced by dear experience that while children are so happy as to have parents or guardians whom they may consult they should not presume no not with the best and purest intentions to follow their own conceits in material cases  a ray of hope of future reconciliation adds she darts in upon my mind from the intention you tell me my mother had to exert herself in my favor had i not gone away and my hope is the stronger as this communication points out to me that my uncle harlowes interest is likely in my mothers opinion to be of weight if it could be engaged it will behove me perhaps to apply to that dear uncle if a proper occasion offer    letter lviii mr lovelace to john belford esquire monday april    fate is weaving a whimsical web for thy friend and i see not but i shall be inevitably manacled  here have i been at work dig dig dig like a cunning miner at one time and spreading my snares like an artful fowler at another and exulting in my contrivances to get this inimitable creature absolutely into my power  every thing made for me  her brother and uncle were but my pioneers her father stormed as i directed him to storm mrs how was acted by the springs i set at work her daughter was moving for me and yet imagined herself plumb against me and the dear creature herself had already run her stubborn neck into my gin and knew not that she was caught for i had not drawn my sprindges close about her  and just as all this was completed would thou believe that i should be my own enemy and her friend  that i should be so totally diverted from all my favorite purposes as to propose to marry her before i went to town in order to put it out of my own power to resume them  when thou know this will thou not think that my black angel plays me booty and has taken it into his head to urge me on to the indissoluble tie that he might be more sure of me from the complex transgressions to which he will certainly stimulate me when wedded than perhaps he thought he could be from the simple sins in which i have so long allowed myself that they seem to have the plea of habit  thou will be still the more surprised when i tell thee that there seems to be a coalition going forward between the black angels and the white ones for here has hers induced her in one hour and by one retrograde accident to acknowledge what the charming creature never before acknowleged a preferable favor for me she even owns an intention to be mine  mine without reformationconditions  she permits me to talk of love to her of the irrevocable ceremony yet another extraordinary postpones that ceremony chooses to set out for london and even to go to the widows in town  well but how comes all this about methinks thou ask  thou lovelace dealest in wonders yet aimest not at the mavelous  how did all this come about  i will tell thee  i was in danger of losing my charmer for ever  she was soaring upward to her native skies she was got above earth by means too of the earthborn and something extraordinary was to be done to keep her with us sublunaries and what so effectually as the soothing voice of love and the attracting offer of matrimony from a man not hated can fix the attention of the maiden heart aching with uncertainty and before impatient of the questionable question  this in short was the case  while she was refusing all manner of obligation to me keeping me at haughty distance in hopes that her cousin mordens arrival would soon fix her in a full and absolute independence of me disgusted likewise at her adorer for holding himself the reins of his own passions instead of giving them up to her control  she writes a letter urging an answer to a letter before written for her apparel her jewels and some gold which she had left behind her all which was to save her pride from obligation and to promote the independence her heart was set upon  and what followed but a shocking answer made still more shocking by the communication of a paternal curse upon a daughter deserving only blessings  a curse upon the cursers heart and a double one upon the transmitters the spiteful the envious arabella  absent when it came on my return i found her recovering from fits again to fall into stronger fits and nobody expecting her life half a dozen messengers dispatched to find me out  nor wonder at her being so affected she whose filial piety gave her dreadful faith in a fathers curses and the curse of this gloomy tyrant extending to use her own words when she could speak to both worlds  o that it had turned in the moment of its utterance to a mortal quinsey and sticking in his gullet had choked the old execrator as a warning to all such unnatural fathers  what a miscreant had i been not to have endeavored to bring her back by all the endearments by all the vows by all the offers that i could make her  i did bring her back more than a father to her for i have given her a life her unnatural father had wellnigh taken away shall i not cherish the fruits of my own benefaction  i have been in earnest in my vows to marry and my ardour to urge the present time was a real ardour but extreme dejection with a mingled delicacy that in her dying moments i doubt not she will preserve have caused her to refuse me the time though not the solemnity for she has told me that now she must be wholly in my protection being destitute of every other  more indebted still thou see to her cruel friends than to herself for her favor  she has written to miss how an account of their barbarity but has not acquainted her how very ill she was  low very low she remains yet dreading her stupid brothers enterprise she wants to be in london where but for this accident and would thou have believed it my persuasions seeing her so very ill she would have been this night and we shall actually set out on wednesday morning if she be not worse  and now for a few words with thee on thy heavy preachment of saturday last  thou art apprehensive that the lady is now in danger indeed and it is a miracle thou tellest me if she stand such an attempter knowing what we know of the sex thou say thou should dread were thou me to make farther trial lest thou should succeed and in another place tellest me that thou pleadest not for the state for any favor thou have for it  what an advocate art thou for matrimony  thou were ever an unhappy fellow at argument does the trite stuff with which the rest of thy letter abounds in favor of wedlock strike with the force that this does against it  thou take great pains to convince me and that from the distresses the lady is reduced to chiefly by her friends persecutions and implacableness i hope thou will own and not from me as yet that the proposed trial will not be a fair trial but let me ask thee is not calamity the test of virtue and would thou not have me value this charming creature upon proof of her merits  do i not intend to reward her by marriage if she stand that proof  but why repeat i what i have said before  turn back thou egregious arguer turn back to my long letter of the   th see letter xvii p  0  to     of this volume  and thou will there find every syllable of what thou have written either answered or invalidated  but i am not angry with thee jack i love opposition as gold is tried by fire and virtue by temptation so is sterling wit by opposition have i not before thou settedst out as an advocate for my fair one often brought thee in as making objections to my proceedings for no other reason than to exalt myself by proving thee a man of straw as homer raises up many of his champions and gives them terrible names only to have them knocked on the head by his heroes  however take to thee this one piece of advice  evermore be sure of being in the right when thou presumest to sit down to correct thy master  well but to return to my principal subject let me observe that be my future resolutions what they will as to this lady the contents of the violent letter she has received have set me at least a month forward with her i can now as i hinted talk of love and marriage without control or restriction her injunctions no more my terror  in this sweetly familiar way shall we set out together for london mrs sorlingss eldest daughter at my motion is to attend her in the chaise while i ride by way of escorte for she is extremely apprehensive of the singleton plot and has engaged me to be all patience if any thing should happen on the road but nothing i am sure will happen for by a letter received just now from joseph i understand that james harlowe has already laid aside his stupid project and this by the earnest desire of all his friends to whom he had communicated it who were afraid of the consequences that might attend it but it is not over with me however although i am not determined at present as to the uses i may make of it  my beloved tells me she shall have her clothes sent her she hopes also her jewels and some gold which she left behind her but joseph says clothes only will be sent i will not however tell her that on the contrary i say there is no doubt but they will send all she wrote for of personals the greater her disappointment from them the greater must be her dependence on me  but after all i hope i shall be enabled to be honest to a merit so transcendent the devil take thee though for thy opinion given so malapropo that she may be overcome  if thou designest to be honest methinks thou say why should not singletons plot be over with thee as it is with her brother  because if i must answer thee where people are so modestly doubtful of what they are able to do it is good to leave a loophole and let me add that when a mans heart is set upon a point and any thing occurs to beat him off he will find it is very difficult when the suspending reason ceases to forbear resumng it  letter lix mr lovelace to john belford esquire tuesday april    all hands at work in preparation for london what makes my heart beat so strong why rises it to my throat in such halfchoaking flutters when i think of what this removal may do for me  i am hitherto resolved to be honest and that increases my wonder at these involuntary commotions it is a plotting villain of a heart it ever was and ever will be i doubt such a joy when any roguery is going forward  i so little its master  a head likewise so well turned to answer the triangular varlets impulses no matter i will have one struggle with thee old friend and if i cannot overcome thee now i never will again attempt to conquer thee  the dear creature continues extremely low and dejected tender blossom how unfit to contend with the rude and ruffling winds of passion and haughty and insolent control  never till now from under the wing it is not enough to say of indulging but of admiring parents the mothers bosom only fit to receive this charming flower  this was the reflection that with mingled compassion and augmented love arose to my mind when i beheld the charmer reposing her lovely face upon the bosom of the widow sorlings from a recovered fit as i entered soon after she had received her execrable sisters letter how lovely in her tears  and as i entered her liftedup face significantly bespeaking my protection as i thought and can i be a villain to such an angel  i hope not  but why once more thou varlet put thou me in mind that she may be overcome and why is her own reliance on my honor so late and so reluctantly shown  but after all so low so dejected continues she to be that i am terribly afraid i shall have a vapourish wife if i do marry i should then be doubly undone not that i shall be much at home with her perhaps after the first fortnight or so but when a man has been ranging like the painful be from flower to flower perhaps for a month together and the thoughts of home and a wife begin to have their charms with him to be received by a niobe who like a wounded vine weeps its vitals away while it but involuntarily curls about you how shall i be able to bear that  may heaven restore my charmer to health and spirits i hourly pray that a man may see whether she can love any body but her father and mother in their power i am confident it will be at any time to make her husband joyless and that as i hate them so heartily is a shocking thing to reflect upon something more than woman an angel in some things but a baby in others so fathersick so familyfond what a poor chance stands a husband with such a wife unless forsooth they vouchsafe to be reconciled to her and continue reconciled  it is infinitely better for her and for me that we should not marry  what a delightful manner of life o that i could persuade her to it would that be with such a lady the fears the inquietudes the uneasy days the restless nights all arising from doubts of having disobliged me every absence dreaded to be an absence for ever and then how amply rewarded and rewarding by the rapturecausing return such a passion as this keeps love in a continual fervor makes it all alive the happy pair instead of sitting dozing and nodding at each other in two opposite chimneycorners in a winterevening and over a wintry love always new to each other and having always something to say  thou know in my verses to my stella my mind on this occasion i will lay those verses in her way as if undesignedly when we are together at the widows that is to say if we do not soon go to church by consent she will thence see what my notions are of wedlock if she receives them with any sort of temper that will be a foundation and let me alone to build upon it  many a girl has been carried who never would have been attempted had she showed a proper resentment when her ears or her eyes were first invaded i have tried a young creature by a bad book a light quotation or an indecent picture and if she has borne that or only blushed and not been angry and moreespecially if she has leerd and smiled that girl have i and old mulciber put down for our own o how i could warn these little rogues if i would perhaps envy more than virtue will put me upon setting up beacons for them when i grow old and joyless   tuesday afternoon if you are in london when i get thither you will see me soon  my charmer is a little better than she was her eyes show it and her harmonious voice hardly audible last time i saw her now begins to cheer my heart once more but yet she has no love no sensibility  there is no addressing her with those meaning yet innocent freedoms innocent at first setting out they may be called which soften others of her sex the more strange this as she now acknowleges preferable favor for me and is highly susceptible of grief grief mollifies and enervates the grieved mind looks round it silently implores consolation and loves the soother grief is ever an inmate with joy though they will not show themselves at the same window at one time yet have they the whole house in common between them   letter lx mr lovelace to john belford esquire wedn apr    at last my lucky star has directed us into the desired port and we are safely landed well says row the wise and active conquer difficulties by daring to attempt them sloth and folly shiver and shrink at sight of toil and hazard and make the impossibility they fear   but in the midst of my exultation something i know not what to call it checks my joys and glooms over my brighter prospects if it be not conscience it is wondrously like what i thought so many many years ago  surely lovelace methinks thou say thy good motions are not gone off already surely thou will not now at last be a villain to this lady  i cannot tell what to say to it  why would not the dear creature accept of me when i so sincerely offered myself to her acceptance things already appear with a very different face now i have got her here already have our mother and her daughters been about me charming lady what a complexion what eyes what majesty in her person  o mr lovelace you are a happy man  you owe us such a lady  then they remind me of my revenge and of my hatred to her whole family sally was so struck with her at first sight that she broke out to me in those lines of dryden  fairer to be seen than the fair lily on the flowery green more fresh than may herself in blossoms new    i sent to thy lodgings within half an hour after our arrival to receive thy congratulations upon it but thou were at edgware it seems  my beloved who is charmingly amended is retired to her constant employment writing i must content myself with the same amusement till she shall be pleased to admit me to her presence having already given to every one her cue  but here comes the widow with dorcas wykes in her hand  dorcas wykes jack is to be the maidservant to my fairone and i am to introduce them both to her in so many ways will it be in my power to have the dear creature now that i shall not know which of them to choose   so the honest girl is accepted  of good parentage but through a neglected education plaguey illiterate  she can neither write nor read writing a kinswoman of mrs sinclairs so could not well be refused the widow in person recommending her and the wench only taken till her hannah can come what an advantage has an imposing or forward nature over a courteous one  so here may something arise to lead into correspondencies and so forth  to be sure a person need not be so wary so cautious of what she writes or what she leaves upon her table or toilet when her attendant cannot read  dorcas is a neat girl both in person and dress a countenance not vulgar and i am in hopes that she accept of her for her bedfellow in astrange house for a week or so but i saw she had a dislike to her at her very first appearance  yet i thought the girl behaved very modestly  overdid it a little perhaps  she shrunk back and looked shy upon her the doctrine of sympathies and antipathies is a surprising doctrine  but dorcas will be excessively obliging and win her ladys favor soon i doubt not  i am secure in her incorruptibility a great point that  for a lady and her maid of one party will be too hard for half a score devils  the dear creature was no less shy when the widow first accosted her at her alighting yet i thought that honest dolemans letter had prepared her for her masculine appearance  and now i mention that letter why do thou not wish me joy jack  joy of what  why joy of my nuptials  know then that said is done with me when i have a mind to have it so and that we are actually man and wife only that consummation has not passed bound down to the contrary of that by a solemn vow till a reconciliation with her family take place the women here are told so they know it before my beloved knows it and that is odd thou wilt say  but how shall i do to make my fairone temperate on the intimation why is she not here  at mrs sinclairs  but if she will hear reason i doubt not to convince her that she ought to acquiesce  she will insist i suppose upon my leaving her and that i shall not take up my lodgings under the same roof but circumstances are changed since i first made her that promise i have taken all the vacant apartments and must carry this point also  i hope in a while to get her with me to the public entertainments she knows nothing of the town and has seen less of its diversions than ever woman of her taste her fortune her endowments did see she has indeed a natural politeness which transcends all acquirement the most capable of any one i ever knew of judging what an hundred things are by seeing one of a like nature indeed she took so much pleasure in her own chosen amusements till persecuted out of them that she had neither leisure nor inclination for the town diversions  these diversions will amuse and the duce is in it if a little susceptibility will not put forth now she receives my address and if i can manage it so as to be allowed to live under one roof with her what though the appearance be at first no more than that of an early springflower in frosty weather that seems afraid of being nippd by an easterly blast that will be enough for me  i hinted to thee in a former letter xxxvii p      that i had provided for the ladys indoor amusement sally and polly are readers my beloveds light closet was their library and several pieces of devotion have been put in bought on purpose at secondhand  i was always for forming a judgment of the reading part of the sex by their books the observations i have made on this occasion have been of great use to me as well in england as out of it this sagacious lady may possibly be as curious in this point as her lovelace  so much for the present thou see that i have a great deal of business before me yet i will write again soon  mr lovelace sends another letter with this in which he takes notice of young mrs sorlingss setting out with them and leaving them at barnet but as its contents are nearly the same with those in the ladys next it is omitted  letter lxi miss clarissa harlowe to miss how wedn p m apr    at length my dearest miss how i am in london and in my new lodgings they are neatly furnished and the situation for the town is pleasant but i think you must not ask me how i like the old gentlewoman yet she seems courteous and obliging her kinswomen just appeared to welcome me at my alighting they seem to be genteel young women but more of their aunt and of them as i shall see more  miss sorlings has an uncle at barnet whom she found so very ill that her uneasiness to stay to attend him having large expectations from him made me comply with her desire yet i wished as her uncle did not expect her that she would first see me settled in london and mr lovelace was still more earnest that she would offering to send her back again in a day or two and urging that her uncles malady intimated not a sudden change but leaving the matter to her choice after she knew what would have been mine she made me not the expected compliment upon it mr lovelace however made her a handsome present at parting  his genteel spirit on all occasions makes me often wish him more consistent  as soon as i arrived i took possession of my apartment shall make good use of the light closet in it if i stay here any time  one of his attendants returns in the morning to the lawn and i made writing to you by him an excuse for my retiring  and now give me leave to chide you my dearest friend for your rash and i hope revocable resolution not to make mr hickman the happiest man in the world while my happiness is in suspense suppose i were to be unhappy what my dear would your resolution avail me marriage is the highest state of friendship if happy it lessens our cares by divideing them at the same time that it doubles our pleasures by a mutual participation why my dear if you love me will you not rather give another friend to one who has not two that she is sure of  had you married on your mothers last birthday as she would have had you i should not i dare say have wanted a refuge that would have saved me so many mortifications and so much disgrace  here i was broken in upon by mr lovelace introducing the widow leading in a kinswoman of hers to attend me if i approved of her till my hannah should come or till i had provided myself with some other servant the widow gave her many good qualities but said that she had one great defect which was that she could not write nor read writing that part of her education having been neglected when she was young but for discretion fidelity obligingness she was not to be outdone by anybody she commended her likewise for her skill in the needle  as for her defect i can easily forgive that she is very likely and genteel too genteel indeed i think for a servant but what i like least of all in her she has a strange sly eye i never saw such an eye  halfconfident i think but indeed mrs sinclair herself for that is the widows name has an odd winking eye and her respectfulness seems too much studied methinks for the london ease and freedom but people cannot help their looks you know and after all she is extremely civil and obliging and as for the young woman dorcas her name she will not be long with me  i accepted her how could i do otherwise if i had a mind to make objections which in my present situation i had not her aunt present and the young woman also present and mr lovelace officious in his introducing of them for my sake  but upon their leaving me i told him who seemed inclinable to begin a conversation with me that i desired that this apartment might be considered as my retirement that when i saw him it might be in the dining room and that i might be as little broke in upon as possible when i am here he withdrew very respectfully to the door but there stopped and asked for my company then in the dining room if he was about setting out for other lodgings i would go with him now i told him but if he did not just then go i would first finish my letter to miss how  i see he has no mind to leave me if he can help it my brothers scheme may give him a pretense to try to engage me to dispense with his promise but if i now do i must acquit him of it entirely  my approbation of his tender behavior in the midst of my grief has given him a right as he seems to think of addressing me with all the freedom of an approved lover i see by this man that when once a woman embarks with this sex there is no receding one concession is but the prelude to another with them he has been ever since sunday last continually complaining of the distance i keep him at and thinks himself entitled now to call in question my value for him strengthening his doubts by my declared readiness to give him up to a reconciliation with my friends  and yet has himself fallen off from that obsequious tenderness if i may couple the words which drew from me the concessions he builds upon  while we were talking at the door my new servant came up with an invitation to us both to tea i said he might accept of it if he pleased but i must pursue my writing and not choosing either tea or supper i desired him to make my excuses below as to both and inform them of my choice to be retired as much as possible yet to promise for me my attendance on the widow and her nieces at breakfast in the morning  he objected particularity in the eye of strangers as to avoiding supper  you know said i and can tell them that i seldom eat suppers my spirits are low you must never urge me against a declared choice pray mr lovelace inform them of all my particularities if they are obliging they will allow for them i come not here to make new acquaintance  i have turned over the books i have found in my closet and am not a little pleased with them and think the better of the people of the house for their sakes  stanhopes gospels sharps tillotsons and souths sermons nelsons feasts and fasts a sacramental piece of the bishop of man and another of dr gauden bishop of exeter and inetts devotions are among the devout books and among those of a lighter turn these not illchosen ones a telemachus in french another in english steeles rowes and shakespeares plays that genteel comedy of mr cibber the careless husband and others of the same author drydens miscellanies the tattlers spectators and guardians popes and swifts and addisons works  in the blank leaves of the nelson and bishop gauden is mrs sinclairs name in those of most of the others either sarah martin or mary horton the names of the two nieces  i am exceedingly out of humor with mr lovelace and have great reason to be so as you will allow when you have read the conversation i am going to give you an account of for he would not let me rest till i gave him my company in the dining room  he began with letting me know that he had been out to inquire after the character of the widow which was the more necessary he said as he supposed that i would expect his frequent absence  i did i said and that he would not think of taking up his lodging in the same house with me but what was the issue of his inquiry  why indeed it was in the main what he liked well enough but as it was miss howes opinion as i had told him that my brother had not given over his scheme as the widow lived by letting lodgings and had others to let in the same part of the house which might be taken by an enemy he knew no better way than for him to take them all as it could not be for a long time unless i would think of removing to others  so far was well enough but as it was easy for me to see that he spoke the slighter of the widow in order to have a pretense to lodge here himself i asked him his intention in that respect and he frankly owned that if i chose to stay here he could not as matters stood think of leaving me for six hours together and he had prepared the widow to expect that we should be here but for a few days  only till we could fix ourselves in a house suitable to our condition and this that i might be under the less embarrass if i pleased to remove  fix ourselves in a house and we and our mr lovelace  pray in what light   he interrupted me  why my dearest life if you will hear me with patience  yet i am half afraid that i have been too forward as i have not consulted you upon it  but as my friends in town according to what mr doleman has written in the letter you have seen conclude us to be married   surely sir you have not presumed   hear me out dearest creature  you have received with favor my addresses  you have made me hope for the honor of your consenting hand yet by declining my most fervent tender of myself to you at mrs sorlingss have given me apprehensions of delay i would not for the world be thought so ungenerous a wretch now you have honored me with your confidence as to wish to precipitate you yet your brothers schemes are not given up singleton i am afraid is actually in town his vessel lies at rotherhith  your brother is absent from harloweplace indeed not with singleton yet as i can hear if you are known to be mine or if you are but thought to be so there will probably be an end of your brothers contrivances the widows character may be as worthy as it is said to be but the worthier she is the more danger if your brothers agent should find us out since she may be persuaded that she ought in conscience to take a parents part against a child who stands in opposition to them but if she believes us married her good character will stand us in stead and she will be of our party  then i have taken care to give her a reason why two apartments are requisite for us at the hour of retirement  i perfectly raved at him i would have flung from him in resentment but he would not let me and what could i do whither go the evening advanced  i am astonished at you said i  if you are a man of honor what need of all this strange obliquity you delight in crooked ways  let me know since i must stay in your company for he held my hand let me know all you have said  indeed indeed mr lovelace you are a very unaccountable man  my dearest creature need i to have mentioned any thing of this and could i not have taken up my lodgings in this house unknown to you if i had not intended to make you the judge of all my proceedings  but this is what i have told the widow before her kinswomen and before your new servant  that indeed we were privately married at hertford but that you had preliminarily bound me under a solemn vow which i am most religiously resolved to keep to be contented with separate apartments and even not to lodge under the same roof till a certain reconciliation shall take place which is of high consequence to both and further that i might convince you of the purity of my intentions and that my whole view in this was to prevent mischief i have acquainted them that i have solemnly promised to behave to you before every body as if we were only betrothed and not married not even offering to take any of those innocent freedoms which are not refused in the most punctilious loves  and then he solemnly vowed to me the strictest observance of the same respectful behavior to me  i told him that i was not by any means satisfied with the tale he had told nor with the necessity he wanted to lay me under of appearing what i was not that every step he took was a wry one a needless wry one and since he thought it necessary to tell the people below any thing about me i insisted that he should unsay all he had said and tell them the truth  what he had told them he said was with so many circumstances that he could sooner die than contradict it and still he insisted upon the propriety of appearing to be married for the reasons he had given before  and dearest creature said he why this high displeasure with me upon so wellintended an expedient you know that i cannot wish to shun your brother or his singleton but upon your account the first step i would take if lest to myself would be to find them out i have always acted in this manner when anybody has presumed to give out threatenings against me  it is true i should have consulted you first and had your leave but since you dislike what i have said let me implore you dearest madam to give the only proper sanction to it by naming an early day would to heaven that were to be tomorrow  for gods sake let it be tomorrow but if not was it his business my dear before i spoke yet he seemed to be afraid of me to say if not let me beseech you madam if my behavior shall not be to your dislike that you will not tomorrow at breakfasttime discredit what i have told them the moment i give you cause to think that i take any advantage of your concession that moment revoke it and expose me as i shall deserve  and once more let me remind you that i have no view either to serve or save myself by this expedient  it is only to prevent a probable mischief for your own minds sake and for the sake of those who deserve not the least consideration from me  what could i say what could i do  i verily think that had he urged me again in a proper manner i should have consented little satisfied as i am with him to give him a meeting tomorrow morning at a more solemn place than in the parlour below  but this i resolve that he shall not have my consent to stay a night under this roof he has now given me a stronger reason for this determination than i had before  alas my dear how vain a thing to say what we will or what we will not do when we have put ourselves into the power of this sex  he went down to the people below on my desiring to be left to myself and staid till their supper was just ready and then desiring a moments audience as he called it he besought my leave to stay that one night promising to set out either for lord ms or for edgware to his friend belfords in the morning after breakfast but if i were against it he said he would not stay supper and would attend me about eight next day  yet he added that my denial would have a very particular appearance to the people below from what he had told them and the more as he had actually agreed for all the vacant apartments indeed only for a month for the reason he had before hinted at but i need not stay here two days if upon conversing with the widow and her nieces in the morning i should have any dislike to them  i thought notwithstanding my resolution abovementioned that it would seem too punctilious to deny him under the circumstances he had mentioned  having besides no reason to think he would obey me for he looked as if he were determined to debate the matter with me and as now i see no likelihood of a reconciliation with my friends and had actually received his addresses with less reserve than ever i thought i would not quarrel with him if i could help it especially as he asked to stay but for one night and could have done so without my knowing it and you being of opinion that the proud wretch distrusting his own merits with me or at least my regard for him will probably bring me to some concessions in his favor for all these reasons i thought proper to yield this point yet i was so vexed with him on the other that it was impossible for me to comply with that grace which a concession should be made with or not made at all  this was what i said  what you will do you must do i think you are very ready to promise very ready to depart from your promise you say however that you will set out tomorrow for the country you know how ill i have been i am not well enough now to debate with you upon your incroaching ways i am utterly dissatisfied with the tale you have told below nor will i promise to appear to the people of the house tomorrow what i am not  he withdrew in the most respectful manner beseeching me only to favor him with such a meeting in the morning as might not make the widow and her nieces think he had given me reason to be offended with him  i retired to my own apartment and dorcas came to me soon after to take my commands i told her that i required very little attendance and always dressed and undressed myself  she seemed concerned as if she thought i had repulsed her and said it should be her whole study to oblige me  i told her that i was not difficult to please and should let her know from time to time what assistances i should expect from her but for that night i had no occasion for her further attendance  she is not only genteel but is wellbred and wellspoken  she must have had what is generally thought to be the polite part of education but it is strange that fathers and mothers should make so light as they generally do of that preferable part in girls which would improve their minds and give a grace to all the rest  as soon as she was gone i inspected the doors the windows the wainscot the dark closet as well as the light one and finding very good fastenings to the door and to all the windows i again had recourse to my pen  mrs sinclair is just now gone from me dorcas she told me had acquainted her that i had dismissed her for the night she came to ask me how i liked my apartment and to wish me good rest she expressed her concern that they could not have my company at supper mr lovelace she said had informed them of my love of retirement she assured me that i should not be broken in upon she highly extolled him and gave me a share in the praise as to person but was sorry she said that she was likely to lose us so soon as mr lovelace talked of  i answered her with suitable civility and she withdrew with great tokens of respect with greater i think than should be from distance of years as she was the wife of a gentleman and as the appearance of every thing about her as well house as dress carries the marks of such good circumstances as require not abasement  if my dear you will write against prohibition be pleased to direct to miss laetitia beaumont to be left till called for at mr wilsons in pall mall  mr lovelace proposed this direction to me not knowing of your desire that our letters should pass by a third hand as his motive for it was that my brother might not trace out where we are i am glad as well from this instance as from others that he seems to think he has done mischief enough already  do you know how my poor hannah does  mr lovelace is so full of his contrivances and expedients that i think it may not be amiss to desire you to look carefully to the seals of my letters as i shall to those of yours if i find him base in this particular i shall think him capable of any evil and will fly him as my worst enemy  letter lxii miss how to miss clarissa harlowe with her two last letters no lvilvii enclosed thursday night april    i have yours just brought me mr hickman has helped me to a lucky expedient which with the assistance of the post will enable me to correspond with you every day an honest higgler simon collins his name by whom i shall send this and the two enclosed now i have your direction where goes to town constantly on mondays wednesdays and fridays and can bring back to me from wilsons what you shall have caused to be left for me  i congratulate you on your arrival in town so much amended in spirits i must be brief i hope you will have no cause to repent returning my norris it is forthcoming on demand  i am sorry your hannah cannot be with you she is very ill still but not in danger  i long for your account of the women you are with if they are not right people you will find them out in one breakfasting  i know not what to write upon his reporting to them that you are actually married his reasons for it are plausible but he delights in odd expedients and inventions  whether you like the people or not dont by your noble sincerity and plaindealing make yourself enemies you are in the world now you know  i am glad you had thoughts of taking him at his offer if he had reurged it i wonder he did not but if he dont soon and in such a way as you can accept of it dont think of staying with him  depend upon it my dear he will not leave you either night or day if he can help it now he has got footing  i should have abhorred him for his report of your marriage had he not made it with such circumstances as leave it still in your power to keep him at distance if once he offer at the least familiarity  but this is needless to say to you he can have i think no other design but what he professes because he must needs think that his report must increase your vigilance  you may depend upon my looking narrowly into the sealings of your letters if as you say he be base in that point he will be so in everything but to one of your merit of your fortune of your virtue he cannot be base the man is no fool it is his interest as well with regard to his expectations from his own friends as from you to be honest would to heaven however that you were really married this is the predominant wish of  your anna how  letter lxiii miss clarissa harlowe to miss how thursday morning eight oclock i am more and more displeased with mr lovelace on reflection for his boldness in hoping to make me though but passively as i may say testify to his great untruth and i shall like him still less for it if his view in it does not come out to be the hope of accelerating my resolution in his favor by the difficulty it will lay me under as to my behavior to him he has sent me his compliments by dorcas with a request that i will permit him to attend me in the dining room perhaps that he may guess from thence whether i will meet him in good humor or not but i have answered that as i shall see him at breakfasttime i desire to be excused   ten oclock i tried to adjust my countenance before i went down to an easier air than i had a heart and was received with the highest tokens of respect by the widow and her two nieces agreeable young women enough in their persons but they seemed to put on an air of reserve while mr lovelace was easy and free to all as if he were of long acquaintance with them gracefully enough i cannot but say an advantage which traveled gentlemen have over other people  the widow in the conversation we had after breakfast gave us an account of the military merit of the colonel her husband and upon this occasion put her handkerchief to her eye twice or thrice i hope for the sake of her sincerity she wetted it because she would be thought to have done so but i saw not that she did she wished that i might never know the loss of a husband so dear to me as her dear colonel was to her and again she put her handkerchief to her eyes  it must no doubt be a most affecting thing to be separated from a good husband and to be left in difficult circumstances besides and that not by his fault and exposed to the insults of the base and ungrateful as she represented her case to be at his death this moved me a good deal in her favor  you know my dear that i have an open and free heart and naturally have as open and free a countenance at least my complimenters have told me so at once where i like i mingle minds without reserve encouraging reciprocal freedoms and am forward to dissipate diffidences but with these two young gentlewomen i never can be intimate  i dont know why  only that circumstances and what passed in conversation encouraged not the notion or i should have been apt to think that the young gentlewomen and mr lovelace were of longer acquaintance than yesterday for he by stealth as it were cast glances sometimes at them which they returned and on my ocular notice their eyes fell as i may say under my eye as if they could not stand its examination  the widow directed all her talk to me as to mrs lovelace and i with a very ill grace bore it and once she expressed more forwardly than i thanked her for her wonder that any vow any consideration however weighty could have force enough with so charming a couple as she called him and me to make us keep separate beds  their eyes upon this hint had the advantage of mine yet was i not conscious of guilt how know i then upon recollection that my censures upon theirs are not too rash there are no doubt many truly modest persons putting myself out of the question who by blushes at an injurious charge have been suspected by those who cannot distinguish between the confusion which guilt will be attended with and the noble consciousness that overspreads the face of a fine spirit to be thought but capable of an imputed evil  the great roman as we read who took his surname from one part in three the fourth not then discovered of the world he had triumphed over being charged with a mean crime to his soldiery chose rather to suffer exile the punishment due to it had he been found guilty than to have it said that scipio was questioned in public on so scandalous a charge and think you my dear that scipio did not blush with indignation when the charge was first communicated to him  mr lovelace when the widow expressed her forward wonder looked sly and leering as if to observe how i took it and said they might observe that his regard for my will and pleasure calling me his dear creature had greater force upon him than the oath by which he had bound himself  rebuking both him and the widow i said it was strange to me to hear an oath or vow so lightly treated as to have it thought but of second consideration whatever were the first  the observation was just miss martin said for that nothing could excuse the breaking of a solemn vow be the occasion of making it what it would  i asked after the nearest church for i have been too long a stranger to the sacred worship they named st jamess st annes and another in bloomsbury and the two nieces said they oftenest went to st jamess church because of the good company as well as for the excellent preaching  mr lovelace said the royal chapel was the place he oftenest went to when in town poor man little did i expect to hear he went to any place of devotion i asked if the presence of the visible king of comparatively but a small territory did not take off too generally the requisite attention to the service of the invisible king and maker of a thousand worlds  he believed this might be so with such as came for curiosity when the royal family were present but otherwise he had seen as many contrite faces at the royal chapel as anywhere else and why not since the people about courts have as deep scores to wipe off as any people whatsoever  he spoke this with so much levity that i could not help saying that nobody questioned but he knew how to choose his company  your servant my dear bowing were his words and turning to them you will observe upon numberless occasions ladies as we are further acquainted that my beloved never spares me upon these topics but i admire her as much in her reproofs as i am fond of her approbation  miss horton said there was a time for everything she could not but say that she thought innocent mirth was mighty becoming in young people  very true joined in miss martin and shakespeare says well that youth is the spring of life the bloom of gaudy years with a theatrical air she spoke it and for her part she could not but admire in my spouse that charming vivacity which so well suited his time of life  mr lovelace bowed the man is fond of praise more fond of it i doubt than of deserving it yet this sort of praise he does deserve he has you know an easy free manner and no bad voice and this praise so expanded his gay heart that he sung the following lines from congreve as he told us youth does a thousand pleasures bring which from decrepit age will fly sweets that wanton in the bosom of the spring in winters cold embraces die   and this for a compliment as he said to the two nieces nor was it thrown away upon them they encored it and his compliance fixed them in my memory  we had some talk about meals and the widow very civilly offered to conform to any rules i would set her i told her how easily i was pleased and how much i chose to dine by myself and that from a plate sent me from any single dish but i will not trouble you with such particulars  they thought me very singular and with reason but as i liked them not so very well as to forego my own choice in compliment to them i was the less concerned for what they thought and still the less as mr lovelace had put me very much out of humor with him  they however cautioned me against melancholy i said i should be a very unhappy creature if i could not bear my own company  mr lovelace said that he must let the ladies into my story and then they would know how to allow for my ways but my dear as you love me said the confident wretch give as little way to melancholy as possible nothing but the sweetness of your temper and your high notions of a duty that can never be deserved where you place it can make you so uneasy as you are  be not angry my dear love for saying so seeing me frown i suppose and snatched my hand and kissed it  i left him with them and retired to my closet and my pen  just as i have wrote thus far i am interrupted by a message from him that he is setting out on a journey and desires to take my commands  so here i will leave off to give him a meeting in the dining room i was not displeased to see him in his riding dress  he seemed desirous to know how i liked the gentlewomen below i told him that although i did not think them very exceptionable yet as i wanted not in my present situation new acquaintance i should not be fond of cultivating theirs and he must second me particularly in my desire of breakfasting and supping when i did sup by myself  if i would have it so to be sure it should be so the people of the house were not of consequence enough to be apologizd to in any point where my pleasure was concerned and if i should dislike them still more on further knowledge of them he hoped i would think of some other lodgings  he expressed a good deal of regret at leaving me declaring that it was absolutely in obedience to my commands but that he could not have consented to go while my brothers schemes were on foot if i had not done him the credit of my countenance in the report he had made that we were married which he said had bound all the family to his interest so that he could leave me with the greater security and satisfaction  he hoped he said that on his return i would name his happy day and the rather as i might be convinced by my brothers projects that no reconciliation was to be expected  i told him that perhaps i might write one letter to my uncle harlowe he once loved me i should be easier when i had made one direct application i might possibly propose such terms in relation to my grandfathers estate as might procure me their attention and i hoped he would be long enough absent to give me time to write to him and receive an answer from him  that he must beg my pardon he could not promise he would inform himself of singletons and my brothers motions and if on his return he found no reason for apprehensions he would go directly to berks and endeavor to bring up with him his cousin charlotte who he hoped would induce me to give him an earlier day than at present i seemed to think of  i told him that i would take that young ladys company for a great favor  i was the more pleased with this motion as it came from himself  he earnestly pressed me to accept of a bank note but i declined it and then he offered me his servant william for my attendant in his absence who he said might be dispatched to him if any thing extraordinary fell out i consented to that  he took his leave of me in the most respectful manner only kissing my hand he left the note unobserved by me upon the table you may be sure i shall give it him back at his return  i am now in a much better humor with him than i was where doubts of any person are removed a mind not ungenerous is willing by way of amends for having conceived those doubts to construe everything that happens capable of a good construction in that persons favor particularly i cannot but be pleased to observe that although he speaks of the ladies of his family with the freedom of relationship yet it is always with tenderness and from a mans kindness to his relations of the sex a woman has some reasons to expect his good behavior to herself when married if she be willing to deserve it from him and thus my dear am i brought to such a pass as to sit myself down satisfied with this man where i find room to infer that he is not naturally a savage  may you my dear friend be always happy in your reflections prays  your everaffectionate cl harlowe     mr lovelace in his next letter triumphs on his having carried his two great points of making the lady yield to pass for his wife to the people of the house and to his taking up his lodging in it though but for one night he is now sure he says that he shall soon prevail if not by persuasion by surprise yet he pretends to have some little remorse and censures himself as acting the part of the grand tempter but having succeeded thus far he cannot he says forbear trying according to the resolution he had before made whether he cannot go farther  he gives the particulars of their debates on the abovementioned subjects to the same effect as in the ladys last letters  it will by this time be seen that his whole merit with regard to this lady lies in doing justice to her excellencies both of mind and person by aknowlegement though to his own condemnation thus he begins his succeeding letter  and now belford will i give thee an account of our first breakfast conversation  all sweetly serene and easy was the lovely brow and charming aspect of my goddess on her descending to us commanding reverence from every eye a courtesy from every knee and silence awful silence from every quivering lip while she armed with conscious worthiness and superiority looked and behaved as an empress would among her vassals yet with a freedom from pride and haughtiness as if born to dignity and to a behavior habitually gracious  he takes notice of the jealousy pride and vanity o sally martin and polly horton on his respectful behavior to her creatures who brought up to high for their fortunes and to a taste of pleasure an the public diversions had fallen an easy prey to hi seducing arts and for some time past been associate with mrs sinclair and who as he observes had no yet got over that distinction in their love which make a woman prefer one man to another  how difficult is it says he to make a woman subscribe to a preference against herself though ev so visible especially where love is concerned this violent this partial little devil sally has the insolence to compare herself with an angel  yet owns her to be an angel i charge you mr lovelace said she show none of your extravagant acts of kindness before me to this sullen this gloomy beauty  i cannot bear it  then her first sacrifices were remembered  what a rout do these women make about nothing at all were it not for what the learned bishop in his letter from italy calls the delicacy of intrigue what is there belford in all they can do for us   how do these creatures endeavor to stimulate me a fallen woman jack is a worse devil than even a profligate man the former is above all remorse that am not i  nor ever shall they prevail upon me though aided by all the powers of darkness to treat this admirable creature with indignity  so far i mean as indignity can be separated from the trials which will prove her to be either woman or angel  yet with them i am a craven i might have had her before now if i would if i would treat her as flesh and blood i should find her such they thought that i knew if any man living did that to make a goddess of a woman she would assume the goddess to give her power she would act up to it to the giver if to nobody else  and d  rs wife is thrown into my dish who thou know kept her overceremonious husband at haughty distance and whined in private to her insulting footman  o how i cursed the blaspheming wretches  they will make me as i tell them hate their house and never rest till i remove her  and by my soul jack i begin to repent already that i have brought her hither  and yet without knowing their hearts she resolves against having any more conversation with them than she can avoid this i am not sorry for since jealousy in woman is not to be concealed from woman and sally has no command of herself   letter lxiv miss clarissa harlowe to miss how friday april    mr lovelace is returned already my brothers projects were his pretense i could not but look upon this short absence as an evasion of his promise especially as he had taken such precautions with the people below and as he knew that i proposed to keep close within doors i cannot bear to be dealt meanly with and angrily insisted that he should directly set out for berkshire in order to engage his cousin as he had promised  o my dearest life said he why will you banish me from your presence  i cannot leave you for so long a time as you seem to expect i should i have been hovering about town ever since i left you edgware was the furthest place i went to and there i was not able to stay two hours for fear at this crisis any thing should happen who can account for the workings of an apprehensive mind when all that is dear and valuable to it is at stake  you may spare yourself the trouble of writing to any of your friends till the happy ceremony has passed that shall entitle me to give weight to your application when they know we are married your brothers plots will be at an end and your father and mother and uncles must be reconciled to you  why then should you hesitate a moment to confirm my happiness  why once more would you banish me from you why will you not give the man who has brought you into difficulties and who so honorably wishes to extricate you from them the happiness of doing so  he was silent my voice failed to second the inclination i had to say something not wholly discourageing to a point so ardently pressed  i will tell you my angel resumed he what i propose to do if you approve of it i will instantly go out to view some of the handsome new squares or fine streets round them and make a report to you of any suitable house i find to be let i will take such a one as you shall choose furnish it and set up an equipage befitting our condition you shall direct the whole and on some early day either before or after we fix it must be at your own choice be pleased to make me the happiest of men and then will every thing be in a desirable train you shall receive in your own house if it can be so soon furnished as i wish the congratulations of all my relations charlotte shall visit you in the interim and if it take up time you shall choose whom you will honor with your company first second or third in the summer months and on your return you shall find all that was wanting in your new habitation supplied and pleasures in a constant round shall attend us o my angel take me to you instead of banishing me from you and make me yours for ever  you see my dear that here was no day pressed r i was not uneasy about that and the sooner overed myself as there was not but however gave him no reason to upbraid me for refusing his er of going in search of a house  he is accordingly gone out for this purpose but  find that he intends to take up his lodging here toght and if tonight no doubt on other nights hen he is in town as the doors and windows of y apartment have good fastenings as he has not all this time given me cause for apprehension as has the pretense of my brothers schemes to plead the people below are very courteous and oblige miss horton especially who seems to have taken a great liking to me and to be of a gentler temper and manners than miss martin and as we are now in a tolerable way i imagine it would look particular to them all and bring me into a debate with a man who let him be set upon what he will has always a great deal to say for himself if i insisted upon his promise on all these accounts i think i will take no notice of his lodging here if he dont  let me know my dear your thoughts of every thing you may believe i gave him back his note the moment i saw him   friday evening mr lovelace has seen two or three houses but none to his mind but he has heard of one which looks promising he says and which he is to inquire about in the morning   saturday morning he has made his inquiries and actually seen the house he was told of last night the owner of it is a young widow lady who is inconsolable for the death of her husband fretchville her name it is furnished quite in taste every thing being new within these six months he believes if i like not the furniture the use of it may be agreed for with the house for a time certain but if i like it he will endeavor to take the one and purchase the other directly  the lady sees nobody nor are the best apartments abovestairs to be viewed till she is either absent or gone into the country where she proposes to live retired and which she talks of doing in a fortnight or three weeks at farthest  what mr lovelace saw of the house which were the salon and two parlours was perfectly elegant and he was assured all is of a piece the offices are also very convenient coachhouse and stables a hand  he shall be very impatient he says till i see the whole nor will he if he finds he can have it look farther till i have seen it except any thing else offer to my liking the price he values not  he has just now received a letter from lady betty lawrance by a particular hand the contents principally relating to an affair she has in chancery but in the postscript she is pleased to say very respectful things of me they are all impatient she says for the happy day being over which they flatter themselves will ensure his reformation  he hoped he told me that i would soon enable him to answer their wishes and his own but although the opportunity was so inviting he urged not for the day which is the more extraordinary as he was so pressing for marriage before we came to town  he was very earnest with me to give him and four of his friends my company on monday evening at a little collation miss martin and miss horton cannot he says be there being engaged in a party of their own with two daughters of colonel solcombe and two nieces of sir anthony holmes upon an annual occasion but mrs sinclair will be present and she gave him hope also of the company of a young maiden lady of very great fortune and merit miss partington to whom colonel sinclair it seems in his lifetime was guardian and who therefore calls mrs sinclair mamma  i desired to be excused he had laid me i said under a most disagreeable necessity of appearing as a married person and i would see as few people as possible who were to think me so  he would not urge it he said if i were much averse but they were his select friends men of birth and fortune who longed to see me it was true that they as well as his friend doleman believed we were married but they thought him under the restrictions that he had mentioned to the people below i might be assured he told me that his politeness before them should be carried into the highest degree of reverence  when he is set upon any thing there is no knowing as i have said heretofore what one can do but i will not if i can help it be made a show of especially to men of whose characters and principles i have no good opinion i am my dearest friend  your everaffectionate cl harlowe mr lovelace in his next letter to his friend mr belford recites the most material passages in hers preceding he invites him to his collation on monday evening    mowbray belton and tourville says he long to see my angel and will be there she has refused me but must be present notwithstanding and then will i show thee the pride and glory of the harlowe family my implacable enemies and thou shall join with me in my triumph over them all  if i can procure you this honor you will be ready to laugh out as i have often much ado to forbear at the puritanical behavior of the mother before this lady not an oath not a curse nor the least free word escapes her lips she minces in her gaite she prims up her horsemouth her voice which when she pleases is the voice of thunder is sunk into an humble whine her stiff hams that have not been bent to a civility for ten years past are now limberd into courtesies threedeep at every word her fat arms are crossed before her and she can hardly be prevailed upon to sit in the presence of my goddess  i am drawing up instructions for ye all to observe on monday night it will be thy care who art a parading fellow and pretendest to wisdom to keep the rest from blundering     saturday night most confoundedly alarmed  lord sir what do you think cried dorcas  my lady is resolved to go to church tomorrow i was at quadrille with the women below  to church said i and down i laid my cards to church repeated they each looking upon the other we had done playing for that night who could have dreamt of such a whim as this  without notice without questions her clothes not come no leave asked  impossible she should think to be my wife  why this lady dont consider if she go to church i must go too  yet not to ask for my company  her brother and singleton ready to snap her up as far as she knows  known by her clothes her person her features so distinguished  not such another woman in england to church of all places  is the devil in the girl said i as soon as i could speak  well but to leave this subject till tomorrow morning i will now give you the instructions i have drawn up for yours and your companions behavior on monday night  instructions to be observed by john belford richard mowbray thomas belton and james tourville esquires of the body to general robert lovelace on their admission to the presence of his goddess then follow his humorous instructions  in which he cautions them to avoid all obscene hints and even the double entendre    you know says he that i never permitted any of you to talk obscenely time enough for that when ye grow old and can only talk what as i have often said cannot you touch a womans heart without wounding her ear  i need not bid you respect me mightily your allegiance obliges you to that and who that sees me respects me not  he gives them their cue as to miss partington and her history and assumed character    so noted says he for innocent looks yet deep discretion  and be sure to remember that my beloved has no name but mine and that the mother has no other than her maiden name sinclair her husband a lieutenant colonel  many other whimsical particulars he gives and then says    this dear lady is prodigiously learned in theories but as to practies as to experimentals must be as you know from her tender years a mere novice till she knew me i dare say she did not believe whatever she had read that there were such fellows in the world as she will see in you four i shall have much pleasure in observing how she will stare at her company when she finds me the politest man of the five  and so much for instructions general and particular for your behavior on monday night  and now methinks thou art curious to know what can be my view in risking the displeasure of my fair one and alarming her fears after four or five halcyon days have gone over our heads  i will satisfy thee  the visitors of the two nieces will crowd the house beds will be scarce miss partington a sweet modest genteel girl will be prodigiously taken with my charmer will want to begin a friendship with her a share in her bed for one night only will be requested who knows but on that very monday night i may be so unhappy as to give mortal offense to my beloved the shyest birds may be caught napping should she attempt to fly me upon it cannot i detain her should she actually fly cannot i bring her back by authority civil or uncivil if i have evidence upon evidence that she acknowleged though but tacitly her marriage  and should i or should i not succeed and she forgive me or if she but descend to expostulate or if she bear me in her sight then will she be all my own all delicacy is my charmer i long to see how such a delicacy on either occasion will behave and in my situation it behooves me to provide against every accident  i must take care knowing what an eel i have to do with that the little wriggling rogue does not slip through my fingers how silly should i look staring after her when she had shot from me into the muddy river her family from which with so much difficulty i have taken her  well then here are  let me see  how many persons are there who after monday night will be able to swear that she has gone by my name answered to my name had no other view in leaving her friends but to go by my name her own relations not able nor willing to deny it  first here are my servants her servant dorcas mrs sinclair her two nieces and miss partington  but for fear these evidences should be suspected here comes the jet of the business  no less than four worthy gentlemen of fortune and family who were all in company such a night particularly at a collation to which they were invited by robert lovelace of sandounhall in the county of lancaster esquire in company with magdalen sinclair widow and priscilla partington spinster and the lady complainant when the said robert lovelace addressed himself to the said lady on a multitude of occasions as his lady as they and others did as mrs lovelace every one complimenting and congratulating her upon her nuptials and that she received such their compliments and congratulations with no other visible displeasure or repugnance than such as a young bride full of blushes and pretty confusion might be supposed to express upon such contemplative revolvings as those compliments would naturally inspire nor do thou rave at me jack nor rebel  do think i brought the dear creature here for nothing  and there is a faint sketch of my plot  stand by varlets  tantararara  veil your bonnets and confess your master   letter lxv mr lovelace to john belford esquire sunday have been at church jack  behaved admirably well too  my charmer is pleased with me now  for i was exceedingly attentive to the discourse and very ready in the auditors part of the service  eyes did not much wander how could they when the loveliest object infinitely the loveliest in the whole church was in my view  dear creature how fervent how amiable in her devotions  i have got her to own that she prayed for me  i hope a prayer from so excellent a mind will not be made in vain  there is after all something beautifully solemn in devotion  the sabbath is a charming institution to keep the heart right when it is right one day in seven how reasonable  i think i will go to church once a day often i fancy it will go a great way toward making me a reformed man to see multitudes of wellappearing people all joining in one reverent act an exercise worthy of a sentient being yet it adds a sting or two to my former stings when i think of my projects with regard to this charming creature in my conscience i believe if i were to go constantly to church i could not pursue them  i had a scheme come into my head while there but i will renounce it because it obtruded itself upon me in so good a place excellent creature how many ruins has she prevented by attaching me to herself  by engrossing my whole attention  but let me tell thee what passed between us in my first visit of this morning and then i will acquaint thee more largely with my good behavior at church  i could not be admitted till after eight i found her ready prepared to go out i pretended to be ignorant of her intention having charged dorcas not to own that she had told me of it  going abroad madam  with an air of indifference  yes sir i intend to go to church  i hope madam i shall have the honor to attend you  no she designed to take a chair and go to the next church  this startled me a chair to carry her to the next church from mrs sinclairs her right name not sinclair and to bring her back thither in the face of people who might not think well of the house there was no permitting that  yet i was to appear indifferent  but said i should take it for a favor if she would permit me to attend her in a coach as there was time for it to st pauls  she made objections to the gaiety of my dress and told me that if she went to st pauls she could go in a coach without me  i objected singleton and her brother and offered to dress in the plainest suit i had  i beg the favor of attending you dear madam said i i have not been at church a great while we shall sit in different stalls and the next time i go i hope it will be to give myself a title to the greatest blessing i can receive  she made some further objections but at last permitted me the honor of attending her  i got myself placed in her eye that the time might not seem tedious to me for we were there early and i gained her good opinion as i mentioned above by my behavior  the subject of the discourse was particular enough it was about a prophets story or parable of an ewelamb taken by a rich man from a poor one who dearly loved it and whose only comfort it was designed to strike remorse into david on his adultery with uriahs wife bathsheba and his murder of the husband these women jack have been the occasion of all manner of mischief from the beginning now when david full of indignation swore king david would swear jack but how should thou know who king david was the story is in the bible that the rich man should surely die nathan which was the prophets name and a good ingenious fellow cried out which were the words of the text thou art the man  by my soul i thought the parson looked directly at me and at that moment i cast my eye full at my ewelamb but i must tell thee too that i thought a good deal of my rosebud  a better man than king david in that point however thought i  when we came home we talked upon the subject and i showed my charmer my attention to the discourse by letting her know where the doctor made the most of his subject and where it might have been touched to greater advantage for it is really a very affecting story and has as pretty a contrivance in it as ever i read and this i did in such a grave way that she seemed more and more pleased with me and i have no doubt that i shall get her to favor me tomorrow night with her company at my collation   sunday evening we all dined together in mrs sinclairs parlour all ex cessively right the two nieces have toppd their parts mrs sinclair hers never so easy yet as now  she really thought a little oddly of these people at first she said mrs sinclair seemed very forbidding her nieces were persons with whom she could not wish to be acquainted but really we should not be too hasty in our censures some people improve upon us the widow seems tolerable she went no farther than tolerable miss martin and miss horton are young people of good sense and have read a good deal what miss martin particularly said of marriage and of her humble servant was very solid she believes with such notions she cannot make a bad wife  by the way sallys humble servant is a woolendraper of great reputation and she is soon to be married  i have been letting her into thy character and into the characters of my other three esquires in hopes to excite her curiosity to see you tomorrow night i have told her some of the worst as well as best parts of your characters in order to exalt myself and to obviate any sudden surprises as well as to teach her what sort of men she may expect to see if she will oblige me  by her observations upon each of you i shall judge what i may or may not do to obtain or keep her good opinion what she will like what not and so pursue the one or avoid the other as i see proper  so while she is penetrating into your shallow heads i shall enter her heart and know what to bid my own hope for  the house is to be taken in three weeks all will be over in three weeks or bad will be my luck  who knows but in three days  have i not carried that great point of making her pass for my wife to the people below and that other great one of fixing myself here night and day  what lady ever escaped me that lodged under one roof with me  the house too the house the people people after my own heart her servants will and dorcas both my servants  three days did i say pho pho  three hours  i have carried my third point jack but extremely to the dislike of my charmer miss partington was introduced to her and being engaged on condition that my beloved would honor me at my collation there was no denying her so fine a young lady seconded by my earnest entreaties  i long to have your opinions of my fair prize  if you love to see features that glow though the heart is frozen and never yet was thawed if you love fine sense and adages flowing through teeth of ivory and lips of coral an eye that penetrates all things a voice that is harmony itself an air of grandeur mingled with a sweetness that cannot be described a politeness that if ever equalled was never excelled  you will see all these excellencies and ten times more in this my gloriana  mark her majestic fabric  she is a temple sacred by birth and built by hands divine her soul the deity that lodges there nor is the pile unworthy of the god or to describe her in a softer style with row the bloom of opening flowers unsullied beauty softness and sweetest innocence she wears and looks like nature in the worlds first spring   adieu varlets four  at six on monday evening i expect ye all  in the ladys next letter dated on monday morning she praises his behavior at church his observations afterward likes the people of the house better than she did the more likes them by reason of the people of condition that visit them  she dates again and declares herself displeased at miss partingtons being introduced to her and still more for being obliged to promise to be present at mr lovelaces collation she foresees she says a murdered evening     letter lxvi miss clarissa harlowe to miss how monday night may   i have just escaped from the very disagreeable company i was obliged so much against my will to be in as a very particular relation of this evenings conversation would be painful to me you must content yourself with what you shall be able to collect from the outlines as i may call them of the characters of the persons assisted by the little histories mr lovelace gave me of each yesterday  the names of the gentlemen are belton mowbray tourville and belford these four with mrs sinclair miss partington the great heiress mentioned in my last mr lovelace and myself made up the company  i gave you before the favorable side of miss partingtons character such as it was given me by mrs sinclair and her nieces i will now add a few words from my own observations upon her behavior in this company  in better company perhaps she would have appeared to less disadvantage but notwithstanding her innocent looks which mr lovelace also highly praised he is the last person whose judgment i would take upon real modesty for i observed that upon some talk from the gentlemen not free enough to be openly censured yet too indecent in its implication to come from wellbred persons in the company of virtuous people this young lady was very ready to apprehend and yet by smiles and simperings to encourage rather than discourage the culpable freedoms of persons who in what they went out of their way to say must either be guilty of absurdity meaning nothing or meaning something of rudeness  but indeed i have seen ladies of whom i have had a better opinion than i can say i have of mrs sinclair who have allowed gentlemen and themselves too in greater liberties of this sort than i have thought consistent with that purity of manners which ought to be the distinguishing characteristic of our sex for what are words but the body and dress of thought and is not the mind indicated strongly by its outward dress  but to the gentlemen as they must be called in right of their ancestors it seems for no other do they appear to have  mr belton has had universityeducation and was designed for the gown but that not suiting with the gaiety of his temper and an uncle dying who bequeathed to him a good estate he quitted the college came up to town and commenced fine gentleman he is said to be a man of sense he dresses gaily but not quite foppishly drinks hard keeps all hours and glories in doing so games and has been hurt by that pernicious diversion he is about thirty years of age his face is of a fiery red somewhat bloated and pimply and his irregularities threaten a brief duration to the sensual dream he is in for he has a short consumptive cough which seems to indicate bad lungs yet makes himself and his friends merry by his stupid and inconsiderate jests upon very threatening symptoms which ought to make him more serious  mr mowbray has been a great traveller speaks as many languages as mr lovelace himself but not so fluently is of a good family seems to be about thirtythree or thirtyfour tall and comely in his person bold and daring in his look is a largeboned strong man has a great scar in his forehead with a dent as if his skull had been beaten in there and a seamed scar in his right cheek he dresses likewise very gaily has his servants always about him whom he is continually calling upon and sending on the most trifling messages half a dozen instances of which we had in the little time i was among them while they seem to watch the turn of his fierce eye to be ready to run before they have half his message and serve him with fear and trembling yet to his equals the man seems tolerable talks not amiss upon public entertainments and diversions especially upon those abroad yet has a romancing air and averrs things strongly which seem quite improbable indeed he doubts nothing but what he ought to believe for he jests upon sacred things and professes to hate the clergy of all religions has high notions of honor a word hardly ever out of his mouth but seems to have no great regard to morals  mr tourville occasionally told his age just turned of thirtyone he also is of an ancient family but in his person and manners more of what i call the coxcomb than any of his companions he dresses richly would be thought elegant in the choice and fashion of what he wears yet after all appears rather tawdry than fine one sees by the care he takes of his outside and the notice he bespeaks from every one by his own notice of himself that the inside takes up the least of his attention he dances finely mr lovelace says is a master of music and singing is one of his principal excellencies they prevailed upon him to sing and he obliged them both in italian and french and to do him justice his songs in both were decent they were all highly delighted with his performance but his greatest admirers were mrs sinclair miss partington and himself to me he appeared to have a great deal of affectation  mr tourvilles conversation and address are insufferably full of those really gross affronts upon the understandings of our sex which the moderns call compliments and are intended to pass for so many instances of good breeding though the most hyperbolical unnatural stuff that can be conceived and which can only serve to show the insincerity of the complimenter and the ridiculous light in which the complimented appears in his eyes if he supposes a woman capable of relishing the romantic absurdities of his speeches  he affects to introduce into his common talk italian and french words and often answers an english question in french which language he greatly prefers to the barbarously hissing english but then he never fails to translate into this his odious native tongue the words and the sentences he speaks in the other two  lest perhaps it should be questioned whether he understands what he says  he loves to tell stories always calls them merry facetious good or excellent before he begins in order to bespeak the attention of the hearers but never gives himself concern in the progress or conclusion of them to make good what he promises in his preface indeed he seldom brings any of them to a conclusion for if his company have patience to hear him out he breaks in upon himself by so many parenthetical intrusions as one may call them and has so many incidents springing in upon him that he frequently drops his own thread and sometimes sits down satisfied halfway or if at other times he would resume it he applies to his company to help him in again with a devil fetch him if he remembers what he was driving at but enough and too much of mr tourville  mr belford is the fourth gentleman and one of whom mr lovelace seems more fond than any of the rest  being a man of tried bravery it seems for this pair of friends came acquainted upon occasion of a quarrel possibly about a lady which a rencounter at kensington gravelpits ended by the mediation of three gentlemen strangers  mr belford is about seven or eight andtwenty it seems the youngest of the five except mr lovelace and these are perhaps the wickedest for they seem capable of leading the other three as they please mr belford as the others dresses gaily but has not those advantages of person nor from his dress which mr lovelace is too proud of he has however the appearance of a gentleman he is well read in classical authors and in the best english poets and writers and by his means the conversation took nowandthen a more agreeable turn and i who endeavored to put the best face i could upon my situation as i passed for mrs lovelace with them made shift to join in it at such times and received abundance of compliments from all the company on the observations i made  mr belford seems goodnatured and obliging and although very complaisant not so fulsomely so as mr tourville and has a polite and easy manner of expressing his sentiments on all occasions he seems to delight in a logical way of argumentation as also does mr belton these two attacking each other in this way and both looking at us women as if to observe whether we did not admire their learning or their wit when they had said a smart thing but mr belford had visibly the advantage of the other having quicker parts and by taking the worst side of the argument seemed to think he had all together he put me in mind of that character in milton  his tongue dropped manna and could make the worse appear the better reason to perplex and dash maturest counsels for his thoughts were low to vice industrious but to nobler deeds timorous and slothful  yet he pleased the ear   how little soever matters in general may be to our liking we are apt to endeavor when hope is strong enough to permit it to make the best we can of the lot we have drawn and i could not but observe often how much mr lovelace excelled all his four friends in every thing they seemed desirous to excel in but as to wit and vivacity he had no equal present all the others gave up to him when his lips began to open the haughty mowbray would call upon the prating tourville for silence and with his elbow would punch the supercilious belton into attention when lovelace was going to speak and when he had spoken the words charming fellow with a free word of admiration or envy fell from every mouth he has indeed so many advantages in his person and manner that what would be inexcusable in another if one took not great care to watch over ones self and to distinguish what is the essence of right and wrong would look becoming in him  see him among twenty men said mr belford who to my no small vexation and confusion with the forwardness of a favored and entrusted friend singled me out on mr lovelaces being sent for down to make me congratulatory compliments on my supposed nuptials which he did with a caution not to insist too long on the rigorous vow i had imposed upon a man so universally admired   see him among twenty men said he all of distinction and nobody is regarded but mr lovelace  it must indeed be confessed that there is in his whole deportment a natural dignity which renders all insolent or imperative demeanor as unnecessary as inexcusable then that deceiving sweetness which appears in his smiles in his accent in his whole aspect and address when he thinks it worth his while to oblige or endeavor to attract how does this show that he was born innocent as i may say that he was not naturally the cruel the boisterous the impetuous creature which the wicked company he may have fallen into have made him for he has besides an open and i think an honest countenance dont you think so too  on all these specious appearances have i founded my hopes of seeing him a reformed man  but it is amazing to me i own that with so much of the gentleman such a general knowledge of books and men such a skill in the learned as well as modern languages he can take so much delight as he does in the company of such persons as i have described and in subjects of frothy impertinence unworthy of his talents and natural and acquired advantages i can think of but one reason for it and that must argue a very low mind his vanity which makes him desirous of being considered as the head of the people he consorts with a man to love praise yet to be content to draw it from such contaminated springs  one compliment passed from mr belford to mr lovelace which hastened my quitting the shocking company  you are a happy man mr lovelace said he upon some fine speeches made him by mrs sinclair and assented to by miss partington you have so much courage and so much wit that neither man nor woman can stand before you  mr belford looked at me when he spoke yes my dear he smilingly looked at me and he looked upon his complimented friend and all their assenting and therefore affronting eyes both mens and womens were turned upon your clarissa at least my selfreproaching heart made me think so for that would hardly permit my eye to look up  oh my dear were but a woman who is thought to be in love with a man and this must be believed to be my case or to what can my supposed voluntary going off with mr lovelace be imputed to to reflect one moment on the exaltation she gives him and the disgrace she brings upon herself the low pity the silent contempt the insolent sneers and whispers to which she makes herself obnoxious from a censuring world of both sexes how would she despise herself and how much more eligible would she think death itself to such a discovered debasement  what i have thus in general touched upon will account to you why i could not more particularly relate what passed in the evenings conversation which as may be gathered from what i have written abounded with approbatory accusations and supposed witry retorts  letter lxvii miss clarissa harlowe to miss how monday midnight i am very much vexed and disturbed at an odd incident  mrs sinclair has just now left me i believe in displeasure on my declining to comply with a request she made me which was to admit miss partington to a share in my bed her house being crowded by her nieces guests and their attendants as well as by those of miss partington  there might be nothing in it and my denial carried a stiff and illnatured appearance but instantly all at once upon her making the request it came into my thought that i was in a manner a stranger to everybody in the house not so much as a servant i could call my own or of whom i had any great opinion that there were four gentlemen of free manners in the house avowed supporters of mr lovelace in matters of offense himself a man of enterprise all as far as i knew and had reason to think by their noisy mirth after i had left them drinking deeply that miss partington herself is not so bashful a lady as she was represented to me to be that officious pains were taken to give me a good opinion of her and that mrs sinclair made a greater parade in prefacing the request than such a request needed to deny thought i can carry only an appearance of singularity to people who already think me singular to consent may possibly if not probably be attended with inconveniences the consequences of the alternative so very disproportionate i thought it more prudent to incur the censure than risk the inconvenience  i told her that i was writing a long letter that i should choose to write till i were sleepy and that miss would be a restraint upon me and i upon her  she was loath she said that so delicate a young creature and so great a fortune as miss partington was should be put to lie with dorcas in a pressbed she should be very sorry if she had asked an improper thing she had never been so put to it before and miss would stay up with her till i had done writing  alarmed at this urgency and it being easier to persist in a denial given than to give it at first i offered miss my whole bed and to retire into the diningroom and there locking myself in write all the night  the poor thing she said was afraid to lie alone to be sure miss partington would not put me to such an inconvenience  she then withdrew but returned begged my pardon for returning but the poor child she said was in tears miss partington had never seen a young lady she so much admired and so much wished to imitate as me the dear girl hoped that nothing had passed in her behavior to give me dislike to her should she bring her to me  i was very busy i said the letter i was writing was upon a very important subject i hoped to see miss in the morning when i would apologize to her for my particularity and then mrs sinclair hesitating and moving toward the door though she turned round to me again i desired her lighting her to take care how she went down  pray madam said she on the stairs head dont give yourself all this trouble god knows my heart i meant no affront but since you seem to take my freedom amiss i beg you will not acquaint mr lovelace with it for he perhaps will think me bold and impertinent  now my dear is not this a particular incident either as i have made it or as it was designed i dont love to do an uncivil thing and if nothing were meant by the request my refusal deserves to be called so then i have shown a suspicion of foul usage by it which surely dare not be meant if just i ought to apprehend every thing and fly the houfe and the man as i would an infection if not just and if i cannot contrive to clear myself of having entertained suspicions by assigning some other plausible reason for my denial the very staying here will have an appearance not at all reputable to myself  i am now out of humor with him with myself with all the world but you his companions are shocking creatures why again i repeat should he have been desirous to bring me into such company once more i like him not i am my dear  your affectionate cl harlowe  letter lxviii miss clarissa harlowe to miss how tuesday may   with infinite regret i am obliged to tell you that i can no longer write to you or receive letters from you your mother has sent me a letter enclosed in a cover to mr lovelace directed for him at lord ms and which was brought him just now reproaching me on this subject in very angry terms and forbidding me as i would not be thought to intend to make her and you unhappy to write to you without her leave  this therefore is the last you must receive from me till happier times and as my prospects are not very bad i presume we shall soon have leave to write again and even to see each other since an alliance with a family so honorable as mr lovelaces is will not be a disgrace  she is pleased to write that if i would wish to inflame you i should let you know her written prohibition but otherwise find some way of my own accord without bringing her into the question to decline a correspondence which i must know she has for some time past forbidden but all i can say is to beg of you not to be inflamed  to beg of you not to let her know or even by your behavior to her on this occasion guess that i have acquainted you with my reason for declining to write to you for how else after the scruples i have heretofore made on this very subject yet proceeding to correspond can i honestly satisfy you about my motives for this sudden stop so my dear i choose you see rather to rely upon your discretion than to feign reasons you would not be satisfied with but with your usual active penetration sift to the bottom and at last find me to be a mean and low qualifier and that with an implication injurious to you that i supposed you had not prudence enough to be trusted with the naked truth  i repeat that my prospects are not bad the house i presume will soon be taken the people here are very respectful notwithstanding my nicety about miss partington miss martin who is near marriage with an eminent tradesman in the strand just now in a very respectful manner asked my opinion of some patterns of rich silks for the occasion the widow has a less forbidding appearance than at first mr lovelace on my declared dislike of his four friends has assured me that neither they nor anybody else shall be introduced to me without my leave  these circumstances i mention as you will suppose that your kind heart may be at ease about me that you may be induced by them to acquiesce with your mothers commands cheerfully acquiesce and that for my sake lest i should be thought an inflamer who am with very contrary intentions my dearest and bestbeloved friend  your everobliged and affectionate clarissa halowe  letter lxix miss how to miss clarissa harlowe wedn may   i am astonished that my mother should take such a step  purely to exercise an unreasonable act of authority and to oblige the most remorseless hearts in the world if i find that i can be of use to you either by advice or information do you think i will not give it  were it to any other person less dear to me than you are do you think in such a case i would forbear giving it   mr hickman who pretends to a little casuistry in such nice matters is of opinion that i ought not to decline a correspondence thus circumstanced and it is well he is for my mother having set me up i must have somebody to quarrel with  this i will come into if it will make you easy i will forbear to write to you for a few days if nothing extraordinary happen  and till the rigor of her prohibition is abated but be assured that i will not dispense with your writing to me my heart my conscience my honor will not permit it  but how will i help myself  how  easy enough for i do assure you that i want but very little further provocation to fly privately to london and if i do i will not leave you till i see you either honorably married or absolutely quit of the wretch and in this last case i will take you down with me in defiance of the whole world or if you refuse to go with me stay with you and accompany you as your shadow whithersoever you go  dont be frighted at this declaration there is but one consideration and but one hope that withold me watched as i am in all my retirements obliged to read to her without a voice to work in her presence without fingers and to lie with her every night against my will the consideration is lest you should apprehend that a step of this nature would look like a doubling of your fault in the eyes of such as think your going away a fault the hope is that things will still end happily and that some people will have reason to take shame to themselves for the sorry parts they have acted  nevertheless i am often balancing but your resolving to give up the correspondence at this crisis will turn the scale write therefore or take the consequence  a few words upon the subject of your last letters  i know not whether your brothers wise project be given up or not a dead silence reigns in your family your brother was absent three days then at home one and is now absent but whether with singleton or not i cannot find out  by your account of your wretchs companions i see not but they are a set of infernals and he the beelzebub what could he mean as you say by his earnestness to bring you into such company and to give you such an opportunity to make him and them reflectingglasses to one another the mans a fool to be sure my dear  a silly fellow at least  they must put on their best before you no doubt  lords of the creation  noble fellows these  yet who knows how many poor despicable souls of our sex the worst of them has had to whine after him  you have brought an inconvenience upon yourself as you observe by your refusal of miss partington for your bedfellow pity you had not admitted her watchful as you are what could have happened if violence were intended he would not stay for the night you might have sat up after her or not gone to bed mrs sinclair pressed it too far you was overscrupulous  if any thing happens to delay your nuptials i would advise you to remove but if you marry you may perhaps think it no great matter to stay where you are till you take possession of your own estate the knot once tied and with so resolute a man it is my opinion your relations will soon resign what they cannot legally hold and were even a litigation to follow you will not be able nor ought you to be willing to help it for your estate will then be his right and it will be unjust to wish it to be withheld from him  one thing i would advise you to think of and that is of proper settlements it will be to the credit of your prudence and of his justice and the more as matters stand that something of this should be done before you marry bad as he is nobody accounts him a sordid man and i wonder he has been hitherto silent on that subject  i am not displeased with his proposal about the widow ladys house i think it will do very well but if it must be three weeks before you can be certain about it surely you need not put off his day for that space and he may bespeak his equipages surprising to me that he could be so acquiescent  i repeat  continue to write to me  i insist upon it and that as minutely as possible or take the consequence i send this by a particular hand i am and ever will be  your most affectionate anna how  letter lxx miss clarissa harlowe to miss how thursday may   i forego every other engagement i suspend every wish i banish every other fear to take up my pen to beg of you that you will not think of being guilty of such an act of love as i can never thank you for but must for ever regret if i must continue to write to you i must i know full well your impatience of control when you have the least imagination that your generosity or friendship is likely to be wounded by it  my dearest dearest creature would you incur a maternal as i have a paternal malediction would not the world think there was an infection in my fault if it were to be followed by miss how there are some points so flagrantly wrong that they will not bear to be argued upon this is one of them i need not give reasons against such a rashness heaven forbid that it should be known that you had it but once in your thought be your motives ever so noble and generous to follow so bad an example the rather as that you would in such a case want the extenuations that might be pleaded in my favor and particularly that one of being surprised into the unhappy step  the restraint your mamma lays you under would not have appeared heavy but on my account would you have once thought it a hardship to be admitted to a part of her bed  how did i use to be delighted with such a favor from my mother  how did i love to work in her presence  so did you in the presence of yours once and to read to her on winterevenings i know was one of your joys  do not give me cause to reproach myself on the reason that may be assigned for the change  learn my dear i beseech you learn to subdue your own passions be the motives what they will excess is excess those passions in our sex which we take no pains to subdue may have one and the same source with those infinitely blacker passions which we used so often to condemn in the violent and headstrong of the other sex and which may be heightened in them only by custom and their freer education let us both my dear ponder well this thought look into ourselves and fear  if i write as i find i must i insist upon your forbearance  your silence to this shall be the sign to me that you will not think of the rashness you threaten me with and that you will obey your mamma as to your own part of the correspondence however especially as you can inform or advise me in every weighty case by mr hickmans pen  my trembling writing will show you what a trembling heart you my dear impetuous creature have given to  your everobliged or if you take so rash a step your forever disobliged clarissa harlowe my clothes were brought to me just now but you have so much discomposed me that i have no heart to look into the trunks  a servant of mr lovelace carries this to mr hickman for dispatchsake let that worthy mans pen relieve my heart from this new uneasiness    letter lxxi mr hickman to miss clarissa harlowe sent to wilsons by a particular hand friday may   madam i have the honor of dear miss howes commands to acquaint you without knowing the occasion that she is excessively concerned for the concern she has given you in her last letter and that if you will but write to her under cover as before she will have no thoughts of what you are so very apprehensive about  yet she bid me write that if she has but the least imagination that she can serve you and save you those are her words all the censures of the world will be but of second consideration with her i have great temptations on this occasion to express my own resentments upon your present state but not being fully apprised of what that is  only conjecturing from the disturbance upon the mind of the dearest lady in the world to me and the most sincere of friends to you that that is not altogether so happy as were to be wished and being moreover forbid to enter into the cruel subject i can only offer as i do my best and faithfullest services and to wish you a happy deliverance from all your troubles for i am  most excellent young lady your faithful and most obedient servant chapter hickman  letter lxxii mr lovelace to john belford esquire tuesday may   mercury as the fabulist tells us having the curiosity to know the estimation he stood in among mortals descended in disguise and in a statuarys shop cheapens a jupiter then a juno then one then another of the dii majores and at last asks what price that same statue of mercury bore o says the artist buy one of the others sir and i will throw ye in that for nothing how sheepish must the god of thieves look upon this rebuff to his vanity  so thou  a thousand pounds would thou give for the good opinion of this single lady to be only thought tolerably of and not quite unworthy of her conversation would make thee happy and at parting last night or rather this morning thou made me promise a few lines to edgware to let thee know what she thinks of thee and thy brother varlets  thy thousand pounds jack is all thy own for most heartily does she dislike ye all thee as much as any  i am sorry for it too as to thy part for two reasons one that i think thy motive for thy curiosity was fear and consciousness whereas that of the archthief was vanity intolerable vanity and he was therefore justly sent away with a blush upon his cheeks to heaven and could not brag the other that i am afraid if she dislikes thee she dislikes me for are we not birds of a feather  i must never talk of reformation she told me having such companions and taking such delight as i seemed to take in their frothy conversation  i no more than you imagined she could possibly like ye but then as my friends i thought a person of her education would have been more sparing of her censures  i dont know how it is belford but women think themselves entitled to take any freedoms with us while we are unpolite forsooth and i cannot tell what if we dont tell a pack of cursed lies and make black white in their favor  teaching us to be hypocrites yet stigmatizing us at other times for deceivers  i defended ye all as well as i could but you know there was no attempting ought but a palliative defense to one of her principles i will summarily give thee a few of my pleas  to the pure every little deviation seemed offensive yet i saw not that there was any thing amiss the whole evening either in your words or behavior some people could talk but upon one or two subjects she upon everyone no wonder therefore they talked to what they understood best and to mere objects of sense  had she honored us with more of her conversation she would have been less disgusted with ours for she saw how everyone was prepared to admire her whenever she opened her lips you in particular had said when she retired that virtue itself spoke when she spoke but that you had such an awe upon you after she had favored us with an observation or two on a subject started that you should ever be afraid in her company to be found most exceptionable when you intended to be least so  plainly she said she neither liked my companions nor the house she was in  i liked not the house any more than she though the people were very obliging and she had owned they were less exceptionable to herself than at first and were we not about another of our own  she did not like miss partington let her fortune be what it would she should not choose an intimacy with her she thought it was a hardship to be put upon such a difficulty as she was put upon the preceding night when there were lodgers in the fronthouse whom they had reason to be freer with than upon so short an acquaintance with her  i pretended to be an utter stranger as to this particular and when she explained herself upon it condemned the request and called it a confident one  she artfully made lighter of her denial of miss for a bedfellow than she thought of it i could see that for it was plain she supposed there was room for me to think she had been either over nice or over cautious  i offered to resent mrs sinclairs freedom  no there was no great matter in it it was best to let it pass it might be thought more particular in her to deny than in mrs sinclair to ask or miss to expect but as the people below had a large acquaintance she did not know how much she might have her retirements invaded if she gave way and indeed there were levities in misss behavior which she could not so far pass over as to wish an intimacy with her but if she were such a vast fortune she could not but say that miss seemed a much more suitable person for me to make my addresses to than   interrupting her with gravity i said i liked miss partington as little as she could like her she was a silly young creature who seemed too likely to justify her guardians watchfulness over her but nevertheless as to her general conversation and behavior last night i must own that i thought the girl for girl she was as to discretion not exceptionable only carrying herself as a free goodnatured creature who thought herself secure in the honor of her company  it was very well said of me she replied but if miss were so well satisfied with her company she left it to me whether i was not very kind to suppose her such an innocent  for her own part she had seen nothing of the london world but thought she must tell me plainly that she never was in such company in her life nor ever again wished to be in it  there belford  worse off than mercury  art thou not  i was nettled hard would be the lot of more discreet ladies as far as i knew than miss partington were they to be judged by so rigid a virtue as hers  not so she said but if i really saw nothing exceptionable to a virtuous mind in that young ladys behavior my ignorance of better behavior was she must needs tell me as pitiable as hers and it were to be wished that minds so paired for their own sakes should never be separated  see jack what i get by my charity  i thanked her heartily but i must take the liberty to say that good folks were generally so uncharitable that devil take me if i would choose to be good were the consequence to be that i must think hardly of the whole world besides  she congratulated me upon my charity but told me that to enlarge her own she hoped it would not be expected of her to approve of the low company i had brought her into last night  no exception for thee belford safe is thy thousand pounds  i saw not i said begging her pardon that she liked anybody plaindealing for plaindealing  why then did she abuse my friends  love me and love my dogs as lord m would say  however let me but know whom and what she did or did not like and if possible i would like and dislike the very same persons and things  she bid me then in a pet dislike myself  cursed severe  does she think she must not pay for it one day or one night  and if one many that is my comfort  i was in a train of being so happy i said before my earnestness to procure her to favor my friends with her company that i wished the devil had had as well my friends as miss partington  and yet i must say that i saw not how good people could answer half their end which was by their example to amend the world were they to accompany only with the good  i had like to have been blasted by two or three flashes of lightning from her indignant eyes and she turned scornfully from me and retired to her own apartment  once more jack safe as thou see is thy thousand pounds  she says i am not a polite man  but is she in the instance before us more polite for a lady  and now do thou not think that i owe my charmer some revenge for her cruelty in obliging such a fine young creature and so vast a fortune as miss partington to crowd into a pressbed with her maidservant dorcas  miss partington too with tears declaring by mrs sinclair that would mrs lovelace honor her at barnet the best bed and best room in her guardians house should be at her service  think thou that i could not guess at her dishonorable fears of me  that she apprehended that the supposed husband would endeavor to take possession of his own  and that miss partington would be willing to contribute to such a piece of justice  thus then thou both remindest and defiest me charmer  and since thou reliest more on thy own precaution than upon my honor be it unto thee as thou apprehendest fair one  and now jack let me know what thy opinion and the opinions of thy brother varlets are of my gloriana  i have just now heard that her hannah hopes to be soon well enough to attend her young lady when in london it seems the girl has had no physician i must send her one out of pure love and respect to her mistress who knows but medicine may weaken nature and strengthen the disease  as her malady is not a fever very likely it may do so  but perhaps her hopes are too forward blustering weather in this month yet  and that is bad for rheumatic complaints  letter lxxiii mr lovelace to john belford esquire tuesday may   just as i had sealed up the enclosed comes a letter to my beloved in a cover to me directed to lord ms from whom think thou  from mrs how   and what the contents  how should i know unless the dear creature had communicated them to me but a very cruel letter i believe it is by the effect it had upon her the tears ran down her checks as she read it and her color changed several times no end of her persecutions i think  what a cruelty in her sat said the sweet lamenter  now the only comfort of her life must be given up  miss howes correspondence no doubt  but should she be so much grieved at this this correspondence was prohibited before and that to the daughter in the strongest terms but yet carried on by both although a brace of impeccables and please ye could they expect that a mother would not vindicate her authority  and finding her prohibition ineffectual with her perverse daughter was it not reasonable to suppose she would try what effect it would have upon her daughters friend  and now i believe the end will be effectually answered for my beloved i dare say will make a point of conscience of it  i hate cruelty especially in women and should have been more concerned for this instance of it in mrs how had i not had a stronger instance of the same in my beloved to miss partington for how did she know since she was so much afraid for herself whom dorcas might let in to that innocent and less watchful young lady but nevertheless i must needs own that i am not very sorry for this prohibition let it originally come from the harlowes or from whom it will because i make no doubt that it is owing to miss how in a great measure that my beloved is so much upon her guard and thinks so hardly of me and who can tell as characters here are so tender and some disguises so flimsy what consequences might follow this undutiful correspondence  i say therefore i am not sorry for it now will she have nobody to compare notes with nobody to alarm her and i may be saved the guilt and disobligation of inspecting into a correspondence that has long made me uneasy  how every thing works for me  why will this charming creature make such contrivances necessary as will increase my trouble and my guilt too as some would account it but why rather i would ask will she fight against her stars   letter lxxiv mr belford to robert lovelace esquire edgware tuesdaynight may   without staying for the promised letter from you to inform us what the lady says of us i write to tell you that we are all of one opinion with regard to her which is that there is not of her age a finer lady in the world as to her understanding as for her person she is at the age of bloom and an admirable creature a perfect beauty but this poorer praise a man can hardly descend to give who has been honored with her conversation and yet she was brought amongst us against her will  permit me dear lovelace to be a means of saving this excellent creature from the dangers she hourly runs from the most plotting heart in the world in a former i pleaded your own family lord ms wishes particularly and then i had not seen her but now i join her sake honors sake motives of justice generosity gratitude and humanity which are all concerned in the preservation of so fine a creature  thou know not the anguish i should have had whence arising i cannot devise had i not known before i set out this morning that the incomparable creature had disappointed thee in thy cursed view of getting her to admit the specious partington for a bedfellow  there is something so awful and yet so sweet in this ladys aspect i have done nothing but talk of her ever since i saw her that were i to have the virtues and the graces all drawn in one piece they should be taken every one of them from different airs and attitudes in her she was born to adorn the age she was given to and would be an ornament to the first dignity what a piercing yet gentle eye every glance i thought mingled with love and fear of you what a sweet smile darting through the cloud that overspread her fair face demonstrating that she had more apprehensions and grief at her heart than she cared to express  you may think what i am going to write too flighty but by my faith i have conceived such a profound reverence for her sense and judgment that far from thinking the man excusable who should treat her basely i am ready to regret that such an angel of a lady should even marry she is in my eye all mind and were she to meet with a man all mind likewise why should the charming qualities she is mistress of be endangered why should such an angel be plunged so low as into the vulgar offices of domestic life were she mine i should hardly wish to see her a mother unless there were a kind of moral certainty that minds like hers could be propagated for why in short should not the work of bodies be left to mere bodies i know that you yourself have an opinion of this lady little less exalted than mine belton mowbray tourville are all of my mind are full of her praises and swear it would be a million of pities to ruin a lady in whose fall none but devils can rejoice  what must that merit and excellence be that can extort this from us free livers like yourself and all of us your partial friends who have joined with you in your just resentments against the rest of her family and offered our assistance to execute your vengeance on them but we cannot think it reasonable that you should punish an innocent lady who loves you so well and who is in your protection and has suffered so much for you for the faults of her relations  and here let me put a serious question or two think thou truly admirable as this lady is that the end thou proposest to thyself if obtained is answerable to the means to the trouble thou give thyself and the perfidies tricks stratagems and contrivances thou have already been guilty of and still meditatest in every real excellence she surpasses all her sex but in the article thou seek to subdue her for a mere sensualist of her sex a partington a horton a martin would make a sensualist a thousand times happier than she either will or can sweet are the joys that come with willingness and would thou make her unhappy for her whole life and thyself not happy for a single moment  hitherto it is not too late and that perhaps is as much as can be said if thou meanest to preserve her esteem and good opinion as well as person for i think it is impossible she can get out of thy hands now she is in this cursed house o that damned hypocritical sinclair as thou call her how was it possible she should behave so speciously as she did all the time the lady staid with us be honest and marry and be thankful that she will condescend to have thee if thou do not thou wilt be the worst of men and will be condemned in this world and the next as i am sure thou ought and should too were thou to be judged by one who never before was so much touched in a womans favor and whom thou know to be  thy partial friend j belford our companions consented that i should withdraw to write to the above effect they can make nothing of the characters we write in so i read this to them and they approve of it and of their own motion each man would set his name to it i would not delay sending it for fear of some detestable scheme taking place  thomas belton richard mowbray james tourville  just now are brought me both thine i vary not my opinion nor forbear my earnest prayers to thee in her behalf notwithstanding her dislike of me      letter lxxv mr lovelace to john belford esquire wednesday may   when i have already taken pains to acquaint thee in full with my views designs and resolutions with regard to this admirable creature it is very extraordinary that thou should vapor as thou do in her behalf when i have made no trial no attempt and yet give it as thy opinion in a former letter that advantage may be taken of the situation she is in and that she may be overcome  most of thy reflections particularly that which respects the difference as to the joys to be given by the virtuous and the libertine of the sex are fitter to come in as afterreflections than as antecedencies  i own with thee and with the poet that sweet are the joys that come with willingness  but is it to be expected that a woman of education and a lover of forms will yield before she is attacked  and have i so much as summoned this to surrender  i doubt not but i shall meet with difficulty i must therefore make my first effort by surprise  there may possibly be some cruelty necessary but there may be consent in struggle there may be yielding in resistance but the first conflict over whether the following may not be weaker and weaker till willingness follow is the point to be tried  i will illustrate what i have said by the simile of a bird newcaught we begin with birds as boys and as men go on to ladies and both perhaps in turns experience our sportive cruelty  have thou not observed the charming gradations by which the ensnared volatile has been brought to bear with its new condition how at first refusing all sustenance it beats and bruises itself against its wires till it makes its gay plumage fly about and overspread its wellsecured cage now it gets out its head sticking only at its beautiful shoulders then with difficulty drawing back its head it gasps for breath and erectedly perched with meditating eyes first surveys and then attempts its wired canopy as it gets breath with renewed rage it beats and bruises again its pretty head and sides bites the wires and pecks at the fingers of its delighted tamer till at last finding its efforts ineffectual quite tired and breathless it lays itself down and pants at the bottom of the cage seeming to bemoan its cruel fate and forfeited liberty and after a few days its struggles to escape still diminishing as it finds it to no purpose to attempt it its new habitation becomes familiar and it hops about from perch to perch resumes its wonted cheerfulness and every day sings a song to amuse itself and reward its keeper  now let me tell thee that i have known a bird actually starve itself and die with grief at its being caught and caged  but never did i meet with a lady who was so silly  yet have i heard the dear souls most vehemently threaten their own lives on such an occasion but it is saying nothing in a womans favor if we do not allow her to have more sense than a bird and yet we must all own that it is more difficult to catch a bird than a lady  and now belford were i to go no further how shall i know whether this sweet bird may not be brought to sing me a fine song and in time to be as well contented with her condition as i have brought other birds to be some of them very shy ones  but i guess at thy principal motive in this thy earnestness in behalf of this charming creature i know that thou correspondest with lord m who is impatient and long has been desirous to see me shackled and thou want to build up a merit with that noble podagraman with a view to one of his nieces but know thou not that my consent will be wanting to complete it  and what a commendation will it be of thee to such a girl as charlotte when i shall acquaint her with the affront thou put upon the whole sex by asking whether i think my reward when i have subdued the most charming woman in the world will be equal to my trouble  which think thou a woman of spirit will soonest forgive the undervaluing varlet who can put such a question or him who prefers the pursuit and conquest of a fine woman to all the joys of life  have i not known even a virtuous woman as she would be thought vow everlasting antipathy to a man who gave out that she was too old for him to attempt  but another word or two as to thy objection relating to my trouble and my reward  does not the keen foxhunter endanger his neck and his bones in pursuit of a vermin which when killed is neither fit food for men nor dogs  do not the hunters of the nobler game value the venison less than the sport  why then should i be reflected upon and the sex affronted for my patience and perseverance in the most noble of all chaces and for not being a poacher in love as thy question may be made to imply  learn of thy master for the future to treat more respectfully a sex that yields us our principal diversions and delights  proceed anon  letter lxxvi mr lovelace in continuation well say thou that mine is the most plotting heart in the world thou do me honor and i thank thee heartily thou art no bad judge how like boileaus parson i strut behind my double chin am i not obliged to deserve thy compliment  and would thou have me repent of a murder before i have committed it  the virtues and graces are this ladys handmaids she was certainly born to adorn the age she was given to  well said jack  and would be an ornament to the first dignity  but what praise is that unless the first dignity were adorned with the first merit  dignity gewgaw  first dignity thou idiot  art thou who know me so taken with ermine and tinsel  i who have won the gold am only fit to wear it for the future therefore correct thy style and proclaim her the ornament of the happiest man and respecting herself and sex the greatest conqueror in the world  then that she loves me as thou imaginest by no means appears clear to me  her conditional offers to renounce me the little confidence she places in me entitle me to ask what merit can she have with a man who won her in spite of herself and who fairly in set and obstinate battle took her prisoner  as to what thou inferrest from her eye when with us thou know nothing of her heart from that if thou imaginest there was one glance of love shot from it well did i note her eye and plainly did i see that it was all but just civil disgust to me and to the company i had brought her into her early retiring that night against all entreaty might have convinced thee that there was very little of the gentle in her heart for me and her eye never knew what it was to contradict her heart  she is thou say all mind so say i but why should thou imagine that such a mind as hers meeting with such a one as mine and to dwell upon the word meeting with an inclination in hers to meet should not propagate minds like her own  no doubt of it as thou say the devils would rejoice in the fall of such a lady but this is my confidence that i shall have it in my power to marry when i will and if i do her this justice shall i not have a claim to her gratitude and will she not think herself the obliged rather than the obliger then let me tell thee belford it is impossible so far to hurt the morals of this lady as thou and thy brothervarlets have hurt others of the sex who now are casting about the town firebrands and double death  take ye that thistle to mumble upon  you will perhaps tell me that among all the objects of your respective attempts there was not one of the rank and merit of my charming miss harlowe  but let me ask has it not been a constant maxim with us that the greater the merit on the womans side the nobler the victory on the mans  and as to rank sense of honor sense of shame pride of family may make rifled rank get up and shake itself to rights and if any thing come of it such a one may suffer only in her pride by being obliged to take up with a secondrate match instead of a first and as it may fall out be the happier as well as the more useful for the misadventure since taken off of her public gaddings and domesticated by her disgrace she will have reason to think herself obliged to the man who has saved her from further reproach while her fortune and alliance will lay an obligation upon him and her past fall if she have prudence and consciousness will be his present and future security  but a poor girl such a one as my rosebud for instance having no recalls from education  being driven out of every family that pretends to reputation persecuted most perhaps by such as have only kept their secret better and having no refuge to fly to  the common the stews the street is the fate of such a poor wretch penury want and disease her sure attendants and an untimely end perhaps closes the miserable scene  and will ye not now all join to say that it is more manly to attack a lion than a sheep  thou know that i always illustrated my eagleship by aiming at the noblest quarries and by disdaining to make a stoup at wrens philtits and wagtails  the worst respecting myself in the case before me is that my triumph when completed will be so glorious a one that i shall never be able to keep up to it all my future attempts must be poor to this i shall be as unhappy after a while from my reflections upon this conquest as don john of austria was in his on the renowned victory of lepanto when he found that none of his future achievements could keep pace with his early glory  i am sensible that my pleas and my reasonings may be easily answered and perhaps justly censured but by whom censured not by any of the confraternity whose constant course of life even long before i became your general to this hour has justified what ye now in a fit of squeamishness and through envy condemn having therefore vindicated myself and my intentions to you that is all i am at present concerned for  be convinced then that i according to our principles am right thou wrong or at least be silent but i command thee to be convinced and in thy next be sure to tell me that thou art  letter lxxvii mr belford to robert lovelace esquire edgware thursday may  i know that thou art so abandoned a man that to give thee the best reasons in the world against what thou have once resolved upon will be but acting the madman whom once we saw trying to buffet down a hurricane with his hat i hope however that the ladys merit will still avail her with thee but if thou persistest if thou will avenge thyself on this sweet lamb which thou have singled out from a flock thou hate for the faults of the dogs who kept it if thou art not to be moved by beauty by learning by prudence by innocence all shining out in one charming object but she must fall fall by the man whom she has chosen for her protector i would not for a thousand worlds have thy crime to answer for  upon my faith lovelace the subject sticks with me notwithstanding i find i have not the honor of the ladys good opinion and the more when i reflect upon her fathers brutal curse and the villainous hardheartedness of all her family  but nevertheless i should be desirous to know if thou will proceed by what gradations arts and contrivances thou effectest thy ungrateful purpose  and o lovelace i conjure thee if thou art a man let not the specious devils thou have brought her among be suffered to triumph over her nor make her the victim of unmanly artifices if she yield to fair seduction if i may so express myself if thou can raise a weakness in her by love or by arts not inhuman i shall the less pity her and shall then conclude that there is not a woman in the world who can resist a bold and resolute lover  a messenger is just now arrived from my uncle the mortification it seems is got up to his knee and the surgeons declare that he cannot live many days he therefore sends for me directly with these shocking words that i will come and close his eyes my servant or his must of necessity be in town everyday on his case or on other affairs and one of them shall regularly attend you for any letter or commands and it will be charity to write to me as often as you can for although i am likely to be a considerable gainer by the poor mans death yet i cannot say that i at all love these scenes of death and the doctor so near me the doctor and death i should have said for that is the natural order and generally speaking the one is but the harbinger to the other  if therefore you decline to oblige me i shall think you are displeased with my freedom but let me tell you at the same time that no man has a right to be displeased at freedoms taken with him for faults he is not ashamed to be guilty of  j belford  letter lxxviii miss clarissa harlowe to miss how i thank you and mr hickman for his letter sent me with such kind expedition and proceed to obey my dear menacing tyranness  she then gives the particulars of what passed between herself and mr lovelace on tuesday morning in relation to his four friends and to miss partington pretty much to the same effect as in mr lovelaces letter numb lxxii and then proceeds    he is constantly accusing me of overscrupulousness he says i am always out of humor with him that i could not have behaved more reservedly to mr solmes and that it is contrary to all his hopes and notions that he should not in so long a time find himself able to inspire the person whom he hoped so soon to have the honor to call his with the least distinguishing tenderness for him beforehand  silly and partial incroacher not to know to what to attribute the reserve i am forced to treat him with but his pride has eaten up his prudence it is indeed a dirty low pride that has swallowed up the true pride which should have set him above the vanity that has overrun him have you not beheld the man when i was your happy guest as he walked to his chariot looking about him as if to observe what eyes his specious person and air had attracted but indeed we have seen homely coxcombs as proud as if they had persons to be proud of at the same time that it was apparent that the pains they took about themselves but the more exposed their defects  the man who is fond of being thought more or better than he is as i have often thought but provokes a scrutiny into his pretensions and that generally produces contempt for pride as i believe i have heretofore observed is an infallible sign of weakness of something wrong in the head or heart he that exalts himself insults his neighbor who is provoked to question in him even that merit which were he modest would perhaps be allowed to be his due  you will say that i am very grave and so i am mr lovelace is extremely sunk in my opinion since monday night nor see i before me any thing that can afford me a pleasing hope for what with a mind so unequal as his can be my best hope  i think i mentioned to you in my former that my clothes were brought me you fluttered me so that i am not sure i did but i know i designed it they were brought me on thursday but neither my few guineas with them nor any of my books except a drexelius on eternity the good old practice of piety and a francis spira my brothers wit i suppose he thinks he does well to point out death and despair to me i wish for the one and every nowandthen am on the brink of the other  you will the less wonder at my being so very solemn when added to the above and to my uncertain situation i tell you that they have sent me with these books a letter from my cousin morden it has set my heart against mr lovelace against myself too i send it enclosed if you please my dear you may read it here  letter lxxix to miss clarissa harlowe florence april    i am extremely concerned to hear of a difference betwixt the rest of a family so near and dear to me and you still dearer to me than any of the rest  my cousin james has acquainted me with the offers you have had and your refusals i wonder not at either such charming promises at so early an age as when i left england and those promises as i have often heard so greatly exceeded as well in your person as mind how much must you be admired how few must there be worthy of you  your parents the most indulgent in the world to a child the most deserving have given way it seems to your refusals of several gentlemen  they have contented themselves at last to name one with earnestness to you because of the address of another they cannot approve of  they had not reason it seems from your behaiour to think you greatly averse so they proceeded  perhaps too hastily for a delicacy like yours but when all was fixed on their parts and most extraordinary terms concluded in your favor terms which abundantly show the gentlemans just value for you you fly off with a warmth and vehemence little suited to that sweetness which gave grace to all your actions  i know very little of either of the gentlemen but of mr lovelace i know more than of mr solmes i wish i could say more to his advantage than i can as to every qualification but one your brother owns there is no comparison  but that one outweighs all the rest together  it cannot be thought that miss clarissa harlowe will dispense with morals in a husband  what my dearest cousin shall i first plead to you on this occasion your duty your interest your temporal and your eternal welfare do and may all depend upon this single point the morality of a husband a wife cannot always have it in her power to be good or to do good if she has a wicked husband as a good husband may if he has a bad wife  you preserve all your religious regards i understand  i wonder not that you do i should have wondered had you not but what can you promise yourself as to perseverance in them with an immoral husband  if your parents and you differ in sentiment on this important occasion let me ask you my dear cousin who ought to give way  i own to you that i should have thought there could not anywhere have been a more suitable match for you than with mr lovelace had he been a moral man i should have very little to say against a man of whose actions i am not to set up myself as a judge did he not address my cousin but on this occasion let me tell you my dear clarissa that mr lovelace cannot possibly deserve you he may reform you will say but he may not habit is not soon shook off libertines who are libertines in defiance of talents of superior lights of conviction hardly ever reform but by miracle or by incapacity well do i know my own sex well am i able to judge of the probability of the reformation of a licentious young man who has not been fastened upon by sickness by affliction by calamity who has a prosperous run of fortune before him his spirits high his will uncontrollable the company he keeps perhaps such as himself confirming him in all his courses assisting him in all his enterprises  as to the other gentleman suppose my dear cousin you dont like him at present it is far from being unlikely that you will hereafter perhaps the more for not liking him now he can hardly sink lower in your opinion he may rise very seldom is it that high expectations are so much as tolerably answered how indeed can they when a fine and extensive imagination carries its expectation infinitely beyond reality in the highest of our sublunary enjoyments a lady adorned with such an imagination sees no defect in a favored object because she is not conscious of any in herself till it is too late to rectify the mistakes occasioned by her generous credulity  but suppose a person of your talents were to marry a man of inferior talents who in this case can be so happy in herself as miss clarissa harlowe what delight do you take in doing good how happily do you devote the several portions of the natural day to your own improvement and to the advantage of all that move within your sphere  and then such is your taste such are your acquirements in the politer studies and in the politer amusements such your excellence in all the different parts of economy fit for a young ladys inspection and practice that your friends would wish you to be taken off as little as possible by regards that might be called merely personal  but as to what may be the consequence respecting yourself respecting a young lady of your exalted talents from the preference you are suspected to give to a libertine i would have you my dear cousin consider what that may be  a mind so pure to mingle with a mind more impure than most of his species such a man as this will ingross all your solicitudes he will perpetually fill you with anxieties for him and for yourself the divine and civil powers defied and their sanctions broke through by him on every not merely accidental but meditated occasion to be agreeable to him and to hope to preserve an interest in his affections you must probably be obliged to abandon all your own laudable pursuits you must enter into his pleasures and distastes you must give up your own virtuous companions for his profligate ones perhaps be forsaken by yours because of the scandal he daily gives can you hope cousin with such a man as this to be long so good as you now are  if not consider which of your present laudable delights you would choose to give up  which of his culpable ones to follow him in how could you brook to go backward instead of forward in those duties which you now so exemplarily perform and how do you know if you once give way where you shall be suffered where you shall be able to stop  your brother acknowleges that mr solmes is not near so agreeable in person as mr lovelace but what is person with such a lady as i have the honor to be now writing to  he owns likewise that he has not the address of mr lovelace but what a mere personal advantage is address without morals  a lady had better take a husband whose manners she were to fashion than to find them readyfashiond to her hand at the price of his morality a price that is often paid for traveling accomplishments o my dear cousin were you but with us here at florence or at rome or at paris where also i resided for many months to see the gentlemen whose supposed rough english manners at setting out are to be polished and what their improvements are in their return through the same places you would infinitely prefer the man in his first stage to the same man in his last you find the difference on their return foreign fashions foreign vices and foreign diseases too often complete the man and to despise his own country and countrymen himself still more despicable than the most despicable of those he despises these too generally make up with a mixture of an unblushing effrontery the traveled gentleman  mr lovelace i know deserves to have an exception made in his favor for he is really a man of parts and learning he was esteemed so both here and at rome and a fine person and a generous turn of mind gave him great advantages but you need not be told that a libertine man of sense does infinitely more mischief than a libertine of weak parts is able to do and this i will tell you farther that it was mr lovelaces own fault that he was not still more respected than he was among the literati here there were in short some liberties in which he indulged himself that endangered his person and his liberty and made the best and most worthy of those who honored him with their notice give him up and his stay both at florence and at rome shorter than he designed  this is all i choose to say of mr lovelace i had much rather have had reason to give him a quite contrary character but as to rakes or libertines in general i who know them well must be allowed because of the mischiefs they have always in their hearts and too often in their power to do your sex to add still a few more words upon this topic  a libertine my dear cousin a plotting an intriguing libertine must be generally remorseless  unjust he must always be the noble rule of doing to others what he would have done to himself is the first rule he breaks and every day he breaks it the oftener the greater his triumph he has great contempt for your sex he believes no woman chaste because he is a profligate every woman who favors him confirms him in his wicked incredulity he is always plotting to extend the mischiefs he delights in if a woman loves such a man how can she bear the thought of dividing her interest in his affections with half the town and that perhaps the dregs of it  then so sensual  how will a young lady of your delicacy bear with so sensual a man a man who makes a jest of his vows and who perhaps will break your spirit by the most unmanly insults to be a libertine at setting out all compunction all humanity must be overcome to continue to be a libertine is to continue to be every thing vile and inhuman prayers tears and the most abject submission are but fuel to his pride wagering perhaps with lewd companions and not improbably with lewder women upon instances which he boasts of to them of your patient sufferings and broken spirit and bringing them home to witness to both i write what i know has been  i mention not fortunes squandered estates mortgaged or sold and posterity robbed nor yet a multitude of other evils too gross too shocking to be mentioned to a delicacy like yours  all these my dear cousin to be shunned all the evils i have named to be avoided the power of doing all the good you have been accustomed to do preserved nay increased by the separate provision that will be made for you your charming diversions and exemplary employments all maintained and every good habit perpetuated and all by one sacrifice the fading pleasure of the eye who would not since every thing is not to be met with in one man who would not to preserve so many essentials give up so light so unpermanent a pleasure  weigh all these things which i might insist upon to more advantage did i think it needful to one of your prudence weigh them well my beloved cousin and if it be not the will of your parents that you should continue single resolve to oblige them and let it not be said that the powers of fancy shall as in many others of your sex be too hard for your duty and your prudence the less agreeable the man the more obliging the compliance remember that he is a sober man a man who has reputation to lose and whose reputation therefore is a security for his good behavior to you  you have an opportunity offered you to give the highest instance that can be given of filial duty  embrace it it is worthy of you it is expected from you however for your inclination sake one may be sorry that you are called upon to give it let it be said that you have been able to lay an obligation upon your parents a proud word my cousin which you could not do were it not laid against your inclination  upon parents who have laid a thousand upon you who are set upon this point who will not give it up who have given up many points to you even of this very nature and in their turn for the sake of their own authority as well as judgment expect to be obliged  i hope i shall soon in person congratulate you upon this your meritorious compliance to settle and give up my trusteeship is one of the principal motives of my leaving these parts i shall be glad to settle it to every ones satisfaction to yours particularly if on my arrival i find a happy union as formerly reign in a family so dear to me it will be an unspeakable pleasure to me and i shall perhaps so dispose my affairs as to be near you for ever  i have written a very long letter and will add no more than that i am with the greatest respect my dearest cousin  your most affectionate and faithful servant wm morden i will suppose my dear miss how that you have read my cousins letter it is now in vain to wish it had come sooner but if it had i might perhaps have been so rash as to give mr lovelace the fatal meeting as i little thought of going off with him  but i should hardly have given him the expectation of so doing previous to the meeting which made him come prepared and the revocation of which he so artfully made ineffectual  persecuted as i was and little expecting so much condescension as my aunt to my great mortification has told me and you confirm that i should have met with it is however hard to say what i should or should not have done as to meeting him had it come in time but this effect i verily believe it would have had  to have made me insist with all my might on going over out of all their ways to the kind writer of the instructive letter and made a father a protector as well as a friend of a cousin who is one of my trustees this circumstanced as i was would have been a natural at least an unexceptionable protection  but i was to be unhappy and how it cuts me to the heart to think that i can already subscribe to my cousins character of a libertine so well drawn in the letter which i suppose you now to have read  that such a vile character which ever was my abhorrence should fall to my lot  but depending on my own strength having no reason to apprehend danger from headstrong and disgraceful impulses i too little perhaps cast up my eyes to the supreme director in whom mistrusting myself i ought to have placed my whole confidence  and the more when i saw myself so persistingly addressed by a man of this character  inexperience and presumption with the help of a brother and sister who have low ends to answer in my disgrace have been my ruin  a hard word my dear but i repeat it upon deliberation since let the best happen which now can happen my reputation is destroyed a rake is my portion and what that portion is my cousin mordens letter has acquainted you  pray keep it by you till called for i saw it not myself having not the heart to inspect my trunks till this morning i would not for the world this man should see it because it might occasion mischief between the most violent spirit and the most settled brave one in the world as my cousins is said to be  this letter was enclosed opened in a blank cover scorn and detest me as they will i wonder that one line was not sent with it  were it but to have more particularly pointed the design of it in the same generous spirit that sent me the spira  the sealing of the cover was with black wax i hope there is no new occasion in the family to give reason for black wax but if there were it would to be sure have been mentioned and laid at my door  perhaps too justly  i had begun a letter to my cousin but laid it by because of the uncertainty of my situation and expecting everyday for several days past to be at a greater certainty you bid me write to him some time ago you know then it was i began it for i have great pleasure in obeying you in all i may so i ought to have for you are the only friend left me and moreover you generally honor me with your own observance of the advice i take the liberty to offer you for i pretend to say i give better advice than i have taken and so i had need for i know not how it comes about but i am in my own opinion a poor lost creature and yet cannot charge myself with one criminal or faulty inclination do you know my dear how this can be  yet i can tell you how i believe  one devious step at setting out  that must be it  which pursued has led me so far out of my path that i am in a wilderness of doubt and error and never never shall find my way out of it for although but one pace awry at first it has led me hundreds and hundreds of miles out of my path and the poor estray has not one kind friend nor has met with one directing passenger to help her to recover it  but i presumptuous creature must rely so much upon my own knowledge of the right path  little apprehending that an ignis fatuus with its false fires and yet i had heard enough of such would arise to mislead me  and now in the midst of fens and quagmires it plays around me and around me throwing me back again whenever i think myself in the right track  but there is one common point in which all shall meet err widely as they may in that i shall be laid quietly down at last and then will all my calamities be at an end  but how i stray again stray from my intention i would only have said that i had begun a letter to my cousin morden some time ago but that now i can never end it you will believe i cannot for how shall i tell him that all his compliments are misbestowed that all his advice is thrown away all his warnings vain and that even my highest expectation is to be the wife of that free liver whom he so pathetically warns me to shun  let me however have your prayers joined with my own my fate depending as it seems upon the lips of such a man that whatever shall be my destiny that dreadful part of my fathers malediction that i may be punished by the man in whom he supposes i put my confidence may not take place that this for mr lovelaces own sake and for the sake of human nature may not be  or if it be necessary in support of the parental authority that i should be punished by him that it may not be by his premeditated or wilful baseness but that i may be able to acquit his intention if not his action otherwise my fault will appear to be doubled in the eye of the event judging world and yet methinks i would be glad that the unkindness of my father and uncles whose hearts have already been too much wounded by my error may be justified in every article excepting in this heavy curse and that my father will be pleased to withdraw that before it be generally known at least that most dreadful part of it which regards futurity  i must lay down my pen i must brood over these reflections once more before i enclose my cousins letter i will peruse it and then i shall have it by heart    end of vol iii
