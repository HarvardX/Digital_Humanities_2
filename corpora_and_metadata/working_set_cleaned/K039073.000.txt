a letter to the right reverend the lord bishop of o   d price one shilling  a letter to the right reverend the lord bishop of o   d containing some animadversions upon a character given of the late dr bentley in a letter from a late professor in the university of oxford to the right rev author of the divine legation of moses demonstrated   jam parce sepulto london printed for j wilkie in st pauls churchyard       a letter to the right reverend the lord bishop of o   d my lord a letter subscribed by a late professor in the university of oxford and addressed to a learned prelate now living fell into my hands no earlier than a few days ago a very unexpected character which is therein given of the literary taste and genius of the late dr bentley has strongly tempted me to address a few observations to the writer of that letter and as i shall hope to do this with all becoming civility and decorum i presume the lord bishop of o    will make no scruple to avow any opinions which a late professor in that university thought fit to advance  in the correspondence i have now commenced with your lordship it is far from my meaning to attempt at measuring weapons with you in the science of letters i have much too humble a sense of my own powers and too high a respect for your lordships to entertain such a design it is an appeal to your candor as a gentleman not an attack upon your capacity as a scholar that i meditate i am willing you should enjoy whole and unenvied all the same you can fairly and honestly acquire but i would wish your lordship to believe that no credit is to be gained either with the present age or posterity by attempting to demolish the reputation of another  add to this that such conduct is in your particular grossly impolitic you at present enjoy a temporary repose hostilities seem for a while suspended between your right reverend correspondent and you cultivate the time examine and improve your resources conciliate to yourself new allies rivet and confirm your old ones and imitate those few wise and provident princes who knowing the short duration of all public felicity employ the intervals of peace in preparations for a future war  you will probably find employment enough for all your talents when the great champion whom you have so insultingly provoked shall enter the lists against you the time will certainly come and amongst the virtues which you will have occasion to exercise in that day of trial it is well my lord if repentance be not found to have a place  the zealous affection which you my lord so well know how to express for your friends must excuse the warmth with which i interest myself in the defense of mine if honor calls upon us to resent an aspersion upon an absent friend yet living something more than honor piety engages us to vindicate the dead did your lordship when you struck with such rancour at dr bentley flatter yourself that he had outlived all those private and tender alliances which bind and connect mankind together and that his fame lay at the mercy of every free booter far from it the learned and the candid of all nations are the friends of his fame and no inconsiderable number still survive whom his private worth and virtues have left under lasting impressions of affection the former order of men will probably think you have discovered no great tokens of discernment in this invective or favoring your judgment will think your temper not altogether free from some small portion of envy and asperity as for the latter class of people personalities my lord inflame mankind to that degree that it is well if they leave you even the small shred of reputation which you have allowed to dr bentley  recollect my lord the warmth the piety with which you remonstrated against bishop w   s treatment of your father in a passage of his julian page      it is not in behalf of myself that i expostulate but of one for whom i am much more concerned that is  my father these are your lordships words amiable affecting expression instructive lesson of filial devotion alas my lord that you who was thus sensible to the least speck which fell upon the reputation of your father should be so inveterate against the fame of one at least as eminent and perhaps no less dear to his family  for my own part much as i reverence great and learned men in my poor estimation one generous sentiment one benevolent emanation of the heart is of more value and respect than all the unimpassioned productions of the understanding i therefore cannot help holding your correspondent in higher esteem for the generous and candid manner in which he atones for this offense than for all the vast fund of erudition which he has displayed in the eyes of the world to the singular annoyance as it should seem of your lordship but to the general use and information of all mankind besides  he tells you that he knew not that the pages         mr l whom he had treated with disrespect in one of his notes was your father that this circumstance amply justified you for every thing he complained of relative to your unkind usage of him in your prelections in short that he owed so much to your piety which he considered as really edifying that he would strike out that note against your father the first opportunity indeed the whole turn of the letter from which these expressions are selected carries such an air of candor and polite acknowledgment that i am surprised your lordship with this transaction fresh in your memory should not have considered when you was thus unhandsomely treating dr bentleys character that it was possible some one might be found under the same predicament or with the same feelings toward him that you had experienced toward mr l there is a rule my lord in the christian doctrine which i dare say you have frequently recommended to other people that on this occasion would have been peculiarly useful to yourself all that can now be done is that as you have thought fit to copy your learned correspondent in the least amiable part of his character you should strive to resemble him in his more shining features and learn of him that even faults may be made graceful by an ingenuous manner of atoning for them as there are some distempers which by being skilfully cured leave the constitution more vigorous and healthy than if it had never been attacked by them so there seem to be certain flaws in the moral conduct of some men which being well and effectually repaired set off the character with greater luster and advantage than it could have appeared with had such imperfections never been discovered was i worthy to prescribe to your lordship the task would be no very hard one that i should set you it would be only to give your real sentiments of dr bentleys merit and i am persuaded they would turn out the most complete recantation of what you have now been pleased to amuse us with that could be wished for  i have entered thus circumstantially into this matter not with a design to aggravate your lordships offense but to extenuate my own censure which falls from you my lord falls from a great height especially when the defenseless object upon whom it is directed is unhappily laid so low  you will now permit me to transcribe the sentence of which i complain i find it in your  0th page i mention the page because for the allusion it bears to any part of your subject it might as well be sought for in any other leaf of the book the paragraph is addressed to bishop w    and runs thus  and here more opportunely for the illustration of what i am saying than for your own purpose you introduce the incomparable bentley as standing in the foremost rank of modern critics of grammatical and verbal critics i agree with you he could judge with great penetration of the age of an author by the dialect the phrase and the matter by thericlean cups and sicilian talents this was his proper sphere of science and in this he excelled but in matters of pure taste a fine discernment of the different characters of composition colors of style and manners of thinking of interior beauties and excellencies of writing in regard to all this what was he unus caprimulgus aut fossor what then has he to do here  ay what indeed your lordship has asked a question which i really cannot easily resolve and but that you have prevented me in it the very question i should have taken the liberty of putting to your lordship  for what answer can we give is it to be thought that you conceive this sovereign contempt of dr bentleys taste and genius from an acquaintance with his works with his it is proposed to publish a new edition of these works in a short time original works i mean for although a great and elegant genius will break forth even when employed in the under work of criticism and exposition as witness your lordships learned labors on the hebrew poesy yet undoubtedly it is in compositions of an original sort where the proper estimate of the genius of an author is to be formed let me then with all due respect demand of your lordship from which of the original productions of dr bentleys pen is it that you have collected these very unfavourable sentiments concerning him in which of his labors have you traced the brutal ignorance of a goatherd the clownish stupidity of a hedger and ditcher indeed my good lord these are hard words worse by one half than you bestowed upon the prophet ezra who escaped your satire with the appellation only of a semibarbarian could you have given worse language to a country curate at a visitation is your lordship sure that these expressions are perfectly elegant and perfectly true are they fit for one scholar one gentleman one christian divine to bestow upon another do they give us any impression of your lordships manners of your wit or of your judgment the virtues of your heart my lord and the purity of your morals will support your character with the present age but it must be the productions of your understanding that are to establish your reputation with posterity how therefore could you think of transmitting to afterages an opinion which mankind will be sure to charge to the error either of your head or of your heart what provocation can you have received from dr bentleys genius that you should liken it to that of boors and peasants i dont know my lord what kind of license you men of learning take in speaking of each other but we who act in common life and have common understandings stare at such familiarities a certain cautious principle which your lordship seems to hold in disregard called prudence and a small degree of worldly virtue in which your lordship it is plain on some occasions does not abound called goodmanners teach us to smother and repress these sallies of spleen and ill nature if not from natural principle yet from the dread of that humiliating correction which expressions of so offensive a nature would be apt to incur these my lord are amongst the checks and restraints that civilize society i dont mean to apply them to the case in question i believe and by your lordships example am convinced that other rules and principles obtain in the republic of letters every thing there breathes an unrestrained freedom of manners affronts are mutually interchanged and challenges are publicly given and accepted by the gravest and most respectable characters nothing however shall persuade me that this is not ridiculous and unbecoming i cannot see professors dignified divines and bishops tilting at each other without a blush it is this unpardonable petulancy that makes the company of men of learning so little sought after it reduces literary science to the rank of a mechanical art when the scholar is found to give way to as many little mean detracting insinuations in his profession as a fiddler or a tailor does in his for my own part such is my prejudice against envy and ill nature and so great is the respect that i bear to candor and complaisance that although i have your lordships example before my eyes still i cannot be persuaded that invidious aspersions lessening comparisons and calumnious railings are any proofs of liberal education or of an elegant improved understanding and this i can tell your lordship that if you had not expressly ay and in capital letters asserted page     the university of oxford to have been the place of your education the seat where you first sacrificed to the muses and to the graces it might really to future ages have been just matter of doubt in what one spot of this globe your lordship had imbibed those elegant and friendly manners which run through the whole of your disputations with bishop w and are particularly marked out in the character you have given of dr bentley a character in which you have apparently a double intent not only to undeceive the world with respect to any false opinions we might have taken up concerning his understanding but to give us at the same time a just impression of your own for where would be the use of exposing dr bentleys egregious deficiency in all the polite accomplishments of a scholar if you did not thereby tacitly inform mankind that dr l th was eminently endowed with them all this my lord of all the roads which lead to fame is the shortest and easiest ascent it is following the camp without mixing in the fray  that men born in the same country cultivators of the same science professing the same religion fellow laborers in the same ministry should invidiously defame and disparage each other in the eyes of mankind is a mystery to men of ordinary capacities if a caprimulgus my lord a low and paltry herdsman should set about to underrate the talents of a rival in that rustic occupation if a fossor a vulgar untaught hedger and ditcher should attempt to disparage the handiwork of a fellow laborer such lowbred dealings in clowns might find some excuse but when we see the same mean passions carried into upper life and exhibited by a man of your lordships talents and erudition we blush for you for your profession for your title we feel an ingenuous shame for the disreputation which is brought upon learning nay even upon our country and we sigh when we can no longer esteem a character like your lordships  for surely my lord you forget how much you expose your own fame when you endeavor to blind and to blacken that of dr bentleys  the treatment the world has thought proper to bestow upon critics in general suits its gratitude it is owing to the labors of the eminent in that department that almost any of the now elegant remains of greek and roman literature are at this day intelligible the moment they were so the weapons they were so kind to polish for our use have been employed against themselves a run therefore upon criticism in general is become too trite to be any longer a subject of complaint but the pulling down the fame of the dead though reared by the approbation of the learned of all europe must be ungenerous however severe a provocation may be supposed to be concealed in a mans having been called incomparable by the bishop of g the lot of dr b has been particular as his character is at present arraigned by your lordship his condition has in like manner been debased in the biographia britannica from that of a gentleman to a mean tradesman this misrepresentation may perhaps have had a share in inducing your lordship to bestow upon him the delicate epithets which you was sure from catullus were good latin and from the authority of an uninformed modern historian you imagined were justly applicable to his supposed birth  but i just now desired your lordship to resolve me in which of dr bentleys original works it was that you had discovered such convincing marks of the meanness and contemptible rusticity of his genius was it in his declamations from the pulpit that he betrayed this utter ignorance of the beauties and excellencies of writing did ever herdsman from his observations on nature and the fabric and construction of man argue up to the divine author and creator of all things with such strength of reasoning such convictive eloquence as are to be found in his lectures did ever hedger and ditcher give such edifying such satisfactory reasons for the hope and the faith that was in him as are given in his famous commencement sermon many clowns my lord it must be confessed have preached before kings and still continue to preach but does dr bentleys sermon before the king impeach him of inurbanity surely not and it will be hard to think with your lordship that the same person who was capable of composing in so good a style himself should be incapable of forming any judgment with respect to that of another mans i flatter myself therefore i may conclude that it is not in the pulpit your lordship will arraign dr bentley it is not for his labors in the cause of religion the instruction of mankind and the confutation of atheism that your lordship so conspicuous for merits of the same nature means to degrade and disgrace his memory i may say for him what bishop w pleaded for himself  page     that his services to religion and society seem to entitle him to common respect   from every man of letters engaged in the same cause where no personal animosities have intervened and as your lordship in describing your own character has professed yourself to be  page     as a member of the commonwealth of letters a true lover of peace and quietness of mutual freedom candor and benevolence and that you detest and despise the squabbles that are perpetually arising from the jealousy and peevishness of the genus irritabile scriptorum i will venture to conclude that you have not taken up this contemptuous opinion of his understanding and abilities from the services he has done to religion and the instructions he has bequeathed to mankind  but my lord this is not all i have some little matter more to offer in defense of his mangled reputation some few remarks more to make upon his services in the cause of god and of religion i hope these will not be taken for tokens of his want of understanding the confutation of atheism seems an easy and obvious task a work for real herdsmen and hedgers every object proves the existence of the deity and every rational being comprehends that proof but bentley like a hardy obstinate clown as he was undertook a bolder task this ignorant unpolished peasant undertook my lord to confute and expose the fine gentlemen of his age the wits and reasoners of the time the set of freethinkers that unhinged the age in which he lived and threw the whole bench of bishops your lordship was not then amongst the number into consternation and dismay in this dilemma my lord when the whole army of protestant divines mitred and unmitred like that of saul upon the challenge of goliath trembled behind their trenches this despicable herdsman this booby boor taken like david from the sheepfolds entered the lists and singly overthrew the mighty champion of infidelity the triumphs of christianity upon this victory were only to be equalled by the applauses which every true believer bestowed upon their defender the whole bench of bishops honored dr bentley with their thanks behold the revolution of a few years bentley dies your lordship succeeds to a seat on that bench you dissent from your predecessors and tear their trophies from his shrine  let me stop here for a moment i would fain preserve all possible respect for your lordship and must not therefore pursue my thoughts where they would lead me on this subject but really if men of your order who are enlisted and banded together against the legions that make war upon christianity cannot withold your fingers from each others throats how can the general cause of religion prosper how must the spirits of the modern freethinkers revive when your lordship tells them and the world that he who had cut their follies to the heart by the keen edge of his most piercing ridicule was a man void of all pure taste and genius incapable of any fine discernment blind to all the beauties and excellencies of writing a mere grammatical and verbal critic in short unus caprimulgus aut fossor this my lord is pity to the fallen indeed it is binding up their wounds yet bleeding with his strokes it is recalling them to life and vigor putting arms into their hands and pointing out the victim against whom they should employ them methinks it puts me in mind of the call of lucifer to his troops of rebelangels when they lay prostrate and confounded in the burning gulf no doubt they will like them obey the summons and arise  the policy therefore of this conduct of your lordships i cannot comprehend the generosity the urbanity of it i have already considered suffer me now to carry my enquiries into the truth of it  what my lord will you allow the author of the remarks no place but amongst grammatical and verbal critics will you expel him from the society of liberal and wellaccomplished scholars was he fit for no higher uses than like a juggler to play with thericlean cups and sicilian talents was this his proper sphere of science and did he really excel in nothing higher are there no sparks of genuine attic wit no sallies of native humor no polished strokes of temperate and cleanly ridicule not such i mean as your lordships pleasantries upon the sin of sodom to be found in that work are there really no dawnings of a pure taste no shadowings of a discerning faculty to be found your lordship says no  he possessed them not  he was a clown a clumsy blockhead  what an error have the learned of all the nations in europe been in  surely my lord without disparaging your lordships learned labors these were works as profitable to mankind and as serviceable to religion as determining the era in which the poem of job call it drama or dialogue was composed your lordship sees i give you credit for having actually decided that important question and am willing to allow you the reputation of having from  a fine discernment of the different characters of composition colors of style and manners of thinking made such nice discoveries in a language of which there is now extant but one volume as not only to have been able to fix the date of this poem the page  0 homer of the hebrew classics but to have pointed out to posterity the augustan era of hebrew poesy though you readily allow there was page    very little variation in the language from the time of moses to the babylonish captivity  but to convince your lordship with what reluctance i yield to any impressions in disfavour of that candor and benevolence which you assure us are to be found in such plentiful portions in your composition i will confess that i am far from thinking we have as yet discovered the cause that ruined dr bentley in your good opinion the laurels he won by his triumphs over atheism and infidelity i am persuaded would neither have attracted your envy nor incurred your ill will i dare believe your lordship is far too considerate in your resentments to abuse any man when there is no prospect of serving yourself by it or gratifying your friends but in the lawful prosecution of ones fortune when by making one enemy we can gain two patrons your lordship understands the value of the worlds favor too well and the road that leads to it to hesitate a moment and if dr bentleys fame has been one round in the ladder by which your lordship has climbed to the summit of preferment   scelera ipsa nefasque  hac mercede placent    there is no harm done my lord the ladder is not one whit the worse for your use it is only brushing the step clean again which your foot has soiled a little and it will be as whole and as sound as when you first mounted upon it  i think therefore we may venture to draw this conclusion that had this object of your contempt been blessed with such faculties as to have reasoned all atheism and deism effectually out of fashion and put to perpetual silence every professor of infidelity had he taken the whole walk of criticism to himself and filled our shelves with notes comments and corrections upon every ancient classic that has come down to us he might have done it with impunity perhaps with applause had he but spared a certain club of wits who sucked the milk of science from the same breasts at which it seems your lordship fed with these confederates your lordship well knows he singly maintained a notable controversy with every advantage on his side that superior talents for wit learning and argumentation could give him if your lordship doubts which party triumphed in this dispute you are the only man of erudition in all europe that does but this i dare say is by no means the case you could have pitied him but you cannot find in your heart to applaud him facts press so hard upon you that you have no argument but the last refuge of a flat denial and the superiority of his genius is so very conspicuous that nothing now can be done but by a resolute and desperate maneuver to assail him in that quarter where he is conceived to be least vulnerable and consequently least expecting an attack in some circumstances every thing is to be risked deny him therefore every faculty for which he was most eminent and though the very same business which gives your lordship the inclination to abuse him furnishes the amplest refutation of that abuse be animated by the hazard of the attempt and make if possible the cradle of his reputation the tomb of it the difficulty of finding an answer to your lordships question at the conclusion of your character of dr bentley now entirely vanishes and when after having bestowed every term that your fertile imagination assisted besides by that of catullus could furnish most contemptuous you ask   what then has he to do here we are no longer without a solution and having now discovered the clue to your thoughts and being fully satisfied that your lordship never dignifies an author with your abuse whom you are not secretly convinced is eminent for those very qualifications that you publicly declare him to be deficient in we thankfully accept your reprehensions as a testimony of your private applause which though it is not indeed signified in so gracious a manner as it might be yet we hold it of much value from the certainty with which it directs us to the real sentiments of your heart  having thus happily discovered the method of decyphering your lordships invectives i am not without suspicion that the same key must be applied for construing your applauses what strengthens this conjecture is that those talents which you are pleased to take from dr bentley you liberally bestow upon page    mr hobbes  according to this rule of inversion how shall we my lord interpret the many fine things you tell us of yourself such as that you are a true lover peace and quietness of mutual freedom candor and benevolence that you detest the jealous and peevish squabbles of authors these are virtues which upon your lordships report we gave you credit for it would be with extreme reluctance we should find ourselves obliged to carry them to the other side of the account  but these are groundless apprehensions you have favored the world with a faithful portrait of yourself however you have dawbed and disguised those of other people i have at this time your letter to the demonstrator of the divine legation of moses before me and i hold it for impossible that the author of any work so full of pleasant and innocent raillery so replete with playful and facetious conceits can be capable of wrath rancour and malevolence can any thing be more lively than the strain in which you accost your right reverend correspondent in the second page of your epistle   i thought says your lordship  you might possibly whip me at the carts a   i beg pardon i should have said  carts tail in a note to divine legation  inimitable humor courtly elegant episcopal wit so severe upon bishop w   so very just and suitable to yourself never did i know a whipping better laid on or more properly applied but behold another attitude   or pillory me in the dunciad  surely there is something ravishingly delectable when a grave wise and dignified priest or prelate like your lordship surprises one all at once with a stroke of this nature there is no withstanding it  but your vein is not yet exhausted and you proceed   or perhaps have ordered me a kind of bridewell correction by one of your beadles in a pamphlet well i protest my lord this climax of yours exceeds in profundity of false humor every thing that swift has given us in his art of sinking we laugh indeed but it is not a bishop w  you ask us to an entertainment provided in his name while your lordship obligingly pays the whole cost these postures in which you have exhibited yourself before us put me in mind of the freaks of a merry andrew who suffers himself to be kicked and cuffed and tweaked by the nose to make sport for the mob while the vile empiric imposes upon them his nostrums and quackeries the paltry sweepings of the counters for universal panaceas when we expected some solemn sententious reproof from the learned and pious prelector on the hebrew poesy out comes all bartlemy fair let loose upon us at once and we see your lordship whipped at the carts tail posted up in the pillory flogged by the beadles of bridewell caned by bishop w   s page    footman hunted and waylaid by his ibid cherokees and iroquois and at length good man exhibited on a page   scaffold erected on purpose for you and in the most conspicuous place  how much you must have profited by your studies on the book of job this example of your patience demonstrates but what agreeable company to introduce us into and you seem so sociable and intimate with them footmen and bumbailiffs beadles constables hangmen and wild indians edifying society elegant allusions taste that savours of the kennels of saint giless jests that would put the ordinary of newgate to the blush and wit the genuine offspring not of athens but of the ola bailey  now my lord would i venture to undergo all the discipline your lordship has run through if that old cynic dr bentley would have stirred a muscle of his face to laughter at all this pleasantry  no no he had no taste or capacity but for hedging and ditching and milking of goats not a syllable of all this would he have comprehended in matters of such pure taste as your lordship has now given us a sample of compositions of a character so different from any he ever had been used to style of a color so directly opposite to his own and a manner of thinking so utterly unlike that of any gentleman who ever thought at all i do allow and am persuaded he would not have shown the least shadow of discernment  for this however i do seriously and from the ground of my heart thank your lordship again and again viz that when you informed the world of his utter want of taste your consented to give us so fair a specimen of your own but your railleries are not confined to yourself only you are wonderfully pleasant upon the patriarchs your arch insinuations about page    abrahams offering his son isaac are infinitely facetious  i was so ignorant as to consider this as a circumstance of a most serious and edifying nature an exalted instance of the most perfect faith in god and obedience to his word and a sacred type of our redeemers death and passion selected as the passage of scripture best suited to our good fridays meditation i have been apt therefore to think and to speak of this act of the patriarchs with reverence and devotion your lordship treats it with the levity of a milesian fable and puts some arch queries upon the matter relative to the sin of sodom this sin of sodom it seems has been a sort of stumbling block to your lordship and you tell us you have hunted after it page    from the beginning of the bible to the end the search might be useful though the object of it was not the most worthy i hope my lord you was not equally inquisitive when you turned to your catullus in search of those reproachful terms caprimulgus aut fossor to bestow them upon dr bentley had you ransacked that author through as you did the bible every leaf would have furnished you with descriptions of the sin of sodom as good luck will have it you have carried us into one of his cleanliest poems and as your quotation put me upon reading it over i really thought i traced the features of your lordship as strongly marked out in the picture of suffenus as you conceived you did those of dr bentley for this suffenus says the vide cat ex rec is voss page  0 poet  homo est venustus et dicax et urbanus idemque long plurimos facit versus     neque idem unquam aeque est beatus ac poema quum scribit tom gaudet in se tamque se ipse miratur the moral with which the epigram concludes i more particularly recommend to your lordship  nimirum idem omnes fallimur neque est quisquam quem non in aliqua re videre suffenum possis suus quoique adtributus est error sed non videmus manticae quid in tergo est but i have detained your lordship long time and hasten to conclude my self  my lord your lordships most obedient humble servant a member of the university of cambridge
