an essay on the learning of shakespeare  an essay on the learning of shakespeare addressed to joseph cradock esquire the second edition with large additions  by richard farmer b d fellow of emmanuelcollege cambridge and of the society of antiquaries london  cambridge printed by j archdeacon printer to the university for j woodyer in cambridge and sold by j beecroft in paternoster row j dodsley in pall mall t cadell in the strand and m hingeston near temple bar london mdcclxvii  preface to the second edition the author of the following essay was sollicitous only for the honor of shakespeare he has however in his own capacity little reason to complain of occasional critics or critics by profession the very few who have been pleased to controvert any part of his doctrine have favored him with better manners than arguments and claim his thanks for a further opportunity of demonstrating the futility of theoretick reasoning against matter of fact it is indeed strange that any real friends of our immortal poet should be still willing to force him into a situation which is not tenable treat him as a learned man and what shall excuse the most gross violations of history chronology and geography   is the motto of every polemick like his brethren at the amphitheatre he holds it a merit to die hard and will not say enough though the battle be decided were it shown says some one that the old bard borrowed all his allusions from english books then published our essayist might have possibly established his system  in good time  this had scarcely been attempted by peter burman himself with the library of shakespeare before him  truly as mr dogberry says for mine own part if i were as tedious as a king i could find in my heart to bestow it all on this subject but where should i meet with a reader  when the main pillars are taken away the whole building falls in course nothing has been or can be pointed out which is not easily removed or rather which was not virtually removed before a very little analogy will do the business i shall therefore have no occasion to trouble myself any further and may venture to call my pamphlet in the words of a pleasant declaimer against sermons on the thirtieth of january an answer to every thing that shall hereafter be written on the subject  but this method of reasoning will prove any one ignorant of the languages who has written when translations were extant  shade of burgersdicius  does it follow because shakespeares early life was incompatible with a course of education  whose contemporaries friends and foes nay and himself likewise agree in his want of what is usually called literature  whose mistakes from equivocal translations and even typographical errors cannot possibly be accounted for otherwise  that lock to whom not one of these circumstances is applicable understood no greek  i suspect rollins opinion of our philosopher was not founded on this argument  shakespeare wanted not the stilts of languages to raise him above all other men the quotation from lilly in the taming of the shrew if indeed it be his strongly proves the extent of his reading had he known terence he would not have quoted erroneously from his grammar every one has met with men in common life who according to the language of the waterpoet got only from possum to posset and yet will throw out a line occasionally from their accidence or their cato de moribus with tolerable propriety  if however the old editions be trusted in this passage our authors memory somewhat failed him in point of concord  the rage of parallelisms is almost over and in truth nothing can be more absurd this was stolen from one classick  that from another  and had i not stepped in to his rescue poor shakespeare had been stripped as naked of ornament as when he first held horses at the door of the playhouse  the late ingenious and modest mr dodsley declared himself untutored in the lore of greece or rome yet let us take a passage at a venture from any of his performances and a thousand to one it is stolen suppose it be his celebrated compliment to the ladies in one of his earliest pieces the toyshop a good wife makes the cares of the world sit easy and adds a sweetness to its pleasures she is a mans best companion in prosperity and his only friend in adversity the carefullest preserver of his health and the kindest attendant in his sickness a faithful adviser in distress a comforter in affliction and a prudent manager in all his domestic affairs  plainly from a fragment of euripides preserved by stobaeus       par  to      malvolio in the twelfthnight of shakespeare has some expressions very similar to alnaschar in the arabian tales which perhaps may be sufficient for some critics to prove his acquaintance with arabic  it seems however at last that taste should determine the matter this as bardolph expresses it is a word of exceeding good command but i am willing that the standard itself be somewhat better ascertained before it be opposed to demonstrative evidence  upon the whole i may consider myself as the pioneer of the commentators i have removed a deal of learned rubbish and pointed out to them shakespeares track in the everpleasing paths of nature this was necessarily a previous inquiry and i hope i may assume with some confidence what one of the first critics of the age was pleased to declare on reading the former edition that the question is now for ever decided i may just remark lest they be mistaken for errata that the word catherine in the   th page is written according to the old orthography for catherine and that the passage in the   st page is copied from upton who improperly calls horatio and marcellus in hamlet the sentinels  in p    l    for had probably read might have etc     an essay on the learning of shakespeare addressed to joseph cradock esquire shakespeare says a brother of the craft mr seward in his preface to beaumont and fletcher  0 vol  vo    0 is a vast garden of criticism and certainly no one can be favored with more weeders gratis  but how often my dear sir are weeds and flowers torn up indiscriminately  the ravaged spot is replanted in a moment and a profusion of critical thorns thrown over it for security  a prudent man therefore would not venture his fingers amongst them  be however in little pain for your friend who regards himself sufficiently to be cautious  yet he asserts with confidence that no improvement can be expected whilst the natural soil is mistaken for a hotbed and the natives of the banks of avon are scientifically choked with the culture of exoticks  thus much for metaphor it is contrary to the statute to fly out so early but who can tell whether it may not be demonstrated by some critic or other that a deviation from rule is peculiarly happy in an essay of shakespeare  you have long known my opinion concerning the literary acquisitions of our immortal dramatist and remember how i congratulated myself on my coincidence with the last and best of his editors i told you however that his small latin and less greek this passage of ben jonson so often quoted is given us in the admirable preface to the late edition with a various reading small latin and no greek which has been held up to the public for a modern sophistication yet whether an error or not it was adopted above a century ago by w towers in a panegyric on cartwright his eulogy with more than fifty others on this now forgotten poet was prefixed to the edit      would still be litigated and you see very assuredly that i was not mistaken the trumpet has been sounded against the darling project of representing shakespeare as one of the illiterate vulgar and indeed to so good purpose that i would by all means recommend the performer to the army of the braying faction recorded by cervantes the testimony of his contemporaries is again disputed constant tradition is opposed by flimsy arguments and nothing is heard but confusion and nonsense one could scarcely imagine this a topic very likely to inflame the passions it is asserted by dryden that those who accuse him to have wanted learning give him the greatest commendation yet an attack upon an article of faith has been usually received with more temper and complacence than the unfortunate opinion which i am about to defend  but let us previously lament with every lover of shakespeare that the question was not fully discussed by mr johnson himself what he sees intuitively others must arrive at by a series of proofs and i have not time to teach with precision be contented therefore with a few cursory observations as they may happen to arise from the chaos of papers you have so often laughed at a stock sufficient to set up an editor in form i am convinced of the strength of my cause and superior to any little advantage from sophistical arrangements  general positions without proofs will probably have no great weight on either side yet it may not seem fair to suppress them take them therefore as their authors occur to me and we will afterward proceed to particulars  the testimony of ben stands foremost and some have held it sufficient to decide the controversy in the warmest panegyric that ever was written he apologizes though thou had small latin etc for what he supposed the only defect in his beloved friend     soul of the age the applause delight the wonder of our stage  whose memory he honored almost to idolatry and conscious of the worth of ancient literature like any other man on the same occasion he rather carries his acquirements above than below the truth jealousy cries mr upton people will allow others any qualities but those upon which they highly value themselves yes where there is a competition and the competitor formidable but i think this critic himself has scarcely set in opposition the learning of shakespeare and jonson when a superiority is universally granted it by no means appears a mans literary interest to depress the reputation of his antagonist  in truth the received opinion of the pride and malignity of jonson at least in the earlier part of life is absolutely groundless at this time scarce a play or a poem appeared without bens encomium from the original shakespeare to the translator of du bartas  but jonson is by no means our only authority drayton the countryman and acquaintance of shakespeare determines his excellence to the natural brain in his elegy on poets and poesy p  0  fol      only digges a wit of the town before our poet left the stage is very strong to the purpose  nature only helped him for look through this whole book thou shall find he does not borow one phrase from greeks not latins imitate nor once from vulgar languages translate from his poem upon master william shakespeare intended to have been prefixed with the other of his composition to the folio of      and afterward printed in several miscellaneous collections particularly the spurious edition of shakespeares poems    0 some account of him may be met with in woods athenae    suckling opposes his easier strain to the sweat of learned jonson denham assures us that all he had was from old motherwit his native woodnotes wild every one remembers to be celebrated by milton dryden observes prettily enough that he wanted not the spectacles of books to read nature he came out of her hand as some one else expresses it like pallas out of joves head at full growth and mature  the ever memorable hales of eton who notwithstanding his epithet is i fear almost forgotten had too great a knowledge both of shakespeare and the ancients to allow much acquaintance between them and urged very justly on the part of genius in opposition to pedantry that if he had not read the classicks he had likewise not stolen from them and if any topic was produced from a poet of antiquity he would undertake to show somewhat on the same subject at least as well written by shakespeare  fuller a diligent and equal searcher after truth and quibbles declares positively that his learning was very little  nature was all the art used upon him as he himself if alive would confess and may we not say he did confess it when he apologized for his untutored lines to his noble patron the earl of southampton  this list of witnesses might be easily enlarged but i flatter myself i shall stand in no need of such evidence  one of the first and most vehement assertors of the learning of shakespeare was the editor of his poems the wellknown mr gildon hence perhaps the illstard rage between this critic and his elder brother john dennis so pathetically lamented in the dunciad whilst the former was persuaded that the man who doubts of the learning of shakespeare has none of his own the latter above regarding the attack in his private capacity declares with great patriotic vehemence that he who allows shakespeare had learning and a familiar acquaintance with the ancients ought to be looked upon as a detractor from the glory of great britain dennis was expelled his college for attempting to stab a man in the dark pope would have been glad of this anecdote and his steps were most punctually taken by a subsequent labourer in the same department dr sewel  mr pope supposed little ground for the common opinion of his want of learning once indeed he made a proper distinction between learning and languages as i would be understood to do in my title page but unfortunately he forgot it in the course of his disquisition and endeavored to persuade himself that shakespeares acquaintance with the ancients might be actually proved by the same medium as jonsons  mr theobald is very unwilling to allow him so poor a scholar as many have labored to represent him and yet is cautious of declaring too positively on the other side the question  dr warburton has exposed the weakness of some arguments from suspected imitations and yet offers others which i doubt not he could as easily have refuted  mr upton wonders with what kind of reasoning any one could be so far imposed upon as to imagine that shakespeare had no learning and lashes with much zeal and satisfaction the pride and pertness of dunces who under such a name would gladly shelter their own idleness and ignorance  he like the learned knight at every anomaly in grammar or meter has hard words ready to show why and tell what rule he did it by   how would the old bard have been astonished to have found that he had very skilfully given the trochaic dimeter brachycatalectic commonly called the ithyphallic measure to the witches in macheth and that now and then a halting verse afforded a most beautiful instance of the pes proceleusmaticus  but continues mr upton it was a learned age roger ascham assures us that queen elizabeth read more greek every day than some dignitaries of the church did latin in a whole week this appears very probable and a pleasant proof it is of the general learning of the times and of shakespeare in particular i wonder he did not corroborate it with an extract from her injunctions to her clergy that such as were but mean readers should peruse over before once or twice the chapters and homilies to the intent they might read to the better understanding of the people  dr gray declares that shakespeares knowledge in the greek and latin tongues cannot reasonably be called in question dr dodd supposes it proved that he was not such a novice in learning and antiquity as some people would pretend and to close the whole for i suspect you to be tired of quotation mr whalley the ingenious editor of jonson has written a piece expressly on this side the question perhaps from a very excusable partiality he was willing to draw shakespeare from the field of nature to classick ground where alone he knew his author could possibly cope with him  these critics and many others their coadjutors have supposed themselves able to trace shakespeare in the writings of the ancients and have sometimes persuaded us of their own learning whatever became of their authors plagiarisms have been discovered in every natural description and every moral sentiment indeed by the kind assistance of the various excerpta sententiae and flores this business may be effected with very little expense of time or sagacity as addison has demonstrated in his comment on chevychace and wagstaff on tom thumb and i myself will engage to give you quotations from the elder english writers for to own the truth i was once idle enough to collect such which shall carry with them at least an equal degree of similarity but there can be no occasion of wasting any future time in this department the world is now in possession of the marks of imitation  shakespeare however has frequent allusions to the facts and fables of antiquity granted  and as mat prior says to save the effusion of more christian ink i will endeavor to show how they came to his acquaintance  it is notorious that much of his matter of fact knowledge is deduced from plutarch but in what language he read him has yet been the question mr upton is pretty confident of his skill in the original and corrects accordingly the errors of his copyists by the greek standard take a few instances which will elucidate this matter sufficiently  in the third act of anthony and cleopatra octavius represents to his courtiers the imperial pomp of those illustrious lovers and the arrangement of their dominion     unto her he gave the stablishment of egypt made her of lower syria cyprus lydia absolute queen   read libya says the critic authoritatively as is plain from plutarch   this is very true mr heath it is extraordinary that this gentleman should attempt so voluminous a work as the revisal of shakespeares text when he tells us in his preface he was not so fortunate as to be furnished with either of the folio editions much less any of the ancient quartos and even sir thomas hanmers performance was known to him only by mr warburtons representation accedes to the correction and mr johnson admits it into the text but turn to the translation from the french of amyot by thomas north in folio      i find the character of this work pretty early delineated it was greek at first that greek was latin made that latin french that french to english straid thus twixt one plutarch there is more difference than in the same englishman returned from france  and you will at once see the origin of the mistake  first of all he did establish cleopatra queen of egypt of cyprus of lydia and the lower syria  again in the fourth act    my messenger he has whipped with rods dares me to personal combat caesar to anthony let the old ruffian know i have many other ways to die mean time laugh at his challenge    what a reply is this cries mr upton it is acknowledging he should fall under the unequal combat but if we read    let the old ruffian know he has many other ways to die mean time i laugh at his challenge  we have the poignancy and the very repartee of caesar in plutarch  this correction was first made by sir thomas hanmer and mr johnson has received it most indisputably it is the sense of plutarch and given so in the modern translations but shakespeare was misled by the ambiguity of the old one antonius sent again to challenge caesar to fight him caesar answered that he had many other ways to die than so  in the third act of julius caesar anthony in his wellknown harangue to the people repeats a part of the emperors will  to every roman citizen he gives to every several man seventy five drams  moreover he has left you all his walks his private arbours and newplanted orchards on this side tyber    our author certainly wrote says mr theobald on that side tyber  travs tiberim  prope caesaris hortos and plutarch whom shakespeare very diligently studied expressly declares that he left the public his gardens and walks  beyond the tyber  this emendation likewise has been adopted by the subsequent editors but hear again the old translation where shakespeares study lay he bequeathed unto every citizen of rome seventyfive drachmas a man and he left his gardens and arbours unto the people which he had on this side of the river of tyber i could furnish you with many more instances but these are as good as a thousand  hence had our author his characteristick knowledge of brutus and anthony upon which much argumentation for his learning has been founded and hence literatim the epitaph on timon which it was once presumed he had corrected from the blunders of the latin version by his own superior knowledge of the original see theobalds preface to k richard  d  vo    0   i cannot however omit a passage of mr pope the speeches copied from plutarch in coriolanus may i think be as well made an instance of the learning of shakespeare as those copied from cicero in catiline of ben jonsons let us inquire into this matter and transcribe a speech for a specimen take the famous one of volumnia  should we be silent and not speak our raiment and state of bodies would bewray what life we have led since thy exile think with thyself how more unfortunate than all living women are we come hither since thy sight which should make our eyes flow with joy hearts dance with comforts constrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow making the mother wife and child to see the son the husband and the father tearing his countrys bowels out and to poor we thy enmitys most capital thou barrst us our prayers to the gods which is a comfort that all but we enjoy for how can we alas how can we for our country pray whereto we are bound together with thy victory whereto we are bound alack or we must of lose the country our dear nurse or else thy person our comfort in the country we must find an eminent calamity though we had our wish which side should win for either thou must as a foreign recreant be led with manacles thorough our streets or else triumphantly tread on thy countrys ruin and bear the palm for having bravely shed thy wife and childrens blood for myself son i purpose not to wait on fortune till these wars determine if i cannot persuade thee rather to show a noble grace to both parts than seek the end of one thou shall no sooner march to assault thy country than to tread trust to it thou shall not on thy mothers womb that brought thee to this world i will now give you the old translation which shall effectually confute mr pope for our author has done little more than thrown the very words of north into blank verse  if we held our peace my son and determined not to speak the state of our poor bodies and present sight of our raiment would easily bewray to thee what life we have led at home since thy exile and abode abroad but think now with thy self how much more unfortunately then all the women living we are come hither considering that the sight which should be most pleasant to all other to behold spiteful fortune has made most fearful to us making my self to see my son and my daughter here her husband besieging the walls of his native country so as that which is the only comfort to all other in their adversity and misery to pray unto the gods and to call to them for aid is the only thing which plongeth us into most deep perplexity for we cannot alas together pray both for victory for our country and for safety of thy life also but a world of grievous curses yea more then any mortal enemy can heap upon us are forcibly wrapped up in our prayers for the bitter soppe of most hard choice is offered thy wife and children to forgo the one of the two either to lose the person of thy self or the nurse of their native contrie for my self my son i am determined not to tarry till fortune in my life time do make an end of this war for if i cannot persuade thee rather to do good unto both parties then to overthrow and destroy the one preferring love and nature before the malice and calamity of wars thou shall see my son and trust unto it thou shall no sooner march forward to assault thy country but thy foot shall tread upon thy mothers womb that brought thee first into this world  the length of this quotation will be excused for it is curiosity and it happily wants not the assistance of a comment but matters may not always be so easily managed  a plagiarism from anacreon has been detected  the suns a thief and with his great attraction robs the vast sea the moons an arrant thief and her pale fire she snatches from the sun the seas a thief whose liquid surge resolves the moon into salt tears the earths a thief that feeds and breeds by a composture stolen from general excrements each things a thief this says dr dodd is a good deal in the manner of the celebrated drinking ode too well known to be inserted yet it may be alleged by those who imagine shakespeare to have been generally able to think for himself that the topics are obvious and their application is different  but for arguments sake let the parody be granted and our author says some one may be puzzled to prove that there was a latin translation of anacreon at the time shakespeare wrote his timon of athens this challenge is peculiarly unhappy for i do not at present recollect any other classick if indeed with great deference to mynheer de pauw anacreon may be numbered amongst them that was originally published with two latin by henry stephens and elias andreas par       to ten years before the birth of shakespeare the former version has been ascribed without reason to john dorat many other translators appeared before the end of the century and particularly the ode in question was made popular by buchanan whose pieces were soon to be met with in almost every modern language translations  but this is not all puttenham in his art of english poesy      quotes some one of a reasonable good facility in translation who finding certain of anacreons odes very well translated by ronsard the french poet  comes our minion and translates the same out of french into english and his strictures upon him evince the publication now this identical ode is to be met with in ronsard and as his works are in few hands i will take the liberty of transcribing it  la terre les eaux va boivant l arbre la boit par sa racine la mer salee boit le vent et le soleil boit la marine le soleil est beu de la lune tout boit soit en haut ou en bas suivant ceste reigle commune pourquoy donc ne boironsnous pas edit fol p  0  i know not whether an observation of two relative to our authors acquaintance with homer be worth our investigation the ingenious mrs lenox observes on a passage of troilus and cressida where achilles is roused to battle by the death of patroclus that shakespeare must here have had the iliad in view as the old story it was originally drawn into english by caxton under the name of the recuyel of the historyes of troy from the french of the right venerable person and worshipful man raoul le feure and fynyshed in the holy

many places he has faithfully copied is absolutely silent with respect to this circumstance  and mr upton is positive that the sweet oblivious antidote inquired after by macbeth could be nothing but the nepenthe described in the odyssey  i will not insist upon the translations by chapman as the first editions are without date and it may be difficult to ascertain the exact time of their publication but the former circumstance might have been learned from alexander barclay who list thistory of patroclus to read etc ship of fools    0 p    and the latter more fully from spenser

etc faerie queen      b   c   st    than from homer himself  but shakespeare persists mr upton has some greek expressions indeed  we have one in coriolanus       it is held that valor is the chiefest

real parents and now only dependant on destiny herself a few lines from spenser will sufficiently illustrate the passage the man whom heavens have ordaynd to be the spouse of britomart is arthegall he

b   c   st    heirs of fixed destiny and how elegant is this quoth mr upton supposing the word to be used as a grecian would have used it  ab   acting in darkness and obscurity  mr heath assures us that the bare mention of such an interpretation is a sufficient refutation of it and his critical word will be rather taken in greek than in english in the same hands therefore i will venture to leave all our authors knowledge of the old comedy and his etymological learning in the word desdemona revisal p       and       surely poor mr upton was very little acquainted with fairies notwithstanding his laborious study of spenser the last authentic account of them is from our countryman william lilly history of his life and times p  0  preserved by his dupe mr ashmole and it by no means agrees with the learned interpretation for the angelical creatures appeared in his hurst wood in a most illustrious glory  and indeed says the sage it is not given to very many persons to endure their glorious aspects  the only use of transcribing these things is to show what absurdities men for ever run into when they lay down an hypothesis and afterward seek for arguments in the support of it what else could induce this man by no means a bad scholar to doubt whether truepenny might not be derived from  and quote upon us with much parade an old scholiast on aristophanes  i will not stop to confute him nor take any notice of two or three more expressions in which he was pleased to suppose some learned meaning or other all which he might have found in every writer of the time or still more easily in the vulgar translation of the bible by consulting the concordance of alexander cruden  but whence have we the plot of timon except from the greek of lucian  the editors and critics have been never at a greater loss than in their inquiries of this sort and the source of a tale has been often in vain sought abroad which might easily have been found at home my good friend the very ingenious editor of the relics of ancient english poetry has shown our author to have been sometimes contented with a legendary ballad  the story of the misanthrope is told in almost every collection of the time and particulary in two books with which shakespeare was intimately acquainted the palace of pleasure and the english plutarch indeed from a passage in an old play called jack drums entertainment i conjecture that he had before made his appearance on the stage  were this a proper place for such a disquisition i could give you many cases of this kind we are sent for instance to cinthio for the plot of measure for measure and shakespeares judgment has been attacked for some deviations from him in the conduct of it when probably all he knew of the matter was from madam isabella in the heptameron of whetstone land  to      she reports in the fourth days exercise the rare history of promos and cassandra a marginal note informs us that whetstone was the author of the commedie on that subject which likewise had probably fallen into the hands of shakespeare ariosto is continually quoted for the fable of much ado about nothing but i suspect our poet to have been satisfied with the geneura of turberville the tale is a pretty comicall matter and has bin written in english verse some few years past learnedly and with good grace by m george turberuil harringtons ariosto fol      p    as you like it was certainly borrowed if we believe dr gray and mr upton from the cokes tale of gamelyn which by the way was not printed till a century afterward when in truth the old bard who was no hunter of mss contented himself solely with lodges rosalynd or euphues golden legacye  to    0 the story of all is well that ends well or as i suppose it to have been sometimes called loves labor won see meress wits treasury      p     is originally indeed the property of boccace our ancient poets are under greater obligations to boccace than is generally imagined who would suspect that chaucer has borrowed from an italian the facetious tale of the miller of trumpington  mr dryden observes on the epic performance palamon and arcite a poem little inferior in his opinion to the iliad or the aeneid that the name of it is author is wholly lost and chaucer is now become the original but he is mistaken this too was the work of boccace and printed at ferrara in folio con il commento di andrea bassi      i have seen a copy of it and a translation into modern greek in the noble library of the very learned and communicative dr askew  it is likewise to be met with in old french under the title of la theseide de jean boccace contenant les belles and chastes amors de deux jeunes chevaliers thebains arcite and palemon   but it came immediately to shakespeare from painters giletta of narbon in the first vol of the palace of pleasure  to      mr langbaine could not conceive whence the story of pericles could be taken not meeting in history with any such prince of tire yet his legend may be found at large in old gower under the name of appolynus confessio amantis printed by t berthelet fol      p     etc   pericles is one of the plays omitted in the later editions as well as the early folios and not improperly though it was published many years before the death of shakespeare with his name in the title page aulus gellius informs us that some plays are ascribed absolutely to plautus which he only retouched and polished and this is undoubtedly the case with our author likewise the revival of this performance which ben jonson calls stale and moldy was probably his earliest attempt in the drama i know that another of these discarded pieces the yorkshire tragedy has been frequently called so but most certainly it was not written by our poet at all nor indeed was it printed in his lifetime the fact on which it is built was perpetrated no sooner than   0  william caluerley of caluerley in yorkshire esquire murdered two of his own children in his own house then stabde his wife into the body with full intent to have killed her and then instantly with like fury went from his house to have slain his youngest child at nurse but was prevented he was pressed to death in york the   of august   0  edm howes continuation of john stowes summarie  vo   0  p     the story appeared before in a  to pamphlet   0  it is ommitted in the folio chronicle      much too late for so mean a performance from the hand of shakespeare  sometimes a very little matter detects a forgery you may remember a play called the double falsehood which mr theobald was desirous of palming upon the world for a posthumous one of shakespeare and i see it is classed as such in the last edition of the bodleian catalogue mr pope himself after all the strictures of scriblerus these however he assures mr hill were the property of dr arbuthnot in a letter to aaron hill supposes it of that age but a mistaken accent determines it to have been written since the middle of the last century   this late example of base henriquez bleeding in me now from each good aspect takes away my trust and in another place you have an aspect sir of wondrous wisdom the word aspect you perceive is here accented on the first syllable which i am confident in any sense of it was never the case in the time of shakespeare though it may sometimes appear to be so when we do not observe a preceding elision thus a line in hamlets description of the player should be printed as in the old folios tears in his eyes distraction ins aspect agreeably to the accent in a hundred other places   some of the professed imitators of our old poets have not attended to this and many other minutiae i could point out to you several performances in the respective styles of chaucer spenser and shakespeare which the imitated bard could not possibly have either read or construed  this very accent has troubled the annotators on milton dr bentley observes it to be a tone different from the present use mr manwaring in his treatise of harmony and numbers very solemnly informs us that this verse is defective both in accent and quantity b   v     his words here ended but his meek aspect silent yet spoke  here says he a syllable is acuted and long whereas it should be short and graved  and a still more extraordinary gentleman one green who published a specimen of a new version of the paradise lost into blank verse by which that amazing work is brought somewhat nearer the summit of perfection begins with correcting a blunder in the fourth book v   0   the setting sun slowly defended and with right aspect  levelled his evening rays   not so in the new version meanwhile the setting sun descending slow  levelled with aspect right his evening rays enough of such commentators  the celebrated dr dee had a spirit who would sometimes condescend to correct him when peccant in quantity and it had been kind of him to have a little assisted the wights abovementioned  milton affected the antique but it may seem more extraordinary that the old accent should be adopted in hudibras  after all the double falsehood is superior to theobald one passage and one only in the whole play he pretended to have written    strike up my masters but touch the strings with a religious softness teach sound to languish through the nights dull ear till melancholy start from her lazy couch and carelessness grow convert to attention   these lines were particularly admired and his vanity could not resist the opportunity of claiming them but his claim had been more easily allowed to any other part of the performance  to whom then shall we ascribe it  somebody has told us who should seem to be a nostrummonger by his argument that let accents be how they will it is called an original play of william shakespeare in the kings patent prefixed to mr theobalds edition      and consequently there could be no fraud in the matter whilff on the contrary the irish laureat mr victor remarks and were it true it would be certainly decisive that the plot is borrowed from a novel of cervantes not published till the year after shakespeares death but unluckily the same novel appears in a part of don quixote which was printed in spanish   0  and in english by shelton       the same reasoning however which exculpated our author from the yorkshire tragedy may be applied on the present occasion  but you want my opinion  and from every mark of style and manner i make no doubt of ascribing it to shirley mr langbaine informs us that he left some plays in ms  these were written about the time of the restoration when the accent in question was more generally altered  perhaps the mistake arose from an abbreviation of the name mr dodsley knew not that the tragedy of andromana was shirleys from the very same cause thus a whole stream of biographers tell us that marstons plays were printed at london      by the care of william shakespeare the famous comedian  here again i suppose in some transcript the real publishers name william sheares was abbreviated no one has protracted the life of shakespeare beyond      except mr hume who is pleased to add a year to it in contradiction to all manner of evidence  shirley is spoken of with contempt in mac flecknoe but his imagination is sometimes fine to an extraordinary degree i recollect a passage in the fourth book of the paradise lost which has been suspected of imitation as a prettiness below the genius of milton i mean where uriel glides backward and forward to heaven on a sunbeam dr newton informs us that this might possibly be hinted by a picture of annibal carracci in the king of frances cabinet but i am apt to believe that milton had been struck with a portrait in shirley fernando in the comedy of the brothers      describes jacinta at vespers her eye did seem to labor with a tear which suddenly took birth but overweighd with it is own swelling dropped upon her bosom which by reflection of her light appeared as nature meant her sorrow for an ornament after her looks grew cheerful and i saw a smile shoot graceful upward from her eyes as if they had gained a victory over grief and with it many beams twisted themselves upon whose golden threads the angels walk to and again from heaven middleton in an obscure play called a game at chesse has some very pleasing lines on a similar occasion upon those lips the sweet fresh buds of youth the holy dew of prayer lies like pearl dropped from the opening eyelids of the morn upon the bashful rose      you must not think me infected with the spirit of lauder if i give you another of miltons imitations   the swan with arched neck between her white wings mantling proudly rows her state with oary feet  b   v     etc  the ancient poets says mr richardson have not hit upon this beauty so lavish as they have been in their descriptions of the swan homer calls the swan longnecked  but how much more pittoresque if he had arched this length of neck  for this beauty however milton was beholden to done whose name i believe at present is better known than his writings   like a ship in her full trim a swan so white that you may unto him compare all whiteness but himself to none glided along and as he glided watched and with his arched neck this poor fish caught  progress of the soul st     those highly finished landscapes the seasons are indeed copied from nature but thomson sometimes recollected the hand of his master    the stately sailing swan gives out his snowy plumage to the gale and arching proud his neck with oary feet bears forward fierce and guards his osier isle protective of his young    but to return as we say on other occasions  perhaps the advocates for shakespeares knowledge of the latin language may be more successful mr gildon takes the van it is plain that he was acquainted with the fables of antiquity very well that some of the arrows of cupid are pointed with lead and others with gold he found in ovid and what he speaks of dido in virgil nor do i know any translation of these poets so ancient as shakespeares time the passages on which these sagacious remarks are made occur in the midsummer nights dream and exhibit we see a clear proof of acquaintance with the latin classicks but we are not answerable for mr gildons ignorance he might have been told of caxton and douglas of surrey and stanyhurst of phaer and twyne of fleming and golding of turberville and churchyard but these fables were easily known without the help of either the originals or the translations the fate of dido had been sung very early by gower chaucer and lydgate marloe had even already introduced her to the stage and cupids arrows appear with their characteristick differences in surrey in sidney in spenser and every sonetteer of the time nay their very names were exhibited long before in the romaunt of the rose a work you may venture to look into notwithstanding master prynne has so positively assured us on the word of john gerson that the author is most certainly damned if he did not care for a serious repentance had our zealous puritan been acquainted with the real crime of de mehun he would not have joined in the clamor against him poor jehan it seems had raised the expectations of a monastery in france by the legacy of a great chest and the weighty contents of it but it proved to be filled with nothing better than vetches the friars enraged at the ridicule and disappointment would not suffer him to have christian burial see the hon mr barringtons very learned and curious observations on the statutes  to      p    from the annals d acquytayne par       our author had his full share in distressing the spirit of this restless man some playbooks are grown from quarto into folio which yet bear so good a price and sale that i cannot but with grief relate it  shackspeers plays are printed in the best crownepaper far better than most bibles     mr whalley argues in the same manner and with the same success he thinks a passage in the tempest    high queen of state great juno comes i know her by her gait a remarkable instance of shakespeares knowledge of ancient poetic story and that the hint was furnished by the divum incedo regina of virgil others would give up this passage for the vera incessu patuit dea but i am not able to see any improvement in the matter even supposing the poet had been speaking of juno and no previous translation were extant   you know honest john tailor the waterpoet declares that he never learned his accidence and that latin and french were to him heathengreek yet by the help of mr whalleys argument i will prove him a learned man in spite of every thing he may say to the contrary for thus he makes a gallant address his lady  most inestimable magazine of beauty  in whom the port and majesty of juno the wisdom of joves brainebred girl and the feature of cytherea this passage recalls to my memory a very extraordinary fact a few years ago at a great court on the continent a countryman of ours of high rank and character sir c h w exhibited with many other candidates his complimental epigram on the birthday and carried the prize in triumph o regina orbis prima and pulcherrima ridens es venus incedens juno minerva loquens literally stolen from angerianus tres quondam nudas vidit priameius heroes luce deas video tres quoque luce deas hoc majus tres uno in corpore coelia ridens est venus incedens juno minerva loquens   delitiae ital poet by gruter under the anagrammatic name of ranutius gherus   0  v   p      perhaps the latter part of the epigram was met with in a whimsical book which had it is day of fame robert burtons anatomy of melancholy fol       th edit p   0   have their domestical habitation  in the merchant of venice we have an oath by twoheaded janus and here says dr warburton shakespeare shows his knowledge in the antique and so again does the waterpoet who describes fortune like a janus with a doubleface  but shakespeare has somewhere at latin motto quoth dr sewel and so has john tailor and a whole poem upon it into the bargain  you perceive my dear sir how vague and indeterminate such arguments must be for in fact this sweet swan of thames as mr pope calls him has more scraps of latin and allusions to antiquity than are any where to be met with in the writings of shakespeare i am sorry to trouble you with trifles yet what must be done when grave men insist upon them  it should seem to be the opinion of some modern critics that the personages of classick land began only to be known in england in the time of shakespeare or rather that he particularly had the honor of introducing them to the notice of his countrymen  for instance  rumor painted full of tongues gives us a prologue to one of the parts of henry the fourth and says dr dodd shakespeare had doubtless a view to either virgil or ovid in their description of fame  but why so stephen hawes in his pastime of pleasure had long before exhibited her in the same manner a goodly lady envyroned about with tongues of fire cap    to       and so had sir thomas more in one of his pageants amongst the things which master more wrote in his youth for his pastime prefixed to his works      fol fame i am called mervayle you nothing though with tongues i am compassed all round not to mention her elaborate portrait by chaucer in the book of fame and by john higgins one of the assistants in the mirour for magistrates in his legend of king albanacte  a very liberal writer on the beauties of poetry who has been more conversant in the ancient literature of other countries than his own cannot but wonder that a poet whose classical images are composed of the finest parts and breath the very spirit of ancient mythology should pass for being illiterate see what a grace was seated on his brow hyperions curls the front of jove himself an eye like mars to threaten and command a station like the herald mercury new lighted on a heavenkissing hill hamlet illiterate is an ambiguous term the question is whether poetic history could be only known by an adept in languages it is no reflection on this ingenious gentleman when i say that i use on this occasion the words of a better critic who yet was not willing to carry the illiteracy of our poet too far  they who are in such astonishment at the learning of shakespeare forget that the pagan imagery was familiar to all the poets of his time and that abundance of this sort of learning was to be picked up from almost every english book that he could take into his hands for not to insist upon stephen batemans golden book of the leaden gods      and several other laborious compilations on the subject all this and much more mythology might as perfectly have been learned from the testament of creseide printed amongst the works of chaucer but really written by robert henderson and the fairy queen it is observable that hyperion is used by spenser with the same error in quantity as from a regular pantheon or polymetis himself  mr upton not contented with heathen learning when he finds it in the text must necessarily superadd it when it appears to be wanting because shakespeare most certainly has lost it by accident  in much ado about nothing don pedro says of the insensible benedict he has twice or thrice cut cupids bowstring and the little hangman dare not shoot at him  this mythology is not recollected in the ancients and therefore the critic has no doubt but his author wrote henchman  a page pusio and this word seeming too hard for the printer he translated the little urchin into a hangman a character no way belonging to him  but this character was not borrowed from the ancients  it came from the arcadia of sir philip sidney millions of years this old drivell cupid lives while still more wretch more wicked he does prove till now at length that jove him office gives at junos suite who much did argus love in this our world a hangman for to be of all those fools that will have all they see b   chapter     i know it may be objected on the authority of such biographers as theophilus cibber and the writer of the life of sir philip prefixed to the modern editions that the arcadia was not published before      and consequently too late for this imitation but i have a copy in my own possession printed for w ponsonbie    0  to which has escaped the notice of the industrious ames and the rest of our typographical antiquaries  thus likewise every word of antiquity is to be cut down to the classical standard  in a note on the prologue to troilus and cressida which by the way is not met with in the quarto mr theobald informs us that the very names of the gates of troy have been barbarously demolished by the editors and a deal of learned dust he makes in setting them right again much however to mr heaths satisfaction indeed the learning is modestly withdrawn from the later editions and we are quietly instructed to read dardan and thymbria ilia scaea trojan and antenorides but had he looked into the troy book of lydgate instead of puzzling himself with dares phrygius he would have found the horrid demolition to have been neither the work of shakespeare nor his editors  thereto his cite compassed enuyrowne had gates vi to enter into the town the first of all and strengest eke with all largest also and most pryncypall of mighty byldyng alone pereless was by the king called dardanydes and in storye like as it is found tymbria was named the second and the third called helyas the fourth gate hyghte also cetheas the fyfthe trojana the syxth anthonydes strong and mighty both in werre and pes the troy book was somewhat modernized and reduced into regular stanzas about the beginning of the last century under the name of the life and death of hector  who fought a hundred main battles in open field against the grecians wherein there were slain on both sides fourteen hundred and six thousand fourscore and six men fol no date this work dr fuller and several other critics have erroneously quoted as the original and observe in consequence that if chaucers coin were of greater weight for deeper learning lydgates were of a more refined standard for purer language so that one might mistake him for a modern writer  let me here make an observation for the benefit of the next editor of chaucer mr urry probably misled by his predecessor speght was determined procrusteslike to force every line in the canterbury tales to the same standard but a precise number of syllables was not the object of our old poets lydgate after the example of his master very fairly acknowledges well wot i much thing is wrong falsely metryd both of short and long and chaucer himself was persuaded that the rhyme might possibly be  somewhat agreeable though some verse fail in a syllable   in short the attention was directed to the caesural pause as the grammarians call it which is carefully marked in every line of lydgate and gascoigne in his certain notes of instruction concerning the making of verse observes very truly of chaucer whosoever do peruse and well consider his works he shall find that although his lines are not always of one self same number of syllables yet being read by one that has understanding the longest verse and that which has most syllables in it will fall to the ear correspondent unto that which has fewest syllables in it and likewise that which has in it fewest syllables shall be found yet to consist of words that have such natural sound as may seem equal in length to a verse which has many more syllables of lighter accents  to         land empr by r pynson      fol b   chapter    our excellent friend mr hurd has born a noble testimony on our side of the question shakespeare says this true critic owed the felicity of freedom from the bondage of classical superstition to the want of what is called the advantage of a learned education  this as well as a vast superiority of genius has contributed to lift this astonishing man to the glory of being esteemed the most original thinker and speaker since the times of homer and hence indisputably the amazing variety of style and manner unknown to all other writers an argument of itself sufficient to emancipate shakespeare from the supposition of a classical training yet to be honest one imitation is fastened on our poet which has been insisted upon likewise by mr upton and mr whalley you remember it in the famous speech of claudio in measure for measure ay but to die and go we know not where etc  most certainly the ideas of a spirit bathing in fiery floods of residing in thrilling regions of thickribbed ice or of being imprisoned in the viewless winds are not original in our author but i am not sure that they came from the platonic hell of virgil   aliae panduntur inanes suspensae ad ventos aliis sub gurgite vasto infectum eluitur scelus aut exuritur igni  the monks also had their hot and their cold hell the first is fire that ever brenneth and never gyveth light says an old homily at the end of the festyuall drawn out of legenda aurea  to   0  it was first printed by caxton      in help of such clerks who excuse them for defaute of books and also by symplenes of conning  the second is passing cold that if a great hylle of fire were casten therein it should torn to ice one of their legends well remembered in the time of shakespeare gives us a dialogue between a bishop and a soul tormented in a piece of ice which was brought to cure a great brenning heat in his foot on all souls day p     take care you do not interpret this the gout for i remember m menage quotes a canon upon us si quis dixerit episcopum podagra laborare anathema sit  another tells us of the soul of a monk fastened to a rock which the winds were to blow about for a twelvemonth and purge of it is enormities indeed this doctrine was before now introduced into poetic fiction as you may see in a poem where the lover declares his pains to exceed far the pains of hell among the many miscellaneous ones subjoined to the works of surrey nay a very learned and inquisitive brotherantiquary our greek professor has observed to me on the authority of blefkenius that this was the ancient opinion of the inhabitants of iceland islandiae descript lugd bat   0  p    who were certainly very little read either in the poet or the philosopher  after all shakespeares curiosity might lead him to translations gawin douglas really changes the platonic hell into the punytion of saulis in purgatory and it is observable that when the ghost informs hamlet of his doom there till the foul crimes done in his days of nature are burnt and purged away  the expression is very similar to the bishops i will give you his version as concisely as i can it is a nedeful thing to suffer panis and torment  sum in the wyndis sum under the watter and in the fire uthir sum  thus the money vices  contrakkit in the corpis be done away and purgit  sixte book of eneados fol p      it seems however that shakespeare himself in the tempest has translated some expressions of virgil witness the o dea certe i presume we are here directed to the passage where ferdinand says of miranda after hearing the songs of ariel   most sure the goddess on whom these airs attend and so very small latin is sufficient for this formidable translation that if it be thought any honor to our poet i am loath to deprive him of it but his honor is not built on such a sandy foundation let us turn to a real translator and examine whether the idea might not be fully comprehended by an english reader supposing it necessarily borrowed from virgil hexameters in our own language are almost forgotten we will quote therefore this time from stanyhurst o to thee fair virgin what term may rightly be fitted thy tongue thy visage no mortal frayltie resembles  no doubt a godesse edit       gabriel harvey desired only to be epitaphd the inventor of the english hexameter and for a while every one would be halting on roman feet but the ridicule of our fellow collegian hall in one of his satires and the reasoning of daniel in his defense of rhyme against campion presently reduced us to our original gothic  but to come nearer the purpose what will you say if i can show you that shakespeare when in the favorite phrase he had a latin poet in his eye most assuredly made use of a translation  prospero in the tempest begins the address to his attendant spirits ye elves of hills of standing lakes and groves  this speech dr warburton rightly observes to be borrowed from medea in ovid and it proves says mr holt in some remarks on the tempest published under the quaint title of an attempt to rescue that aunciente english poet and playwrighte master williaume shakespeare from the many errors faulsely charged upon him by certain newfangled wits land  vo      p    beyond contradiction that shakespeare was perfectly acquainted with the sentiments of the ancients on the subject of enchantments the original lines are these auraeque and venti montesque amnesque lacusque diique omnes nemorum diique omnes noctis adeste it happens however that the translation by arthur golding his work is dedicated to the earl of leicester in a long epistle in verse from berwicke apr  0      is by no means literal and shakespeare has closely followed it ye airs and winds ye elves of hills of brooks of woods alone of standing lakes and of the night approach ye everych one   i think it is unnecessary to pursue this any further especially as more powerful arguments await us  in the merchant of venice the jew as an apology for his cruelty to anthonio rehearses many sympathies and antipathies for which no reason can be rendered some love not a gaping pig  and others when a bagpipe sings in the nose cannot contain their urine for affection   this incident dr warburton supposes to be taken from a passage in scaligers exercitations against cardan narrabo tibi jocosam sympathiam reguli vasconis equitis is dum viveret audito phormingis sono urinam illico facere cogebatur and proceeds the doctor to make this jocular story still more ridiculous shakespeare i suppose translated phorminx by bagpipes  here we seem fairly caught  for scaligers work was never as the term goes done into english but luckily in an old translation from the french of peter le loier entitled a treatise of specters or strange sights visions and apparitions appearing sensibly unto men we have this identical story from scaliger and what is still more a marginal note gives us in all probability the very fact alluded to as well as the word of shakespeare another gentleman of this quality lived of late in deuon near excester who could not endure the playing on a bagpipe m bail has delineated the singular character of our fantastical author his work was originally translated by one zachary jones my edit is in  to   0  with an anonymous dedication to the king the devonshire story was therefore well known in the time of shakespeare   the passage from scaliger is likewise to be met with in the optic glass of humors written i believe by t wombwell and in several other places   we may just add as some observation has been made upon it that affection in the sense of sympathy was formerly technical and so used by lord bacon sir kenelm digby and many other writers  a single word in queen catherines character of wolsey in henry the  th is brought by the doctor as another argument for the learning of shakespeare     he was a man of an unbounded stomach ever ranking himself with princes one that by suggestion tied all the kingdom simony was fair play his own opinion was his law in the presence he would say untruths and be ever double both in his words and meaning he was never but where he meant to ruin pitiful his promises were as he then was mighty but his performance as he now is nothing of his own body he was ill and gave the clergy ill example the word suggestion says the critic is here used with great propriety and seeming knowledge of the latin tongue and he proceeds to settle the sense of it from the late roman writers and their glossers but shakespeares knowledge was from holingshed whom he follows verbatim  this cardinal was of a great stomach for he compted himself equal with princes and by crafty suggestion got into his hands innumerable treasure he forced little on simonie and was not pitiful and stood affectionate in his own opinion in open presence he would lie and seie untruth and was double both in speech and meaning he would promise much and perform little he was vicious of his body and gave the clergy evil example edit      p      perhaps after this quotation you may not think that sir thomas hanmer who reads tythd  instead of tied all the kingdom deserves quite so much of dr warburtons severity  indisputably the passage like every other in the speech is intended to express the meaning of the parallel one in the chronicle it cannot therefore be credited that any man when the original was produced should still choose to defend a cant acceptance and inform us perhaps seriously that in gaming language from i know not what practice to tie is to equal a sense of the word as far as i have yet found unknown to our old writers and if known would not surely have been used in this place by our author  but let us turn from conjecture to shakespeares authorities hall from whom the above description is copied by holingshed is very explicit in the demands of the cardinal who having insolently told the lord mayor and aldermen for sothe i think that half your substance were to little assures them by way of comfort at the end of his harangue that upon an average the tithe should be sufficient sers speak not to break that thing that is concluded for some shall not pay the tenth part and some more  and again they said the cardinal by visitacions making of abbottes probates of testamentes granting of faculties licenses and other pollyngs in his courts legantines had made his threasore egall with the kings edit      p     and      skeleton his poems are printed with the title of pithy pleasant and profitable works of master skeleton poet laureate  but says mr cibber after several other writers how or by what interest he was made laureat or whether it was a title he assumed to himself cannot be determined  this is an error pretty generally received and it may be worth our while to remove it  a facetious author says somewhere that a poet laureat in the modern idea is a gentleman who has an annual stipend for reminding us of the neva year and the birthday but formerly a poet laureat was a real university graduate skeleton wore the laurel wreath

very scholarlike in hamlet to swear the sentinels on a sword but this is for ever met with for instance in the passus primus of pierce plowman david in his days dubbed knights and did hem swear on her sword to serve truth ever and in hieronymo the common butt of our author and the wits of the time says lorenzo to pedringano swear on this cross that what thou say is true  but if i prove thee perjured and unjust this very sword whereon thou tookst thine oath shall be the worker of thy tragedy we have therefore no occasion to go with mr garrick as far as the french of brantome to illustrate this ceremony mr johnsons edit v   p     a gentleman who will be always allowed the first commentator on shakespeare when he does not carry us beyond himself  mr upton however in the next place produces a passage from henry the sixth whence he argues it to be very plain that our author had not only read ciceros offices but even more critically than many of the editors  this villain here being captain of a pinnace threatens more than bargulus the strong illyrian pirate so the wight he observes with great exultation is named by cicero in the editions of shakespeares time  bargulus illyrius latro though the modern editors have chosen to call him bardylis  and thus i found it in two mss  and thus he might have found it in two translations before shakespeare was born robert whytinton      calls him bargulus a pirate upon the sea of illiry and nicholas grimald about twenty years afterward bargulus the illyrian robber i have met with a writer who tells us that a translation of the offices was printed by caxton in the year      but such a book never existed it is a mistake for tullius of old age by john tiptoft earl of worcester   but it had been easy to have checked mr uptons exultation by observing that bargulus does not appear in the quarto  which also is the case with some fragments of latin verses in the different parts of this doubtful performance  it is scarcely worth mentioning that two or three more latin passages which are met with in our author are immediately transcribed from the story or chronicle before him thus in henry the fifth whose right to the kingdom of france is copiously demonstrated by the archbishop    there is no bar to make against your highness claim to france but this which they produce from pharamond in terram salicam mulieres ne succedant no woman shall succeed in salike land which salike land the french unjustly gloze to be the realm of france and pharamond the founder of this law and female bar yet their own authors faithfully affirm that the land salike lies in germany between the floods of sala and of elve etc archbishop chichelie says holingshed did much inueie against the surmised and false fained law salike which the frenchmen allege ever against the kings of england in bar of their just title to the crown of france the very words of that supposed law are these in terram salicam mulieres ne succedant that is to say into the salike land let not women succeed which the french glossers expound to be the realm of france and that this law was made by king pharamond whereas yet their own authors affirm that the land salike is in germany between the rivers of elbe and sala etc p      it has lately been repeated from mr guthries essay upon english tragedy that the portrait of macbeths wife is copied from buchanan whose spirit as well as words is translated into the play of shakespeare and it had signified nothing to have pored only on holingshed for facts  animus etiam per se ferox prope quotidianis conviciis uxoris quae omnium consiliorum ei erat conscia stimulabatur  this is the whole that buchanan says of the lady and truly i see no more spirit in the scotch than in the english chronicler the words of the three weird sisters also greatly encouraged him to the murder of duncan but specially his wife lay sore upon him to attempt the thing as she that was very ambitious brenning in unquenchable desire to bear the name of a queen edit      p      this part of holingshed is an abridgment of johne bellendens translation of the noble clerk hector boece imprinted at edingburgh in fol      i will give the passage as it is found there his wife impacient of lang tarry  as all women ar specially quhare they are desirus of any purpos gaif him great artation to pursew

beniuolence of fortoun howbeit sindry otheris hes assailzeit sic things before with may terribyl jeopardyis quhen they had not sic sickernes to succeid in the end of their laubouris as he had p      but we can demonstrate that shakespeare had not the story from buchanan according to him the weirdsisters salute macbeth una angusiae thanum altera moraviae tertia regem  thane of angus and of murray etc but according to holingshed immediately from bellenden as it stands in shakespeare the first of them spoke and said all hayle makbeth thane of glammis  the second of them said hayle makbeth thane of cawder but the third said all hayle makbeth that hereafter shall be king of scotland p       witch all hail macbeth hail to thee thane of glamis   witch all hail macbeth hail to thee thane of cawdor   witch all hail macbeth that shall be king hereafter here too our poet found the equivocal predictions on which his hero so fatally depended he had learned of certain wysards how that he ought to take heed of macduffe  and surely hereupon had he put macduffe to death but a certain witch whom he had in great trust had told that he should never be slain with man borne of any woman nor vanquished till the wood of bernane came to the castle of dunsinane p     and the scene between malcolm and macduff in the fourth act is almost literally taken from the chronicle  macheth was certainly one of shakespeares latest productions and it might possibly have been suggested to him by a little performance on the same subject at oxford before king james   0  i will transcribe my notice of it from wakes rex platonicus fabulae ansam dedit antiqua de regia prosapia historiola apud scotobritannos celebrata quae narrat tres olim sibyllas occurrisse duobus scotiae proceribus macbetho and banchoni and illum praedixisse regem futurum sed regem nullum geniturum hunc regem non futurum sed reges geniturum multos vaticinii veritatem rerum eventus comprobavit banchonis enim e stirpe potentissimus jacobus oriundus p     a stronger argument has been brought from the plot of hamlet dr gray and mr whalley assure us that for this shakespeare must have read saxo grammaticus in latin for no translation has been made into any modern language but the truth is he did not take it from saxo at all a novel called the history of hamblet was his original a fragment of which in black letter i have been favored with by a very curious and intelligent gentleman to whom the lovers of shakespeare will some time or other owe great obligations  it has indeed been said that if such an history exists it is almost impossible that any poet unacquainted with the latin language supposing his perceptive faculties to have been ever so acute could have caught the characteristical madness of hamlet described by saxo grammaticus falsitatis enim  hamlethus alienus haberi cupidus ita astutiam veriloquio permiscebat ut nec dictis veracitas deesset nec acuminis modus verorum judicio proderetur this is quoted as it had been before in mr guthries essay on tragedy with a small variation from the original see edit fol      p  0 so happily as it is delineated by shakespeare  very luckily our fragment gives us a part of hamlets speech to his mother which sufficiently replies to this observation  it was not without cause and just occasion that my gestures countenances and words seem to proceed from a madman and that i desire to have all men esteem me wholly deprived of sense and reasonable understanding because i am well assured that he that has made no conscience to kill his own brother accustomed to murders and allured with desire of government without control in his treasons will not spare to save himself with the like cruelty in the blood and flesh of the loins of his brother by him massacred and therefore it is better for me to feign madness then to use my right senses as nature has bestowed them upon me the bright shining clearnes thereof i am forced to hide under this shadow of dissimulation as the sun does her beams under some great cloud when the wether in summer time ouercasteth the face of a mad man serves to cover my gallant countenance and the gestures of a fool are fit for me to the end that guiding my self wisely therein i may preserve my life for the danes and the memory of my late deceased father for that the desire of revenging his death is so engraven in my heart that if i dye not shortly i hope to take such and so great vengeance that these countries shall for ever speak thereof nevertheless i must stay the time means and occasion lest by making over great have i be now the cause of of mine own sudden ruin and overthrow and by that means end before i begin to effect my hearts desire he that has to do with a wicked disloyal cruel and discourteous man must use craft and politic inventions such as a fine wit can best imagine not to discover his interprise for seeing that by force i cannot effect my desire reason allows me by dissimulation subtlety and secret practices to proceed therein  but to put the matter out of all question my communicative friend abovementioned mr capell for why should i not give myself the credit of his name has been fortunate enough to procure from the collection of the duke of newcastle a complete copy of the history of hamblet which proves to be a translation from the french of belleforest and he tells me that all the chief incidents of the play and all the capital characters are there in embryo after a rude and barbarous manner sentiments indeed there are none that shakespeare could borrow nor any expression but one which is where hamlet kills polonius behind the arras in doing which he is made to cry out as in the play a rat a rat  so much for saxo grammaticus  it is scarcely conceivable how industriously the puritanical zeal of the last age exerted itself in destroying amongst better things the innocent amusements of the former numberless tales and poems are alluded to in old books which are now perhaps no where to be found mr capell informs me and he is in these matters the most able of all men to give information that our author appears to have been beholden to some novels which he has yet only seen in french or italian but he adds to say they are not in some english dress prosaic or metrical and perhaps with circumstances nearer to his stories is what i will not take upon me to do nor indeed is it what i believe but rather the contrary and that time and accident will bring some of them to light if not all   w painter at the conclusion of the second tome of his palace of pleasure      advertises the reader because suddenly contrary to expectation this volume is risen to greater heap of leaves i do omit for this present time sundry novels of merry devise reserving the same to be joined with the rest of an other part wherein shall succeed the remnant of bandello specially such suffrable as the learned french man francois de belleforrest has selected and the choysest done in the italian some also out of erizzo ser giouanni florentine parabosco cynthio straparole sansouino and the best liked out of the queen of navarre and other authors take these in good part with those that have and shall come forth  but i am not able to find that a third tome was ever published and it is very probable that the interest of his booksellers and more especially the prevailing mode of the time might lead him afterward to print his sundry novels separately if this were the case it is no wonder that such fugitive pieces are recovered with difficulty when the two tomes which tom rawlinson would have called justa volumina are almost annihilated mr ames who searched after books of this sort with the utmost avidity most certainly had not seen them when he published his typographical antiquities as appears from his blunders about them and possibly i myself might have remained in the fame predicament had i not been favored with a copy by my generous friend mr lort  mr colman in the preface to his elegant translation of terence has offered some arguments for the learning of shakespeare which have been retailed with much confidence since the appearance of mr johnsons edition  besides the resemblance of particular passages scattered up and down in different plays it is well known that the comedy of errors is in great measure founded on the menaechmi of plautus but i do not recollect ever to have seen it observed that the disguise of the pedant in the taming of the shrew and his assuming the name and character of vincentio seem to be evidently taken from the disguise of the sycophanta in the trinummus of the said author this observation of mr colman is quoted by his very ingenious colleague mr thornton in his translation of this play who further remarks in another part of it that a passage in romeo and juliet where shakespeare speaks of the contradiction in the nature of love is very much in the manner of his author amor  mores hominum moros and morosos efficit minus placet quod suadetur quod disuadetur placet quom inopiast cupias quando ejus copiast tum non velis etc which he translates with ease and elegance   love makes a man a fool hard to be pleased  what you would persuade him to he likes not and embraces that from which you would dissuade him  what there is a lack of that will he covet  when it is in his power he will none on it  act   scene   let us now turn to the passage in shakespeare  o brawling love o loving hate  o heavy lightness serious vanity misshapen chaos of wellseeming forms feather of lead bright smoke cold fire sick health stillwaking sleep that is not what it is shakespeare i am sure in the opinion of mr thornton did not want a plautus to teach him the workings of nature nor are his parallelisms produced with any such implication but i suppose a peculiarity appears here in the manner of expression which however was extremely the humor of the age every sonetteer characterises love by contrarieties watson begins one of his canzonets love is a sour delight a sugared grief a living death an euerdying life etc turberville makes reason harangue against it in the same manner a fiery frost a flame that frozen is with ise a heavy burden light to bear a virtue fraught with vice etc immediately from the romaunt of the rose love it is an hateful pees a free acquitaunce without reles  an heavy burden light to bear a wicked wawe away to wear and health full of malady and charity full of envy  a laughter that is weping aie rest that trauaileth night and day etc this kind of antithesis was very much the taste of the provencal and italian poets perhaps it might be hinted by the ode of sappho preserved by longinus petrarch is full of it pace non trovo and non ho da far guerra et temo and spero and ardo and son un ghiaccio et volo sopral cielo and ghiaccio in terra et nulla stringo and tuttol mondo abbraccio etc sonetto  0  sir thomas wyat gives a translation of this sonnet without any notice of the original under the title of description of the contrarious passions in a lover amongst the songs and sonettes by the earl of surrey and others      and there is a quotation from the eunuch of terence also so familiarly introduced into the dialogue of the taming of the shrew that i think it puts the question of shakespeares having read the roman comic poets in the original language out of all doubt redime te captum quam queas minimo  with respect to resemblances i shall not trouble you any further  that the comedy of errors is founded on the menaechmi it is notorious nor is it less so that a translation of it by w w perhaps william warner the author of albions england was extant in the time of shakespeare it was published in  to      the printer of langbaine p     has accidently given the date      which has been copied implicitly by gildon theobald cook and several others warner is now almost forgotten yet the old critics esteemed him one of our chief heroical makers  meres informs us that he had heard him termed of the best wits of both our universities our english homer though mr upton and some other advocates for his learning have cautiously dropped the mention of it besides this if indeed it were different in the gesta grayorum the christmas revels of the graysinn gentlemen      a comedy of errors like to plautus his menechmus was played by the players and the same has been suspected to be the subject of the goodly comedy of plautus acted at greenwich before the king and queen in    0 as we learn from hall and holingshed  riccoboni highly compliments the english on opening their stage so well but unfortunately cavendish in his life of wolsey calls it an excellent interlude in latin about the same time it was exhibited in german at nuremburgh by the celebrated hanssach the shoemaker  but a character in the taming of the shrew is borrowed from the trinummus and no translation of that was extant  mr colman indeed has been better employed but if he had met with an old comedy called supposes translated from ariosto by george gascoigne his works were first collected under the singular title of a hundredth sundry flowers bound up in one small poesy gathered partly by translation in the fine outlandish gardins of euripides ovid petrarke ariosto and others and partly by invention out of our own fruitful orchardes in england yelding sundry sweet savors of tragical comical and moral discourses both pleasant and profitable to the well smellyng noses of learned readers black letter  to no date he certainly would not have appealed to plautus thence shakespeare borrowed this part of the plot as well as some of the phraseology though theobald pronounces it his own invention there likewise he found the quaint name of petruchio my young master and his man exchange habits and characters and persuade a scenaese as he is called to personate the father exactly as in the taming of the shrew by the pretended danger of his coming from sienna to ferrara contrary to the order of the government  still shakespeare quotes a line from the eunuch of terence by memory too and what is more purposely alters it in order to bring the sense within the compass of one line  this remark was previous to mr johnsons or indisputably it would not have been made at all  our author had this line from lilly which i mention that it may not be brought as an argument of his learning  but how cries an unprovoked antagonist can you take upon you to say that he had it from lilly and not from terence w kenricks review of dr johnsons edit of shakespeare       vo p  0  i will answer for mr johnson who is above answering for himself  because it is quoted as it appears in the grammarian and not as it appears in the poet  and thus we have done with the purposed alteration udall likewise in his flowers for latin speaking gathered out of terence    0 reduces the passage to a single line and subjoins a translation  we have hitherto supposed shakespeare the author of the taming of the shrew but his property in it is extremely disputable i will give you my opinion and the reasons on which it is founded i suppose then the present play not originally the work of shakespeare but restored by him to the stage with the whole induction of the tinker and some other occasional improvements especially in the character of petruchio it is very obvious that the induction and the play were either the works of different hands or written at a great interval of time the former is in our authors best manner and the greater part of the latter in his worst or even below it dr warburton declares it to be certainly spurious and without doubt supposing it to have been written by shakespeare it must have been one of his earliest productions yet it is not mentioned in the list of his works by meres in       i have met with a facetious piece of sir john harrington printed in      and possibly there may be an earlier edition called the metamorphosis of ajax where i suspect an allusion to the old play read the book of taming a shrew which has made a number of us so perfect that now every one can rule a shrew in our country save he that has her  i am aware a modern linguist may object that the word book does not at present seem dramatick but it was once almost technically so gosson in his school of abuse containing a pleasant inuective against poets pipers players jesters and such like caterpillars of a commonwealth      mentions two prose books played at the belsauage and hearne tells us in a note at the end of william of worcester that he had seen a ms in the nature of a play or interlude entitled the book of sir thomas moore i know indeed there is extant a very old poem in black letter to which it might have been supposed sir john harrington alluded had he not spoken of the discovery as a new one and recommended it as worthy the notice of his countrymen i am persuaded the method in the old bard will not be thought either at the end of the sixth volume of lelands itinerary we are favored by mr hearne with a macaronic poem on a battle at oxford between the scholars and the townsmen on a line of which invadunt aulas bycheson cum forth geminantes our commentator very wisely and gravely remarks bycheson id est son of a byche ut e codice rawlinsoniano edidi eo nempe modo quo et olim whoreson dixerunt pro son of a whore exempla habemus cum alibi tum in libello quodam lepido and antiquo inter codices seldenianos in bibl bodl qui inscribitur the wife lapped in morels skyn or the taming of a shrew ubi page    sic legimus they wrestled together thus they two so long that the clothes asunder went and to the ground he threw her tho that clean from the back her smock he rent in every hand a rod he gate and laid upon her a right good pace asking of her what game was that and she cried out horeson alas alas et page    come down now in this seller so deep and morels skin there shall you see with many a rod that has made me to weep when the blood ran down fast by my knee the mother this beheld and cried out alas and ran out of the seller as she had been wood she came to the table where the company was and said out horeson i will see thy heart blood    and in fact there is such an old anonymous play in mr popes list a pleasant conceited history called the taming of a shrew  sundry times acted by the earl of pembroke his servants which seems to have been republished by the remains of that company in   0  when shakespeares copy appeared at the blackfriars or the globe  nor let this seem derogatory from the character of our poet there is no reason to believe that he wanted to claim the play as his own it was not even printed till some years after his death but he merely revived it on his stage as a manager  ravenscroft assures us that this was really the case with titus andronicus which it may be observed has not shakespeares name on the title page of the only edition published in his lifetime indeed from every internal mark i have not the least doubt but this horrible piece was originally written by the author of the lines thrown into the mouth of the player in hamlet and of the tragedy of locrine which likewise from some assistance perhaps given to his friend has been unjustly and ignorantly charged upon shakespeare  but the sheetanchor holds fast shakespeare himself has left some translations from ovid the epistles says one of paris and helen give a sufficient proof of his acquaintance with that poet and it may be concluded says another that he was a competent judge of other authors who wrote in the same language  this has been the universal cry from mr pope himself to the critics of yesterday possibly however the gentlemen will hesitate a moment if we tell them that shakespeare was not the author of these translations let them turn to a forgotten book by thomas heywood called britains troy printed by w jaggard in   0  fol and they will find these identical epistles which being so pertinent to our history says heywood i thought necessary to translate  how then came they ascribed to shakespeare we will tell them that likewise the same voluminous writer published an apology for actors  to      and in an appendix directed to his new printer nic oaks he accuses his old one jaggard of taking the two epistles of paris to helen and helen to paris and printing them in a less volume under the name of another  but he was much offended with master jaggard that altogether unknown to him he had presumed to make so bold with his name it may seem little matter of wonder that the name of shakespeare should be borrowed for the benefit of the bookseller and by the way as probably for a play as a poem but modern critics may be surprised perhaps at the complaint of john hall that certain chapters of the proverbes translated by him into english meter    0 had before been untruely entitled to be the doyngs of master thomas sternhold in the same work of heywood are all the other translations which have been printed in the modern editions of the poems of shakespeare  you now hope for land we have seen through little matters but what must be done with a whole book  in      was reprinted a compendious or brief examination of certain ordinary complaints of diverse of our countrymen in these our days which although they are in some part unjust and frivolous yet are they all by way of dialogue thoroughly debated and discussed by william shakespeare gentleman  vo  this extraordinary piece was originally published in  to      and dedicated by the author to the most virtuous and learned lady his most dear and sovereign princess elizabeth being enforced by her majestys late and singular clemency in pardoning certain his unduetifull misdemeanour and by the modern editors to the late king as a treatise composed by the most extensive and fertile genius that ever any age or nation produced  here we join issue with the writers of that excellent though very unequal work the biographia britannica i must however correct a remark in the life of spenser which is impotently levelled at the first critics of the age it is observed from the correspondence of spenser and gabriel harvey that the plan of the fairy queen was laid and part of it executed in    0 three years before the gierusalemme liberata was printed hence appears the impertinence of all the apologies for his choice of ariostos manner in preference to tassos  but the fact is not true with respect to tasso manso and niceron inform us that his poem was published though imperfectly in      and i myself can assure the biographer that i have met with at least six other editions preceding his date for it is first publication i suspect that baillet is accountable for this mistake who in the jugemens des savans tom   p     mentions no edition previous to the  to venice       it is a question of long standing whether a part of the fairy queen has been lost or whether the work was left unfinished which may effectually be answered by a single quotation william brown published some poems in fol      under the name of britannias pastorals esteemed then says wood to be written in a sublime strain and for subject amorous and very pleasing  in one of which book   song   he thus speaks of spenser he sung the heroicke knights of faiery land in lines so elegant of such command that had the thracian played but half so well he had not left eurydice in hell but ere he ended his melodious song an host of angels flew the clouds among and rapt this swan from his attentive mates to make him one of their associates in heavens fair quire where now he sings the praise of him that is the first and last of days   it appears that brown was intimate with drayton jonson and seldom by their poems prefixed to his book he had therefore good opportunities of being acquainted with the fact abovementioned many of his poems remain in ms we have in our library at emmanuel a masque of his presented at the inner temple jan         the subject is the story of ulysses and circe   if say they this piece could be written by our poet it would be absolutely decisive in the dispute about his learning for many quotations appear in it from the greek and latin classicks  the concurring circumstances of the name and the misdemeanor which is supposed to be the old story of deerstealing seem fairly to challenge our poet for the author but they hesitate  his claim may appear to be confuted by the date      when shakespeare was only seventeen and the long experience which the writer talks of  but i will not keep you in suspense the book was not written by shakespeare  strype in his annals calls the author some learned man and this gave me the first suspicion i knew very well that honest john to use the language of sir thomas bodley did not waste his time with such baggage books as plays and poems yet i must suppose that he had heard of the name of shakespeare after a while i met with the original edition here in the title page and at the end of the dedication appear only the initials w s gent and presently i was informed by anthony wood that the book in question was written not by william shakespeare but by william stafford gentleman fasti  d edit v   0   it will be seen on turning to the former edition that the latter part of the paragraph belongs to another stafford  i have since observed that wood is not the first who has given us the true author of the pamphlet which at once accounted for the misdemeanour in the dedication for stafford had been concerned at that time and was indeed afterward as camden and the other annalists inform us with some of the conspirators against elizabeth which he properly calls his unduetifull behavior  i hope by this time that any one open to conviction may be nearly satisfied and i will promise to give you on this head very little more trouble  the justly celebrated mr warton has favored us in his life of dr bathurst with some hearsay particulars concerning shakespeare from the papers of aubrey which had been in the hands of wood and i ought not to suppress them as the last seems to make against my doctrine they came originally i find on consulting the ms from one mr beeston and i am sure mr warton whom i have the honor to call my friend and an associate in the question will be in no pain about their credit  william shakespeares father was a butcher  while he was a boy be exercised his fathers trade but when he killed a calf he would do it in a high style and make a speech this william being inclined naturally to poetry and acting came to london i guess about eighteen and was an actor in one of the playhouses and did act exceedingly well he began early to make essays in dramatique poetry  the humor of the constable in the midsummer nights dream he happened to take at crendon it was observed in the former edition that this place is not met with in spelmans villare or in adams index nor it might have been added in the first and the last performance of this sort speeds tables and whatleys gazetteer perhaps however it may be meant under the name of crandon  but the inquiry is of no importance  it should i think be written credendon though better antiquaries than aubrey have acquiesced in the vulgar corruption in bucks  i think i have been told that he left near three hundred pounds to a sister  he understood latin pretty well for he had been in his younger years a schoolmaster in the country  i will be short in my animadversions and take them in their order  the account of the trade of the family is not only contrary to all other tradition but as it may seem to the instrument from the heralds office so frequently reprinted  shakespeare most certainly went to london and commenced actor through necessity not natural inclination  nor have we any reason to suppose that he did act exceedingly well row tells us from the information of betterton who was inquisitive into this point and had very early opportunities of inquiry from sir w davenant that he was no extraordinary actor and that the top of his performance was the ghost in his own hamlet yet this chef d oeuvre did not please i will give you an original stroke at it dr lodge who was for ever pestering the town with pamphlets published in the year      wits misery and the worlds madness discovering the devils incarnat of this age  to one of these devils is hatevirtue or sorrow for another mans good success who says the doctor is a foul lubber and looks as pale as the visard of the ghost which cried so miserably at the theater like an oisterwife hamlet revenge thus you see mr holts supposed proof in the appendix to the late edition that hamlet was written after      or perhaps   0  will by no means hold good whatever might be the case of the particular passage on which it is founded  nor does it appear that shakespeare did begin early to make essays in dramatique poetry the arraignment of paris      which has so often been ascribed to him on the credit of kirkman and winstanley these people who were the curls of the last age ascribe likewise to our author those miserable performances mucidorus and the merry devil of edmonton was written by george peele and shakespeare is not met with even as an assistant till at least seven years afterward mr pope asserts the troublesome reign of king john in   parts      to have been written by shakespeare and rowley  which edition is a mere copy of another in black letter      but i find his assertion is somewhat to be doubted for the old edition has no name of author at all and that of      the initials only w sh in the title page  nash in his epistle to the gentlemen students of both universities prefixed to greenes arcadia  to black letter recommends his friend peele as the chief supporter of pleasance now living the atlas of poetry and primus verborum artifex whose first increase the arraignment of paris might plead to their opinions his pregnant dexterity of wit and manifold variety of invention peele seems to have been taken into the patronage of the earl of northumberland about      to whom he dedicates in that year the honor ofthe garter a poem gratulatorie  the firstling consecrated to his noble name  he was esteemed says anthony wood a most noted poet      but when or where he died i cannot tell for so it is and always has been that most poets die poor and consequently obscurely and a hard matter it is to trace them to their graves claruit      ath oxon vol   p  00  we had lately in a periodical pamphlet called the theatrical review a very curious letter under the name of george peele to one master henry mark relative to a dispute between shakespeare and alleyn which was compromised by ben jonson  i never longed for thy company more than last night we were all very merry at the globe when ned alleyn did not scruple to affirm pleasauntly to thy friend will that he had stolen his speech about the excellency of acting in hamlet his tragedye from conversaytions manifold which had passed between them and opinions gyven by alleyn touching that subjecte shakespeare did not take this talk in good sort but jonson did put an end to the strife with wittielie saying this affair needs no contentione you stole it from ned no doubt do not marvel have you not seen him act times out of number  this is pretended to be printed from the original ms dated   00 which agrees well enough with woods claruit but unluckily peele was dead at least two years before as anacreon died by the pot says meres so george peele by the pox wits treasury      p         in the next place unfortunately there is neither such a character as a constable in the midsummer nights dream nor was the three hundred pounds legacy to a sister but a daughter  and to close the whole it is not possible according to aubrey himself that shakespeare could have been some years a schoolmaster in the country on which circumstance only the supposition of his learning is professedly founded he was not surely very young when he was employed to kill calves and he commenced player about eighteen  the truth is that he left his father for a wife a year sooner and had at least two children born at stratford before he retired from thence to london it is therefore sufficiently clear that poor anthony had too much reason for his character of aubrey you will find it in his own account of his life published by hearne which i would earnestly recommend to any hypochondriack  a pretender to antiquities roving magotieheaded and sometimes little better than crased and being exceedingly credulous would stuff his many letters sent to a w with folliries and misinformations p      thus much for the learning of shakespeare with respect to the ancient languages indulge me with an observation or two on his supposed knowledge of the modern ones and i will promise to release you  it is evident we have been told that he was not unacquainted with the italian but let us inquire into the evidence  certainly some italian words and phrases appear in the works of shakespeare yet if we had nothing else to observe their orthography might lead us to suspect them to be not of the writers importation but we can go further and prove this  when pistol chears up himself with ends of verse he is only a copy of hanniball gonsaga who ranted on yielding himself a prisoner to an english captain in the low countries as you may read in an old collection of tales called wits fits and fancies by one anthony copley  to black letter it seems to have had many editions perhaps the last was in       the first piece of this sort that i have met with was printed

lived about the court p      i fancy you will be satisfied with one more instance  baccare you are mavelous forward quoth gremio to petruchio in the taming of the shrew  but not so forward says mr theobald as our editors are indolent this is a stupid corruption of the press that none of them have dived into we must read baccalare as mr warburton acutely observed to me by which the italians mean thou ignorant presumptuous man  properly indeed adds mr heath a graduated scholar but ironically and sarcastically a pretender to scholarship  this is admitted by the editors and critics of every denomination yet the word is neither wrong nor italian it was an old proverbial one used frequently by john heywood who has made what he pleases to call epigrams upon it  take two of them such as they are backare quoth mortimer to his sow went that sow back at that biddyng trow you backare quoth mortimer to his sow se mortimers sow speakth as good latin as he howel takes this from heywood in his old sawes and adages and philpot introduces it into the proverbs collected by camden  we have but few observations concerning shakespeares knowledge of the spanish tongue dr gray indeed is willing to suppose that the plot of romeo and juliet may be borrowed from a comedy of lopes de vega but the spaniard who was certainly acquainted with bandello has not only changed the catastrophe but the names of the characters neither romeo nor juliet neither montague nor capulet appears in this performance and how came they to the knowledge of shakespeare  nothing is more certain than that he chiefly followed the translation by painter from the french of boisteau and hence arise the deviations from bandellos original italian it is remarked that paris though in one place called earl is most commonly styled the county in this play shakespeare seems to have preferred for some reason or other the italian conte to our count  perhaps he took it from the old english novel from which he is said to have taken his plot  he certainly did so paris is there first styled a young earl and afterward count countee and county according to the unsettled orthography of the time  the word however is frequently met with in other writers particularly in fairfax as when a captain does besiege some hold set in a marish or high on a hill and tries ways and wiles a thousand fold to bring the piece subjected to his will so fared the county with the pagan bold etc godfrey of bulloigne book   st  0 fairfax says mr hume has translated tasso with an elegance and ease and at the same time with an exactness which for that age are surprising each line in the original is faithfully rendered by a correspondent line in the translation the former part of this character is extremely true but the latter not quite so in the book abovequoted tasso and fairfax do not even agree in the number of stanzas   it seems however from a passage in amess typographical antiquities that painter was not the only translator of this popular story and it is possible therefore that shakespeare might have other assistance  in the induction to the taming of the shrew the tinker attempts to talk spanish and consequently the author himself was acquainted with it paucus pallabris let the world slide sessa but this is a burlesque on hieronymo the piece of bombast that i have mentioned to you before what new device have they devised trow pocas pallabras etc    mr whalley tells us the author of this piece has the happiness to be at this time unknown the remembrance of him having perished with himself philips and others ascribe it to one william smith but i take this opportunity of informing him that it was written by thomas kyd if he will accept the authority of his contemporary heywood  more has been said concerning shakespeares acquaintance with the french language in the play of henry the fifth we have a whole scene in it and in other places it occurs familiarly in the dialogue  we may observe in general that the early editions have not half the quantity and every sentence or rather every word most ridiculously blundered these for several reasons could not possibly be published by the author every writer on shakespeare has expressed his astonishment that his author was not solicitous to secure his fame by a correct edition of his performances this matter is not understood when a poet was connected with a particular playhouse he constantly sold his works to the company and it was their interest to keep them from a number of rivals a favorite piece as heywood informs us only got into print when it was copied by the ear for a double sale would bring on a supicion of honesty shakespeare therefore himself published nothing in the drama when he left the stage his copies remained with his fellowmanagers heminge and condell who at their own retirement about seven years after the death of the author gave the world the edition now known by the name of the first folio and call the previous publications stolen and surreptitious maimed and deformed by the frauds and stealths of injurious impostors but this was printed from the playhouse copies which in a series of years had been frequently altered through convenience caprice or ignorance we have a sufficient instance of the liberties taken by the actors in an old pamphlet by nash called lenten stuff with the praise of the red herring  to      where he assures us that in a play of his called the isle of dogs four acts without his consent or the least guess of his drift or scope were supplied by the players  this however was not his first quarrel with them in the epistle prefixed to greenes arcadia which i have quoted before tom has a lash at some vain glorious tragedians and very plainly at shakespeare in particular which will serve for an answer to an observation of mr pope that had almost been forgotten it was thought a praise to shakespeare that he scarce ever blotted a line  i believe the common opinion of his want of learning proceeded from no better ground this too might be thought a praise by some  but hear nash who was far from praising i leave all these to the mercy of their mother tongue that feed on naught but the crumbs that fall from the translators trencher  that could scarcely latinize their neck verse if they should have need yet english seneca read by candlelight yields many good sentences  he will afford you whole hamlets i should say handfuls of tragical speeches  i cannot determine exactly when this epistle was first published but i fancy it will carry the original hamlet somewhat further back than we have hitherto done and it may be observed that the oldest copy now extant is said to be enlarged to almost as much again as it was gabriel harvey printed at the end of the year      four letters and certain sonnetts especially touching robert green in one of which his arcadia is mentioned now nashs epistle must have been previous to these as gabriel is quoted in it with applause and the four letters were the beginning of a quarrel nash replied in strange news of the intercepting certain letters and a convoy of verses as they were going privilie to victual the low countries      harvey rejoined the same year in pierces supererogation or a new praise of the old ass and nash again in have with you to saffronwalden or gabriell harveys hunt is up containing a full answer to the eldest son of the haltermaker       dr lodge calls nash our true english aretine and john tailor in his kicksey winsey or a lerry cometwang even makes an oath by sweet satyricke nash his urne  he died before   0  as appears from an old comedy called the return from parnassus   and it is extremely probable that the french ribaldry was at first inserted by a different hand as the many additions most certainly were after he had left the stage  indeed every friend to his memory will not easily believe that he was acquainted with the scene between catharine and the old gentlewoman or surely he would not have admitted such obscenity and nonsense  mr hawkins in the appendix to mr johnsons edition has an ingenious observation to prove that shakespeare supposing the french to be his had very little knowledge of the language  estil impossible deschapper la force de ton bras says a frenchman  brass cur replies pistol  almost any one knows that the french word bras is pronounced brau and what resemblance of sound does this bear to brass   mr johnson makes a doubt whether the pronunciation of the french language may not be changed since shakespeares time if not says he it may be suspected that some other man wrote the french scenes but this does not appear to be the case at least in this termination from the rules of the grammarians or the practice of the poets i am certain of the former from the french alphabeth of de la mothe land       vo and the orthoepia gallica of john eliot land       to eliot is almost the only witty grammarian that i have had the fortune to meet with in his epistle prefatory to the gentle doctors of gaul he cries out for persecution very like jack in that most poignant of satires the tale of a tub i pray you be ready quickly to cavil at my book i beseech you heartily calumniate my doings with speed i request you humbly control my method as soon as you may i earnestly entreat you hiss at my inventions etc and of the latter from the rhymes of marot ronsard and du bartas  connections of this kind were very common shakespeare himself assisted ben jonson in his sejanus as it was originally written and fletcher in his two noble kinsmen  but what if the french scene were occasionally introduced into every play on this subject and perhaps there were more than one before our poets  in pierce penilesse his supplication to the devil  to      which it seems from the epistle to the printer was not the first edition the author nash exclaims what a glorious thing it is to have henry the fifth represented on the stage leading the french king prisoner and forcing both him and the dolphin to swear fealty  and it appears from the jests of the famous comedian tarlton  to      that he had been particularly celebrated in the part of the clown in henry the fifth but no such character exists in the play of shakespeare  henry the sixth has ever been doubted and a passage in the abovequoted piece of nash may give us reason to believe it was previous to our author how would it have joyed brave talbot the terror of the french to think that after he had lain two hundred year in his toomb he should triumph again on the stage and have his bones new embalmed with the tears of ten thousand spectators at least at several times who in the tragedian that represents his person imagine they behold him fresh bleeding  i have no doubt but henry the sixth had the same author with edward the third which has been recovered to the world in mr capells prolusions  it has been observed that the giant of rabelais is sometimes alluded to by shakespeare and in his time no translation was extant  but the story was in every ones hand  in a letter by one laneham or langham for the name is written differently it is indeed of no importance but i suspect the former to be right as i find it corrupted afterward to lanam and lanum concerning the entertainment at killingwoorth castle printed      we have a list of the vulgar romances of the age king arthurz book huon of burdeaus friar rous howleglass and gargantua meres this author by a pleasant mistake in some sensible conjectures on shakespeare lately printed at oxford is quoted by the name of master perhaps the title page was imperfect it runs thus palladis tamia wits treasury being the second part of wits commonwealth by francis meres master of arts of both universities  i am glad out of gratitude to this man who has been of frequent service to me that i am enabled to perfect woods account of him from the assistance of our masters very accurate list of graduates which it would do honor to the university to print at the public expense and the kind information of a friend from the register of his parish   he was originally of pembrokehall b a in      and m a      about   0  he became rector of wing in rutland and died there      in the   st year of his age   mentions him as equally hurtful to young minds with the four sons of aymon and the seven champions and john tailor has him likewise in his catalogue of authors prefixed to sir gregory nonsense i have quoted many pieces of john tailor but it was impossible to give their original dates he may be traced as an author for more than half a century his works were collected in folio    0 but many were printed afterward i will mention one for the humor of the title drink and welcome or the famous history of the most part of drinks in use in great britain and ireland with an especial declaration of the potency virtue and operation of our english ale with a description of all sorts of waters from the ocean sea to the tears of a woman  to       in wits merriment or lusty drollery      we have an epitaph on john tailor who was born in the city of gloucester and died in phoenix alley in the    year of his age you may find him if the worms have not devoured him in covent garden churchyard p   0  he died about two years before   but to come to a conclusion i will give you an irrefragable argument that shakespeare did not understand two very common words in the french and latin languages  according to the articles of agreement between the conqueror henry and the king of france the latter was to style the former in the corrected french of the modern editions nostre tres cher filz henry roy d angleterre and in latin praeclarissimus filius etc what says dr warburton is tres cher in french praeclarissimus in latin we should read praecarissimus  this appears to be exceedingly true but how came the blunder it is a typographical one in holingshed which shakespeare copied but must indisputably have corrected had he been acquainted with the languages  our said father during his life shall name call and write us in french in this manner nostre tres chier filz henry roy d engleterre  and in latin in this manner praeclarissimus filius noster edit      p      to corroborate this instance let me observe to you though it be nothing further to the purpose that another error of the same kind has been the source of a mistake in an historical passage of our author which has ridiculously troubled the critics  richard the third some inquiry has been made for the first performers of the capital characters in shakespeare  we learn that burbage the alter roscius of camden was the original richard from a passage in the poems of bishop corbet who introduces his host at bosworth describing the battle but when he would have said king richard died and called a horse a horse he burbage cried   the play on this subject mentioned by sir john harrington in his apology for poetry      and sometimes mistaken for shakespeares was a latin one written by dr leg and acted at st johns in our university some years before      the date of the copy in the museum this appears from a better ms in our library at emmanuel with the names of the original performers  it is evident from a passage in camdens annals that there was an old play likewise on the subject of richard the second but i know not in what language sir gelley merrick who was concerned in the harebrained business of the earl of essex and was hanged for it with the ingenious cuffe in   0  is accused amongst other things quod exoletam tragoediam de tragica abdicatione regis ricardi secundi in publico theatro coram conjuratis data pecunia agi curasset   harangues his army before the battle of bosworth remember whom ye are to cope withal a sort of vagabonds of rascals runaways  and who does lead them but a paltry fellow long kept in britain at our mothers cost a milksop etc    our mother mr theobald perceives to be wrong and henry was somewhere secreted on the continent he reads therefore and all the editors after him long kept in bretague at his mothers cost  but give me leave to transcribe a few more lines from holingshed and you will find at once that shakespeare had been there before me  ye see further how a company of traitors thieves outlaws and runnagates be aiders and partakers of his feat and enterprise  and to begin with the earl of richmond captain of this rebellion he is a welsh milksop  brought up by my moothers means and mine like a captive in a close cage in the court of francis duke of britain p      holingshed copies this verbatim from his brother chronicler hall edit      fol    but his printer has given us by accident the word moother instead of brother as it is in the original and ought to be in shakespeare i cannot take my leave of holingshed without clearing up a difficulty which has puzzled his biographers nicholson and other writers have supposed him a clergyman tanner goes further and tells us that he was educated at cambridge and actually took the degree of m a in       yet it appears by his will printed by hearne that at the end of life he was only a steward or a servant in some capacity or other to thomas burdett esquire of bromcote in warwickshire  these things dr campbell could not reconcile the truth is we have no claim to the education of the chronicler the m a in      was not raphael but one ottiwell holingshed who was afterward named by the founder one of the first fellows of trinity college   i hope my good friend you have by this time acquitted our great poet of all piratical depredations on the ancients and are ready to receive my conclusion  he remembered perhaps enough of his schoolboy learning to put the hig hag hog into the mouth of sir hugh evans and might pick up in the writers of the time ascham in the epistle prefixed to his toxophilus      observes of them that many english writers usinge strange words as lattine french and italian do make all things dark and hard ones says he i communed with a man which reasoned the english tongue to be enriched and increased thereby saying who will not praise that feast where a man shall drink at a dinner both wine ale and beer truly quoth i they be al good every one taken by himself alone but if you put malmesye and sack red wine and white ale and beer and al in one pot you shall make a drink neither easy to be known nor yet wholesome for the body or the course of his conversation a familiar phrase or two of french or italian but his studies were most demonstratively confined to nature and his own language  in the course of this disquisition you have often smiled at all such reading as was never read and possibly i may have indulged it too far but it is the reading necessary for a comment on shakespeare those who apply solely to the ancients for this purpose may with equal wisdom study the talmud for an exposition of tristram shandy nothing but an intimate acquaintance with the writers of the time who are frequently of no other value can point out his allusions and ascertain his phraseology the reformers of his text are for ever equally positive and equally wrong the cant of the age a provincial expression an obscure proverb an obsolete custom a hint at a person or a fact no longer remembered has continually defeated the best of our guessers you must not suppose me to speak at random when i assure you that from some forgotten book or other i can demonstrate this to you in many hundred places and i almost wish that i had not been persuaded into a different employment  though i have as much of the natale solum about me as any man whatsoever yet i own the primrose path is still more pleasing than the fosse or the watling street age cannot wither it nor custom stale it is infinite variety  and when i am fairly rid of the dust of topographical antiquity which has continued much longer about me than i expected you may very probably be troubled again with the ever fruitful subject of shakespeare and his commentators  finis
