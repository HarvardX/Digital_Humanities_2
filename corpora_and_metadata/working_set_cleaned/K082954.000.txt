observations on some of the probable effects of mr gilberts bill to which are added remarks deduced from dr prices account of the national debt  by the reverend mr brand m a  london printed for j robson and co new bond street  mdcclxxvi  observations etc the defects of our system of poor laws have lately engaged the attention of the public and a variety of eminent writers upon the subject have discussed several parts of it with great ability my object is to add some supplemental remarks to what they have laid down which i think may tend to strengthen and confirm the opinions of those who have recommended houses of industry  the most eligible method of drawing up a general plan for the support of the poor would possibly be to mark off in some of the best treatises which have been published upon the subject such principles and practical observation as appear most firmly founded upon political reason or drawn from facts properly stated these detached materials may be reduced to their general heads and the vacancies in the outline easily marked in an architect from a few vestiges and ruined members of columns is able with the greatest degree of certainty to make a drawing of the building in all its original magnificence the happiness of a great people is certainly worthy the same enlightened and persevering attention which has frequently been misapplied to restore some gothic design of classical antiquity  but it is by no means my intention to pursue the subject so extensively the only points i mean to go into are the state of the present burden and charge of the poors rate the different expense of maintaining the poor in the present mode and in incorporated districts and the probable amount of the advantage of adopting mr gilberts plan with such alterations as may be found necessary i shall endeavor likewise to add something to what has been said upon the advantages of a better and more regular education for the poor and how far such incorporations are favorable or adverse to the spirit of the constitution  i shall first consider the charge of the rate laying down first this distinction that by charge we are to understand the sum paid be the value of money what it will by burden the proportion of that sum to our ability to pay it mr potter in a very ingenious pamphlet published last year upon this subject states the total amount of the poors rate at three millions the advance in nine years at  00000 during that period the price of provisions has increased in a geometrical progression the increment of the poor rates has at last followed the same law  apendix note a b two positions which will be demonstrated in the appendix the rate of the  th year will be       0l and the augmentation of perpetual expense the ninth  0   0 and the value of this perpetuity at   per cent   0     the increased charge therefore to the public is equal to that sum added to the funded debt at   per cent this augmentation gives the annual increase of the rate   0  per cent and by the table in the appendix this rate of increase appears very moderate  taking the surplus of the public revenue which may in time of peace be applied to the discharge of the debt at  00000l a sum it was supposed to produce before the annual payment of  00000 from the east india company was withdrawn the value of the perpetuity   0     exceeds that sum in proportion as   to    hence the poor rate appears to increase the national expense three times as fast as that surplus can diminish it uniformly applied to the discharge of that debt in the time of peace supposing it to increase every year even with the same celerity as the poor rate  it may be worth while in order to point out the true extent of a charge thus increasing to enquire what sum of money the public ought to pay down to be delivered from it for ever  divide  00 by the difference of the rate of increase and the rate of interest uniformly taken at   the quotient will be the number of years purchase of the original sum which will equal the required payment appendix note d   case the  st if we suppose the rate to continue perpetually the same or without increase it will be worth    years purchase let the present amount be   00000 only the purchase money will be     0000  case the  d let the annual increment be   or about the increase of the price of provisions the number of years purchase will then amount to  0 and the sum     millions very nearly equal the funded debt  case the  d the least rate of advance given in the tables is     per cent and to be relieved from a charge perpetually increasing in that ratio the public ought to give  00  years purchase or a sum exceeding     millions  case the  th but the increase of charge exceeds the rate of interest if it were barely equal the former subtracted from the latter leaves no remainder and the number of years purchase becomes  000 or infinite  the truth of this last conclusion may be easily proved in the following manner the rate at the end of the first year becomes by the supposition  0   the present value of which is  00 at the end of the second year it is increased to  0    the present value of which is  00 rate of the third year   0   the fourth       the present value of each of which is likewise  00 so that to be discharged from the next years rate we must pay down a sum equal to the present or  00l for the next two  00 the three first years  00 or so many years purchase of the present value of the rate as we mean to be discharged from therefore to be discharged from all future expense we must pay down a sum equal to the present rate multiplied by the number of years to the end of time or infinity  how far the poor rate has been an increasing burden is the next particular which offers itself to our consideration  as specie represents some real value in goods and commodities the burden of a rate must be in proportion to that real value which the specie it raises represents if at one time  00l represent or will purchase twice the real value in goods and necessaries which it does at another a man who pays  0l to a rate at the former period has double the real value taken from him which he would have in the latter or the burden is double upon him in general the burden is always to be estimated by the value of money and the sum conjointly or their product when the value of money augments the burden increases with it when it diminishes it decreases in the same proportion  having the rate of increase of the charge given to determne that of the burden we must endeavor to discover the annual decrement of the value of money  the real value of a sum of money at different periods is proportioned to the number of people it will maintain with the necessaries of life  the price of wheat and the interest of money have been both considered as the standard of this value the former being perhaps the greatest article of necessary consumption and much affecting the price of the rest will have a great effect upon it but not one can rise or fall without influencing it in some measure  the rate of interest is a standard still more inadequate this rate has continued the same for some years last past if particular circumstances have not rather contributed to raise it  00l at the end of the year produces  l  0s ten years after it produces the same sum but will that sum at those different periods represent or equal the same real value of the necessaries of life to prove  00l of the same value at the one period as at the other we must make this assumption that  l  0s at the end is equal in value or represents the same real value with  l  0s at the beginning the very principle wanted to be proved  to determine the value of money we must find the quantity of commodities in kind which a certain number of men consume in a year and multiply each separate quantity by its price in the given year adding these together for a total repeat the same operation for any other year and the two sums will be reciprocally as the value of money at those periods or the greater sum will represent the value of money at the cheaper period the less at the dearer  but if we want to enquire into the law of increase or decrease more of these periods must be taken and the hypothesis tried by the totals they exhibit  the account of the state of the house of industry at nacton drawn up by order of the house of commons contains all the different prices of wheat beef malt and cheese for    years and the variations for every year carefully marked i reduced the different prices of each article in every year to a mean and from thence formed the four tables given in the appendix  this account begins with the year from easter      to    the average of the first four years will give the mean price of wheat michaelmas    the following four michaelmas    the succeeding five at easter    and the last four michaelmas    this operation is to be repeated with the other three tables and we may thus obtain a correct state of the advance upon each of these commodities for thirteen years  to ascertain the quantities consumed in kind of each of these particulars i copied an account of the consumption of eight weeks from the books of the house of industry at heckingham this gives us the total consumption of  0   persons for one week from whence we easily deduce that of ten persons for a year multiplying the quantity of every article of this result by its price in each of the four years above mentioned the sum of the prices of all the articles in each year will be as the value of money that year if those articles had comprised all the necessaries of life  to insert the rest i computed from the best information i could procure and principally derived from the same house the additional expense at this present for clothing fireing etc and found it amount to  0s a man i then supposed the advance upon these articles two thirds that of the others that i might be sure the conclusion might be below the truth  the result of these operations gives us the following rate of increase for the price of provisions michael    michael    east    michael    price of provisions  0     0        0   geometrical progression  0            0    the lower series are four terms in an interrupted geometrical progression where the disstance of the terms is equal the intervals of the time  these coincide so nearly with the numbers above them as to point out that such a law nearly took place whatever the cause of this decrement of the value of money may have been it seems nearly uniform for the given time  the annual decrement of the value of money during the whole period was     per cent but in the first four years it amounted to     per cent the rate of advance of the price of provision was considerably more from    to    than from    to the present time which is contrary to the general received opinion it appears in those four years to have been accelerated   annually per cent nearly more than its mean increase the four years from whence the second term is obtained are the years    and those immediately following and this irregularity seems to form no objection to the law but to be the effect of the great sums of money the successes of the last war brought into the nation a cause which was barely beginning to operate in the first period of four years the average of which is therefore nearer its true level  i have chosen to explain the principles upon which these tables are grounded at some length as the consequences deduced from them upon a very important question treated of in the appendix differ from what is delivered by some very respectable writers  from what has been here laid down we are able to determine the ratio of increase of the burden of the poor rate an estate which last year paid to the rate  00 will be by the average advance charged  0  0  for the expense of the present but by the rise of provisions  0    at the end of a year is equal in value to  00 at the beginning therefore the burden of those two periods will be in proportion of  0    to  0  0  or as  00 to  00  and the advance of the charge is to the advance of the burden as   to   nearly  the further observations i had to make upon this head are referred to the appendix note e i have there demonstrated the operations of this payment upon the price of provisions  the last thing remaining is to determine the probable saving to the public by adopting a general bill for houses of industry  but we shall be able to give a much more certain answer to the question by enquiring what would probably have been the sum saved if such a bill had taken place at the same time colnies and carlton hundreds were incorporated and having discovered that we shall easily determine the advantage sought  the year ending at easter      was the middle term of the seven years from which their average charge was assest i collected the rates of ten parishes for that year and the year    six of them situated near the incorporated hundred and added to them four parishes in norfolk the charge in the first of these years amounted to  0   etc and in the last to       etc the annual rate of advance appeared to be     per cent upon these grounds we find the present value of all the payments of a district equal to the incorporated hundreds for the last    years the difference between this sum and the present value of all the payments of the corporation adding the balance between their debt and stock will give the amount of the sum saved in seventeen years past  the annual payment of the hundreds is        etc which increasing in the proportion supposed would have become at the latter period   0   from this we obtain the probable present value of the sums which would have been expended for maintaining the poor in the hundred note d upon the old system       upon the new with the balance added   0   balance in favor of the latter       proportion of expense nearly as   to    to determine the value of the future advantage suppose even the annual increase of the expense of maintaining the poor in the old mode diminished this can only be true in case the price of provisions advance with no more than the present celerity consequently the expense of maintaining the paupers in the house will follow the same law note d the present value of all the future payments had there been no act of incorporation would be  l  0     of the incorporation     0 future saving       past do       sum saved present value        this amounts to     years purchase of the rate of these hundreds in      supposing an average of seven years equal the rate of the middle year  or     of the probable amount of the rate of      and the present values of the expense of the two different modes of supporting the poor for those hundreds l        and         the proportion of these sums is nearly as    to    or as   to      before we proceed any further let us apply this conclusion to mr gilberts bill and suppose that a third of the kingdom from local circumstances is incapable of being incorporated but that the remaining had been divided into incorporated districts    years since and ascertain the present value of the sum which would in all probability have been saved by it  the amount of the rates of of the kingdom is two millions  present value of the sum saved in    years         probable future saving        0 total advantage           the number of years purchase of a rate which these sums are equal to have been joined to the results given above that if there should have been any error in fixing the amount of the poors rate of the whole kingdom at three millions the account of the total advantage may be readily corrected  the rate of interest in these computations has been taken   per cent the rate of advance of the charge has been taken     while the price of provisions by the table has increased     per cent this must be far beneath the average increase as the price of labor though somewhat augmented has not increased faster or even equally with the price of necessaries and the number of paupers relieved has been generally increasing all these circumstances together have cooperated to lessen the account given of the value of the charge of maintaining the poor under the present laws  on the other hand the sum saved at nacton has been the least of any house i have examined the weekly expense of a pauper exclusive of repairs furniture surgeons and officers has been at nacton  s  d at melton  s  d and at heckingham  s  0d either of the two latter would have given the advantages much more  a method which would have brought us far nearer the truth would have been to have taken the mean advance of the rates exhibited in the table as the advance of the poors rate and compared the total expense for seventeen years upon such a supposition with the mean expense of a house of industry the weekly expense at melton approaches nearest to such a medium  i have declined all computation of the advantages of these foundations deduced from the profit of heckingham at midsummer next nine years from the opening of the house half the original debt of  000 will be paid off and the rate reduced we cannot expect its success to be universally equaled the care of the directors and the particular attention which mr cooper has constantly paid to it have put its funds upon a very superior footing the promoters of these institutions must greatly regret that he has laid aside an intention he had formed of adding a full account of the management of them to the dissertations upon this subject he has already given to the public but let us imagine the expense of the house at nacton would have been thus diminished in proportion of  s  d to  s  d or    to    the present value of expense of the house for the first seventeen years would have been reduced to       and that of the future expenses to        the probable expense of the first term if the poor had continued under the management of the overseers would have been   0   and that of the second      0 the comparison therefore stands as follows incorporation poor under overseers total saved expense to              0   future do            0  0 0                  the sum which should be given by any district to be free for ever from the charge of the poor rate appears here to be upwards of sixty years purchase of the next years expense the interest being taken   per cent the general rate in the country had i taken   the first sum would have been diminished but the second increased in a far greater proportion  but supposing the true future charges of both systems ought to be taken at a medium from the sums stated above and the value of the perpetuity of the annual charges of two such equal districts the first with a house of industry established seventeen years since the second with the poor continuing under the overseers admitting both to remain fixed at their present payments for ever  continuing the interest at   per cent the perpetuity of the future charge upon the house would be       l of the present expense of maintaining the poor under parish officers       l and the future expense will be found by new system old do hyp  st            0  d             sum               mean               the advantages by this corrected hypothesis stand ultimately as follows incorporation old system exence to            0   future do                         0  the difference then appears to be  0      the probable amount of the rates of colnies increasing every year   0  per cent would be at the end of seventeen years equal the average      l multipied by  0  0    twentytwo years being past since the year when the amount equaled the average this difference therefore is       years purchase of the present rate if therefore a bill had been passed at that period to have incorporated of the kingdom as supposed above the present value of the past and future saving would at this time have been      000 or taking interest at   per cent at its first establishment seventeen years since    0 000 l which was the value then of the difference of expense to the nation between the two modes of providing for the poor  but the annual increase of the rates since has a little exceeded the discount on the former sum therefore the present value of the difference is at least sixtyfive million  the future expense        is nearly equal    x   0  and therefore about fiftyfour years purchase of the present rates  the rate of annual advance in this state per cent     about   0 of the least increase near the present period i have been able to discover  and the charge of the two different modes is to each other as       to      0 or as   to       very nearly  if we suspect a conclusion to be exaggerated which brings out the value of a rate fiftyfour years purchase the result of the following supposition may tend to destroy the objections we entertain against it admit the true value of a rent charge to be so high as   per cent and that for twentyfive years last past the rates of a parish have increased in the same proportion we have seen them for a considerable period last past and then stop forever how many years purchase of the first years rate is the value of such a perpetual payment  here the rate of increase somewhat exceeds the rate of interest but admitting it to be equal and the rates of the parish  00 l a year by reasoning as before on the same case the present value of the first twentyfive years payments at the beginning of the term will be   00 l or twentyfive years purchase the remaining perpetuity at the end of the term will be worth the rate of the twentysixth year multiplied by    the number of years purchase it is worth if it continues without augmentation for ever but the present value of that rate at the beginning of the twentyfive years is equal  00 l and the value of the perpetuity    0 l or    years purchase of the original rate such a rate therefore appears to be worth    x        years purchase the reduced hypothesis gives it fiftyfour years  a parish which twentyfive years ago had given to redeem its poor rates the then present vale of all the sums it has paid since added to the perpetuity of the present rate would have saved all the probable future advance upon it therefore    years purchase was less than the value of such a rate by all the probable future advance an hypothesis which states it at    must fall nearly as far below the truth  we see that all the reasons which might have been then urged against its being an eligible contract would at this instant been refuted by the experience of the past period and what arguments can be now brought against it which could not have been urged with equal or superior probability then they had not then to encounter and bear of the past period  but to remove every degree of doubt about the result i added together the rates of all the parishes which i had taken for long periods all of them but one accidentally happen to give the lowest annual increase the rate of increase of the whole thus added was something under the general advance being equal to       per cent the rates for the term of twentyfive years were worth at the beginning of that period   0  and the remainder of the perpetuity      the whole      which deducted form    leaves about   years purchase of the rates twentyfive years since or about      of the value of a rate at present as equal to all the future advances which may happen  that i may finish here every thing that relates to calculation i shall add some observations on the bills of mortality in houses of industry on the proportion of power to be granted to guardians and directors and on the probablility of these institutions being neglected in future periods  the registers in houses of industry have usually been kept in the general mode but the names of the paupers who died with their ages and distempers and day of admission into the house has been generally entered into the report book at heckingham since march      by the assistance of that entry and such information as the governor supplied me with concerning so recent a period i was able to distinguish those who died of distempers with which they were admitted into the house from those who died by disorders contracted after their entry the number of the former in this period were  0 of the latter     but during this term a malignant fever raged very much both in the house and country from christmas    to midsummer    in periods of average health these numbers were as    to    and therefore taking a medium between these proportions the corrected result comes out as    to    and the deaths    0 of the total exhibited by the registers as these distinctions have not been made in those returns to the house of commons i have seen i thought it necessary to insert them here to obviate an objection which might otherwise be very reasonably made to the mortality of the several houses  in the time of the general illness mentioned fortynine died admitted ill from the country and an hundred and one resident in the house this disorder which was of the putrid kind was brought into the house from the country the state of the air seemed at that time particularly fatal to old persons of the latter number no less than twenty were above seventyfive the small pox carried off six or seven and three were lost by inoculation incidents which will reduce the number nearly to its just proportion  when we want information we are generally so happy as to discover what would have been the proper form to digest records which at present are so kept as to be of very little use i am sensible that the scale upon which these observations are formed is not so extensive as it ought to be but they are the best grounds i could procure i had drawn up some observations upon registers before i knew what had been done upon that subject by dr price i incorporated his observations afterward with my own and have given them in the appendix  it was an observation of one of the directors of this house and confirmed by the governor that the children when admitted had too generally a very meagre emaciated appearance and that the difference between those newly entered and those who had been in the house some time was very striking in that case it must preserve a number of useful lives to society  the only sufficient reason for entrusting a set of men with the exercise of any power or the expenditure of a certain revenue is their interest in the application of it or their ability or both conjointly in considering these particulars we shall easily determine how far the old law which in its operation has flung the disposition of the sums collected for the poor into the hands of the overseers in the first instance was political or right we shall be thence likewise able to form an idea what weight their dissent to the incorporation of a particular district ought to carry and with what reason they may complain of an abridgement of their powers by the late acts  the average length of leases throughout the kingdom is difficult to ascertain but though we cannot assign a term of years which shall precisely equal it we may assume one which we are sensible from the nature of things must greatly exceed it to compute the proportional interest of the landlord and tenant in the poor rates i have therefore supposed all the lands in the kingdom under leases of fourteen years and upon that supposition the interest of the owners to that of the occupiers will be as    to   but this gives the tenants interest greatly above the true value had we stated the average length of leases at nine years it would have fallen considerably short of half as much  had these two classes of men been equally raised above temptation equally enlightened with respect to the true political principles upon which the extensive detail of police depends in that case such would have been the proportion in which authority justly would have been distributed to them it is true that among the occupiers there are persons to be found respectable for their character and information i am not certain whether emerson farms his own estate but a constant attendance upon their own affairs and an education not training them much to reflection will stamp a general character upon the whole class which will render them improper for public duties yet such is the order of the the people to whom the spirit of the laws now in being commits the expenditure of a revenue whose present purchase appears to be equal to the national debt exposed to the peculation or mismanagement of every dishonest or ignorant man to whose charge it is entrusted experience points out what numbers may be fairly ranged under both these heads  an error in legislation perhaps single in its kind  the magistrate has by law some check upon the officer but the instances of possible misconduct are so numerous that the remedy in its operation is far from being in any degree equally extensive with the evil  every subsequent check possible may be provided but where the expenditure of a fund in the first instance without superior direction is lodged in the hands of the most improper class of people the manner in which it will be applied will be strongly marked with the characters of the men a stream which takes its rise and flows over a soil full of mineral particles will imbibe all its noxious qualities nor will it be greatly altered by the addition of a trifling rivulet which may fall into it in some part or other of its course  but to this it may be replied that there will be little advantage resulting to the public from removing these powers out of the hands of persons who may abuse to place them in the hands of those who will absolutely neglect the use of them while the spirit which planned and formed a new institution subsists the attendance given by the managers is constant but like every other kind of enthusiasm it is strongest at its first appearance difficulties in the execution damp it but the tedium of attendance wear it out entirely the original institutors had a kind of personal attachment to their own plan which engaged many others to a duty which bore the appearance of personal attention to them but to their successors it is only a common care in which they are equally engaged with many this is a second and certain source of diminution of attendance and what is the sum total which we obtain by the alteration of established systems to exchange old abuses with old names for old abuses with new ones  this is an objection which has been much dwelt upon we must measure the effect of these causes to diminish the attendance of directors by what experience has already pointed them out to be the most proper instance will be that of the oldest establishment of this kind where they will discover themselves most fully and clearly and here it has happened that every one of the causes mentioned in the objection have operated with greater force than in any other instance which to the best of my knowledge can be produced the average numbers attending the annual meetings at nacton from  0 to    inclusive were for the first five years ten the second    the third      and in the last year  0 the book from whence i extracted this account goes back no further than    0  another branch of subject which i proposed to consider was the advantages of a better and more regular education which this system in a considerable degree provides for the poor  the elegant and fanciful rousseau has attacked all education in general and made happiness to consist in every human savage living alone in his cave being very dirty wearing no clothes and keeping his nails long enough to dig his own pignuts this puts him above the artificial wants contracted in society but a much superior philosopher of our own country has particularly written against the education of the poor and very clearly demonstrated that sharpers highwaymen and pickpockets were the most patriot characters his conclusion from this principle was very properly drawn you must suffer your poor to remain uneducated otherwise they will not be quite so beneficial to the public  bad principles in philosophy joined with great and useful discoveries seem to have the same fortune with the little qualities of great men they have so much false lusture flung upon them by the neighborhood they stand in that they almost seem to shine by their own light it is particularly unlucky for my present argument that these objections against the utility of education stand in such respectable company that will be enough to deter me from attacking them in detail but not from laying down what i think may be urged on the contrary side  the man who writes and the man who reads have frequently very different opinions of the importance of the branch of the subject under present consideration but the consequences which i think may be drawn from this head will induce me to go into it with particular attention  those passions whose irregular indulgencies produce the worst effects in society do not attain any degree of strength before the period of a common education is passed and the principles of sympathy and compassion implanted in mind by nature discover themselves there a long while previous to them for this reason in the earlier stages of life we receive and retain impressions of virtue much easier than those of vice on account of their nearer analogy to that set of emotions which then reign in their full strength while those which afterward attain more than power enough to counterbalance them have not yet arrived at force or maturity  impressions of this kind early made on the mind are long retained and being frequently repeated by virtue of that repetition become so deeply and habitually infixed as to obtain the same force and permanent efficacy with those impressions originally stamped there by nature in this manner a few first principles early inculcated and frequently repeated win their way into the heart and maturer years fortify by reflection what habit before had rendered almost a second nature  we cannot long personate any character but that some part of it will attach itself to us and become our own that warmth with which we endeavor to render the deception complete carries us beyond the mark designed and converts appearance into reality the constant action of an internal principle produces the external appearance of it and by a kind of reflex operation the assuming the external appearance constantly fortifies or even gives birth to the internal principle we have frequently seen a bare external show of religion improve into genuine piety while a mock defense of the desolate maxims of the morales lubriques or an air of libertinism worn in the gaiety of some unhappy hour has fixed a bias on the mind which has not with ease been shaken off those who have attacked the utility of all institutions for the education of the children of the poor have owned that they produce an external appearance of decorum industry and assiduity the tendency of these external appearances to strike deeper root and improve into reality converts this concession into a strong argument in favor of such institutions  to live agreeably in any society our general conduct must be such as not to draw upon ourselves any particular degree of disesteem from it few people i believe were ever so absurd as to go for pleasure or even to propose tolerable convenience to themselves in a road where there is an incessant multitude continually thronging the opposite way elbowed on one side pushed on another it is hard to struggle against popular opinion there are not many practical principles whose operations by an inspection into the actions of mankind at large we can discover to be so extensive and in their effects so infallible a kind of external force operating upon us either prevents us from deviating from that train of action public opinion has marked out for us or the pain we receive from every excentricity quickly recals us to it if we should admit that the efficacy of that education i am recommending extends no further than correcting our opinions without correcting our principles the oblique effect of such reformation of our sentiment must be well worth securing and be productive of the most advantageous consequences to the manners and morals of society  let us endeavor to trace its effects from the observation i had before laid down a man who by a better education is improved only in his judgment of virtue and vice when the merits of an individual with whom he is unconnected by relation prejudice or favor comes to be discoursed of will heartily pronounce of them according to those improved sentiments he has imbibed far the greater part of society stand in this very identical relation to every individual of which it is composed hence the public at large will appreciate the merits of any action the better the more generally those principales by which it ought to be judged are diffused that general censure on every deviation becomes more precise more enlightened and more certainly passed the train of action marked out by public opinion being rendered more agreeable to the laws of reason and virtue becomes more agreeable to the public interest and in the path thus marked out for them the generality of mankind will always walk but whatever lights the superior part of mankind may thus enjoy if they do not reach the class below they will certainly fail of producing this effect among them if a man do not run counter to the sentiments of that class of life in which his principal connections lay to violate the ideas of right or wrong entertained by those much above or much below can little affect him in this respect he may be said to live in a different society and from hence arises the necessity that these grounds of judgment should be equally diffused in every rank of life  nor does it form a reasonable objection to such an education that its effects are by no means infallible that nature and passion will frequently triumph over such slight obstacles as habit and education oppose to them that their efficacy is always found least when the most urgent necessity calls for their support there are some men whose violent appetites transport them with such excess that no education can infuse a proper counterpoise to them other whose passions balanced in the exactest moral equilibrium are so harmonized as to preclude the necessity of every degree of instruction with the former it must be inefficatious with the latter superfluous but in the scale of human dispositions there are many intermediate degrees between these two extreme limits near which we find them very thinly scattered and almost every character occupies a space much nearer the middle point than is commonly assigned consequently the constant operation of habit and education though their power were much less than experience shows it to be may determine on which side they shall be found and it would be absurd to reject any design generally useful because its benefit could not be extended to every uncommon case an inventive imagination can propose  education operates on the mind with a gentle and secret influence yet this unseen bias though not discoverable perhaps in one or two particular instances will be clearly discerned in a series of many actions and form the predominant character of them it is like a slight bias given to a die which in a large number of casts will not fail to demonstrate itself in a degree proportioned to its strength with such a regulated certainty that we are able almost infallibly before hand to determine its precise effect though from some assignable causes it may not be indicated in a single experiment  though the general institution of houses of industry will not provide for the education of all the children of the poor yet the good effect which would result from a general provision will be answered in proportion to the extent of the partial provision proposed  the reasoning above laid down seems in some degree confirmed by an effect already experienced it was an observation of the governor of one of those houses i have visited that the children born in the house or admitted very young were the most orderly and industrious those whose relations or parents came into the house with them being abetted and encouraged by their friends were extremely irregular and idle and that this difference in their behavior was very perceptible a remark which clearly points out two facts very important to the present subject that the training the children of the poor receive in their cottages is of the worst kind and that the education and control of a house of industry provides an adequate remedy to it  but these institutions have been attacked upon another ground it has been alleged that a pauper is deprived of his civil liberty by being shut up in one of these magnificent prisons and put under the control of a governor nor does the inconsistency end here every law should have a certain analogy to the principle upon which the government of a state is founded where it is inconsistent with it it clashes with and tends to weaken that principle if it be only local if general it saps its very foundation this maxim is the fundamental ground of the true spirit of law in every country the principle of this government is civil liberty and can that principle remain unimpaired when a law is made which actually reduces a great number and subjects half a people to a probability of personal confinement  before we admit this reasoning which i think i have proposed in its full force it will be necessary to see how low down the idea of civil liberty can extend in the freest government and in what manner a disciple of lock the most enlightened and zealous advocate of freedom would take it up  every man he would reply when he enters into society gives up a certain proportion of his natural liberty to the magistrate in return for the protection he receives from him and the remainder after such a surrender is called his civil liberty if beside protection he want maintenance and have no property to procure it he then becomes a servant to some individual which lock on civil government b ii c   commonly puts him into the family of his master and under the ordinary discipline thereof and gives his master a temporary power over him which extends to whatever is contained in the contract and no further  that master and servant are names as old as history that is as the history of civilized society and human happiness if the state or a district which provides maintenance for those who have no property to procure it do not acquire the same rights over the persons maintained it must be from some difference in the circumstances of the case a servant goes into the family of his master and the ordinary discipline thereof  by an express contract into which he is obliged to enter by the impossibility of subsisting without it from which he cannot be disengaged until the end of his contract if he be able to support himself in a manner he likes better the service he undertakes to do in return for maintenance and wages generally overpaying considerably the expense to his master  a pauper enters into a house of industry provided by the district and the discipline thereof defined by written laws  by a tacit contract into which he is obliged to enter by the impossibility of subsisting without it  from which he is of course discharged if he be able to support himself in a manner he likes better  and his service in return for maintenance and gratuities is generally much beneath the expense to the district the differences then appear to be these the servant is subject to the ordinary discipline of his masters house which in its nature must be somewhat discretionary  the pauper in a house of industry to a discipline defined by written laws  the servant is not disengaged from his master until the end of his contract although he be able to support himself in a manner he likes better  in that case the pauper is of course discharged  the last circumstance in which these states are contradistinguished appears to be that the services of the former are beneficial to the individual those of the latter do not nearly repay the expenses of the district which maintains him  what rights can the pauper retain in the latter case where upon the whole he is a burden upon the public which the servant has not a tittle to in the former where upon the whole his labors are beneficial to the individual would be difficult to discover the only reason which can make against a district having this power is that it reduces the poor to a worse situation than the present without being attended with any considerable benefit to society the error of the former part of this reasoning has been very ably refuted by an mr potters observations p       impartial state of their situations under both these systems which the enquiries i have made upon this subject enable me to pronounce not exaggerated that of the latter i flatter myself to have demonstrated in the former part of this essay  after all is it certain that the liberty remaining to the poor considered as an aggregate body is at all abridged by these institutions or that it does not gain in one respect more than it loses in another a pauper at present cannot remove from the place of his settlement without a certificate which the officers may refuse to grant the general administration of this law is nearly as rigorous as the spirit of it in districts under the latter acts of incorporation a certificate must be granted for the pauper to remove to any place within them the liberty of residence by the old law circumscribed to a single parish is by the new one extended to large district all the poor are benefited by this enlargement while but a small part of them are put under the restraint complained of balance these circumstances and we shall be induced to think that the poor enjoy upon the whole a greater proportion of civil liberty under the new than old law  we may further observe that this new system in its consequences is highly favorable to every improvement in legislation and the spirit of that civil liberty to which it is held out as being so subversive the happiness and freedom of every state depend ultimately upon the laws by which it is governed  if we enquire what is the least possible restraint of law in a state the answer will be it ought to be such as added to the restrant which the manners of a people oppose to those irregularities which destroy the peace of society forms a sufficient counterpoize to those passions which would betray us into them for if it be less it is inadequate if more unnecessary and every unnecessary restraint is a degree of despotism an institution which improves the manners of society makes way therefore for a more moderate and improved system of legislation agreeably to these observations it has been found that those refinements in civil policy which take place in polite ages and nations would be of no use when endeavored to be put in practice in a hoard of barbarians on account of their savage ferocity of manners as these manners have gradually improved laws  are the laws you have given the athenians the best systems possible the best replies solon they are capable of receiving an answer which every legislator ought thoroughly to understand montesquieu esp de loix l    c    which to be efficacious must necessarily bear a relation to them have refined likewise and societies grown powerful and happy it is thus that improvements in manners generally diffused throughout a state have always preceded and served for the basis of improvements in civil policy but these advanced virtues must be disseminated through the greater part of society before those successive amendments in legislation can be introduced and here we discover in a striking light the further utility of those institutions which tend so eminently to reform the morals and manners of the inferior members of the state of which that majority is composed every advancement toward a more perfect system of laws in its turn promotes the virtue of society these reciprocal improvements are in this manner multiplied to a degree of infinity like the images of an object placed between two opposite reflectors  when we survey the manners of mankind in this state of continual and gradual improvement the prospect so much brightens upon us that we are led to imagine that those excellent forms of government and regulations of society which have subsisted only in the minds of a few abstracted philosophers will some ages hence be actually realized if one view the gradual advances which have taken place in the science of legislation we shall discover that they have always had a tendency to this as that ultimate point to which nature originally destined human society to attain and rest in and which alone is worthy that noble appellation the state of nature i am not now to be told that this is looked upon rather as a matter of curious speculation the ingenious amusement of a few men of refined imagination than as a thing which ever can exist the negative of such a question ought always to be maintained with the same diffidence and reserve with which the affirmative is advanced there are certainly some institutions which now exist and are celebrated as masterpieces of policy which the most penetrating politicians once censured as plausible in idea but what would be found in the execution chimerical and impracticable i venture to assign as an instance of this the noble edifice of the constitution of england planned by the wisdom founded by the labors cemented by the blood of a long illustrious line of legislators patriots and heroes that philosophical historian tacitus has told us nam cunctas nationes et urbes populus aut primores aut singuli regunt delecta ex his et constituta reipublicae forma laudari facilius quam evenire vel si evenit haud diuturna esse potest tac ann lib iv c    that in every nation the government is in the hands of the people the nobility or a monarch a constitution selected and compounded of these three rather recommends itself as specious in idea than practicable and if put in execution could never exist for any time yet that constitution was then forming in the woods of germany and de moribus germanorum tacitus himself has transmitted to us the original outline of its foundation  appendix article i on the burden of the public debt a writer of the first abilities dr price has in a late publication represented the burden of the national debt to be so much increased as to threaten the subversion of public credit as the data i have collected to point out to what degree the burden of the poor rate is augmented and the principles laid down to determine it appeared to me during my enquiries upon this latter subject to apply equally to the former i shall endeavor to discover upon these grounds what has been the increase of the public burden since the commencement of the last war what operation it has had upon the price of provision and the probable period in which we may expect to be able to discharge it  there cannot be a subject on which an error on either side can be attended with worse consequences an opinion of the near danger of public bankruptcy produces almost all the evils which could come upon us were the danger real it annihilates public credit it tempts the attacks of our enemies to which our ill grounded fears make us oppose a very ineffectual resistance it destroys that public vigor and persevering spirit of private enterprise which form the best treasure and happiness of a state and even where they do not find ability create it  but the danger is equal on the opposite side when a nation has but a few last means of safety left if they be squandered away by a confidence in resources which do not exist it renders certain and precipitates a ruin which wiser measures might have avoided  i am sensible of the difficulty and extent of the subject which is to be enquired into upon the principles of a science which i never pursued to any great length and which i have some years entirely laid aside and believe i should have suppressed any observations which might have occurred to me upon it if the enlightened attention of the public which some late writers of great merit have called out had not rendered it almost impossible for any error to pass into a general opinion  the burden of a tax or the total taxes of a country must be in proportion to that part of the subsistence of the people which it takes away if a tax took away   0 part of the subsistence of a people twenty years since and an equal portion at this present time its burden is precisely equal if it take away more it increases if less it diminishes money represents some real value in goods and commodities and if a tax at two different periods take away the representative of   0 of our subsistence the buthen of that tax upon a people at those different times is equal  in this calculation and those which follow i take the sum of our annual charges and my data in general from dr price the amount of the taxes in    was  0      exclusive of the land tax at two shillings in the pound        and the total payment         from which the difference of the burden in that year and the year    when the total amount of the taxes was ten million is easily derived we are first to investigate what sum of money in    was of equal value with the sum of the taxes in    this term comprehends nineteen years admit the value of money to have decreased at the rate of     per cent annually for the whole term the real value then of         in    was equal to         x  0      or      00 in    or these sums at those periods were equal burdens upon the people  the taxes in      amounted to ten millions the proportion of the public burdens in    and    was as       to  00000 or as   to      but the result would have been as   to      if we had confounded the charge and the burden as the same thing a mode of proceeding which gives the advance of the latter six times too great for this reason the conclusions of dr price and those writers who never lay down that distinction when they treat of increasing burdens and the measure of their effect upon the national credit must be erroneous  the annual decrement of the value of money upon which this calculation and some which follow are founded is i think assigned with moderation the article in the table from which i deduced it which advanced with the greatest celerity was corn yet it seemed uniform through all the period observed which points out a permanent cause many might be easily instanced that luxury introduced by the fortunes made in the last war over and above the immediate consequence of an increase of wealth a change of the manner of life in the farmers who raise these commodities who have in their own consumption substituted more expensive articles instead of the cheaper and simpler which formerly supplied them and the fortunes made by many in a short time which have excited the avidity of almost all to grow rich in haste these if entered into at length would be found best to correspond to the effects observed if the former years of the period for which the register of prices i have used was kept were rather more plentiful than the latter the exportation permitted then tended on the other hand to raise those prices and the restraint in the latter to diminish them and during those years of greater plenty the advance was found most rapid but that advance could not be owing to exportation only or the same cause at any other period would have produced the same effect nor would any thing but a deficiency in the productions of the earth increasing every year produce it which can with no probability be supposed it was out of the power of an uniform deficiency to have caused it the price must have come to its utmost height in a short time and there remained fixed indeed but not progressive  but that the annual decrement of the value of money might be suspected of no exaggeration i have supposed the value of corn to have risen only half the sum the nacton table points out and from thence deduced the rate of decrease     per cent annually  if we had taken the fall of money     as exhibited in the table the burden of the taxes would have appeared diminished   0 or      0 l yearly that of the peace establishment     and that of the debt increased   0  the public annual charges are compounded of the interest of the debt added to the other current expenses which may deserve to be considered separately the debt at the beginning of of the last war was seventytwo millions and supposing the interest paid the public creditors equal in both times such a burden was equal to  0  0000 at the end of    the public debt then amounted to     millions and the proportion of the national burdens in those years was as  0  to     or as   to      to suppose the burden and actual sum the same would give this rate of increase as   to   0  or the difference of burden nearly    times too much  if we deduct the interest of the debt from         l the total taxes of    the remainder will be the peace establishment together with the sums applied to the discharge of the debt the interest amounts to     000 l admitting it to be proportional to that of the present debt the difference applied to the purposes mentioned above amount to         l which equalled in value   0  00 in    the remainder of the public revenue in    applied to these purposes after the discharge of the interest of the funded debt was       0 exceeding the former sum   00 which gives the addition to the burden during the last peace we have annually paid off        l of the debt during the former   0000 the difference is        l  the expense of the peace establishment has been loudly objected to it appears however from the last consideration to have been a decreasing burden though a much more considerable force has been kept up by sea and land than before the commencement of the last war  the debt in      was fiftyfive millions and nearly the same it is to be supposed at the peace of utrecht the national interest then was six per cent the present debt     its interest   and admitting both these sums to be redeemable funded debts the interest on each will be   00000 l and     000 l if we calculate the value of money for      from an average of ten years of which that is the middle term we shall find a revenue of   00000 at that period equal in value to     000 in      our burden therefore in those fortynine years is augmented barely   0 and we may in reasoning upon this subject suppose them perfectly equal  it seems to follow from this conclusion that the total of all our national exertions since the peace of utrecht have been no more than equal to our abilities because our burdens have not been increased  that there is no more reason to apprehend a national bankruptcy now than there was at that period and the fears which were then entertained have been since refuted by experience  it has been observed of late years that some of our funds have become more productive the advantages resulting to the nation from such a circumstance deserve a little attention  the proportion of the present value of the perpetuity of an increasing to a fixed fund is as the rate of interest to the difference between that and the advance  that of a decreasing fund as the interest to the sum of the interest and rate of advance  and that of an increasing to a decreasing fund as that sum to the difference mentioned above an example will make this sufficiently clear  let there be three funds each of  00000 the first increasing   per cent annually the second fixed the third decreasing at the same rate the first increases let   be the rate of interest the value of the increasing fund will be to that which remains fixed as   the rate of interest to   the difference of the advance and interest or as   to   the real value of the first is five millions the second         and the difference          the value of the decreasing to the fixed fund will be   to   or   to  0 and the perpetuity of the third fund will be  000000 the loss        and the difference between the increasing and decreasing fund    to    as   to    therefore the loss upon five funds perpetually decreasing at the rate of   per cent is only equal to the gain upon two increasing funds  and let there be seven parishes assest at an equal sum to the poors rate let the charges of five annually decrease at   per cent and the remaining two increase at the same rate the decrease of the former will be balanced by the augmentation of the latter  after having said so much on the relative measures of burdens the next subject which naturally offers itself to our consideration is its absolute measure or what every man pays in the pound in proportion to his consumption of commodities  there are no data i believe to determine this question exactly the utmost we can do is by a probable conjecture to approach near the truth  a land tax of  s in the pound according to the assessments was some years ago estimated to raise no more than  s  d of the rack rent the rent of the kingdom will thus appear to amount to    millions the product taken as three times the rent    millions admit the additional value of our manufactures    of our whole production the value of our manufactures will thus come out    00000 and supposing consumed at home that consumption amounts to    00000l and our exports to   00000 for which we import foreign commodities of which the value to the consumer will be  0  0000 reckoning  0 per cent only for freight and mercantile profit i have here supposed no balance of trade in our favor our annual consumption therefore appears to be     0000 l add  0 millions the sum of the taxes and the total expense of the kingdom is  0   000 a year and the absolute measure of the burden  or  of our total expense something less than   0 in the pound mr massy in      calculated the taxes paid by the farmer in proportion to his consumption at  s  0d in the pound upon what ground he formed his conclusion i do not know  the interest of the debt being nearly half the taxes its burden will be    in the pound mr hanway has endeavored to compute the annual consumption of the kingdom upon different principles he begins his account with a supposition which can no ways be admitted that the ordinary rent is twenty times the value of a land tax at one shilling in the pound this evidently gives the result far too little  that the land annually produces on a medium four rents i have supposed but three  that the other articles to be added are half the produce exceeding the proportion assumed here as   to    if he had supposed the rents to bear the common estimated proportion to the land tax the consumption of the kingdom would have come out     millions annually the total expense of taxes and consumption     the burden     or more nearly  s  d in the pound  of the effect of public burdens on the price of provisions supposing the unreduced advance of prices drawn from the tables true it appears that the price of provisions and the money levied in taxes have since the beginning of the last war advanced almost in equal degrees it may be proper therefore to examine upon this supposition whether the increase of the public expenses have not raised the prices of provision and thus created an apparent ability to support them at the expense of a much heavier evil  let us suppose the quantity of money of provision and the number of people in a state to remain the same for an indefinite term of years the price of necessaries will remain the same  imagine now by a deficiency of the productions of the earth or any other cause the quantity of provision in one single year is reduced in a certain proportion as for instance     it is evident the price of provisions will rise that year in some similar proportion not perhaps precisely equal suppose it   per cent the next year upon the return of the old quantity they will fall again nearly to their original rate which they will after a certain period acquire if this period extend to five years for the term is of no importance and the decrease of price every year be equal or that the addition to the first price shall be in the  st year   the  d   the  d   the  th   the  th   the  th 0 or return to its old level  let the quantity of provisions to be diminished again a second year the effect of the diminution of the first year will have left an advance of four upon the price the present year increases this with an additional advance of five so that the total advance of the second year will be nine in like manner for the third year the advance from the deficiency of the first will be three the second four the total seven and generally in the  advance from the deficiency in year the  st             year             0 0             0                                                             if we suppose these decrements continual proportionals instead of equal quantities the numbers and sums will be indexes of powers the result the same and the form of demonstration but the arithmetical progression will be more universally understood here we see that the price of provision by withdrawing every year   0 of the whole quantity increases continually to the fifth year but in the sixth and seventh year and ever after no further increase is made the effect is in that year come to a maximum  and let the price of necessaries increase during this period from any other cause acting in conjunction with this as for instance the augmentation of the quantity of money in the same number of years the effect of the annual diminution of provision will be at its greatest height and at all subsequent periods the rate of increase of price will go on in the same proportion as if it had been effected by the quantity of money alone  if instead of commodities in kind their representative specie had been substituted its effect would have been the same if the sums taken had at the different times assigned represented the same real value for no reason can be assigned why taking away the representative should produce a greater effect than taking away the real value represented by it  when the proportion of necessaries thus taken or specie representing them uniformly increases it continually tends to increase the price of provision which then has no maximum the increase of the burden of the poor rate has been  00    for nine years last past its efficacy to raise the price of provision has possibly been to that of all the other causes operating with it as     to     about of the whole  when the burden decreases the prices of provision if no other causes operate decrease with it if we admit the decrement of the value of money which the table gives to be true the burden of our annual taxes since the commencement of the last war has decreased   0 therefore a fortiori they have not been the cause of any decrement in the value of money  if we reason from the reduced hypothesis which gives the value of money     our burden being now no more than it was at the death of queen anne the present difference of the price of provision compared with that of three or four years after cannot be ascribed to it for if it had continued the same during the whole interval it would have produced its utmost effect in three or four years after the peace of utrecht and the subsequent advances must have been attributed to some other cause  there is a striking difference between the operation of a debt with its annual interest levied upon the public and a tax of the same amount applied to the current service for the two annual payments of the public simply as such would produce the same effect upon the price of provision but if there had been no fund to vest the capital of the debt in a great part of the money now composing it would have been laid out in the purchase of lands this would have increased their price to reimburse himself this extraordinary expense the new purchaser raises his rents and this raises the price of provision and the interest paid to foreigners again diminishes its efficacy being a diminution of the quantity of money in the kingdom  but admitting the decrement of the value of money assigned too high there is another argument which i think puts this beyond a doubt a nation which funds instead of defraying the current expenses of war and peace by immediate taxation at first is eased of paying the principal by only taking the burden of the interest as the debt increases this interest increases until it becomes as much as would have equalled the average expense of war and peace if there had been no debt its last stage is where the interest exceeds that average during the first two periods the sum of all its taxes will have been much less than in the former system and therefore they will have produced an effect considerably less in raising the price of provisions we are now nearly in the second of these periods as i shall have presently occasion to show and therefore provisions have hitherto been cheaper on account of our funding  yet i am by no means inclined to extenuate the consequences of a system which if not receded from in time may still for a certain period continue to lighten our own burdens by the ruin of posterity but a general dispondence from views which i conceive present our situation in too dark a point of light may discourage and even disable us from making use of those resources which remain to us though the debt appears not to have been an increasing burden funding may very well be conceived to be an ineligible mode of defraying the public expense let us therefore enquire into the present value of the difference of our system of funding and that of raising such taxes uniformly since the beginning of last war as would have completely discharged the sums it was then necessary to borrow at the end of that term of years for which we might reasonably expect the continuance of peace this sum added to our peace establishment will give us the amount of our taxes in case we had no debt and enable us to determine the loss of the kingdom by funding according to the present state of that debt  the proportion of the number of years of war to those of peace since the commencement of the present century has been as   to    the operations of the last war begun in the spring of      and included seven years and the probable expectation of peace was twelve years the debt contracted in the war was    millions and supposing the annual grants all equal the extraordinary expense amounted to  0      l per annum an extraordinary revenue of  0   00 would have discharged that debt with its interest by the time another war would probably have commenced we must add to this the peace establishment for the army navy civil list and the annual debt upon these articles amounting to    0000l and the whole revenue annually raised upon the public would thus amount to      00l which falls short of the present sum raised by the taxes     00 l about   0  during the peace the debt has been diminished to    millions but to have discharged that sum in the same term of time     0  l a year must have been levied in additional taxes or in the whole   0     l in both these cases we should have begun the subsequent war with the same debt upon us we did the former but the different sums of money to be raised upon the people to bring us into the same situation would have been as    to   0 or as   to  0 which i think to be the difference of the real value to the kingdom in our present circumstances between the system of funding and that described above  if the debt were annihilated it does not seem that we should be able to reduce our taxes without the probability of being obliged to create a new one because the interest of the debt is very nearly equal the sum we should annually pay to prevent coming into that circumstance  but notwithstanding this points out the necessity of pursuing for a certain term of years the most efficacious methods of reducing the public debt i therefore proceed to enquire into the means dr price has recommended to effect this  he has supposed we may be able at least to obtain of america a fund of  00000 a year  the colonies are said to double their numbers in    years but let us suppose the term    in which the quantity of land flung into cultivation is doubled if a tax be laid upon the land already broken up amounting to  00000 per annum which he seems upon the authority of lord shelburne to consider as attainable and all future grants be assest at half as much again for the same quantity of land the rate of increase of cultivated land will be       or      per hundred acres yearly which would be the increase of the tax if the lands newly brought into cultivation were assest at the same rate with the old but they are supposed to pay half as much again or the tax to increase       per cent yearly and taking the interest of money at      and the debt at     million it would be discharged in  0  years by that fund and an annual burden of    000 annihilated with a clear addition to the revenue at the end of that term of  0    0 l  there is one particular property attending such a mode of taxation that all frauds at the original assessment and those which may be committed afterward act contrary to and will nearly destroy each others effect a fixed sum is to be paid if the present possessor in his account delivered in diminish the quantity of land he holds such a diminution will augment the tax upon equal quantities and the sum will remain the same but it will also augment the revenue from lands afterward brought into cultivation in the proportion of   to   and if the future frauds in respect of quantity be equal to the past the revenue will upon the whole gain if they exceed them in proportion of three to two it will not lose  but beside the tax from the colonies which i suppose to remain as stated above the following are some of the resources which he points out as remaining to the nation for the discharge of the debt    the annual surplus of the revenue  00000l    the land tax to be continued at  s in the pound the amount of the additional shilling   0000 nearly to be thus applied    in      there will be an addition to the annual saving of       l        00l principal debt falling from   per cent to      in      a further addition of    00l    00000l more being reduced from   to   per cent    in    years the greatest part of      0l per annum annuities will be extinguished as these will fall into the savings gradually let us suppose them all to subsist together    years and then at once to fall off then in     the fund will be further augmented      0l  these funds conjointly will discharge the debt in  years and if we further were to suppose the affairs of the east india company so far retrieved as to be able in two or three years to pay  00000 a year to government the debt will be discharged in    years nearly  in determining this period i supposed the rate of interest   per cent for the following reasons when a fund sinks below par as for instance to  0 it may be privately bought up if it rise above as to   0 the creditor will submit to a reduction of   per cent rather than be paid off at  00 these particulars have been fully pointed out by dr price i have therefore supposed their effect equal to per cent added to the common rate of interest  it is impossible perhaps to form any wellgrounded hypothesis of the future annual decrement of the value of money but upon a supposition that it will be for the next    years what the following table gives it for the term it comprehends that our future wars shall have the same proportional length as the former in this century and our operations be as extensive as in the last our new debt will be paid off in  0   years the whole in    and the burden continue nearly the same during the entire term of payment but toward the latter end of these periods the discharge of the debt might be perhaps too much accelerated and such a quantity of money be flung into the hands of the public creditors as must greatly and rapidly increase the price of land and consequently of provision the effects this might produce upon commerce and industry merit some consideration there is a limit which the payment of the british creditors ought not to exceed when it gets to that it might perhaps be expedient with the overplus to begin to discharge the principal due to foreigners which therefore it would be right to reserve till nearly the last because we might be obliged to stop in the course of payment earlier than we otherwise should be necessitated to nor ought even that in any period of its discharge to exceed a certain proportion of the balance of trade in our favor it might otherwise deprive us of our specie  i shall close these observations on the debt with a recapitulation of what has been endeavored to be proved  i that the burden of the taxes from    to    increased    00  ii that in reasoning upon this subject if we consider burden and charge as synonimous terms the increase resulting will be six times too much  iii that the increase of the burden of the debt in the same period is only     000 but according to the second method of estimating it it appears to be  0  000 or    times too great  iv that the peace establishment has not been an increasing burden notwithstanding the superior force kept up  that the burden of the annual sum paid to the public creditors was the same nearly at the peace of utrecht as at present  the burden of paying off the debt with a given annuity at that period the interest   per cent and that of the present the interest   per cent would be found not differing in a very great proportion but to assign this it would be necessary to go into a detail exceeding the limit which should be allowed to a subject merely collateral  that the gain by a fund which becomes annually more productive greatly overbalances the loss by a decreasing fund  that the system of funding has not yet raised the price of necessaries  that the absolute burden of the taxes is  s  0d in the pound of the debt   d but that the difference between the present system of funding and imposing such taxes as might probably at the discharge the expense of one war by the commencement of the following is as  0 to    but that all fears of public bankruptcy grounded upon a measure of public burdens which does not take the decrease of the value of money into consideration appear for that reason ill founded  that these conclusions may be compared and understood with more facility i have digested them into the form of a table  years charge decrement of money burden

following manner the present expense for  0 paupers in one year from the best estimate of particular articles i could obtain amounted to   l the rate of increase was then assumed equal to that of the other articles  but there is an apparent irregularity in the advance an acceleration in the first period of   per cent the cause of this and its precise measure may very probably be assigned  we very easily discover two temporary causes of acceleration which then took place the increase of taxes and the fortunes made in the last war and brought over from the east indies we will suppose the effect of the latter that of the former the annual average increase of the debt last war was about    millions and in the middle of that period we are considering it was nearly     millions and the annual increment of the burden       we found the absolute burden when the debt was     millions to be    in the pound at     it therefore was  0 and the increment in pence          admit with dr price that more is raised upon the public for commodities by the increase of taxes than the sum paid to government the total increment of the price of provisions will be   0        or in the terms of a pound  or  per cent the effect of the influx of money of the former amounts to  per cent and their joint operation  for the acceleration of the increase of the price of provision      per cent but the mean advance by the table appears to be     the accelerated advance     and the effect of the accelerating cause   as determined above  to this it may be objected that it has been demonstrated that taking the decrement     the increase of taxes has not raised the price of provisions in    years but the reasons alleged above not only admit that the taxes in some of the given years increase the prices of commodidities but even assign the quantity of that augmentation  the period mentioned was during the war the operation of a tax newly laid on is to raise the price of necessaries and consequently to drop the value of money during a war of seven years if taxes increase in a superior proportion to the fall of the value of money the public burden increases if money continue to fall as the table points it out in every successive year of peace the same tax will have less value or become a less burden than the former and as there are twelve years of peace to seven years of war the decrement of burden in twelve years taking the yearly rate      will balance the increase in seven  the numbers therefore corrected by removing these causes of perturbation would stand thus prices  0             0   geo prog  0             0    i must observe here that the correction of the numbers founded on a probable hypothesis is probably but not perhaps mathematically true there being no demonstration of the assumption on which it is founded it is certain however that of the irregularity ought to be subtracted if we allow no efficacy to the influx of money but whatever be allowed will abate the remaining there is the greatest probability that the annual decrement of the value of money has not been overrated after the reduction i have allowed it is much more probable that it falls short of the true measure  considerable uses might i should be inclined to think be derived from accurate tables kept in this manner  government has already ordered registers to be kept of the principle articles in it if the others were likewise added the business of granting relief to the poor might be regulated upon such fixed principles as to be always proportioned to the necessity of the pauper applying for relief in every variation of prices the quantities of the different necessaries of life to be consumed in kind by a family of every probable number may be found with very little difficulty then the different expense of maintaining ten men for a year deduced as above may be given in the first column of a table and in a line with every different charge which need not exceed twelve in number the weekly expense of a family of every different size such a table might be comprised in one folio page and need no alteration for many years the prices of many articles of provision are i believe delivered in at the quarter sessions a clerk might every half year draw out an account of the charge of supporting ten men annually at the rates of the time being it would be completed in four or five short multiplications the numbers in the line opposite the nearest sum in the table would give the weekly expense of a family of every probable size the the weekly earnings of the pauper subtracted from this will give the weekly allowance proper discretionary additions may be made in case of sickness  if the relief thus proper to be granted to a family of every size transcribed from the general table were published in the provincial papers at the same times they would form a check upon either the avarice or profuse folly of a parish officer  possibly some very good consequences might be derived from general abstracts of the accounts of the different houses of industry being yearly advertised in the county papers with the average expense of maintaining ten paupers for the last year compared with the charge of the same number formed by the prices of that part of the country as in the forgoing article if such an institution by the negligence of the directors in general should be suffered to fall into improper hands of which i think there is no probable danger this comparison would be an account of their mismanagement the measure of it exactly defined and their own accusation to the public the different expense of maintaining that number of paupers in different houses would be easily compared and the cause examined into by the director of that district whose charge amounted to the greater sum it would be a check upon the unnecessary expense or illiberal parsimony of either and all such corporations be continually approaching to the best plan of providing for their poor  it would render this new system likewise capable of being made more general the probability of the abuse of such institution arises from the want of a sufficient number of directors but diminishing the probability you make fewer directors necessary  we may thus likewise approach tolerably near the solution of a political difficulty of some consequence to regulate the price of labor by the state if ever it should be found expedient to attempt such a measure  the legislature may know at what mean price the public interest requires work of a certain kind to be fixed but determine that price invariably by statute and every labourer let his strength or skill be ever so different as the quantity of neither can be defined receives equal wages as the value of money falls there will be a necessity of frequently altering the statute or the laborers are reduced to the most abject distress fixing labor of different kinds to rates which rise and fall by the prices of provisions deduced from a table formed in the manner i have given would take away the latter objection but leaves the first to remedy that when a servant was hired for a certain period the sum fixed by agreement might be considered as a rate or proportion and the payment should increase or decrease with the variations of the value of money a short annual table might be given before michaelmas for the whole kingdom which would contain every variation of rate or the justices of the peace for the separate counties might draw up one at the preceding sessions as the prices of the different counties are not perfectly equal it is easy to see that there would never be occasion for any alteration of the rate of hireing  that the labourer would be paid according to his abilities and the necessity of his master for his services  that he would always receive the real value in proportion to the terms of his agreement instead of a nominal sum  wages always bearing nearly the same proportion to the price of provisions equal labor would generally procure an equal quantity at every price which would tend to diminish popular insurrections  suppose the price of labor to be now a certain number of years behind the price of provisions as four or five every other circumstance is easily deduced from that point of time when fixed but there certainly is some delicacy requisite in fixing it  i had occasion to consider before in the appendix the effect of a land tax in a country not fully settled but where population and settlement advanced with great rapidity if far the greater part or the whole of the revenue a country draws from its colonies were by such a tax the rate of which was made fixed and permanent it would give greater security to the colonist for the peaceable enjoyment of the rest of his property than successive taxes imposed at various times to make up the same amount there certainly is no injustice in subjecting a future age to bear the same burdens and contribute the same real value to the parent state their predecessors did if the absolute taxation for equal quantities of land varied every ten years according to the variation of the value of money in the colony for the preceding term deduced from a table of this kind the burden of an individual would at the most distant period of time always be in proportion to his ability and be equal upon equal property the money produced by it would increase in a complicate proportion of the increase of the settlement and the rise of provisions this augmentation would continue after such a settlement was fully peopled in proportion as they applied themselves to arts and commerce for a people strong by sea without numerous land forces large islands but such as are not capable of supporting above  00000 inhabitants seem the best settlements if less their people will soon cease to increase and the settlement be entirely cultivated and perhaps there is a vigor of character and a degree of refinement attainable in a middling society which smaller ones are not capable of if they be larger it may be difficult to restrain them in the bounds of a proper subordination and they have this further recommendation nature seems to have separated them and prevented all temptations to a dirty detail of insidious left handed artifices and the unpolitical errors of an unmanly policy  article iii on the increase of the charge and burden of poors rates hypothesis when the price of labor remains constant and the price of necessaries increase the number of poor to be supported by the public shall increase at least in the same proportion  it is easy to demonstrate that this supposition falls short of the truth the paupers who receive weekly collection in a very populous district being lately numbered amounted to  00 those of one single parish which pays of the rates are in the whole far more than double that number let us suppose that    of the number receive collection double the price of provision without increasing that of labor and of the whole number of poor could infallibly become chargeable but the hypothesis gives the increased number only    or  let n the number of poor r the amount of the rate p the price of provisions l the price of labor then r p x n and n p  l by the hypothesis when the price of labor remains constant or l po then n p and r p  let us now suppose the price of labor to increase in the same proportion with the price of provisions then p l n remains constant and r p  and in all the intermediate degrees of increase of the price of labor it will be represented by some pure power of p as p   m for assuming a series with coefficients and comparing the terms with the known cases they will be found severally equal to o then n p  l  but the

celerity of increase of the ordinate supposing x constant  but the former of these two equations will require a correction  the poors rates of a number of years being given to determine the rate of a given year according to the mean degree of advance  a rate of this kind is generally upon the advance and though it may be some years lower than the mean rate of augmentation gives it in others it will be higher when these irregularities are as equally distributed as possible we approach very nearly to the mean law of increase which may be discovered by the application of the foregoing problem  add the rates of ten succeeding years together if the district from whence they be taken be large those irregularities will enter into such a sum nearly in proportion of their probability and magnitude and the accidental excess of the rate proceeding from accidental scarcity want of trade or any other cause in one year nearly counterbalancing the defect in another such a sum shall approach indefinitely near what the mean law of increase if known would have given repeat the same operation with the next period of ten years call these totals successively a b c then shall y be the annual payment of the year x according to the mean rate of increase for that term and the next form gives the celerity of increase and represents in every distinct period of time the adequate measure of the effect of those causes which have increased it  the same mode of proceeding will give us the decrement of the value of money and its acceleration with this we may compare the causes which the history of that time suggests and approach as near to certainty in our researches upon this head as the subject will give us leave if the data deduced from history have any tolerable degree of precision the conclusion will be sufficiently accurate and at all events if enquiry into such subjects be necessary or useful we should not decline the trouble of enquiring into them upon the best grounds  on parish registers the want of good political data has been lamented by almost every person who has undertaken any operations of political arithmetic the following corrections to the present plan of our registers might be of considerable use  a parish register of burials should contain every person buried in that parish of whatever sect or religion it would be most conveniently divided into columns the first containing the surname of the person the second his christian name third day of the month fourth age fifth trade sixth distemper seventh married man widower or bachelor eighth number of children born ninth survivors  by placing the surname first it would most easily be inspected  inserting the trade of the person would nearly point out the number of manufacturers of every kind in the kingdom but by comparing it with the following column it would serve a very useful purpose and determine in a few years how far particular manufactures abridged the lives of mankind and point out to us if luxury will have its gratifications even at such an expense what foreign manufactures it might be politic to encourage the importation of as the money we lose in one branch may by proper attention be retrieved in another and the number of our people preserved the eighth and ninth columns the number of children and survivors will likewise point out the further effect of particular trades upon population and in conjunction with the seventh give us the state of matrimony this last which i added after i had planned the rest from dr price will be of great use in determining the value of some kinds of survivorships  the register of marriage should contain the ages of the parties this would further enable us to judge of the state of marriage in the kingdom for the same reason legitimate and illegitimate children should be distinguished in that of births  the register of deaths in a house of industry should contain the day of the paupers admission  if of an infirm constitution  if admitted in sickness and with what distemper  on the interest of money as allowed in the following computations the loss to an individual from a sum of money taken from him a given number of years since is equal to its present amount at compound interest  the whole use and benefit to an individual of equal sums for equal times are equal and his loss by being deprived of them is equal let a man be supposed to have paid a given sum for instance  00l ten years since to any rate or tax he has lost the use and benefit of  00 pounds for the term of ten years past and for ever after  let him at the same time have laid aside  00l to increase at compound interest to this period at four per cent this sum will have amounted to    l at the end of the term if then this sum be taken from him by a second rate or taxation what is it he loses the use and benefit of  00l for the past term of ten years and for ever after but his loss in the first case is equal to that in the second or equal to a present loss of the amount of the sum for the given term at compound interest  what has been demonstrated of one individual paying a certain sum holds true of any aggregate body of individuals paying any sums  and for similar reasons the loss to an individual in being obliged to pay a given sum at the end of a given term of years is less than if he had been compelled to pay it immediately  this will be readily admitted in the cases of two kinds of people those who put out money at interest because their income exceeds their expense or who borrow for the contrary reason but are the intermediate class who neither hoard nor borrow affected the same way  if the interest of the sum taken away be small in proportion to such a mans income suppose   00 part it may become imperceptible but is nevertheless real for if possible suppose the contrary that it was absolutely nothing then it would be nothing if multiplied indefinitely or fifty times for instance but an accumulation of such nothings as cut off   0 part of a mans income who did not save before would be found a real difference  some conclusions upon a question of consequence having been lately drawn from principles contrary to these it will not perhaps be thought unnecessary to have given this demonstration of them at length before the following calculations  article vi calculations problem i to

be the sum a farm let out upon lease paid to the poors rate the year preceding the contract and be the rent what it will if the poors rate had been  l less the tenant would with equal advantage to himself have been able to have added  l to it if  l he might and would have raised in the rent the same sum if that payment were instantly annihilated it would be added to the rent therefore for the term of the lease the rent will be diminished  0l or the landlord will pay it and upon an equality of chance there will be an equal number of tenants at the present time in the  st  d  d and every year of the common term of leases t and upon the same account there will be no reason why the occupations of the tenants now in the first year of their leases should be more than those in the second third or any succeeding year the occupations of all the tenants in every term will according to the laws of probability be equal as also the numbers in each class therefore their conjoint interest will be to that of all the owners as the interest of t tenants occupying equal farms one being in the first year one in the second one in the third etc to the interest of all their respective landlords  let s be the poor rate of a given district  then the sum of the poors rates in years 0           t put n  r s sa sa  sa  sa  sa  sat of which the tenant pays  then the tenants interest will

value of which at any term in the lease added to the former perpetuity  00 ps gives the total charge upon the owner this will be when the lease terminates in years  and the corresponding charge upon t landlords will be equal to the sum of all the terms of this series hence   supposing the lands throughout the kingdom upon an average to be under fourteen year leases interest four per cent rate of advance of the expense of the poor    per cent to determine the proportion in which the owners and occupiers in fact contribute to this payment  taking s   0 we shall find the charge upon the  owners  and upon the occupiers   then the real charge upon the owners to that upon the occupiers shall be as    0 to   0 or as    to    we may derive a result somewhat near this by the following method which as it depends only upon the principles of common arithmetic will be more universally understood  the advance of rates being given at   as before at the end of fourteen years a farm which paid  0l a year the last year it was in the former occupier will be raised to l    here the advance for the term of the lease will be l   and supposing it equal every year the annual increase of charge will be    l therefore the advance upon the farmer at the end of year                                            0       0                                            0   the interest of a farmer in the
