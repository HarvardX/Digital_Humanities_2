a short introduction to vocal music  mdcclxvii  to the reader in the following little treatise intended for the use of children the author has endeavored to set down his meaning just as he would explain it by word of mouth to a young person an entire stranger to music enlarging and more minutely expressing many things which to persons of maturer judgment might have been explained in fewer words it is hoped therefore that the critical reader will not take exception to the imperfections of style or tautology that may have been occasioned by this method of treating the subject if in other respects it shall be found to answer the purpose of instruction this is all that is aimed at  the author however that he may not seem to make much ado about nothing begs leave to assure his readers that insignificant as his method of hitting distances may appear to some it has nevertheless been practiced by several persons with great success he therefore flatters himself that the young persons for whose use the following rules were drawn up will not esteem them unworthy their consideration especially when they shall find that this method of learning music requires very little time in comparison of the old method of sol faing  it is not alleged or pretended that a child may comprehend these rules of himself without the assistance of some understanding person who by reading them over with him shall teach him how to apply them  neither does he say that they are sufficient to make a skilful musician nor does he recommend them to such children as are bred musicians by profession but to such only as cannot be allowed time enough from their other school studies to learn music in the regular way but yet may be enabled in a little time by this method to bear a chorus part in the service of god  a short introduction to music rule i there are but   notes in music  viz abcdef and g with the halfnotes between them and their octaves above and below  rule ii every octave consists of five tones and two halftones the situation of the latter viz the halftones must always be attended to as they determine the key  rule iii if one halftone is found between the  d and  th notes of the key and the other between the  th and  th commonly called the  th and  th places then it is a sharp key  rule iv but if the one halftone is found between the  d and  d and the other between the  th and  th commonly called the  d and  th places then it is a flat key  the following rule will explain this  rule v from a to b is a whole tone from b to c is half a tone from c to d is a whole tone from d to e is a wholetone from e to f is half a tone from f to g is a wholetone from g to a is a wholetone before i can give the learner an example of this rule he must be well acquainted with the nature of the cliffs which from their situation on the beginning of a line readily determine the name of each note for example  whatever line in a stave shall have the c cliff marked upon it at the beginning must be called c and all the other lines and spaces must take their names from it rising in alphabetical order the same method must be observed in the other cliffs  rule vi there are but   cliffs in music viz  first the g cliff commonly called the treble cliff and marked  which seems to owe its shape to a careless manner of making a g as it is sometimes marked  for g sol re ut it is seldom placed on any other line but the second and is used in the uppermost or treble part of most compositions viz the part for womens or boys voices and treble instruments  secondly the c cliff marked  it is called tenor contratenor or soprano cliff according to the line on which it is placed which line being made c by the cliff is in the same octave with the lowest c in the g cliff marked  but this will be more easily understood by examining the scale which follows the next paragraph  thirdly the f cliff marked  or  commonly called the bass cliff because it is much lower in pitch than the rest making the  th line on which it is usually placed one octave below the lowest f in the treble cliff marked  notwithstanding which the young scholar in practicing the following examples may sing in the natural pitch of his treble voice taking his key note as it shall best suit himself for the only reason of prefixing the f cliff to the following examples is that the learner by being sufficiently acquainted with it may the more readily find the key note in real compositions  a scale showing the different octaves of the   cliffs   st octave    d octave    d octave   rule vii in most musical compositions the last note in the bass is the key note  that the young scholar may more readily find the name of this note in the following scale as it is somewhat awkward to say the letters backward from the cliff line let him find the  th space below the line on which the f cliff is placed which is still f though an octave or the  th note lower then let him count forwards g a b and the next note c he finds to be the key note as for example  the key note in the following example  a scale of   notes gradually ascending and descending   having found the key note to be c refer back to the  th rule to find where the half notes lie proceeding from the key note as follows from c to d is a whole tone from d to e is a whole tone from e to f is a half tone n b between the  d and  th commonly called the  th place from f to g is a wholetone from g to a is a wholetone from a to b is a whole tone b to c is but half a tone n b between the  th and  th commonly called the  th place this according to the  d rule must be a sharp key  rule viii the easiest method of hitting the distances is practiced by those who play on the french horn or trumpet for as the tones from those instruments are not formed by the fingering like others but only by the lips and breath so the idea of passing from note to note must be much the same as in singing they commonly sound the keynote of their instrument and its  d  th and octave backwards and forwards in tuning before they begin to play any piece and strictly observe what lines or spaces those notes the  d  th and  th should be placed according to the cliff they play in for as they must keep the sound of their key note in idea so they readily from thence sound the  d  th and octave having used their ear to those distances which like steps convey the performer to all other notes of the musical scale before the young practitioner studies the following examples he must accustom himself by ear only and without notes to sound first the sharp  d and the  th and  th and then the flat  d and the  th and  th to any given note which any person who has the least knowledge of music can teach him by first sounding them for him to imitate let him likewise be used to sound the  th and octave to any given note missing the  d as  and to strike octaves without the intermediate notes as  and if he finds it difficult to hit a  d let him suppose a note between the given note and the  d as  to find the tone of a  th let him suppose the octave before it as  to hit a  th let him suppose the  th first as  and to find the  th above the key let him touch softly first upon the  th as  with some practice in this method a person who has a good ear for music may acquire so clear an idea of the distances that he will be enabled to sing tolerably at sight without those last mentioned assistances  in singing the following examples let the learner make use of the word la to every note it being the best syllable to form a round open tone upon  examples for tuning the voice in the same key as the first   observe well the situation of the  d  th and  th   the following rule will assist the learner to know the distances without counting the notes viz  rule ix if a keynote is placed on a line the  th will be found on the  d line and the octave on the  th space above it but if it stands on a space as in the above example the  th will be on the  d space and the octave on the  th line above it  examples of the same key in the other cliffs  example in the tenor cliff being the c cliff placed on the  th line    the c cliff on the  d line commonly called the contratenor cliff   the c or soprano cliff so called when placed on the first line   the g or treble cliff   rule x a flat is marked b every note having this mark set before it or at the beginning of its line or space is sounded half a tone lower than it would be without it  a sharp is marked and makes every note before which it is set half a note or tone higher  when any note having a b or set at the beginning of its line or space is required by the melody to be sung as if there was no b or then this mark called a natural is placed before it  example of the flat key  n b the following short example is not intended to be sung for it is not agreeable to the rules of modulation to ascend gradually the   uppermost notes of a flat key but is merely speculative to show the situation of the halfnotes   refer to the  th rule for the explanation which will lie as follows from the keynote c to d is a wholetone and from d to e is a wholetone but from d to e b is but half a tone for the b marked at the beginning of the space makes e half a tone lower and consequently half a tone near d n b this halfnote is between the  d and  d commonly called the  d place then from e b to f must be a wholetone because from e without the b to f according to the  th rule is an halftone from f to g is a wholetone and from g to a is a wholetone but from g to a b the b being marked on the space of the octave below is but half a tone n b this is between the  th and  th called the  th place   then from a b to b b is a whole tone for as they both have a flat a on the space and b on the line of their octaves below so are they both brought an halftone lower and consequently are still the same distance from each other which the  th rule mentions then from b b to c is a wholetone the b being made half a tone further from c by the b this therefore according to the  th rule must be a flat key having one halfnote between the  d and  d and the other between the  th and  th  let the learner be very careful to sound the  th a wholetone below the octave for after singing in a sharp key he will be very liable to make it only half a note lower  examples in the same key   example in d with a sharp third   refer to the  th rule beginning with d as follows from d to e is a wholetone from e to f is half a tone but to f the placed at the beginning of the line making it half a tone higher is a wholetone from f to g is half a tone because f is brought half a tone nearer to g by the placed at the beginning of the line from g to a is a wholetone from a to b is a wholetone from b to c is half a tone but a being placed on the space of the octave below makes c half a tone higher so it is consequently a wholenote from b to c from c to d is half a tone c being made half a note higher and nearer d by the so that as this halftone is between the  th and  th and the other between the  d and  th it must be a sharp key according to the  d rule   example in b flat key   refer again to the  th rule beginning with the keynote b as follows from b to c is half a tone but from b to c is a wholetone from c to d can be but half a tone because from c natural to d is a wholetone n b between the  d and  d from d to e is a wholetone from e to f is a wholetone the removing f half a tone higher and further from e from f to g is but half a tone the removing f half a note higher and nearer to g n b between the  th and  th from g to a is a wholetone and from a to b is a wholetone therefore this example according to the  th rule must be a flat key having one halftone between the  d and  d and the other between the  th and  th   in the same manner are all other keys to be proved the keynote being found by the  th rule  the next thing to be considered is time or the length of notes which the following table will show  a semibreve  is as long as  minims which are as long as  crotchets which are as long as  quavers which are as long as     semiquavers  every piece of music having   crotchets in a bar is said to be in commontime and has generally this mark c put at the beginning of the stave  thus   for the more exact keeping of this measure it is usual to beat with the hand at the beginning of every bar and to keep it down during one half of the bar viz while you count   and   and to hold it up while you count   and   the remaining half of the bar  when a piece of music has   crotchets in a bar it is then called triple time and is marked at the beginning of a stave   in beating of this time you must count the   first crotchets with your hand down and the  d with your hand up  the next material thing to be considered in vocal music is the speaking of the words distinct and plain which alone and not the singing quick a false notion which too much prevails in choir music can add spirit to the performance but this if the students own genius does not direct him must be taught by a good master as it cannot so easily be explained in writing  to conclude i must advise the learner to choose the easiest and slowest compositions to begin his practice with such as common psalm tunes and other slow movements  a further and complete understanding of vocal music can only be acquired by being long conversant in the science  finis
