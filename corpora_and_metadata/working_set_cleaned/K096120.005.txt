youkaguirians tschoucktsches koraiks kurilians kamtschadales and the eastern islanders which are also parts of the russian empire i will supply the deficiency from steller muller cook and others who have treated upon the subject steller muller and kratscheninikaff have furnished us with the best accounts we have at present but other travelers though not literary men have given some accounts equally true and interesting  of the different nations which occupy this country the youkaguirians are similar in language and manners to the jakutes the tschouktsches resemble the people of the northern isles the kurilians and the people of kamschatka are like those of the eastern islands and the koraiks resemble the tschouktsches and kamtschadales but as much as any of these participate in language and way of living there is still a characteristic difference we will speak first of the tungusians  tungus in tartar implies a hog and the tartars probably gave them this name by way of contempt and to express their natural filthiness their deserts extend eastward from the jenisei beyond the lena as far as the amur and the eastern sea from south to north they inhabit the country from the   d degree of north latitude to the   th as they are a peaceable people they admit various other nations to live among them particularly the eastjaiks samojedes and jakutes some of this tribe belong to the chinese and wander about the river amur and the district of the mandshours their country in general is marshy and interspersed with mountains and forests except about the amur and the climate is so cold that they can clear the land but in very few places  the eastjaiks of the jenisei gave the russians notice of these people in   0  many expeditions were sent against them but they were not wholly subdued till       the tunguse like all other eastern nations divide themselves into races each race composed of several distinguished families known by the name of their founders those who can prove their origin in a direct line from the founder of the family are esteemed noble and called oterikan from these nobles they elect their saissans or chiefs who are confirmed by the government of russia  in      they were numbered in order to be taxed and were found to consist of     races which all together comprised       boys or males that paid tribute besides about   00 tents or families that roamed beyond their own deserts into neighboring territories and there are also many yet unrolled of course we may say that the tungusians form one of the most numerous nations of siberia for if we add three to each family for their wives and children it makes up the number of those registered only near one hundred and twenty thousand people  the tunguse are of a middling stature and wellmade their faces not so flat as the kalmucks they have a fresh complexion small sharp eyes small thin nose lank black hair and very little beard some men have none at all their senses of seeing and hearing are so acute as to be wonderful but their organs of feeling and smelling are less acute than ours and their voice is rather hoarse their young women are wellmade pleasing figures very sprightly and modest but their old women are frightfully ugly full of wrinkles smoke and filth with eyes as red as fire we seldom see a whiteheaded man or woman even in the most advanced old age they are vigorous straight and upright and so full of vivacity that a stranger would not suppose them old  in constitution they are sanguine and in temper frank always appearing as they are lying is to them so absurd a thing that they are never guilty of it of course they are never suspicious nor are they obliged to affirm any thing upon oath theft and fraud are held so very infamous among them that on the smallest reflection or reproach of that kind a challenge ensues and they immediately proceed to fight with bows and arrows content with the necessaries of life they want no other keeping to the manners and customs of their ancestors and never forming any novel scheme not anxious for the morrow they cheerfully divide the last morsel with the first comer and the gaiety of conversation is never lost in the poverty of the host though they are often obliged to fast many days without food they are never dispirited the only case in which they look forward is in marriage and in this they are so prudent as seldom to be unhappy for added to the provision they make they are so indifferent to the world that they are neither nice or delicate in lovematters nor are they inclined to libertinism within their sphere of knowledge they are attentive diligent and of good capacity learning foreign languages with care and expedition and almost acquainted with every tree and stone within the tracts they are accustomed to they are good horsemen good hunters and dextrous at the bow they will track their game by the pressure of the grass or moss and even by marks on the ground though so light as not to be discovered by others they are resolute and daring to a great degree great numbers fall in duels and they will unarmed attack a bear if they meet one yet resolute as they are they cannot calmly suffer extreme indigence wounds loss of friends or fortune but with all this society has no charms with them they go singly to hunt and when they chance to meet in the vast deserts they feel no social pleasure and when relations part they do it without regret the rich as in every other country have a greater number of wants and cares than those who are poorer and are less liberal and generous however the wealthy are all ready to pay tribute for such as are old and infirm and this is done in skins or furs  their language is a dialect of the mandshourian easy to pronounce and not unpleasing to the ear it contains but few letters and is written in characters easier drawn than penned but the russian tunguse have neither schools nor books their learning being confined merely to tradition in a case of dispute they will rather submit it to arbitration or fight it out with arrows than refer it to a magistrate or darouga and be judged by laws they are unacquainted with duelling is forbidden for which reason numbers disappear without any one being able to tell what is become of them as a proof of their good order there is not a single tungusian among the criminals employed in the mines of nertschintskoi  when valdeyak or manslaughter is the consequence of a quarrel it is not a capital offense the killer is however flogged on the back with sticks and obliged to maintain the family of the person killed yet he is never reproached but considered as the braver for it a certain number of strokes is the punishment of theft and an obligation to restore the thing stolen or its value and the thief is ignominious for the rest of his life for rape or seduction the men only are punished the gallant is forced to purchase his fair one at a certain sum or be flogged if a man in poor circumstances deflowers a girl either rich or handsome the relations will often privily shoot him and put him to death married people are allowed to decide their domestic quarrels by fighting but if either is wounded the person giving the wound is whipped if a married couple find they cannot live happily together they separate tungusian women are not more exact in conjugal fidelity than the men of course gallantries and intrigues pass often unnoticed  all accidental marks and defects of the covered part of the body and a redundancy of hair are attributed to the influence of devils and though either is seldom the lot of a tunguse girl yet where it happens it is the cause of irony and there are examiners into these defects who pronounce a sentence of divorce accordingly  in matters of litigation which is not often oaths are enjoined of which there are three kinds in one the accused person takes a knife in his hand brandishes it toward the sun and pronounces these words if i am guilty may the sun send disease into my body as mortal as a stab of this knife would be in another the criminal is forced to climb up a sacred mountain repeating as he mounts may i die if i am guilty or may i lose my children and my cattle or i renounce for ever all success in hunting and fishing if i am guilty but the strictest oath is when the accused is made to drink some blood of a dog whose throat they have cut and impaled near a fire and burnt the person taking the oath scatters pieces of his flesh about saying what i say is as true as that i drink this blood if i lie may i perish burn or be dried up like this dog  the tunguse live by pasturage hunting and fishing the reindeer furnishes them as it does the laplanders with every necessary of life the opulent have flocks  000 or more in number the poor about  0 such being their manner of life they seldom remain in the same place longer than three days wandering in large bodies and when they traverse their immeasurable wilds they separate so much from each other that one would suppose they were distinct families independent of their flocks their wealth is but small consisting only of their clothes huts dogs and instruments for hunting and fishing and all these are not worth five rubles their poverty however gives them no concern for having but few wants they have fewer cares  every race has a certain district to fish in called a boa their boats are a kind of wherries yaou made of very light wood covered with birch sewed together they are flat at bottom brought to a point at each end and are of various lengths their breadth is from one foot and an half to two feet and an half and though they are strong enough to carry four or five men some will weigh no more than  0lb the largest not above  0lb in these ticklish vessels they will cross the most rapid rivers and venture out at a great distance from shore on the baikal with one oar only made with a kind of shovel at each end with which they strike the water alternately they fish with a eastern islanders fishing threehooked prong the prongs three inches long and one inch apart this is fastened to one end of a line seven feet long the other end fixed to the boat the following is their manner of fishing they row about in the night to the steep sandy steps of the shore and having set fire to some deal chips lie down on their faces to watch the fish and they are so expert at this business that a fish once seen seldom escapes the hook see the plate  their methods of hunting and catching animals are so various and the number of gins snares and selfshooting bows so great that it is dangerous to travel in these parts without a tungusian guide acquainted with the marks where snares are laid as these people commonly hunt alone they are exposed to various accidents and often lose their lives by a fall from some cliff or by heavy stones from the mountains rolling down on them some are carried away in crossing rivers in the rapidity of the stream and others torn to pieces by wild beasts should an unfortunate sportsman chance to break a limb and fall down between two rocks so that he cannot disengage himself he lingers till death by hunger relieves him with but one hope that of a wild beasts putting a speedier end to his sufferings  none of the tunguse occupy themselves in any handicraft work a blacksmith is the only exception and his business is carried on in so small a scale that he can carry all his materials in a bag under his arm their women are employed in domestic offices in making of clothes dying tanning and drying of fish they are expert also at dressing furs and making shammoy leather but their great excellence is in staining white furs and embroidering their clothes with goats hair and thread made of the nerves of animals  their arans or huts are made of  0 poles about    feet high formed into a cone joined at top by hooks and spreading over a space at bottom from    to    feet in diameter the inside is hung with birchbark boiled and sewed together like linen and fringed within with slips of the same bark the fireplace is in the middle and the smoke issues out at top they leave a space on one side to enter and cover it with a birchbark curtain so that their jurts or huts resemble a soldiers tent in winter they remove their tents under some hill for shelter but in summer they are erected near the wateredge  their furniture consists only of a small iron kettle wooden or bark vessels leathern bottles a cradle a pair of snowscates a sledge drawn by dogs of the pomeranian breed boxes covered with skins and embroidered spades to dig up roots about one foot and a half long a little bent and pointed with iron and a few implements for hunting and fishing their omko or cradles are boxes about    inches deep made of birchbark and lined with skins without a cover at one end the bottom and sides form an obtuse angle somewhat like an armed chair in which the child is supported by a backboard through which a hole is made to prevent it from hurting its head and a small idol is hung over the childs head as a tutelary genius every cradle has a leather strap by which it hangs at the mothers back is hung to the saddle of a horse or suspended in the tent or on some tree  the dress of the tunguse is much like that of the jakutes but very different from that of most other eastern nations which according to mr fischer professor of the academy of sciences at petersburg who was among that people some time consists of a furhabit which they wear next the skin short trowsers and long stockings or boots for they answer both purposes drawn up tight and smooth to the leg and fastenened to the trowsers these stockings are soled and embroidered ornamented with glass beads and fringed they fasten their breeches with a string which runs through the waistband to which is tied in part a small leather apron cut into a great many slips like fringe the coatsleeves are close the skirts reach no lower than the knees the borders are edged with fur and the collars are embroidered two inches broad and fringed with a white hair about four inches deep sometimes the seams are covered with glass beads striped with blue and white paint they wear no girdle but fasten their pipes and tobaccopouch flint steel and knife to the waistband of their trowsers under their coat they wear a waistcoat that does not close entirely on the breast but fastens with thongs and to defend their bosoms from the cold they wear in winter a kind of breast plate neatly ornamented with glass beads and covered with long dyed hair or goats skin four inches broad and seven or eight long this hangs round the neck and reaches to the stomach some wear over this breast plate in hopes of good fortune an iron idol representing a human figure or that of a beast or bird in winter they wear over over these stockings or boots buskins that reach half way the leg made of white reindeer skin to give them a savage appearance they trim their clothes with fur and many fix large tufts of black white or red hair    or    inches long at their hips and delight in seeing them float in the air in summer they go bareheaded but in winter wear a cap made of the skin of the head of some horned animal a reindeer goat etc and so contrive it that the ears and horns of the animal being left on are set erect on the head they tie their hair close behind and let it hang down loose on the back and where they tie their hair they have a bunch of beads the women dress exactly like the men many of the men mark their faces with blue dots in irregular figures as do the americans and greenlanders this ornament is esteemed a beauty and mothers imprint them on their children by drawing a thread blacked with soot and spittle under the epidermis which at first inflames the part but leaves an indelible blue mark in summer as a protection from the flies they hang a bunch of horsehair over their shoulders and every one carries the soft shining skin taken from a drakes head with which they wipe the small flies from their eyes see pl p     vol    the youth of both sexes when well dressed make a handsome appearance and their easy carriage and manners and open and cheerful countenance add not a little to their figure such of this people as lead a shepherdlife dress still better and shave their heads as do the mongols leaving a lock of hair on the crown which they braid into a tress  the tunguse are not delicate in their eating all kinds of animals even carnivorous ones dead carcases if not too much putrified weasels mice all come alike to them and they search for and eat a variety of bulbous roots as onions lilies and such roots as are stored up by the mice of this country they make provision for the winter of fish frozen dried or smoked and flesh prepared in a similar manner and stow it away in pits dug under ground or small huts like pigeonhouses built on the top of the stump of a tree    or    feet from the ground as do the laplanders that it may be out of the reach of wild beasts  they do not eat raw meat like the samojedes but they boil it in water without salt or roast it on a wooden spit they have a dish called sillo made of flesh and wild roots a kind of bloodpudding called schiloukta made in the gut of an animal without cleaning it and as to fat and suet they will eat it undressed as it comes from the animal itself but the most disgustful of all their viands are the silama and oedegal these are the afterbirths of women which when roasted is called silama when boiled oedegal this is a delicacy reserved for the father the woman herself tastes of it but none are invited to partake of it but their best friend water is their common drink but in spring they drink the sap of birchtrees or infusions of certain herbs roseleaves and gooseberryleaves in summer they chew niouta which is the gum of the larch in order to keep their mouth moist and sometimes they chew and smoke tobacco but never to intoxication they like other tartars distill a spirit from sour milk but never drink it in such quantities as to inebriate for their life is a state of sobriety  they are not great tatlers but the little they say is honest and spoken from the heart they are always cheerful and contented and not easily provoked if any one person is in want of any thing and another has it he asks for it without reserve and where the person asked has it to give it is never refused of course a refusal gives no offense they cannot boast of refinement or delicacy of sentiment but they are warm in their attachments when young folks meet after years of absence it is without emotion and when friends part perhaps never to meet again it is apparently without regret but it is otherwise with persons advanced in life they will if meeting a friend after a long absence fly into his arms with such transport as to change color and be black in the face and in this ecstasy will sometimes kiss the women however have more sensibility than the men they are miserable at the death of their husbands and it is sometimes with difficulty that a young widow is prevented from destroying herself their fondling terms are niki outa amenikan omimikan kattoun in english friend child little papa little mama good old man terms of anger are bouni and tsschilkour that is thief and devil  they can fast for a long time a day or two together but when they do eat will do it voraciously they have however no fixed hours for meals but take their food when they are hungry squatting on the ground  cleanliness is not one of their virtues they clean each others head and swallow the vermin and parents clean their childrens noses by sucking them they never wash themselves nor clean their dishes if even they wipe them it is with the first piece of fir that comes to hand it is natural to conceive that people in such a state of nature will not be very nice with respect to decency children often go about naked even adults of both sexes will sit round a fire naked all but their trowsers and will often go abroad so but marriageable girls are seldom seen without some covering wrong as this may appear to be to a civilized people custom renders it innocent and as every adult is married the consequences are not so bad as might otherwise be expected  polygamy is allowed among them some having five wives but the generality have but one being eager to be their own master boys marry at    and girls before    they purchase their wives and the price is from  0 to  00 head of cattle and the bride as a dowry brings with her a fourth of the value of the price given for her when the marriagecontract is made they cohabit without ceremony and on going into their new house make an entertainment for their friends their diversions on this occasion consist in singing ditties and relating strange adventures they have both lovesongs and songs of the chase and they dance to the sound of the kour a kind of violin made of a board and three strings the men amuse themselves with running races activity on horseback and shooting at a mark  the life of these nomades is perfectly natural temperate and independent despising all luxury taste and refinement money they have none but a little coined iron their happiness is confined to good health a number of children and living to an advanced old age few tungusian women however have seldom more than four children owing probably to their laborious manner of living and suckling their children till they are four years of age they bring forth with ease and in a few days after return to their employ but are not reckoned pure till after four weeks the general names of boys are scheminga ourkoundou lawinka atounga those of girls alanmour oyok jounguilbi and these names are given by friends without any ceremony  desirous as they are of living to a good old age they seldom pass seventy sore and inflamed eyes from their smoky huts are the attendant of old age but they are free from other disorders except that of the scurvy the smallpox has appeared among them and committed great ravage but this is seldom their priests are their physicians and their cures simples sacrifice and magic of their witches i have spoken before  on the spot where a man dies there is he buried except he has expressed a wish to the contrary and the body is interred dressed in his usual clothes with some tobaccopipes and sundry utensils arms etc but priests and some others desire not to be buried at all but exposed to the air in this case they are covered in the coffin with stones and boughs and are hung up near the place where the body of some schaman has been placed being all of that sect after the interment each one brings provision and drink to the deceased and places it on the grave and this rite they call schitourap  the youkaguirians consist only of about  0 wandering tribes that occupy the lower parts of the yama eastward of the lena to the borders of the frozen sea and are rated in tribute at     males they resemble the tungusians in idolatrous worship and dress and the samojedes in manner of living steller says they are fond of intoxication and smoke tobacco and chew the intoxicating mushroom for that purpose nay they will with care preserve the urine of those who have got drunk with them in order by drinking that urine at some other time to enjoy the getting drunk themselves these mushrooms do not heat the blood nor increase the circulation but have such an effect on the nerves that many during the time of intoxication are all over of a tremble and become in their old age quite stupid but under the influence of these vapors they fancy themselves rich and of gigantic stature and whilst lying on their backs sing merry songs prophesy and rave about futurity till they fall asleep with some these mushrooms produce phrenzy and downright madness  a description of kamtschatka from bhering pawloutzky steller kratscheninikaff king and others chap i of the country climate productions and animals kamtschatka is a peninsula formed by a chain of rocky and barren mountains running to the south southwest of that part of the continent of siberia inhabited by the koraiks is bounded by the eastern ocean the gulf of penschinskoi and the sea of oghotzk between    and    degrees of north latitude and extending to the    th degree of longitude the soil is stony so destitute of the smallest piece of fertile land and so cold even in summertime that it will not of itself produce feed for cattle nor is it fit for cultivation to an european it would be deemed uninhabitable yet it is the place to which russia transports its greatest criminals  in    0 the russians first heard there was such a place six years afterward they took possession of it in      an expedition to this place was undertaken by bhering but not completed till      major pawloutsky at the head of a detachment traversed great part of this country and conquered it in      since which time it has been visited by others  mr steller who resided some time in this country and seems to have taken great pains to gain information on this subject is persuaded that the true kamtschadales are a people of great antiquity and have for many ages inhabited this peninsula and that they are originally descended from the mongols for they have no tradition of having migrated from any other country they believing themselves created and placed on this very spot by their god koutkou that they are the most favored of all his creatures the most fortunate of beings and that their country is superior to all others affording means of gratification far beyond what are any where else to be met with  the russians have a few settlements in this peninsula which they call ostrogs these are no other than a building surrounded by a pallisado but sufficient to protect their trade and guard the banished criminals to these places they are obliged to send the necessaries of life from great distances by horses  kamtschatka is plentifully furnished with rivers but none are navigable except one and this will carry vessels   0 miles up from its mouth  the natural severity of the climate must be in due proportion to the general sterility of the soil of which it is probably the cause in may      the whole face of it was covered with snow from six to eight feet deep on the  th captain king says it snowed with the wind at northeast on the  th of may at noon the thermometer stood at    on the   th the snow melted and in the beginning of june the low lands were clear on the   th of june the thermometer had never risen higher than    nor the barometer than  0   in august all sorts of vegetation seemed to be in its best state of perfection in september the weather is changeable but not severe the greatest height of the thermometer was    the lowest  0 the barometers greatest height  0 its lowest      in the beginning of october the tops of the hills begin to be covered again with snow their summer then ought to be considered from the middle of june to the middle of september october may be considered as an autumnal month and from thence to the end of may winter no spring  thunder and lightening is here not very common but their winter is very severe and they have often dreadful hurricanes of wind and snow major bekm who was the russian governor of kamtschatka in      says that the winter of that year was so cold and inclement that all intercourse between the inhabitants was entirely stopped every one being afraid to stir out even from one house to another for fear of being frostbitten this extreme cold in so low a latitude can only be accounted for from its being situated to the east of such an immense uncultivated tract of country and from the prevalence of the westerly winds blowing over so extensive and cold a continent the extraordinary violence and impetuosity of the winds is attributed to the subterraneous fires the sulphurous exhalations and the general volcanic disposition of the country  this peninsula abounds in volcanoes three of which have for some time past been subject to eruptions one of these in the beginning of      vomited forth from its summit such a whirlwind of flames as to reduce the neighboring forests to ashes  their country is said to contain numerous springs of hot water kratscheninikaff says there are very extraordinary pits or wells at the bottom of which the water is seen to boil as in a cauldron with prodigious force and impetuosity at the same time a dreadful noise issues out of them and so thick a vapor that a man cannot be seen through it  on the banks of their navigable rivers says the same author is found plenty of roots and berries which in some measure supply the want of corn near the head of this river corn would grow as well as in other places of the same latitude several trials of summercorn have been made in which both barley and oats have succeeded vegetables have also been tried but the most succulent plants produce only leaves and stalks cabbages and lettuce never come to perfection and peace will bloom till late in harvest and not bear turnips and radishes thrive well and the grass especially near the rivers and lakes runs up near six feet high and grows so fast that it is sometimes cut three times in a summer cattle in such places are therefore large and fat and give plenty of milk all the year places where the grass grows are not so much covered with snow as the bogs and swamps there is plenty of wood in this country fit for building houses and shipping mr king who was there in may      says he traveled over the snow to a wellwooded fat where the snow was thawed but the trees were just budding and the verdure of the whole scene was strongly contrasted with the sides of the surrounding hills still covered with snow that the soil appeared capable of producing all common vegetables and ye he did not see the smallest spot cultivated nor were any of the inhabitants possessed of any kind of cattle yet in another place he says if i may judge of the soil by what i saw of its vegetation i should not hesitate in pronouncing it barren in the extreme neither in the bay nor in the country i traversed nor in any of our hunting expeditions did i ever meet with the smallest spot of ground that resembled what is called in england a good green turf or that seemed as if it could be turned to any advantage either in the way of pasturage or other mode of cultivation the face of the country in general was covered with stunted trees having a bottom of moss mixed with low weak heath the whole bore a more striking resemblance to newfoundland than to any other part of the world i had ever seen however he admits in one place that he saw three or four stacks of sweet and very finelooking hay  of the trees says captain king which fell under my notice the principal was the birch the poplar the alder with the bark of which they stain their leather many species of willow and a kind of dwarf cedar or pine which yields a good essence for beer the birch the natives tap and drink the juice without mixture or preparation it it pleasant and refreshing but somewhat purgative birchbark they convert into vessels for all domestic purposes and of the wood they make their sledges and canoes kratscheninikaff says they convert the young bark of the birch into food stripping it off whilst green drying it in slips like vermicelli and stewing it with caviar he says there are also firs and larches the servicetree padus soliis annuis and two species of the white thorn one bearing a red and the other a black berry  of the shrub kind there are junipers the mountainash wild rushes rasberries and a variety of other berries which the natives gather and boil into a thick jam without sugar these are used as sauce for dried fish and are likewise eat in puddings  in a wild state says captain king we met with several wholesome vegetables such as celery angelica chervil garlic and onions turnips and turnepradishes they have a plant peculiar to this country that bears a dark red single flower like a narcissus the root a bulbous one which they collect in august dry in the sun and lay up for use when roasted on embers it supplies the place of bread after being baked in an oven and pounded it becomes an excellent substitute for flour being mixed with all their soups etc  they have another plant called sweet grass the botanical description of which is heracleum sibericum soliis pinnatis soliolis quinis intermediis sessilibus corollulis uniformibus hort upsal    the time says captain king when i took notice of it was in may it was about a foot and a half high had much the appearance of sedge and was covered with a white down like hoar frost which might be rubbed off and tasted sweet as sugar but was hot and pungent the stalk is hollow and consists of three or four joints from each of which arise large leaves and when at its full growth is six feet high  they scrape off the down of this plant lay the stalks in heaps to sweat and on their growing dry again being put into mats they will yield a sweet saccherine powder which exsudes from the hollow of the stalk but in the proportion of four ounces of powder to    pounds of stalks from which powder they distill a spirit  they have also three other plants one is a kind of ranunculus of the grass of which they make a sort of matting which serves for sacks bedcloaths curtains etc another which resembles cyperoides is carded like wool and of which they make cloths and wadding the other is of the common nettle of the flax of which they make their nets  their animals supply them with variety of skins such as the common fox the zibeline or sable the isatis or arctic fox the varying hare the mountainrat or earless marmout the weasel the wolvene or glutton the argali or wild sheep reindeer bears wolves and dogs  the fox canis vulpes is the most general object of the chase as they are found in great numbers and of a variety of colors some of a dark chestnut some striped with darkcolored bars some with black bellies and the rest of the body a light chestnut some of a dark brown some black others of a stone color and some few quite white their furs are thick and fine and superior to those of siberia or america a variety of engines are contrived to catch this animal which is as crafty here as in other countries some traps are calculated to fall on them some to catch them by the feet and others by the head they sometimes lay poison for them the nux vomica before the russians came among them they used bows and arrows but now every one is provided with a rifledbarrelled gun  the mountainrat is a beautiful little animal of a bright shining color varying in hue like the plumage of birds it lives on roots and berries is considerabiy less than a squirrel and eats as does a squirrel erect on its hind legs holding its food in its forepaws but  the skin of the glutton is held here in the highest estimation the women adorn their hair with its parts which are white and a kamtschadale considers himself richly attired when he has any of this fur about him they have a superstitious notion that angels are clad in the skins of these animals it is said this creature is easily tamed and taught a number of pleasant tricks kratscheninikaff relates that this small animal frequently destroys deer and the wild mountainsheep that they scatter moss and bark which these animals are fond of at the bottoms of trees and whilst they are picking it up drop suddenly upon them and fastening behind the head suck out their eyes  the argali or wild mountainsheep capra ammon an animal unknown except in corsica and sardinia is here in great plenty its skin resembles the deers but in gait and appearance it is more like a goat it has two large twisted horns sometimes weighing from    to  0 pounds which in running it rests upon its back these creatures are exceedingly nimble and swift haunt the most craggy and mountainous parts and make their way among the steepest rocks with an astonishing agility the natives work their horns into spoons cups and platters and have one frequently hanging at their girdles to drink out of when hunting this animal is of the sheepkind and its flesh is wellflavoured  they have another remarkable animal about the size of a sheep called a kangaroo resembling in taste the flesh of a hare but better flavoured its body is formed like a goose largest behind and growing taper to the head which resembles that of a fawn it has lips and ears which it throws back like a hare in the upper jaw it has six large teeth in the under one only two its neck is short and small near to which are the forefeet which have five toes each with nails like a cat the forelegs are kept close to the breast and seem like those of the mole to be used only for digging they are small and not more than eight inches long having no kneejoint but the hind legs have the customary joints of animals and are    inches long it has a tail tapering to the end as long as its whole body which it carries like a greyhound and the whole animal is covered with a short fur of a dark mouse or greycolour it sits up on its hinder legs like a hare in her form and does not run like other quadrupeds but leaps like a hare or deer  the dogs of this country are something like the pomeranian only a great deal larger and the hair somewhat coarser they are of various colors but the generality are of a dirty cream color they yoke these dogs to sledges and thus travel on the snow toward the end of may they are all turned loose and left to provide for themselves throughout the summer being sure to return to their respective homes when the snow begins to fall their food in winter is the head entrails and back bones of the salmon which are put aside and dried for that purpose five dogs are yoked to a sledge two and two with a leader and as a sledge carries but one person the number of them is very great captain kings party took up     they never use the female for draught but dogs that are cut whelps are trained to this business by tying them to stakes with tight leather thongs made to stretch and having their food placed at a proper distance out of their reach so that by constantly pulling and drawing in order to reach their victuals they acquire both strength of limbs and a habit of drawing  the sledge is a kind of half moon or crescent made of light tough wood bound together with wickerwork the horns of the crescent upright the circular part fixed by four legs about two feet high on two flat pieces of wood like a laplanders snowscates five or six inches broad extending a foot at each end beyond the body of the sledge these are turned up before in the manner of a scate and shod with bone the body is about fourfeet and a half long and a foot wide the hollow part of the crescent is covered with a fur the forepart ornamented with leather thongs and tassels of colored cloth and the woodwork often stained with red and blue in front is a cross bar to which the harness is fixed and on which are links of iron and small bells the jingling of which encourages the dogs the person riding in this sledge sits sideways resting his feet on the lower part and carries his provisions etc wrapped up in a bundle behind him each dog has a collar to which the reins are fastened but these are of little use in governing them the rider depends on the obedience of the dogs to his voice for this purpose the leader is so well trained up and with such a particular degree of care and attention that one has been valued at  0 rubles or  0 pounds english the driver has a crooked stick which answers the end both of whip and reins as by striking it into the snow he can moderate their speed or stop them entirely and when they are lazy or inattentive to his voice he throws the stick at them the leader immediately picks it up returns it to the driver and hastens on should the driver lose his stick the dogs will instantly perceive it and unless their leader be of the most sober and resolute kind will immediately run ahead full speed and never stop till they are quite spent but as that is the case soon it generally happens that the carriage is either overturned dashed to pieces against some tree or hurried down a precipice and all buried in the snow the accounts captain king received of the speed and extraordinary patience of hunger and fatigue of these dogs would be scarcely credible if they were not supported by the best authority though fed only on the offal of stinking and dead fish they are deprived of this wretched food a day before they set out on a journey and never suffered to eat but at the end of it it is not unusual for them to continue thus fasting two whole days in which time they will perform a journey of   0 miles traveling parties says kraschininikaff are often overtaken with dreadful storms of snow on the approach of which they drive with the utmost precipitation into the nearest wood and are there obliged to stay till the tempest which frequently lasts six or seven days is over the dogs remaining all this time quiet and inoffensive except that sometimes when pressed by hunger they will devour their reins and other leather parts of their harness all the time the sledges are preparing the dogs howl with a melancholy noise but as soon as they are yoked and ready to set out they change to a light cheerful yelping which ceases the instant they set off  it is very difficult to travel in these sledges for unless a man keeps the exactest balance he is liable to be overturned every moment in going down hill they unyoke all the dogs but one and in going up hill the rider walks when the snow is very soft and tender the rider quits the sledge and makes a path for it by going before with his snowshoes such as the laplanders and eastjaiks use thus pressing the snow down this is laborious work but he has no alternative  when they take shelter in a wood from storms and this storm is likely to last long a kamtschadale will wrap himself up in his fur and creep under the snow where he lies as warm as in his hut it is difficult to persuade them to make a fire to warm themselves or dress their food all the people of this climate bear cold so well that they will sleep as sound in the open air as others do in warm beds  the coasts and bays of this country are frequented by almost every kind of northern seafowl and among the rest seaeagles of beautiful plumage and called aangitche from their singular and pleasing cry consisting of three distinct notes according to music f on the first space below a c repeated rising at equal intervals above each other whilst on the subject of birds i must not omit the disgusting mode of feeding of the arctic gull which has procured it the name of the parasite this bird which is somewhat larger than the common gull pursues the latter kind whenever it meets it the gull after flying for some time with loud screams and evident marks of great terror drops its dung which its pursuer immediately darts at and catches before it falls into the sea  in the woods are many eagles of a prodigious size and a great number of hawks falcons and bustards here are also woodcocks snipes and two sorts of growse or moorga ne and in the sea seals seaotters and whales etc  indeed there is such plenty of fish of all kinds that it may be considered as their staple article of food fish may be here called the staff of life with more propriety than bread is in other countries the whole they convert to various uses of the skin they make soles to their shoes and straps and thongs the flesh they eat storing the fat for kitchenuse and for their lamps with their whiskers they sew the seams of their canoes and make nets for large fish and shoe their sledges with the jawbones the other bones are worked up into knives and other instruments their intestines they clean blow and dry like bladders to store their oil and fat in and of the nerves and veins which are strong and slip readily they make excellent snares so that every part has its use  they catch quantities of flat fish trout herrings and cod but the salmonfishing is what the natives most depend on for their winterprovisions and the coasts abound here with all the different species  chap ii of the inhabitants their habitations and employments history is unacquainted with the origin of this people and they themselves know nothing of it nor of any events that have happened in their nation i believe it will be admitted that from this quarter of the world the western parts of north america were peopled especially when we come to give an account of the people on the coast opposite to the most eastern part of asia for captain king has proved beyond a doubt that the two great continents in one part of bherings streights in latitude    are not more than    leagues asunder and that in this narrow straight are several islands a great similarity is observable in the appearance of the two countries both are destitute of wood the shores are low with mountains rising to a great height farther up the country the depth of water in the midway between them is    fathoms gradually decreasing toward either continent so that it seems as if they were divided by some violent concussion of the earth and the streights between them being crowded with islands favor the same idea but to return to the kamtschadales who to judge of them by their language figure and manner would be taken for a separate people bearing some little relation to the islanders in their neighborhood these and other circumstances are a strong proof of the antiquity of this people who are as wild as the country itself few of them have any fixed habitations but wander with their herds of reindeer from place to place they are divided into three nations the kamtschadales koriaks and kurilians the koraiks inhabit the northern parts and round the eastern ocean almost to anadir and the kurilians inhabit the islands in the eastern sea reaching as far as those of japan  they are of small stature swarthy black hair large heads long flat faces sharp noses small eyes sinking in small thin eyebrows hanging bellies short legs and their arms small and slender they are stout walkers regardless of change of weather and indifferent to their manner of living the women have black eyes and eyebrows a delicate skin lovely complexion pretty hands small feet and are tolerably wellmade  the ancient dress of both sexes differed from the present fashions which have been introduced by the russians men and women dress nearly alike they wear a shirt loose breeches like the dutch which fasten below the knee with stockings of skin the hair outward and a kind of shoe or buskin laced round the leg their upper garment is a fur frock like a carters frock that reaches almost to the knees the hairy side of the skin inwards it has sleeves that close at the wrist is bordered with dogs hair and has a tippet of long dogs hair round the neck which they can turn up against the face to keep it warm this frock or schube has also a hood which they occasionally pull over their heads the women tie a handkerchief over their heads that comes down low on the forehead the knot behind and the ends hanging down before on each side the upper robe of the man is tied round his waist with a girdle till the russians came among them they went almost naked wearing only a furgirdle handsomely embroidered with a bag before and an apron behind and at present when at home they often sit in this undress formerly they wore bonnets made of birds feathers exactly like those on the opposite shore of america east of kamtschatka but they now dress as do the russians among them they wear gloves constantly even in the nightime formerly they braided their hnir in the tartar fashion now they divide it on the top of the head plait it at the neck and adorn it with ribbands glass beads etc some dress entirely in the russian mode wear clothes of different kinds clothes with buttons and boots and the women when dressed out wear silk shifts with ruffles slippers and a silk hankerchief round the head imitating a curtain which dress costs at kamtschatka at least a hundred sables or foxskins each skin equal to a ruble which the husband procures in the best manner he can the russians in kamtschatka wear the european dress and the uniform of the troops quartered here is dark green faced with red formerly they never washed themselves now they paint their faces red and white their white paint is made of rotten wood and russian glass calcined selenites their red of a seaweed sertularia boiled in seals fat with this they rub their cheeks till they are very red  the kuriles are better able to buy good clothes than the kamtschadales for the former can purchase for one seabeaver as much as the latter can for twenty foxes and one beaver costs a kurilian no more trouble in catching him than five foxes do a kamtschadale inside of a kamtschadale house for the latter must be a good hunter that catches more than  0 foxes in a winter whereas a kurilian thinks himself unlucky if he does not catch three beavers in the season besides the numbers that are cast on shore by storms  time immemorial the kamtschadales have lived in fixed habitations or villages they formerly fortified these by entrenchments palisadoes and ramparts of earth and of course the russians have given these villages the name of ostrog or redoubt but they are not suffered to entrench themselves now though their villages are yet so called every family has a winter and a summer house the jourt or winterhouse is thus formed they dig a hole in the ground about five feet deep the breadth and length proportioned to the number of inhabitants in the middle of this hole they erect four wooden pillars over these they lay balks on which they form the roof or cieling leaving in the middle a square opening which serves them for window chimney and door this done they cover the building with grass and earth so that it resembles on the outside a round hillock but within it is an oblong square with the fireplace in one of the long sides between the pillars and the walls of their hut three parts round they fix broad platforms made of boards raised about six inches from the ground like a taylors shopboard on which each of the family lies separately having first covered them with mats on that side opposite the fire there are no benches this place being left for their kitchenfurniture the walls are adorned with grass and mats these huts are entered at the hole above between the pillars by an illformed ladder a kind of balk with steps cut in it and it being nearly over the fireplace for the convenience of letting out the smoke when they are heating their huts the steps of the ladder are sometimes so hot and the smoke so thick that it is almost impossible for any but a native to go up and down without being burnt or suffocated yet a kamtschadale finds no difficulty in this but fixes his toes on the steps of the ladder and mounts like a squirrel nor do the women hesitate to go through this smoke with their children on their shoulders though there is another opening through which the women are allowed to pass but if any man should presume to do the same he would be laughed at here they live all the winter at their feasts and entertainments the hotter the jourts are made for the reception of the guests the greater the compliment they betake themselves to the jourts the middle of october and continue in them till the middle of may five or six families live in one jourt but each family has a summertent to itself  their balagans or summer houses are built with laths like pidgeonhouses raised about    feet from the ground on nine posts fixed into the earth in three rows some in circular form and others in an angular the balks inclining to each other at the top give them a conical appearance the walls and roof are covered with wood and thatched with long grass these huts are very small and many of them being built close together boards of communication like bridges are laid across one to the other and frequently they fix boards round these tents in which they sit abroad in fine weather these raised huts have two doors each in the sides opposite to each other are raised thus high to defend them from the plunder of wild beasts and to prevent the inconvenience of the damp ground which is very moist in summertime as these huts are not very strong a brisker wind than usual shakes them to and fro but notwithstanding this precaution of raising their magazines so much above ground bears in harvesttime will often make a shift to climb up and plunder them underneath these huts they tie their dogs  they have also other houses called isbas or loghouses these are raised with long timbers piled horizontally the ends being let into one another and the seams caulked with moss the roof is sloping like that of our common cottages and thatched with coarse grass or rushes the inside consists of three apartments at one end is the entry a room that runs the whole width and height of the house and holds their sledges harness and bulky household goods this communicates with the middle and best apartment furnished with broad benches or platforms for eating and sleeping on out of this is a door into the kitchen one half of which is taken up by the fireplace so contrived by being let into the wall that separates the kitchen from the middle room as to warm them both over these two rooms are two lofts to which they ascend by a ladder in the entry each room has two small windows of talc or fishskin to let in the light the beams and boards of the cieling are dubbed with a hatchet planes they have none and from the effects of the smoke are black and shining as jet  the governors house is built with logs as above and thatched but much larger consists of three handsome rooms neatly papered the windows of talc the town of bolcheretsk where he resides consists of several rows of low buildings each consisting of five or six dwellings besides a welllooking church a courtroom and barracks for the soldiers the inhabitants of this town altogether amount to between   and  00 the governor major behm lived here with his wife and family  the southern kamtschadales commonly build their villages which shall not however consist of more than  0 or  0 huts in thick woods and other places naturally strong and not more than    miles from the sea their summerhabitations are near the mouths of rivers but those upon the perichinska sea and the eastern ocean build their villages very near the shore they consider the river near their village as the inheritance of their tribe  before the arrival of the russians they used stones and bones instead of metals out of which they made their hatchets spears arrows needles and lances hatchets were made of the bones of whales and reindeer and sometimes of agate and flint they were shaped like a wedge and fastened to crooked handles with these they hollowed out their canoes boats dishes and troughs which with cans of birchbark constituted the whole of their furniture but with so much trouble and time that a canoe would take three years to make it and a large boat one year on this account a large canoe or trough was held in great estimation and a village in possession of such a one set the highest value on it in these bowls they dress their victuals and heat their broth by throwing redhot stones into it  their knives were made of a greenish mountainchrystal sharp pointed shaped like a lancet and stuck into a wooden handle of such crystals were made the points of their arrows spears and lancets which last they now use to let blood needles were formed of sablebones and with these they used to embroider very curiously but now the russians have furnished them with useful materials of all kinds  notwithstanding they imitate the russians in a great degree they have a number of peculiar customs some of which are very extraordinary and which will always be retained from the nature and the inclemency of the weather they prefer procuring of fire by friction to the use of flints and spunk to procure fire they make a small hole in a piece of dry wood in which they turn a stick so rapidly between their hands that it takes fire the eskimaux indians on the labrador coast do the same and is a proof of their former communication pounded hay serves them for tinder as some of them delight in war the russian merchants are prohibited from selling them any warlike instruments but they are ingenious enough to make spears and arrows out of the iron pots and kettles which they purchase and they are so dextrous that when the eye of a needle breaks they will make a new one and so repeat it till nothing remains but the point  in former times they never ate till they were hungry but now they have regular meals as what they eat is always cold they have very fine teeth the flesh of land and the larger seaanimals is boiled in troughs the broth they drink out of ladles and bowls and the meat they take out upon boards and eat with their hands they divide their fish into six parts the sides and tail are hung up to dry the back and the inner part of the belly are prepared apart and generally dried over the fire the head is laid to sour in pits then eaten like saltfish and much esteemed though it stinks intolerably the ribs and flesh upon them are hung up and dried and then pounded for use the larger bones are dried and given to the dogs  their second favorite food is caviar or the roes of fish which they dry in the air and never take a journey or go a hunting without it and if a kamtschadale has a pound of this he can subsist a great while without any other provision for every birch and aldertree furnishes him with bark which with his dried caviar makes him an agreeable meal but they cannot eat either separately for the caviar sticks to the teeth like glue and it is almost impossible to swallow the bark chew it ever so long  they have a third diet called chupriki thus prepared in their huts over the fireplace they make a bridge of stakes on which they lay a heap of shellfish which there remains till the hut is as warm as a bagnio it is there smoked and roasted and has a very agreeable taste and may be reckoned the best of all their cooking for the whole juice and fat being prepared with a gradual heat and kept in by the skin this skin when the fish is done is stripped off and the guts taken out and spread on mats to dry  they have also another dish called huigul which is fish laid in pits to sour and putrify and though the stench is intolerable the kamtschadales esteem it a perfume this fish rots so much often in these pits that it cannot be taken out but by ladles in which case it is given to their dogs  there is a principal dish at all their feasts called selaga made by pounding all sorts of roots and berries together with the addition of caviar and whales and seals fat  before the conquest of the russians they seldom drank any thing but water except at festivals when they drank water in which mushrooms had been steeped now they drink spirits as fast as the russians after dinner they drink water and at night set a vessel by their bedside with the addition of snow or ice to keep it cool and always drink it up before morning in winter they frequently amuse themselves by throwing handsfull of snow into their mouths  they eat and drink amazing quantities notwithstanding they are poor they are very hospitable but their hospitality is original the host to do the honors of his house heats his winterhut to a considerable degree and by never ceasing to press his guest to stuff down his shocking food forces him to swallow such a quantity of it that he must vomit and the more he vomits the more is he pressed to eat when a man has done such justice to his friends entertainment he has secured to himself every service it is in the power of his entertainer to do him to be a little more particular on this subject when any man seeks the friendship of another he invites him to his hut and for his entertainment dresses as much of his best victuals as might serve ten people as soon as the stranger comes into the hut which is made hot for his reception both he and the host strip themselves naked then great plenty of victuals is set before the guest and whilst he is eating the host throws water upon redhot stones until he makes the hut insupportably hot the stranger endeavors all he can to bear this excessive heat and to eat up all the victuals whilst the host is still endeavoring to oblige him to complain of the heat and beg to be excused from eating all up it is reckoned an affront to the host not to be able to accomplish this and a niggardliness in the host not to urge his friend till he complies during this operation the host eats nothing himself and may go out of the hut to cool himself but the stranger is not suffered to stir till he acknowledges himself overcome at these feasts they gorge to such a degree as not to be able to bear the sight of food for three days afterward and are scarce able to move  when the stranger has gorged himself to the full and can no longer endure the heat he purchases leave to retire with presents of dogs clothes and other things this however is considered as no injury for he expects in turn to treat his friend in the same manner  in their banquets they treat their friends much in the same way except that they do not torment them with heat nor expect any presents when they entertain with the fat of seals or whales they cut it out in slices and the host kneeling before his company with one of these slices in one hand and a knife in the other thrusts the fat into their mouths crying in a surly tone ta na and with his knife cuts off all that hangs out of their mouths after they are crammed as full as they can hold so do the eastjaiks see the plates of the eastjaiks  to kill a bear is to perform an heroic deed on this occasion the hunter proud of his achievement invites his friends to a feast which consists of pieces of lard cut from the bear and handed round among the guests each of whom grasps it in his hand takes a bite and passes it to his next neighbor  part of their employment is to make boats and sledges their boats are made of poplarwood but the kurilians not having any wood make use of what is thrown on shore by the sea the koraiks make their boats of the skins of seaanimals sewed together with whales beards and caulked with moss or nettles beaten small  these boats hold two persons one sits in the prow the other in the stern they push against the stream with poles but when the current is strong this is so troublesome that they can scarcely advance two feet in ten minutes notwithstanding this they will push these boats full loaded    miles and even twice the distance when the stream is not very strong the larger boats carry  0 or  0 puds when goods are not heavy they lay them on a float or bridge resting on two boats joined together  the men pass the greatest part of their time in debauchery and idleness if they pursue any employment it is hunting fishing and looking a little after their household affairs the chase furnishes them with game but is always attended with danger they are expert fishers and are well acquainted with all the proper seasons for it their nets are made with nettleflax at times the men are also employed in building huts forming different utensils and making bows and arrows they cut grass for mats and contrary to the custom of all other nations the business of the kitchen belongs to the men and they assist each other not from selfish motives but from friendship bears they kill chiefly with a gun and there is such a natural affection in these animals that if they fire at a young cub when the mother is near and the cub drops the dam will become enraged to a degree little short of madness and if she gets sight of her enemy will only quit her revenge with her life they never therefore fire at a cub if its mother be near if the dam be shot the cub will not leave her side even after she has been dead a long time but continue about her showing by a variety of affecting actions and gestures marks of the deepest affliction and thus become an easy prey to the hunters  nor is their sagacity less extraordinary in order to catch the bareens which are too swift of foot for them they will have recourse to the following stratagem these animals keep together in large herds frequenting mostly the low grounds and browsing at the feet of rocks and precipices the bear hunts them by scent till in sight when he advances warily keeping above them and concealing himself among the rocks as he makes his approaches till he gets immediately over them and nigh enough for his purpose he then begins to push down with his paws pieces of the rock among the herd below and when he finds he has wounded one so as not to be able to escape he pursues him overtakes and devours him  from this digression i will proceed to the employment of women which is in tanning converting nettles into thread mats and baskets drying fish and preparing isinglass roots and berries to tan skins they scrape off the hair rub it with fat and fishroe and squeeze it in by twisting it in their arms they make shammoy leather of reindeer skins by fermenting it with the bark of the aldertree and a decoction of the same bark the kamtschadale women are excellent sempstresses and embroider admirably with nettlethread and the tendons of animals the women look also after the reindeer and dogs women also are the only tailors and shoemakers it is a disgrace for the men to do any thing of the kind they are also employed in dying skins in comforting and curing the sick  chap iii of their manners customs genius etc though the kamtschadales imitate the russians in a great degree they have as i said a number of customs peculiar to themselves they sleep quite naked on mats and their outer garments covering themselves with their clothes they are a dirty lazy people and so careless that they often find themselves exposed to the most extreme indigence they eat out of the same vessels with their dogs and without cleaning them they are commonly covered with vermin and like the tunguse amuse themselves with catching and eating them they let their nails grow to their natural length which are always full of nastiness besides painting of themselves the women endeavor to add to their beauty by plastering on their faces the thin cawl or skin which covers the entrails of the bear some of these ladies affect a modesty wear veils and turn away their eyes from strange men those that have not natural hair sufficient wear false locks and they will often put on to the amount of ten pounds weight so that their heads shall look like a haycock  they have a lively imagination a strong memory and such a genius for imitation that they copy with ease whatever they see their songs and tales are full of wit and pleasantry they are great mimics take off the way of speaking and motions of strangers and turn them into ridicule they pay little regard to the customs of their ancestors but when they change it is generally for the worse and are more apt to follow bad examples than good they seldom give themselves the trouble to reflect and forget their faults too soon to improve the future regulation of their conduct for which they have no manner of concern their curiosity is unbounded insomuch that dreams are matters of such moment as to claim all their attention love is their predominant passion and goodnature their chief characteristic these form a strange contrast to their negligence and insensibility which makes them not only indifferent to the pleasures of life but even to life itself poverty gives them no concern and nothing but hunger can call them to the chase and then they seldom go so far but they can return at night to the arms of their women they care not how their food is dressed so they have enough to fill their bellies nor of what quality their liquor is of so as it does but intoxicate in short they are given to sensuality they talk with regret of the happy times of their ancestors who could walk up to the ancles in the overflowing of a drunken debauch whilst in their days they can scarcely wet the soles of their feet their immoderate lust proceeds even to bestiality and the men contrary to the custom of other eastern nations make themselves the voluntary slaves of the women to gratify their lascivious desires pederasty is practiced almost publicly the women too are as much addicted to a profligate libertinism as the men and not only indulge with their own nation and expect such a return for every service they do to strangers but also pursue unnatural means to gratify their passions steller who was among them a long time attributes this insatiable lust to their daily use of halfrotten fish fishroe rancid fat and onions but especially to their excessive indolence  they are remarkable for their cowardice boasting and slavishness to people who use them hard and for their obstinacy and contempt of those who treat them with gentleness  they have a very confused notion of honor and shame kind treatment has no effect upon them therefore to render them more civilized less knavish and more serviceable than they naturally are they must be treated with severity pleasure and inaction are their only objects of course they steal nothing but women and dogs which formerly were the continual causes of national war they are cowardly and base to an extreme gratifying their revenge only by the darkest and most secret means the least apprehension of danger drives them to despair and as they have no hope of futurity they fly to suicide as a relief not only from present but even from imaginary evil not only those who are confined for offenses but such as are discontented with their lot prefer a voluntary death to an uneasy life and the pains of disease the ancient people of the north says aelian used to kill men when they became through old age a burden to themselves and society and children will strangle their aged parents at their own request as do the eskimaux indians which we have seen but the kamtschadales will dispatch themselves when any disease has rendered them infirm they want courage to bear great pain and always seek relief in suicide if a woman brings forth twins they commonly kill one of them and perhaps throw them to their dogs likewise every weak child and such as are born with any defect if a woman finds her pregnancy an inconvenience to her she endeavors to effect a miscarriage that she may more easily renew the indulgence of her desires the sick and malefactors meet the most terrible death without any emotion  in their social life the men secure the affections of the women by rough and free caresses by little assiduities and by acts of submission and obedience but the men among themselves take no manner of notice of one another either by bowing shaking hands or other salutations their abusive words are koscha koaughwitsch kana kaiktschitsch that is dog hanged villain devil and accusations of preposterous lusts  their diversions consist of feasts at which they eat and drink sing whistle through a pipe made of a cabbagestalk dance and tell stories singing is the most favorite amusement of the women their voices are agreeable and their songs are either national or composed extempore the exploits of their gods and heroes and the adventures which their ancestors and themselves have met with in hunting are the subjects of their tales and fabulous stories and their dances like those of the eastjaiks are pantomimic their beardance is an exact counterpart of every attitude and gesture peculiar to this animal through its various positions and this is the foundation and groundwork of all their other dances  when a kamtschadale resolves to marry he looks about for a bride in some of the neighboring villages seldom in his own and when he finds one to his mind he discovers his inclination to her parents desiring that he may have the liberty of serving them for some time this permission he readily obtains and during his service shows an uncommon zeal in serving them the time of his service expired he desires the liberty of seizing his bride which if he pleased her parents in his service is granted if disapproved of he is dismissed with some small reward to catch a girl is their term for marriage and when he has obtained liberty to seize her he seeks every opportunity of finding her alone or with few people for during this time all the women of the village are obliged to protect her besides she has two or three different coats and is so swatned round with fishnets and straps that she has scarce more motion than a statue if the bridegroom happens to find her alone or with few in company he throws himself upon her and begins to tear off her clothes for to strip the bride naked is the marriageceremony this is not always an easy task for though she is able to make but little resistance herself yet if any women are about her they all fall on the bridegroom without mercy beating and dragging him by the hair scratching his face and using every a kamtschadale wedding method they can think off to prevent him accomplishing his design if the bridegroom is so happy as to obtain his wish he immediately runs from her and the bride as a proof of being conquered calls him back with a soft and tender voice and thus the marriage is concluded this victory is seldom attained at once but sometimes the contest will last a whole year and after every attempt the bridegroom is obliged to take time to recover strength and to heal the wounds he has received there is an instance of one who after having persevered for seven years instead of obtaining his bride was rendered a cripple the women having used him very barbarously  as soon as the ceremony is over he is at liberty next night to go to her bed and the day following carries her off to his own village after some time the bride and bridegroom return to the brides relations where the marriage feast is celebrated in the following manner of which the writer of this account was an eyewitness in       the bridegroom his friends and wife visited the fatherinlaw in three boats all the women were in the boats and the men being naked pushed them along with poles about one hundred paces from the village to which they were going they landed began to sing and used conjurations with tow fastened in a rod muttering something over a dried fishs head which they wrapped in the tow and gave to an old woman to hold the conjuration being over they put on the bride a sheepskin coat and tied four images about her thus loaded she had some difficulty to move they then returned to their boats and came up to the village where they landed a second time at this landingplace a boy of the village met them and taking the bride by the hand led her along all the women following  when the bride came to the hut they tied a strap round her by which she was let down the ladder the old woman who carried the fishs head going before her this head she laid down at the foot of the ladder where it was trodden on by the bride and bridegroom and all the people present and then thrown into the fire  all the strangers took their places having first stripped the bride of her superfluous ornaments the bridegroom heated the hut dressed the victuals which they had brought with them and entertained the inhabitants of the village the next day the master of the hut entertained the strangers winh great abundance who at the third day departed the bride and bridegroom remaining to work some time with their father the superfluous parts of the brides dress were distributed among her relations who were obliged to return her presents of far greater value  these ceremonies only relate to a first marriage for in the marriage of a widow the man and womans agreement is sufficient but he must not take her to himself before her sins are taken away this can only be done by some strangers lying with her once but as this taking off of sin is considered by the kamtschadales as very dishonorable for the man it was formerly difficult to find one to undertake it so that the poor widows were at a great loss befure the russians came amongst them since which they have been at no great want of strangers to take away their sins  marriage is forbidden only between father and daughter mother and son a soninlaw may marry his motherinlaw and a fatherinlaw his daughterinlaw and first cousins marry frequently their divorce is easy consisting only in separating beds in such case the man immediately marries again and the woman accepts another husband without any further ceremony  a kamtschadale has two or three wives with whom he sleeps by turns sometimes he keeps them all in one hut and sometimes in different ones with every maid he marries he is obliged to to go through the abovementioned ceremonies though these people are fond of women they are not so jealous as the koraiks nor are the women more jealous for even their wives will live with one husband in great harmony even though he should also keep concubines  like the brasilians and americans and the ancient thracians they set no great value on the virginity of their brides and hence proceeds the generosity with which the kamtschadale girls bestow their favors on the russians having no reason to fear any reproaches on this head from their future husbands the kossacks and soldiers of the garrisons had formerly little seraglios at their service  though many women do all they can to disqualify themselves from breeding there are some who ardently wish to be mothers and to that end use superstitious means some swallow spiders others call in the aid of magicians who perform a great many ridiculous ceremonies to render them fruitful the women are not very fruitful they have commonly very easy births for in a quarter of an hour afterward they will appear abroad about their ordinary business and without any change of countenance they have no professed midwives the mother or nearest relation performing the office some friend who calls in to see them gives a name to the child the most common of which are rosko pickengour aphaka they have a very tender but illdirected affection for their children who so far from being obedient to them treat them with harshness and cruelty  the kamtschadales are in general strong and healthy some of them are maimed from accidents in traveling or falling from high rocks the scurvy abscesses foul humors the venereal disease pleurisy mortifications jaundice and inflammations of the eyes are their common disorders for the scurvy they eat wild berries and raw fish the venereal disease was among them before the arrival of the russians inflamed eyes proceeds from the dazzling whiteness of the snow they formerly inoculated their children for the smallpox by scratching the face with a fishbone dipped in variolous matter but as this distemper has made no appearance for a number of years they dropped this salutary practice when in      it was unluckily brought there by a soldier who had a long time been cured of it and this scourge of the human race then raged so dreadfully as to sweep away twothirds of the nation  these diseases they think are inflicted upon them by the spirits that inhabit particular groves if they ignorantly happen to cut down a tree there their chief remedies consist in charms and conjurations though they neglect not more specific remedies they very thankfully acknowledge that they owe the little advancement they have made in physic and surgery to the bears that by remarking with what herbs these animals rub the wounds they receive and what they have recourse to when sick and languid they have become acquainted with most of the simples in use among them  when bitten by a dog or a wolf they lay the bruised leaves of the ulmaria upon the wound drinking a decoction of them at the same time the leaves and stalks pounded they use in bruises and use the decoction for the bellyach toothache and scurvy in the jaundice they take the roots of the iris sylvestris clean them beat them in warm water squeeze out the juice and use it as a clyster two or three times a day this purges and relieves if after some time it does not cure they repeat it they let blood by raising the skin with wooden pincers and piercing it with a crystal lancet in pains of the back they rub the part afflicted before a fire with the root of cicuta being careful not to touch the loins which they say would occasion spasms in pains of the joints they place a pyramid of birch fungus over it set it on fire and let it burn till it comes to the skin which then cracks and leaves a wound that discharges a good deal of matter the root of the anemonides or ranunculus is made use of to poison their enemies and they also poison their arrows with it  instead of burying their dead they bind a strap round the neck of the corpse draw it out and leave it near the hut to be devoured by their dogs under a notion that such as are eaten by dogs will drive with fine dogs in the other world and by leaving them near the hut they suppose those evil spirits whom they imagine were the cause of its death seeing the dead body may be satisfied with the mischief they have done however they generally remove to some other place when any one has died in the hut and leave the body in it  all the clothes of the deceased they throw away from an opinion that any one wearing them will come to an untimely end after the decease of any one they use the following purification going to the wood they cut a few rods of which they make a ring and creeping through it twice they carry it to the wood and throw it toward the wood those who dragged out the body are obliged to catch two birds of some sort or other one of which they burn and eat the other with the whole family this purification is performed on the same day for before this they dare not enter any ones hut but their own nor will any one enter theirs in commemoration of the dead the whole family dines upon a fish the fins of which they burn in the fire  chap iv of their learning language religion government trade etc the kamtschadales have no knowledge but what they acquire in their narrow circle of life and in pursuance of the impulses of nature they have neither letters nor hieroglyphics their language is national and peculiar though inclining to that of the mongols and as it adopts no foreign term is very difficult to learn they endeavor to give every thing such a name as will express the property of it but if they do not understand the thing thoroughly themselves they take a name from some foreign language which perhaps has no relation to the thing itself thus for example they call a priest bogbog because probably they heard him use the word bogbog god bread they call brighsatin augsh that is russian root  probably the kamtschadales and the mongols might formerly have been one and the same people for as the chinese mongols have so have the kamtschadales many words ending in ong ing sang chin cha ching ksi and ksung  they are ignorant of the causes of eclipses but when they happen they carry fire out of their huts and pray the luminary eclipsed to shine as before they know only three constellations viz the great bear the pleiades and the three stars in orion they count by tens and are such poor arithmeticians that they cannot arrive at that number without using their fingers  it is very diverting to see them attempt to count above ten for having reckoned the fingers of both hands they clasp them together which signifies ten then they begin with their toes and count to  0 after which they are confounded and cry metcha that is where shall i take more they reckon ten months in the year some longer and some shorter and divide them by the order of particular occurrences as the month koakouaisch is that when the cuckoo is first heard and so on they divide our year into two so that winter is one year and summer another the summeryear begins in may and the winter in november they do not distinguish the days by any particular appellation nor form them into weeks or months but mark their epochs by some one moveable event as the raging of the small pox the arrival of the russians the great rebellion and the like  like all other barbarous nations the kamtschadales have no notions of a deity but what are absurd ridiculous and shocking to a humanized mind their ancient national religion is schamanism their idolatrous worship like that of the jakutes they call their god kutchu but pay him no religious worship and the only use they make of his name is to divert themselves with it they relate such scandalous stories of him as one would be ashamed to repeat among other things they reproach him with having made so many steep hills so many small and rapid rivers so much rain and so many storms and in all their troubles they upbraid and blaspheme him however they celebrate always three days in the month of november hence called the month of purification after their summer or harvestlabour is over they consider it as a sin to do any work or make any visits before these holidays the breach of which they never suffer to pass without expiation from hence we may see that the ancestors of these people were accustomed to offer up the first fruits of their summerlabours to god and at the same time make merry with one another their ceremonies in the celebration of their holidays are silly to the extreme and consist of many ridiculous antics  they erect a pillar on a large wide plain which they bind round with rags whenever they pass this pillar they throw a piece of fish or some other victuals at it and near it never gather any berries or kill any beast or bird this offering they think preserves their lives which otherwise would be shortened however they offer nothing of any use to themselves only the fins and tails of fish or such things as they would be obliged to throw away in this all the people of asia agree offering to their idols only such things as are useless to themselves besides these pillars several other places are esteemed sacred such as burning and smoking mountains hot springs and some particular woods which they imagine are inhabited by devils the chief of whom they call kanna the world they believe is eternal and the soul immortal and that it shall be again joined to the body and live eternally subject to fatigues and troubles as in this present life with this difference only that they shall have greater plenty of every necessary even the smallest animal they imagine will rise again and dwell under the earth they conceive the earth to be flat and that under it there is a firmament like ours and under that firmament another earth in which when we have summer they have winter and when we have winter they have summer with regard to future rewards and punishments they believe that in the other world the rich will be poor and the poor rich  their notions of vice and virtue are equally extravagant they believe every thing lawful that gratifies their passions and conceive that only to be a sin from which they apprehend danger and ruin so that they neither reckon murder selfmurder adultery oppression or the like any wickedness on the contrary they look on it as a mortal sin to save any one that is drowning because according to their notions who ever saves him will be soon drowned himself they account it also a sin to bathe in or drink hot water or to go up to the burning mountains they have besides these innumerable absurd customs such as scraping the snow from their feet with a knife or whetting their hatchets upon the road it may however be said that they are not the only people who have ridiculous superstitions  besides the abovementioned gods they pay a religious regard to several animals from whom they apprehend danger they often fire at the holes of sables and foxes when fishing they entreat the whales or seahorses not to overturn their boats and in hunting beseech the bears and wolves not to hurt them  they fill almost every place in heaven and earth with different spirits and offer them sacrifices upon every occasion some carry little idols about them or fix them up in their huts but with regard to god they not only neglect as i have said to worship him but in case of troubles and misfortunes curse and blaspheme him  every old woman is looked on as a witch and an interpreter of dreams and there are magicians who pretend to conjure and are called guispahas in their conjurations they whisper to the fins of fish and some other things by which they think to cure diseases avert misfortunes and foretell futurity they are in general great observers of dreams which they relate to each other in the morning as soon as they awake judging from thence of their future good or bad fortune and some of these dreams have their interpretations fixed and settled besides this they pretend to chiromancy and to foretell a mans fate by the lines of his hand  all this ignorance and superstition will however be soon rooted out from among them their strong bent to imitation has led them to embrace christianity so that at present there are few who are not converted chapels of worship are built in almost every village and schools erected to which the kamtschadales send their children with great pleasure but as the people neither fear nor love god and the very idea of a providence appearing to them ridiculous they make no better christians than they were idolaters all their actions concentering in sensuality and having no conception of a paradise destitute of an indulgence of their present desires the schools however will teach their rising generation better principles there is little doubt but the christian religion being there transplanted will rise and flourish in that remote corner of the world as it has done in more southern climes  what shall be said of their government their societies are distributed into families each family has a separate ostroschok or hamlet consisting of a few small houses and situated in general near some river when a young man marries he removes into the hamlet to which his wife belongs when a village becomes too populous they separate and form a new village but always on the same river the oldest of these villages the stock of collateral hamlets enjoys some prerogatives as pretending to have been the abode of one of the sons of the founder of the kamtschadale nation who must be a descendant of their god kutchu they pay a deference to old men of the villages but their authority is very circumscribed they have no punishment but for theft and murder the fingers of a thief are burnt that he may be known and detested a murderer is delivered into the hands of those whom he has injured who may and often do make him suffer the most cruel torments  formerly whole villages were often in a state of warfare which arose from their frequent attempts to carry off the women from one anothers hamlet and though they had no ambition of increasing their power or enlarging their territories before the russian conquest they had such frequent quarrels that seldom a year passed without one village or other being entirely ruined  their wars were carried on more by stratagem than bravery for being naturally cowards they never attack but from necessity their selfmurder arises more from fear of encountering misfortunes than daring to die when they do attack it is in this manner they steal into the enemys village by night and surprise them which is easily done as they keep no watch thus a small party may destroy a large village having nothing more to do than to secure the mouth of a hut suffer none to come out but one at a time and of course knock down that one or oblige him to submit and be bound in their former wars with the koraiks when a village was blockaded and they had no hope of dislodging the enemy it was common for the men first to kill all the women in the place and then themselves knowing that were they to surrender they would not meet a better fate the bow and arrow the pike and the club were all their offensive and defensive arms their quivers are made of the larchwood glued round with birchbark their bowstrings of the blood vessels of the whale their arrows are about four feet long pointed with bone and are very dangerous being all poisoned so that a person wounded by them generally dies in    hours unless the poison is sucked out they have also coats of mail made of mats or sealskin cut into thongs and plaited together these are worn on the left side tied with thongs upon the right behind is fixed a high board to defend their heads and another before to guard the heart  it is remarkable that when they march two never go abreast but follow each other in the same path which by use becomes very deep and narrow so that it is impossible for one that is not used to it to walk therein for they always set one foot strait before the other in walking  their constant hostilities furnished opportunities of aspiring to the dignity of toyons or chiefs of parties but their present situation has made a change the political relation in which they stand is almost the same with that of the other siberians they have russian overseers and are obliged to give hostages for greater security every tributarymale must furnish a sableskin or some other of equal value the russians have divided them according to the ostrogs where they pay their tribute and according to this division there are about  000 natives including men women and children but were the number three times as great the inhabitants would be but few for such an extent of ground and still fewer if we consider that in the most northern ostrogs the koraiks belonging to them are included in the number  the russians have five forts in this country and near the same number at ingiga which though to the north of the peninsula are under the governor of kamtschatka in these sorts are about four hundred russians and cossacks and besides this there are some few russian traders emigrants and exiles in some of the ostrogs or hamlets are but  0 or  0 natives captain king passed four extensive ostrogs and did not find a single inhabitant in them so thinly are they scattered so that in the present diminished state of the natives with fresh supplies of russians and cossacks perpetually pouring in and intermixing with the natives by marriage it is probable that in less than half a century there will be very few of them left  the governor of this country in      resigned that command the same year and left the place and was succeeded by captain shmaleff the russian government is here mild and equitable but a military one the natives are permitted to choose their own magistrates from among themselves in the way and with the same power they ever had one of these under the title of toyon presides over each ostrog and is the referee in all differences imposes fines and inflicts punishments for all crimes this toyon has the appointment of an officer to assist him and act under him  by an edict of the present empress no crime whatever can be punished with death but in cases of murder the punishment of the knout is inflicted with such severity that the offender generally dies under it the greek religion is here introduced and missionaries settled  it is to this place that many criminals are transported from different parts of the empire and without doubt it is the most horrid place of exile of all the vast empire of russia captain king met there with a celebrated exile the hospodin ivaskin a gentleman of a considerable family in russia his father was a general in the empresss service and he himself having received his education partly in france and partly in germany had been page to the empress elizabeth and an ensign in her guards at the age of    he was knouted had his nose slit and was banished first to siberia and afterward to kamtschatka where he had now lived    years he was a very tall thin man with a face furrowed all over with deep wrinkles and bore in his whole figure the strongest marks of old age though he had scarcely reached his   th year no one ever knew the cause of his banishment but they took it for granted that it must have been for something very notorious particularly as two or three governors of kamtschatka have endeavored to get him recalled since the present empresss reign but far from succeeding in this they have not been able to get the place of his banishment changed he told captain king that for  0 years he had not tasted bread nor had been allowed subsistence of any kind whatever but that during this period he had lived among the kamtschadales on what his own activity and toil in the chase had furnished that afterward he had a small pension granted and that since major behm was governor his situation had been mended that he had procured his pension to be increased to  00 rubles yearly which is half the pay of an ensign in this place this gentleman had forgotten both the french and german so totally as not to understand what was said to him in either of these languages  the trade of this country formerly was confined to procuring the necessaries of life bartering with the koraiks for sables fox and white dogskins for deerskins clothes and other hides it is a custom here among the natives that when one wants a thing another has he goes freely to visit him makes known his wants and though a stranger the other will accommodate him  the commerce with the russians as far as concerns the exports is entirely confined to furs and carried on by a company of merchants instituted by the present empress these are bought with money so that there is a great circulation of specie in the country articles of importation are european manufactures english dutch siberian and chinese they consist of coarse woollen and linen cloths yarn stockings bonnets and gloves thin persian silks cottons nankeens silk and cotton handkerchiefs brass coppers and pans iron stoves files guns and gunpowder hardware such as hatchets bills knives etc lookingglasses flour sugar leather boots etc and these sell for treble the price they might have been bought for in england and though the merchants have so large a profit on these imported goods they have still a larger on the furs at kiachta on the frontiers of china which is the great market for them the best seaotter skins sell generally in kamtschatka for about  0 rubles each a ruble about  s  d english the chinese merchants at kiachta purchase them at more than double that price and sell them again at peking at a great advance where a farther profitable trade is made with some of them at japan if therefore a skin is worth  0 rubles at kamtschatka to be first transported to okotsk thence to be conveyed by land to kiachta a distance of      miles thence on to peking   0 miles more and after this to be transported to japan what a prodigious advantageous trade might be carried on between kamtschatka and japan which is but a fortnights or at most three weeks sail from it  the duties arising from the exports and imports amount annually to about  0000 rubles there are six vessels of  0 to  0 tons burden employed by the empress between okotsk and bolcheresk two ports in kamtschatka in transporting stores and provisions besides these there are about    vessels employed by the merchants in the furtrade among the eastern islands where the trade is chiefly carried on indeed the whole sea between kamtschatka and america is covered with islands  an account of the koraiks and tschouktsches the koraiks inhabit the northern coast of the gulf penchinskoi and the most northern part of kamtschatka to the river anadir their country extends westward from the river olomon to the indian ocean they are a nomade and shepherdpeople and the country they wander over is rude marshy full of small rocks and in many places destitute of forests  some of these people are however settled in the northern part of kamtschatka on the eastern coast and have a strong resemblance to the kamtschadales their dress and habitations are of the same kind they are tributary to the russians and are under the district of the ingiga the koraik women make lines upon their faces as do the tunguse live on the same kind of food as the kamtschadales and dress it equally as nastily  the wandering koraiks are employed wholly in breeding and pasturing deer of which they possess great numbers a chief will have a herd of four or five thousand their sledges are drawn by reindeer not by dogs nnd though when not wanted will pasture with others yet when called will instantly quit the herd and attend upon their master these two nations of the koraiks speak different dialects but neither of them bear the least resemblance to the kamtschadale  the history of this savage people is enveloped in the thickest darkness having no knowledge of it themselves they are without the least education quite uninformed and were not known before the russians subdued them there is nothing more probable than that all these different nations are colonies from america before the russians came among them riches alone conferred prerogative but now they are under the same laws and regulations with other siberians pay their tribute in furs but are not more numerous than the kamtschadales  hunting and fishing are the chief employ of these people not spending their time in the kitchen as do the kamtschadales but leaving that to the women their social manners are not agreeable though they profess a great deal of friendship making every one welcome who goes to see them but not stuffing them against their will as do the kamtschadales they keep their huts exceedingly hot and the women whilst in them go quite naked they travel in winter in sledges something like the laplanders managing the deer with leather reins to which is tied a comb so that by pulling the rein it pricks the neck of the reindeer and spurs him on they sometimes put two abreast and will travel  00 miles a day they never kill a deer eating only such as die by accident or disease and to this their numerous herds are owing the poor go into the service of the rich and join their little herds to those of their masters  the wandering koraiks are much more savage than those which are settled often making parties to go and plunder their neighbors before they enter on such an enterprise they always drink of the decoction of the intoxicating mushroom to inspire them with courage their arms are the bow and arrow a lance and a club theft rapine and murder among themthemselves are criminal but heroic acts when committed on others their greatest pleasure is looking at their numerous herds which are always too great to be counted and yet if one strays it is immediately known  the koraiks are all polygamists some having four wives these are not purchased but caught in the manner of the kamtschadales the rich marry among each other without any regard to relationship the wandering koraiks are exceedingly jealous and torment their unhappy wives cruelly the and their gallants are often sacrificed to an illfounded suspicion but the settled koraiks err as much in the other extreme they are pleased to see their wives noticed by strangers and the caresses the wife receives is so much pleasure bestowed on the husband they make an offer of their wives and daughters to strangers as companions for the night an acceptance of such an offer is considered as a test of friendship and a refusal a mark of contempt which is sure to displease  we find a similar custom mentioned in scripture the women also with cords about them sitting in the ways burn bran for perfume but if any of them drawn by some that passes by lie with him she reproacheth her fellow that she was not thought as worthy as herself nor her cord broken baruch vi     herodotus charges the ancient babylonans with the like and it still obtains among some of the south americans probably the custom of bundling still practiced in the interior parts of north america among the civilized people is the remains of this old custom if a gentieman goes to visit at a farmhouse where there are any marriageable daughters if he stays the night with them he is always invited to bundle or sleep with one of them which he likes best he sleeps in his breeches and she in her petticoat and if the fair one has the constancy and resolution to rise a virgin she may probably gain a husband in her bedfellow among the koraiks this politeness is attended with a disagreeable circumstance to the favored stranger for his fair partner makes water in his presence and offers him a bowl of it to wash his mouth with  the old women name the children they neither swaddle them nor use cradles but suckle them till three years of age in sickness they have recourse to their priests who cure them by a charm and always burn their dead having built a pile they draw the corpse there on a sledge dressed in its best clothes and on this pile burn it with all the arms and utensils of the deceased killing the reindeer that drew it there eating its flesh and throwing the remains into the fire they are schaman idolaters and their ceremonies resemble those of the kamtschadales  tschouktsches the people of tschouktsk have so strong a resemblance to the koraiks that they are certainly descended from the same stock they inhabit that promontory in siberia which extends from the rivers anadir and kolyma to the northeast and separates the frozen sea from the northern ocean they are says captain king a stout wellmade bold warlike race of people formidable neighbors to the koraiks the russians have many years endeavored to bring them under their dominion and after losing a great many men in their different expeditions for this purpose have not been able to effect it as they lie in latitude    the climate is cold the soil marshy abounding in rocks barren bare of woods and extremely wild and savage the summer lasts only a few months but in this season the days are very long as for several weeks the sun does not set at all the winter extends through the greatest part of the year and during this melancholy season it is almost one continual night the inhabitants are similar to the country the most savage barbarous most untractable the least civilized the most rugged and cruel of all the nations of siberia the history and strength of this people is yet unknown but by a probable computation they are estimated at   00 males capable of bearing arms captain cook says they are certainly a distinct nation from the americans on the opposite coast though the straight that separates the two continents is but    leagues wide for the americans on that coast at least such as he had seen were rather low of stature with round chubby faces and high cheek bones whereas the tschouktsches on the eastern coast of asia have long visages and are stout and wellmade their dress he speaks only of the men consists of a cap a frock a pair of breeches a pair of boots and a pair of glove all made of welldressed leather or the skins of deer dogs or seals some with the hair or fur on others without it their caps are made to fit the head very close and over these caps they wear hoods of dogskin large enough to cover both head and shoulders their hair is black but is cut close to the head and none have any beard  such as came down to the coast when captain cook approached the shore were armed with bows and spears or spontoons and as the last were of iron or steel he is persuaded they were of european or asiatic workmanship and that they get them by trading with the russians the staves of these spears were carved and inlaid with brass and white metal their arrows were pointed with bone or stone some few of them had barbs these were in a leather quiver slung over their left shoulder and their spears were slung by a leather strap over their right shoulder most of their quivers were extremely beautiful being made of red leather neatly embroidered and ornamented indeed barbarous as muller calls them captain cook says that several other things and in particular their clothing showed that they were possessed of a degree of ingenuity far surpassing what one could expect to find amongst so northern a people they mark not only their faces but their hands and arms as do the tunguse with black figures bore their ears and wear earrings of glass beads  we found the village continues he where we landed composed both of summer and winterhabitations the latter are exactly like a vault the floor of which is sunk a little below the surface of the earth one of them which i examined was of an oval form about  0 feet long and    or more high the framing was composed of wood and the ribs of whales disposed in a judicious manner and bound together with smaller materials of the same kind over this framing was laid a covering of strong coarse grass and that again covered with earth so that the outside of the house looked like a little hillock supported by a stone wall three or four feet high built round the two sides and at one end and at the other end the earth is raised sloping to walk up to the entrance which is by a hole in the top of the roof over the built end the floor was boarded and under it a kind of cellar in which i saw nothing but water probably the floor is so contrived to keep the house dry from the draining of the land at the end of each house was a vaulted room apparently a storeroom communicating with the house by a dark passage and with the air by a hole in the roof which is on a level with the ground we walk on but they cannot be said to be wholly under ground as one reached to the edge of the hill along which they were made and which was built up with stone over it stood a kind of sentrybox or tower composed of the bones of large fish  their summerhuts are pretty large and circular being brought to a point at top the framing is of slight poles or bones covered with the skins of seaanimals in the inside there is a fireplace just within the door and near this lie generally some few dirty vessels made of wood or leather their bedplaces are close to the side and take up about half the circuit some privacy is probably observed as they have several partitions made with skins their bed and bedding are made of deerskins and are generally very dry and clean  about their habitations are erected several stages ten or twelve feet high composed of fishbones in which they dry their fish out of the reach of their dogs of which they have a great many of the foxkind large with long soft hair like wool captain cook supposes these dogs constitute part of their food as he saw several lie dead that had been killed that morning  they neither eat raw flesh nor fish says took but dress their food by hanging it in the smoke sausages are their favorite dish which they dress by smoking they have numerous herds of reindeer but never milk the female of course like the koriaks want butter and cheese nor will they kill a reindeer for food without the utmost regret but eat such as die naturally game of all kinds sea animals whales cast on shore and shellfish water is their constant drink except when they mean to get drunk to do this they drink the decoction of the intoxicating mushroom which they procure from the kamtschadales in exchange for reindeer skins  the care of their deer is their principal occupation yet they both hunt and fish in the number of their reindeer consists all their wealth some will have  0000 some  0000 tis nbles them to furnish the fixed koriaks and kamtschadales with skins for clothing those tschouktsches who possess not a single deer as is the case with some join fortunes together and live in common by hunting and fishing catching the whale morses and the like the women of this nation follow the same employments with the koraik women  the morse vulgarly called the seahorse probably from morse and horse being so similar in sound says captain cook who killed and examined many of them has nothing like a horse about it it is more like a cow and is doubtless the same animal that is found in the gulf of st lawrence and there called a seacow but its similitude to a cow is in nothing more than the snout in short it is an animal like a seal but incomparably larger the dimensions he gives us of one which was none of the largest is as follows tschceksches and sea horses ft ins length from the snout to tail     height of the shoulder as it lay on the ground   length of the fore and hind fins     circumference of the neck close to the ears     ditto of the body at the shoulder    0 weight of the whole carcass without entrails   00lb  they lie in herds of many hundreds on the ice huddling one over the other like swine and roar and bray very loud so that in the night or in foggy weather they gave us notice says captain cook of the vicinity of the ice before we could see it we never found the whole herd asleep some being always on the watch these on the approach of the boat would wake those next them and the alarm being thus gradually communicated the whole herd would be awake presently but they were seldom in a hurry to get away till after they had been once fired at then they would tumble one over the other into the sea in the utmost confusion and if we did not at the first discharge kill those we fired at we generally lost them though mortally wounded they did not appear to us to be that dangerous animal some authors have described not even when attacked they are more so in appearance than in reality vast numbers of them would follow and come close up to the boats but the flash of a musket in the pan or even the bare pointing at one of them would send them down in an instant the female will defend the young one to the very last and at the expense of her own life whether in the water or upon the ice nor will the young one quit the dam though she be dead so that if you kill one you are sure of the other the dam when in the water holds the young one between her forefins this animal seems to shed its teeth for the largest and the oldest of them had not tusks more than six inches in length we killed many of these animals and eat them for fresh provisions the lean parts are coarse black and have rather a strong taste but this grew less disgusting by use my men preferred it to salt meat the heart tasted like a bullocks heart the fat at first is as sweet as manna but in a few days grows rancid unless salted when melted it yields a good deal of oil which burns well and their hides were useful about our rigging  in this voyage captain king sailed up through the streights northward to the latitude of  0    m with a view of sailing eastwards round the coast of america or westwards round that of asia but met with such fields of ice as rendered it impracticable and convinced him there was no safe passage for shipping on either coast in these high latitudes he met with nothing but the seahorses i have described and some white bears one of which he shot and gives us the following dimensions of ft ins from the snout to the end of the tail     from ditto to the shoulder bone     height of the shoulder     circumference near the fore legs    0 breadth of the fore paw  0  weight of the four quarters    lb  these animals are of the kind with those lord mulgrave met with in his voyage to the north pole their flesh is fishy but infinitely superior to the seahorse but to return to the tschouktsches  the manners and customs of this people resemble much those of the islanders of these latitudes several families often live together in the same pit having their apartments separated by upright poles the habitation is commonly full of smoke and is so hot that the women sit always stark naked even in the coolest part every division has its particular lamp of fishoil and a wick of moss their beds are only low benches covered with furs and they are by constitution so inured to the cold that the flame of a lamp is always sufficient to warm them in the open air when they travel they are drawn in sledges by reindeer their canoes are made of the ribs of whales covered with sealskins and after the manner of the greenlanders and esquimaux sit in them as in a purse drawn close round their body they are about    feet long narrow and flatbottomed  with respect to their ferocity they are naturally as revengeful and dangerous as the tunguse their neighbors are mild and gentle twenty tschouktsches never hesitate a moment about attacking  0 koraiks and had it not been for the russian forts or ostrogs the former would long ago have exterminated the whole koraik nation nay the very ostrogs built in their neighborhood are in continual danger  notwithstanding their characteristic of ferocity and cruelty they are very hospitable not compelling their guests indeed to gorge themselves but will kill a reindeer for their entertainment which they never do for themselves after the manner of the koraiks they offer to their guests the most enchanting beauties at their disposal to make the night agreeable to them and these fair ones never forget that charming piece of gallantry of presenting a cup of their urine to such as accept their favors  their manner of taking wives of educating their children their rejoicings and their interments are exactly the same as among the koriaks like them they are of the schamane religion their ideas of virtue and vice are exceedingly confused it is held criminal to thieve or murder in a family or race to which a person belongs but these crimes committed elsewhere are not only allowed but held honorable and glorious they have a bad opinion of a young girl who has never acquitted herself cleverly in some theft and without such testimony of her dexterity and address she will scarcely find a husband and robberies committed on the circumjacent families are considered as heroic acts they swear to the truth of a thing in the name of the sun and when conquered by their enemies give their priests as hostages and pledges of their obedience  they live in families according to their races but have no formal superior they obey the most wealthy and sagacious among them preserving at the same time the most perfect independence and the right of following each his own particular inclination they think little of death bear the troubles inseparable to human life with great reluctance of course are very indifferent as to existence and ready to terminate their sufferings by suicide a circumstance that has thrown great obstacles in the way of their subjection  of the kurilians the chain of islands running in a southwest direction from the southern promontory of kamtschatka to japan extending from latitude    to    are called the kuriles according to spanberg they are    in number not reckoning the small ones the most northern is called shoomska and is not more three leagues from the continent the next to the south is called paramousir is much larger than shoomska and inhabited by its own natives their ancestors according to a tradition among them having come from an island rather more to the south called onecutan those two islands were first visited by the russians in      and then brought under subjection the others in order are at present made tributary and the pastor of paratounca in kamtschatka is their missionary and visits them once in three years the most southern island is nadeegsda and represented by the russians who trade to it as inhabited by a race of men remarkably hairy and who live in a state of entire independence spanberg places this island in     0 n latitude and mentions his having watered here and that this wateringparty brought off eight of the natives of whom he relates the following circumstances that their bodies were covered all over with hair that some of them had silver rings pendant from their ears that they wore a loose striped silk gown reaching to their ancles that seeing a live cock on deck they fell on their knees before it and likewise before the presents that were brought to them closing and stretching forth their hands and bowing their heads at the same time to the ground and that excepting the peculiarity of their hairiness they resembled the other kurile islanders and spoke the same language the journal of the ship cashicom which first discovered this island and called it jeso speaks of the people being covered with hair such a man was if i recollect right exhibited some time since in london but not from this part of the world  a trade of barter is carried on between matmai and the kurile islands in which for furs dried fish and oil they get silk cotton iron and japanese articles of furniture the inhabitants of as many of the islands as are under the dominion of russia are converted to christianity and probably the time is not very far distant when a friendly and profitable intercourse between kamtschatka and this whole chain of islands will be brought about which will open a communication with japan itself a very desirable and advantageous thing to the russiaas  these islands are all mountainous and in several are volcanoes and hotsprings as in kamtschatka on some of them are forests on others none but the climate of the whole is temperate they seem to have been formed by a chain of mountains beginning at kamtschatka and ending at niphon whose valleys being sunk into the sea have left their summits above water of various magnitudes the nearest to kamtschatka is shoomska only three leagues from it and the furthest island of the chain called matmai is only eight leagues from japan and about the same distance from the western continent of china  the chief of these islands are inhabited but many small ones are desert and uninhabited and they differ in situation and natural constitution the more northern ones have forests of laryx and pines the more southward produce canes bulrushes bamboos vines etc in some of them are bears foxes and jovis musimon of pallas they are not very populous for all the islands subject to russia in      were enrolled at no more than     males they are a friendly hospitable generous humane race of people excelling the kamtschadales not less in the formation of their bodies than in the docility and quickness of their understandings their language is agreeable to the ear and they speak and pronounce it slowly their habitations are dug in the earth like the kamtschadales only neater are wainscoted and furnished with japan goods their food consists of amphibious and seaanimals and all kinds of game fowls fish fruits wild roots and seacabbages a species of the fuci and also sweetmeats from japan  the dress of the northern islanders resembles that of the tunguse it is made of swanskin and other aquatic fowls they cut their hair close to the head and wear hats woven of reeds the southern kurilians love a thick beard let their hair grow and stain their lips black these dress like the chinese and wear a japan fabre slung in a girdle over their robe but wear no breeches the women dress like the men but stain their lips blacker and mark their faces hands and arms with black figures fond of foreign fashions they adopt them and mix them with their more natural dress priding themselves in a variety of colors they get their clothes from japan but are very dirty and slovenly  their manner of taking a wife is much like that of the kamtschadales the lover does all he can to obtain the last favor this done he carries her off if she proves unfaithful the husband challenges the gallant and in their duels each strikes his antagonist three blows by turns the women have difficult labors the midwife names the child without ceremony the southern islands bury their dead but the northern ones cover such as die in the winter with straw and leave them they have a particular veneration for old men and when any islanders make a visit to some neighboring isle the inhabitants take up their arms and dress to receive them they treat them like friends salute them by bending the knee embrace and kiss some of them have so much sensibility at these friendly interviews as to shed tears after the first salutations the oldest in company makes a speech in which he relates his adventures and what has happened to him and his friend since the last visit all the company standing up during the recital and listening with the profoundest attention this orator having finished he to whom the visit is paid makes a speech in his turn and every one declares he is much interested in all that has happened to the rest after these assurances of reciprocal friendship an entertainment takes place but filthy enough they sing dance and tell tales their expressions are tender modest and becoming and as they hate lies and fraud they always speak the truth with the utmost fidelity  of the eastern islands america we have observed is separated from the eastern coast of siberia and continent of asia by a straight in which are many islands of various magnitude these also are under the dominion of russia some of those nearest to the coast of siberia have been subject to russia ever since they have been in possession of siberia some of the larger and at a greater distance from the continent have been but lately visited by the russians and many doubtless are undiscovered captain king who went out with captain cook in his last voyage touched at one of them and from him and some of the russian navigators we shall be able to give the reader a tolerable account of them  a map comprehending bherings straits with the adjoining coasts of asia and america   these islands are supposed to extend from the peninsula of kamtschatka to the continent of america in the direction west southwest to east northeast from about    degrees north latitude to    one of the largest of these islands is koumandirskoi lying about    leagues east of the mouth of the river kamtschatka and is about  0 miles in length the land oumnakis about    leagues in circuit and ounalashka is larger than this  some of these islands are so near the coast of siberia that the tschouktsches venture over in their little canoes and the nearest to the american coast is supposed to be the island of kadyak all these islands are alike with respect to soil they are stony mountainous boggy wild and uncultivated in their produce they differ according to their situation and climate some are covered with forests and abound with forestgame the more southern are bare of wood but abound in foxes and other animals that love an open country the seaotter mustela lutris sealion phoca leonina seabear phoca ursina seals and other amphibious animals are found on their shores and the sea throws up seacabbages muscles a variety of shellfish and a quantity of floating timber  some of these islands are inhabited others not and those which are but thinly some having but two or three families and some not exceeding  00 the russians have no settlement on any of them but in      enrolled the inhabitants of all they visited and could make no more than     tributarymales in the whole  two russian vessels make the voyage of some of these islands once a year and collect a tribute from all they visit the different islanders seem to be about as much distinguishable from each other as the different tartar tribes in siberia and their language varys but little the natives of kadiak call themselves kanaguil not unlike karalit the name of the greenlanders and the esquimaux indians  of ounalaskka we shall speak more particularly  the inhabitants of these islands in general are stout and robust but active their faces are flat and their skins fair they have lank black hair and but little beard they have a good share of plain natural understanding and their children learn foreign languages with great facility they seem cold and indifferent in all their actions but rouse them and they are furious and revengful without any regard to consequences the least apprehension drives them to despair and the least affliction to selfmurder though free and independent they are neither fraudulent nor perfidious they will offer their wives to those who behave friendly to them but whoever shall presume to offer violence to a woman is sure to pay the forfeit of his life  there is such a perfect equality among them that they have no chief or superior nor any law or punishment they enjoy life without any bitter recollection of the past or any anxious solicitude for the future they live in a society of families called a race mutually defending each other if strangers of a neighboring isle come to visit them in small companies they are amicably received but if in larger bands they are repulsed with arms the inhabitants of the same island considering that island as their own they have no knowledge of letters are ignorant of their own history totally void of education or any kind of information but what immediately respects their way of life to give a specimen of their language agaiya signifies the sun touguilag the moon tana the water katschik the wind kiguenag fire taiyagha man ayagout woman yaga wood  they have no connection with any island but their own and have no domestic animals not even dogs game they kill with snares and arrows and fish by enclosing parts of rivers and catching it in baskets the women are employed in this business equally with the men and partake of all their labors the siberian women surpass these in tanning but these surpass the siberians in embroidery they dress in furs and since the arrival of the russians among them wear the worst and barter away the best for shreds and remnants of cloth thread needles beads and other trifles  these happy people are so contented with their lot that the master of a tolerably good pit thinks himself the first man in the world provided he has a good number of women a strong canoe and such clothes as would be considered as handsome in no other place yet these haughty islanders do not possess the least article that would have any value with an european nay they scarce enjoy so much authority as to make their children in the least obedient  their arms and movables are a perfect picture of the infancy of the world the bow and arrow the dart the lance and the sling the club and the shield are all their weapons and they can throw a javelin three feet long to the distance of  0 fathoms equal to a greenlander  their baidars or boats are several fathoms long and will carry from five to  0 persons they are badly made and with much trouble being constructed of floating timber hewn with sharp stones or of the ribs of a whale covered with seahorse skin their common canoes hold no more than two persons and seldom weigh more than about   lb  their habitations are like the kamtschadales only larger their beds are mats or furs and they light their pits with lamps suspended from the roof a whole village or several families will live in a single pit to the number of from  0 to  00 persons and a stranger first entering them by a hole in the roof must conceive he is descending into hell a gloomy darkness a thick smoke a heat often insupportable the pale light of stinking tapers a number of beings all wild and naked having nothing human but the figure a great abundance of vermin food the most miserable and disgustful a constant noise and din a horrible stench worse than that of styx all these together form the picture presented to a stranger descending into these subterranean caverns but they have summerhuts also like the kamtschatdales abounding also with inhabitants many of them pass their whole life in holes of rocks or in natural caverns which they find  their furniture is as simple as their houses troughs made of drift wood shells hollowed stones baskets bark and leathervessels straw mats sharp stonehatchets and knives utensils of bone and where the russians usually land some few skillets and boilers  persuaded that nature never meant to conceal their shape they go always naked within their huts as well adults as children indeed their huts are kept so hot that dress would be burdensome in this easy negligence the two sexes converse together and whenever they are abroad they throw of all their dress as soon as it becomes inconvenient some however wear a fur or leatherapron and many like our forefathers hide their nakedness only with a leaf not so much for decency as security against injury  in many of the isles both sexes ornament their faces arms and hands by staining them with the figures of birds beasts and flowers by pricking the skin till it bleeds and rubbing the part with a black powder many bore their ears with a number of holes through which pass gaudy feathers strings of beads and other ornaments as a great quantity of hair is by them esteemed ugly the men pluck out the greatest part of their beards by the roots the women cut their hair before and tie up the rest on the crown in a tress some men shave their heads close with sharp stones and others leave a round tonsure the generality are so filthy as never to wash themselves and with their nastiness and copper complexion are truly ugly those who do wash wash with their own water and then with spring water and these have a good skin and look fresh and well both men and women throughout the isles make two deep incisions when young in the lower lip and a hole in the cartilaginous separation of the nostrils and when they mean to dress fix in these incisions in the lip two slender teeth turned upwards and smoothly polished about two inches long through the hole in their nose they pass a little bone of a bird in order to swell out the nostrils some that wish to be smarter than ordinary will make a third incision in the lip and fix some colored stone in it  when they wear a dress it is a frock like that of the koraiks reaching to the knees made of the bellyskin of various waterfowl those of the women are made of skins with the fur inwards and worn next the skin the outside stained with a red earth and this is all their dress except in summer they will sometimes wear a wooden hat scooped out in the shape of a ducks beak about    inches long from the fore part to the hind these they paint with colored earths decorate the edges with feathers the crown with a bunch of sealions hair eight or ten inches long and surround them with glass lead and bunches of feathers so as to resemble a roman helmet some on the top place an image of a man sitting about an inch high tolerably well covered in stone other islanders wear conical caps made of skin and embroidered with broad fringes of hair and the sides and borders ornamented with feathers and embroidered with the sinews of animals hair and glass beads which they get from the russians others will skin a waterfowl in such a manner that the neck wings and tail shall remain with the skin and in drying them keep the head and neck erect and the whole in a good shape and put their head into the body of the bird these caps are worn by women and are the handsomest part of their dress they vary these caps in a number of ways but all equally ornamented their best garments are made of the bellyskins of different fowls shaped like shifts and reaching to their heels the borders prettily embroidered two inches broad and a quantity of stripes of fine furs six or eight inches long tied all round it at bottom there is a furbelow six inches broad made of a number of strait slips of skin  their food is agreeable to what the islands produce they eat whales seahorses porpoises seaotters seabears sealions beasts of prey and other game all sorts of fowl birds of prey and others and all kind of fish in short except insects and their fellow creatures nothing comes amiss to them either in the animal or vegetable kingdom and they will eat them halfrotten salt is unknown to them generally speaking they eat all their food raw so that the blood of the flesh they devour runs out of their mouths through the incisions in the lower lip what they do dress is either warmed in the flame of their stinking lamps by sticking it on large skewers and turning it round in that flame or by stewing it between two stones hollowed out for a pan and its cover the joints being cemented with clay after thus dressing it they set it by till it is cold their drink is water and if they have not fresh at hand they will drink seawater as a treat they will gulp down the blubber of whales porpoises or other fish they are not fond of spirituous liquors but from the russians many of them have learnt to take snuff  every family or village has a certain extent of seacoast appropriated to their sole use from which they collect for food any fish or dead animals that may be cast ashore nor does any stranger presume to invade this territory if he does he is in danger of being shot or knocked on the head  simple and natural as the life of these islanders is it does no great credit to the state of nature as the natives are but a small degree above the level of the brute creation they are of a serious turn very laconic in their conversation rude and uncivilized but at the same time from carelessness generous and hospitable they have no id of subordination or decorum but every one follows his own propensities eating when they are hungry and even performing the evacuations of nature whilst they are eating children almost fill the pit in which they live with their ordure and grown persons seldom go further than the roof of course the stench is intolerable in times of scarcity they will fast several days together at home they go quite naked practice propagation as their inclination leads them whether in public or out without any reserve and the women are delivered in the presence of any one that may chance to be with them without the least privacy their beds are mats and their clothes are their only covering  their matrimonial connexions scarce deserve the name of marriage a boy old enough to hunt or catch fish takes home one or two girls or women and they live together in the same pit without any previous contract a man generally selects his first wives himself but if he is a stout fellow and a good huntsman or fisherman maidens deserted women widows and wives dismissed from their husbands will offer themselves to them so that many will have four five or six wives where a household has been thus formed there is generally a gang of old men women and children all are welcome and employed according to their strength but when times are not prosperous with such a family they disperse as easily as they form the men go to seek provisions elsewhere women take to other men and carry their children with them and this without disorder or dispute for the women are as independent and free as the men men will sometimes truck away their wives and children and such wives and children will sometimes return to their original home and in this pure state of nature we see fewer disagreeable consequences than under more regular institutions  ignorant of the exclusive right of a married state these islanders know no jealousy but leave their wives in a perfect freedom of promiscuous intercourse with other men as they engage in wedlock with no other motive than to have an assistance in gaining a livelihood they are not subject to excessive libertinism they neither envy any mans pleasure or good fortune and as buxom women are preferred to maidens girls are suffered to grow up in perfect liberty totally unconstrained by either virtue or modesty  women have easy labors frequently bathe their children in cold seawater and whenever a child cries it is plunged under water even in the coldest weather till it is silent they suckle their infants but a short time feeding them with raw and gross meat and to make them squat down on their heels often tie their feet together and place them in that attitude  but savage as they are they are not insensible but will seek to soften the rubs of life by various amusements they make no festivals either at their nuptials the birth of their children or their religious exercises yet they pass the whole month of december in visiting not only their neighbors but the adjacent isles a successful chase a visit from an unexpected friend or the carcass of a whale thrown on the coast will cause a rejoicing on this latter occasion that of a whale being cast ashore it becomes the property of the whole island the people assemble from all parts express the most extravagant joy perform idolatrous worship round the animal then strip themselves naked and proceed to cut up and divide the prey this done they put on their best clothes swell out their nostrils decorate their lips with crooked bones and devour all the parts that are eatable with demonstrations of excessive transport at these celebrations they beat a kind of kettle drum sing dance tell stories and indulge their amorous propensities this drum is the only musical instrument they have and they dance and beat it in procession before their visitors their dances are regular but backwards and forwards several persons make a long string and perform a number of leaps and gesticulations they have at this time also masquerades concealing their faces with wooden masks representing the form of various animals the men attend these quite naked except a small apron or purse worn before but the women ate clothed having danced enough they break their drums and masks couches are then brought the women are courted and the host of the entertainment furnishes such of his guests with ladies as brought none with them when their visitors are leaving them the parting is cold the host neither conducting them on their way nor the guests expressing any thanks for the kind reception they have met with  they are pagans and their faith is schamanism as is indeed that of all the eastern siberians though less sensual than these islanders they have no distinct idea of gods their influence on mankind nor of a future state they have neither festivals nor any degree of worship their magic priests are like those of kamtschatka who pretend to be related to and connected with spirits and boast of knowing the past and the future  like other schamanders they inter with the dead sundry utensils to enable them to begin the other world with they suppose the volcanoes the smoking rocks of their island and sundry great caverns to be the abode of their spirits and to these objects their prayers are addressed but they have in their habitations certain small idols which they rub with blood and grease as their food they are terrified at ghosts and specter and it is with great reluctance that they inhabit the huts of any deceased person of course left such huts should be useless they carry the sick out of them and suffer them to die in the open air they bury their poor in their clothes wrapping them up in mat with certain utensils and implements of hunting but the rich they dress in their best garments place them in a little canoe hang it to a kind of gallows and thus suffer it to rot in the air  they have generally a good constitution and preserve it to a very advanced age the smallpox is unknown to them and the scurvy itch fevers and many other distempers are seldom met with their teeth continue firm and white even to old age and if any one finds himself unwell he keeps a perfect regimen for a few days and is perfectly recovered for the headache they open a vein in the head with a sharp flint and dress their wounds with healing herbs which their country affords they have little fear of pain and as they make glue by a preparation of the blood of animals if they have no such blood at hand they will without hesitation strike themselves on the nose with their fist and attain from themselves as much as they have occasion for  the russian troops and merchants cossacks and others who frequent these islands lead but a troublesome life they embark at kamtschatska visit different places and seldom perform the voyage in less than a year at these times they receive the tribute barter with the natives a variety of small merchandise beads and trinkets for furs the russians themselves are suffered to hunt when there and the tartars will attend them on the occasion the russians have their own barracks on shore never lodge with the natives nor trust themselves alone with them for though the islanders generally treat them with curtesy yet if any suspicion is broad they resolve on destroying every foreigner and that without reflection  oonalahska  of all the groupes of islands in the northsea that of which oonalahska is one is by far the greatest and this island the principal of them all this group extends  0 leagues from oonalahska to f n f the russians have a settlement on this island which at present consists only of a dwelling house and two storehouses besides the russians resident here are a number of kamtschadales and some of the natives as servants or slaves to the former these all live in the same house the russians at the upper end the kamtschadales in the middle and the natives at the lower end where is fixed a large boiler for preparing their food which consists chiefly of what the sea produces with the addition of wild roots and berries there are russians settled on all the principal islands between oonalashka and kamtschatka for the sole purpose of collecting furs their great object is the seabeaver or otter they have frequented oonalashka since the year      the latitude of samganoodka the principal haven of oonalashka and where captain cook lay in october      is      min n the longitude      0 min w  the russians here settled are obliged to put up with the food of the country but captain cook says he got some whales flesh of their dressing and it was very palatable and they treated him with a kind of panpudding made of salmonroe beat up very fine and fried which is a good succedaneum for bread which they seldom can procure as to liquor they have none but the juice of berries which they sip at meals as the island supplies them with food so does it with clothes which consist chiefly of skins their upper garment is made like our waggoners frock and reaches to their knees besides this they wear a waistcoat or two a pair of breeches a fur cap and a pair of boots the soles and upper leathers of which are made of russian leather but the legs of strong gut  the natives are to all appearance peaceable and inoffensive and honest to the extreme perhaps made so from strict discipline they have their own chiefs on each island and seem to enjoy liberty and property unmolested they are low of stature but plump and wellshaped with short necks chubby faces black eyes small hands and long strait black hair which the men wear loose behind and cut before but the women tie up in a bunch  both sexes wear the same kind of clothes the difference is only in the materials the womans frock is made of sealskin like a carters frock that of the men is made of the skin of birds both reach below the knee this is the whole dress of the women but the men wear over their frock another made of gut which repels water and has a hood over it that draws over the head some wear boots and all of them a kind of ovalsnouted cap made of wood with a rim to admit the head these caps are dyed with green and other colors and round the upper part of the rim are stuck the long bristles of some seaanimal on which are strung glass beads and in the front is a small image or two made of bone  inhabitants of oonalashka   they use no paint but the women puncture their faces slightly and both men and women bore the under lip in which they fix pieces of stone at oonalashka indeed it is an ornament only used by the women some fix beads to the upper lip and all of them hang ornaments in their ears  their food consists of fish seaanimals birds roots berries and seaweeds they dry large quantities of fish in summer which they lay up in small huts for winteruse and probably they preserve roots and berries for the same time of scarcity every thing is eaten almost raw boiling and roasting are their only means of cookery some have got little brass kettles and those who have not make one of a flat stone with sides of clay not unlike a raised pie i was once present says captain cook when the chief of oonalashka made his dinner of the raw head of a large halibut just caught before any was given to the chief two of his servants eat the gills without any other preparation than squeezing out the slime this done one of them cut off the head of the fish took it to the sea and washed it then came with it and sat down by the chief first pulling up some grass upon a part of which the head was laid and the rest was strewed before the chief he then cut large pieces of the cheeks and laid these within the reach of the great man who swallowed them with as much satisfaction as we should do raw oysters when he had done the remains of the head were cut in pieces and given to the attendants who tore off the meat with their teeth and gnawed the bones like so many dogs  as these people use no paint they are not so dirty in their persons as the savages that do but they are equally lousy and filthy in their houses they live in a pit as do the kamtschadales generally an oblong square about  0 feet by  0 over this pit is raised a wooden roof first covered with grass and then with earth so that without it has the appearance of a dunghill in the middle of this roof toward each end is left a square hole one to admit the light and the other for an entrance as by this hole they descend into the hut by a post with steps into it round the sides and ends of the huts the families for several lodge in one house have their separate apartments where they sleep and sit at work not on benches but in a kind of concave trench dug all round the inside and covered with mats so that this part is kept tolerably decent but the middle of the hut common to all is far otherwise for although it is covered with dry grass it is a recess liable for all kinds of filth and the place for the urinetrough the stench of which is not mended by raw hides or leather being constantly steeped in it behind and over the trench are placed the few effects they are possessed of such as their clothes mats and skins  inside of a house at oonalashka   their furniture consists of bowls spoons buckets cans matted baskets and perhaps a russian kettle or pot all these utensils are very neatly made and well formed and yet they have no other tools than a small piece of iron fitted into a crooked wooden handle resembling an adze and a knife there are few if any of them that do not take snuff chew and smoke tobacco  a luxury that bids fair to keep them poor  they did not seem continues captain cook to covet any other iron instruments than needles to sew their canoes and make and embroider their clothes for thread they use the sinews of animals they are excellent makers of baskets and mats which are not only beautiful but strong in short there is such a neatness and perfection in most of their workmanship that shows they neither want ingenuity or perseverance  their houses are lighted and heated by lamps having no fireplaces these lamps are made of a flat stone hollowed out like a plate about the size of one filled with oil and the wick is a piece of dried grass over these they occasionally sit and warm themselves fire is produced both by collision and attrition the former by striking two stones against each other on one of which brimstone is rubbed the other by two pieces of wood as among the kamtschadales greenlanders and eskimaux indians  no such thing as a weapon is to be seen among them having probably been disarmed by the russians nor have they any large canoes probably likewise a political prohibition their canoes are built after the manner of the greenlanders they are about    feet long a foot and a half broad in the middle and    or    inches deep they will occasionally carry two persons one of whom is stretched at full length in the canoe and the other sits in the seat or round hole which is nearly in the middle round this hole is a rim or hoop of wood about which is sewed gutskin that can be drawn together or opened like a purse the man seats himself in this place draws the skin tight round his body over his gutfrock and brings the ends of the purseskin over the shoulder to keep it in its place the sleeves of his frock are tied round his wrist and it being close round his neck and the hood drawn over his head and these confined by his cap the water can scarcely penetrate either to his body or into the canoe if it should it is taken out of the canoe with a sponge they will put their canoes on at the rate of seven miles an hour by striking the water with a quick regular motion on each side the canoe with a doublebladed paddle which they hold with both hands in the middle  their fishing and huntingimplements lie ready on their canoes for use strapped on for safety and differ little from those used by the greenlanders  fishes common to other northern seas are found here north of  0 small fish is not to be met with but the whales are more numerous seahorses are seen in prodigious numbers about the ice and the seaotter is an animal peculiar to this sea  the few landbirds we saw says captain cook are the same with those in europe but there are many others i had not an opportunity of knowing sea and waterfowls are not met with here in such numbers nor in such variety as in the northern parts of the atlantic ocean  there are no deer in oonalashka or any other of these islands not have they any domestic animals not even dogs hence it is evident that the sea and rivers supply the inhabitants chiefly with food they are obliged also to the sea for wood i mean driftwood for not a stick grows on any of the islands nor on the adjacent coasts of the continent  there are a great variety of plants at oonalashka and most of them were in bloom the latter end of june several of them are such as we find in europe and in many parts of america particularly in newfoundland berries there are of various kinds such as brambleberries cranberries hurtleberries heathberries etc and also a brown berry somewhat the taste of a sloe from which brandy might be distilled of culinary plants they have wild purslane peatops a kind of scurvy grass cresses and some others all very palatable on the low grounds is plenty of grass which grows very thick and long and in which catle might subsist at oonalashka the whole year without being housed and the soil in many places seems capable of producing grain roots and vegetables but none is cultivated  the people of oonalashka bury their dead on the summit of hills and raise a little hillock over the grave in a walk says captain cook into the country one of the natives who attended me pointed out several and one in particular by the side of the road over which was raised a heap of stones and i observed that every one who passed added a stone to the number  they are remarkably cheerful and friendly among each other the russians keep up a reserve among them and have no connection with their women merely because they are not christians the venereal disease is general amongst them and they are subject to cancers which those who are afflicted with take great pains to conceal they do not appear to be longlived captain cook saw none seemingly more advanced in life than between  0 and  0  the natives of oonalashka and those on the northwest side of america resemble the greenlanders and eskimaux not only in various particulars of person dress weapons canoes and the like but in their language which warrants this judgment that there is great reason to believe these nations are of the same extraction if so there can be little doubt of a northern communication of some sort by sea between this side of america and the east side through baffinsbay which communication however may be effectually shut up against ships by ice and other impediments  of the schamane religion having had occasion to speak of the pagan religion of the siberians and eastern islanders and having entered but slightly into the doctrines of schamanism my reader will probably not be displeased with some further account of it i will therefore lay before him the great outlines of it without descending to the minutiae  the several pagan nations that inhabit the russian empire are distinguished as the professors of three religions the schamane that of lama and that of the bramins the last is the faith of only a small number of indians found in this empire the former is by far the most numerous branching out into the different sects of finns tartars samojedes eastjaiks manshours mongols etc  the schamane idolatry is one of the most ancient that exists it is the source or origin of the lama the bramine and various other pagan sects this idolatrous sect is without much order or connection and is full of absurdity but i will endeavor to throw it into the best general system i can without entering into the various diversities as followed by different sects  among all the schamanes women are held much inferior to men and are thought to have been created merely for sensual pleasure to people the world and look after domestic affairs of course are treated with great severity and contempt they are scarce allowed the common prerogatives of humanity are held as impure and reprobated by the gods are considered as noxious during the period of their sexual revolutions and in childbirth are supposed dangerous and fatal both to men and animals they are prohibited the worship of idols and are thought to defile every thing they touch they are considered as articles of merchandise and a woman delivered of twins or a deformed child is thought to have had commerce with the devil  yet notwithstanding this universal contempt of the female sex they admit the women to be priestesses and ascribe to them equal preeminence and power with their priests and reverence such women as much both priests and priestesses are distinguished from the laity no otherwise than by their peculiar manner and a little more knowledge of the ceremonies of their faith some are enthusiasts some impostors but the greatest number are a compound of both  their dress has been already described and a plate given to represent it see that of tunguse sorcery the drum is the principal implement of their magic and they pretend to beat it in such a manner as to make spirits appear and disappear at pleasure this drum has been particularly described when we treated of lapland if it was customary for priests of antiquity to follow armies to war it is possible that the use of the drum in regiments might have originated in this religious tabor  the principles and notions of the schamanes are imperfect obscure confused and contradictory but they all agree in essentials they all believe a universal god the creator of all things that he loves his creation knows every thing and is allpowerful but pays no attention to the particular actions of man being too great for them to offend him and to do any thing meritorious in his sight of course as he neither punishes nor rewards it is useless to love him and there is no reason to fear him  most of these heathens think that god is invisible that he has a human figure and that he dwells in the sun or the sky whilst others take the sun itself to be god  different nations have different divinities with different influences but they are all supposed subordinate to the control of the great creator some of these deities are beneficent persons some maleficent of the latter schaitan is the head of all the rest they consider him as the most powerful being after the supreme god represent him as violently wicked but think it possible to appease him and that the schamans or priests are particularly in his favor they hold evil to be a selfexisting substance distinguished by a variety of names but all their notions on this head are confused and unconnected these evil spirits are supposed to be lords of the earth lords of iron spirits of the mountains demons of the forests gods of insects and to dwell in the water under the earth in volcanoes and in forests  besides these different deities they address a certain worship to the manes of their ancestors of the settlers of colonies heroes and all the priests and priestesses of schamanism attributing to these demigods a perfect knowledge of every thing below and a power to procure happiness or succor to their applicants and votaries  the notions they have of the world and the universe are confined within the narrow bounds of that knowledge they are able to acquire in the deserts they conceive the world to be eternal and that future life is but a continuation of the present  man according to them is composed of body and soul is free and his actions arbitrary and as the gods are indifferent to the actions of man he is at liberty to act as he pleases health a thriving flock a numerous progeny and a frequent enjoyment of sensual embraces constitute their supreme felicity misfortunes and the want of these enjoyments are their greatest evils  all the professors of schamanism believe an existence after death but have such uncomfortable ideas of that state as to dread it they suppose death to be a change of the present life into a subterraneous one of the same kind but purely intellectual and spiritual though gloomy and melancholy they attribute a soul to every animal and though they are convinced that every thing rots by dissolution they bury with the dead implements for his use in the other world the more eastern siberians the kurilians and kamtschadales maintain like the mahomedans that the future life though a continuation of the present will be more perfect and their enjoyments greater that they shall possess more wealth and finer women of course they meet death with ardor and often put an end to their existence here with the utmost coolness  the ceremonies of their worship differ according to the different nations but all consist in prayers the worship of the beneficent divinities sacrificing offerings magic rites and superstitious mummery the adorations both public and private prove that many of these nations fear the gods and several discover a sincere devotion all their prayers are very laconic the laity by short but devout invocations pray for a supply of what they want the supplicant turns his face to the sun to a mountain a river or an idol and invokes them as do the roman catholics with great fervency calling on every saint by his proper name  their magic ceremonies are designed to appease malignant spirits and are so absurd and contain so much visible imposture that we cannot allow these people that indulgent pity we owe to men under the guidance of ignorant and deluded priests the laity have honest and good designs in their idolworship but the priests impose on their simplicity and we find that fraud and fanaticism are not incompatible in the human mind  but in spite of all that obscurity and confusion which prevail in the religion of the schamans and its mythology we cannot but discover through them the general notions of natural religion as well as various ceremonies of mosaic law the sacred fire the oblations the adorations the opinions with respect to women with many other articles of schamane faith seem to be borrowed from the ceremonial of judaism the chief causes that contribute to perpetuate their errors are the sensuality and materialism of all their opinions their wild and vagabond way of life their extreme poverty and of course their total want of education all these obstacles in conjunction are a bar to their improvements but if in a future period these or the greatest part of them should be removed there is every reason to suppose from their tractable and excellent disposition they may be induced to shake off their errors and that the christian religion will be transplanted into these the remotest regions of the earth  a description of little russia from perry hanway king wraxall coxe and others having treated largely of the wide extended and uncivilized parts of this vast empire it is necessary i should give my readers some account of that part which is called little russia and which includes the kingdoms of moscow and astracan parts into which within these  0 years european manners have been introduced and in doing this i will resume that system i had adopted in the first volume of this work but which the celebrated journal of pallas induced me to drop whilst speaking of siberia and tartary  chap i of the country climate and productions the country comprised under the name of russia or the russias is of greater extent than all the rest of europe or than was the roman empire in the zenith of its power it stretches from the baltic and sweden on the west beyond kamtschatka and the oriental isles  000 miles and upwards eastward to the most western shore of the american continent which as i have already observed is divided from the eastern coast of siberia by a straight of only    leagues in breadth on the north it is bounded by the frozen ocean and extends on the southeast to china and persia the greatest part of this empire lies in asia of this we have already treated i shall therefore confine myself now to that part which lies in europe  little russia then extends from the   th degree of northlatitude to the  0th or further north but is scarce habitable nearer the pole and from the   st degree of longitude to the  0th reckoning from the meridian of london in the southern provinces the longest day does not exceed fifteen hours and a half whereas in the most northern the sun does not set in summertime for the space of two months together and here during the winter which generally continues seven months the whole country is covered with snow a yard or two deep and the rivers are all frozen up it is natural to suppose therefore that where the climate is so various there must be as great a diversity of soil  dr king who resided eleven years in russia says that the cold at petersburgh which is in the latitude of  0 is during the months of december january and february usually by fahrenheits thermometer from eight to    and  0 degrees below 0 that is from  0 to    degrees below the freezing point that the inhabitants have very little comfort in their winterdays and spend most of their time by the fireside for though the sun may be a little above the horizon for wo or three hours it is seldom seen on account of the thick fogs which so darken the air that it may be rather called dawn than daylight the cold weather begins in august and every one is wrapped in furs till may following the ice in their rivers is a yard thick it is difficult says dr king for an inhabitant of a temperate clime to have any idea of their cold when a person walks out in winter the cold makes the eyes water and that water freezes on the eyelashes so as to hang in isicles these isicles may be seen hanging at the chin of their peasants who wear their beards like a lump of ice but even in this state the icy beard defends the glands of the throat which the soldiers who wear no beards are obliged to guard by tying a handkerchief under the chin all the parts of the face are liable to be frozen though the person so frozen is not himself sensible of it but is commonly apprised of it by those who meet him and advised to rub his face with snow which is their mode of thawing it for the part frozen always turns white should this be omitted and the person so frozen pproach a fire or dip his ears nose or chin in warm water the frozen part will instantly mortify and drop off in severe winters birds have been so benumbed as to be unable to fly and carters sitting in their loaded carriages have been found frozen to death when the thermometer has been at    degrees below 0 boiling water thrown up into the air and spread by an engine has fallen to the ground in ice but notwithstanding this severity of the cold the inhabitants have such various means to guard against it that they suffer much less from it than might be expected mr coxe says that when he was there in january the mercury in fahrenheits thermometer fell to    below the freezing point and yet it did not detain him at home he walked out as usual with no other precaution than his pelisse furboots and cap and as the sun shone bright he found it by no means unpleasant the common people continued at their work as usual and the drivers plied in the streets with their sledges seemingly unaffected with the frost their beards were incrusted with ice and the horses covered with isicles the people did not during this extreme cold add to their ordinary clothing they are careful to preserve their extremities by covering their legs hands and head with fur but leave their necks quite bare and their breasts only covered with a coarse shirt during this time continues mr coxe many women were employed in washing in the river making holes in the ice with a hatchet dipping their linen into the water with their bare hands and beating it with flat sticks the ice formed again almost as soon as they broke it and yet they would stand hours at this work  a proof that the human body may be brought to endure all extremes  coachmen and servants waiting for their masters have been killed by the frost to guard as much as possible against this great fires of whole trees piled up are made in the court yards of the palace and most frequented parts of the town to warm the air the rain that falls in this country yearly exceeds that which falls in england in the proportion of    to     russia is in general a flat country except in the north from petersburgh to pekin in china through independent tartary scarce a mountain is to be seen and from petersburgh to the north of france by dantzic hamburgh and amsterdam there is not the smallest hill  the most considerable rivers are  st the wolga which after traversing the greatest part of muscovy in a course of  000 miles empties itself into the caspian sea it is in most places so shallow that vessels drawing above five feet water can scarcely float except in floodtimes when the largest flatbottomed vessels even carrying  00 tuns find sufficient water the stream in common does not run more than one mile an hour but in floodtime it will run three miles the watermen who navigate this river do it by warping they have three boats to carry out these warps which they take in forwards and thus get on against the stream when the wind is not with them  0 miles a day their barges are so large as to carry from   0 to  00 men in all its long course it has not a cataract to interrupt the navigation and by it the city of moscow has a communication not only with all the southern parts of russia but even into persia georgia tartary and all the countries bordering on the caspian sea  the don is another great river divides the eastern part of russia from asia and in its course eastwards approaches so near the wolga that it was intended to cut a canal between the two and it would have been done but for the interruption of the tartars this river runs near  00 miles and empties itself into the sea of asoph the dnieper which is likewise one of the largest rivers in europe has thirteen cataracts within a small distance rises ar the source of the wolga in the forest of the volkenski a forest of   0 mile in length and that reaches almost to the gates of moscow about  00 miles from smolensko separates the ukraine from poland and discharges itself into the black sea by the acquisition of the province of mohilef it is included within the russian territories the northern and northeastern provinces are in a manner desert but the rest of the country abounds with forests  the principal cities are petersburgh moscow novogorod twer smolensko kiova riga archangel casan and astrachan of some of these i have already spoken  russia being for the most part a level country and extremely well watered by lakes and rivers is abundantly fruitful the communication of one part of the empire with another is laid open by roads and navigable canals so that the northern parts which wanted corn and fruits so plentiful in the south are now supplied with both in the spring of the year as soon as the snow is gone which generally lies on the ground three months the warm weather succeeds every thing looks green and the tulips lilies of the valley and many other fine flowers and herbs spring up spontaneously without culture and vegetation is very quick in all its branches the shortness of the summer does not allow the grain time to ripen well but the peasants contrive to dry it in the following way they construct a wooden building something like the shell of a cottage without windows under this building is a large hollow on which a fire being made the new cut corn in ear is laid on the floor till dry after this it is hung on frames in the open air and then threshed pastures and meadows are very prolific but they have no fruits except strawberries and rasberries as to the finer fruits such as pines apricots grapes pears and cherries they cannot be obtained but in hothouses they have however excellent melons pomegranates and pines from astrachan grapes are brought from astrachan to the empress every three days a distance not less than   00 miles they are preserved in sand and carried between two horses supported in the manner of a litter and are    days on their journey  the russes have a saying that they are very rich in fish and bread and it may be added they have good store of horses cattle and wild game provisions are so cheap that good beef may be bought for three farthings a pound mutton and pork in proportion and bread at about one sixth part of the usual price in england the broadtailed sheep are brought from astrachan and are in flavor something like venison  on account of the severe cold in this country not only waterfowl cranes swans ducks geese snipes etc but almost all sorts of landbirds fly to the southward in winter in infinite numbers and back again in the spring when the snow disappears which in the latitude of moscow is not till about the end of april  their horses are not of a large breed but like those of scotland hardy and serviceable and are seldom shod either in summer or winter they have greyhounds but no hounds their wild beasts are bears foxes boars elks deer wolves wild horses and wild sheep captain perry says he ate part of a wild sheep which was pursued into a river by a wolf and he thought it more tender and palatable than tame mutton they have also martens sables ermines and two kinds of hares one of which turns white in the winter and changes again in summer  there is no country in europe better stocked with bees and their woods accordingly afford great plenty of honey and the wealthy burn nothing but waxcandles the woods and gardens about moscow are full of singingbirds but there being few in the neighborhood of petersburgh government purchased as many as came to six or seven hundred pounds and let them fly into the woods about that capital where it is said they have multiplied exceedingly  with respect to the mines of this country they have been treated of fully when describing tartary and siberia  chap ii of the people and chief cities nothing can be more erroneous than the different accounts of the population of this empire voltaire tells us that by a list taken in      of all the males that paid the polltax including boys and old men the number amounted to near seven millions and if we reckon three times this number for females and persons not registered it will make about  0 millions and to these add   0000 soldiers and  00000 nobility and clergy and foreigners exempted from the polltax and the number will be about  0 millions and a half which with the conquered tartars may be estimated at    millions but mr coxe in a much better calculation in      thinks they may surely be stated at near    millions  the russians are generally speaking a personable people rather dutchbuilt and inclined to be corpulent at least this is what they admire they are hardy vigorous and patient of labor their complexions differ from those of the english or scots but the women think an addition of red paint heightens their beauty their eyesight seems to be defective perhaps owing to the snow the army possess a great share of passive and active valor will live hard and submit to the strictest discipline the temper of the russians however has not been much admired they are held to have good parts but to be very deceitful and not to have a proper sense of shame captain perry who was some time in that country in the beginning of the present century says that the foreigners there used to say that if you wish to know whether a russ is an honest man look in the palm of his hand and if you dont find hair grow there never trust him when they flatter and sooth and profess with oaths and asseverations a great respect for you be well upon your guard for they mean to betray you and so far are they wanting continues he in a sense of shame that they hold it a commendable quality to be a sharper and say that such a man understands the world and will thrive but of an honest man they say un cloup nemeit shiet he is a blockhead and knows not how to live and so little regard have they for their word and so void of any notion of real honor that they have not a word in their language to express it the czar peter took a great deal of pains to inculcate proper principles into them and they do not now deserve so severe a character mr coxe who was there very lately says even the peasants in their common intercourse are remarkably polite to each other they take off their caps at meeting bow ceremoniously and frequently and usually exchange a salute they accompany their ordinary discourse with much action and innumerable gestures and are exceedingly servile in their expressions of deference to their superiors in accosting a person of consequence they prostrate themselves and even touch the ground with their heads  a kind of eastern homage they are greedy however of money and almost always demand previous payment for any article they sell and they seem in general says mr coxe much inclined to thieving it was found necessary to place a guard by the carriage at night where we stopped or every article in it would have disappeared before morning  among the better class of people continues mr coxe nothing can exceed their hospitality we could never pay a morningvisit to any nobleman without being detained to dinner the principal persons of distinction keep open tables and are highly obliged to persons who resort to them without ceremony their tables are served with great profusion and taste they will at the same time have sterlet a kind of sturgeon from the wolga veal from archangel mutton from astrachan beef from the ukraine and pheasants from hungary and bohemia and their common wines are claret burgundy champaigne and english beer and porter in perfection though they have adopted the delicacies of french cookery they despise not the solid joints of the english before dinner even in the houses of persons of the first distinction a small table is spread in a corner of the drawing room covered with plates of caviare dried and pickled herrings smoked ham or tongue bread butter and cheese with bottles of different liqueurs a little of which is generally tasted before dinner their usual hour of dining is three their entertainments are regulated according to the french ceremonial the wine being circulated during meals and the dishes are no sooner removed than the company retire into another room and are served with coffee gentlemen as well as ladies  drunkenness is so common among the lower class of people that it is scarcely esteemed a vice captain perry says that if we ride through moscow on a holiday we shall see both priests and people drunk upon the ground and if you go to help one up he will say by way of excuse it is holidaytime nay he says further that their women of quality are so little ashamed of drinking to excess that they will acknowledge their having been drunk and return thanks to their friends who made them so this was however near a century ago mr coxe says now that among persons of rank they never deviate from the strictest sobriety  mr wraxall tells us and he traveled there in      that the females in this country are all forced and brought forward in despite of nature that during the wintermonths they are constantly in apartments heated by stoves to a great degree from which they enter upon a hasty but hot summer of two or three months the consequence of this added to their warm baths of which they are very fond is that they want like every other artificial production the genuine flavor which nature only can give that charming firmness and elasticity of flesh so indispensibly requisite to constitute beauty the ladies esteemed as beauties here are ponderous and massy and loveliness seems to consist in a womans weighing near  00 lb in giving a description of some of the principal cities i shall have occasion to speak of the people again of course will drop the subject for the present  petersburgh the capital of the empire was founded by peter the great in the beginning of this century and has amazingly increased in size within these fifty years at the death of peter it did not contain above  0000 inhabitants and now the russians assert that there are  00000 but this says mr marshall is an exaggeration the number says mr coxe is about   0000 and the city is perhaps the only one in europe where there are more births than deaths  petersburgh lies in  0 degrees n latitude and is built at the mouth of the river neva on several islands which were once nothing more than marshy spots of mud overrun with reeds as indeed is all the country round but the immortal founder whose undertakings in every thing carried a magnificence of idea in them converted a miserable bog into a fine city for petersburgh is the soul of commerce in all these northern parts it is the foundation on which all the russian naval force has been erected is so well fortified as to be impregnable and the port on which their nursery of sailors most depends but notwithstanding these capital circumstances it must be acknowledged very deficient as a receptacle of the men of war of a great empire for the depth of water the freshness of it the docks yards every thing at petersburgh are against the use of it for that purpose indeed it is at present but an extensive outline which will require future ages to complete it stands on a prodigious extent of ground but as the houses in many places do not join and great spaces are uncovered it is real size cannot be ascertained the houses like those of amsterdam are all built upon piles and indeed the place very much resembles the cities in holland the streets being very broad as broad as the high street in oxford with canals running through many of them and several planted on each side the canal with trees though there are some errors in the plan there are also some regular and well built streets chiefly paved but many of them floored with timber which in accidents of fire carry the communication rapidly the houses are very large and the palaces of the nobility exceed in size those of any other city the public buildings are so numerous as to constitute a fifth or sixth part of the whole capital and the houses of the nobility are mostly vast piles of building and furnished in the same elegant style as at paris or references a

monastery w garden to the corpse of cadets   plan of the city of st petersburgh  london they are chiefly of brick ornamented with a white stucco which has led travelers to suppose they are built of stone mr coxe says there are but two stone buildings in all petersburgh one is the church of st isaac not finished and the other a palace building by the empress on the banks of the neva with hewn granite and marble columns  this palace of the empress is an amazing structure indeed all the capital houses are rather great than beautiful the size is all that strike us and they are stuck so thick with ornaments as to leave us scarce room to judge of their proportion the italian architecture is mixed with the dutch and the whole forms but very inelegant buildings in which true taste is sacrificed to splendour if the eye does not scrutinize into the serate parts of the buildings but takes in only the streets at large the city may be pronounced a very fine one many of the houses are erected with wood the sides consisting of squaresided pieces of timber laid upon each other the roofs are thin deal spars laid pretty thick and lined with laths covered with turf or bark the houses are seldom more than one story high and those of the common people consist of but one room but the public buildings have throughout a very handsome appearance and are like every thing else on a larger scale than elsewhere the churches have generally a large cupola encircled with four smaller ones and covered with gilt copper which has a fine effect in the sunshine  the river neva which runs through the city is in most places broader than the thames at london is deep rapid and as clear as crystal its banks exhibit the most grand and lively scenes they are lined on each side with a continued range of handsome buildings and it has one of the finest walks in the world not a quay but a parade a mile long which is still to be continued further in length it is embanked by a parapetwall and has a pavement of hewn granite over the river is a bridge of pontoons but a russian peasant has projected the sublime plan of throwing a wooden bridge of a single arch across it where the river is only   0 feet wide and which is to be built with all expedition it is to be roofed over and to tower     feet from the water the road is not to be carried over the arch but to hang to or be suspended in the middle below it the estimate for building this bridge is  0000l sterling the bridge is upon the same principle with that of schaffhausen excepting that the mechanism is more complicated and that the road is not so level the ascent of the road of the bridge at schaffhausen being barely fourtenths of an inch to a foot the person whose name is kulibin who projected this bridge is merely a russian peasant has a long beard and wears the common dress of his country he receives however a pension from the empress and is encouraged to follow the bent of his mechanical genius which is truly uncommon though rather foreign to our subject it may not be unentertaining to our readers to have the following account of a repeatingwatch that he made it is about the size of an egg within is represented the tomb of our savior with the stone at the entrance and the sentinels on duty suddenly the stone is removed the sentinels fall down the angels appear the women enter the sepulcher and the same chant is heard which is performed on easter eve  this watch is deposited in the academy of sciences at petersburgh  one of the noblest monuments paid to the veneration of the founder of this city is the equestrian statue of that monarch cast in bronze by that celebrated french statuary monsieur falconet at the expense of the empress and erected in the area before the palace a description of it being a wonderful undertaking cannot displease our readers the pedestal on which it stands is a stupendous mass of reddish granite which was discovered half buried in the midst of a morass at some distance from the city the morass was drained to get it out and a road was cut through a forest to pass it after it was reduced it weighed   00 tons it was drawn with  0 men seated on the top of it by a windlass and large friction balls placed in grooves and fixed on each side of the road to the banks of the river on which it was conveyed in a vessel constructed purposely to receive it to the place where it now stands at its base it is    feet long    at the top    thick and    high  a bulk greatly surpassing in weight the most boasted monuments of roman grandeur the statue is of colossal size and represents the monarch in the attitude of mounting a precipice the summit of which he has nearly attained he is crowned with laurel in a loose asiatic vest and sitting on a bearskin housing his right hand stretched as in the act of blessing his people and his left holding the reins the horse is rearing on his hind legs and his tail which is full and flowing slightly touches a bronze serpent artfully contrived to assist in supporting the vast weight of the statue in due equilibrium it was erected in      and its erection attended with great solemnity a proclamation was offered at the time to pardon all criminals under sentence of death all deserters who should return to their duty within a limited time and all convicts condemned to hard labor provided they had not been guilty of murder  in   0  peter began the foundation of the fortress its walls are of brick and strengthened with five regular bastions they encircle a small island of about half a mile in circumference formed by the great and little neva within the walls are barracks for a small garrison several wards used as a common jail and dungeons for the confinement of stateprisoners in the fortress is a small arsenal which among other military stores conains some ancient cannon cast in the middle of the   th century in a separate building of the fortress is the mint the gold and silver are sent from the mines of siberia and the separation is performed in this laboratory large quantities of dutch dollars are melted down here for the purpose of coining into rubles as half the duties are discharged in that money by all foreign merchants excepting the english who are exempted by treaty but as these and the gold and silver obtained from the mines of siberia are by no means sufficient for the money in circulation a considerable quantity of both these metals is annually imported there is here a very ingenious and simple piece of mechanism  a machine for stamping the coin which must not be omitted because it was an invention of her present majesty within the fortress is a fouroared boat called the little grandsire which is secured with great veneration in a brick building constructed for that purpose and preserved as a memorial to future ages of its being the origin of the russian fleet adjacent to the fortress stands a wooden hovel dignified by its having served for the habitation of peter the great while the fortress was constructing it still exists in its original state and stands under a brick building purposely erected to preserve it from destruction near this house is another fouroared boat the work of peters own hands  the cathedral of st peter and paul is in a different state of architecture from that usually employed in the construction of churches for the service of the greek religion instead of domes it has a spire of copper gilt the highest part of which rises above   0 feet from the ground its interior decorations of paintings etc are in an elegant and modern style in this cathedral are deposited the remains of peter the great and of all the successive sovereigns excepting the late unfortunate peter the third who are ranged in coffins side by side but have not any of them marble monuments erected to their memories bearing only inscriptions in the russian tongue on their tombs which are shaped like square coffins devotion has not been wanting to add her magnificence and to erect places of worship in almost every part  the market upon the neva is too remarkable to be omitted  at the conclusion of the long fast which closes on the   th of december o s the russians lay in their provisions for the remaining part of the winter for this purpose an annual market or fair which lasts three days is held upon the river near the fortress a long street above a mile in length is lined on each side with an immense store of provisions sufficient for the supply of the capital for the next three months many thousand raw carcases of oxen sheep hogs pigs together with geese fowls and every species of frozen food are exposed for sale the larger quadrupedes are grouped in various circles upright their hind legs fixed in the snow with their heads and forelegs turned toward each other these tower above the rest and occupy the hindermost row next to them succeeds a regular series of animals descending gradually to the smallest intermixed with poultry and game hanging in festoons and garnished with heaps of fish butter and eggs the most distant quarters help to supply this vast store of provisions and the finest veal has been sent by landcarriage as far as from archangel beef is sold at one penny the russian pound that is fourteen ounces and an half english pork at five farthings and mutton at three halfpence a goose for ten pence a pig for eight pence and all other articles in proportion in order to render their frozen food fit for dressing it is first thawed in cold water  the court of petersburgh has long enjoyed the reputation of being one of the most brilliant in europe rich clothes are still the passion of the russians and though sumptuary laws have been often talked of and set on foot they have never properly been carried into execution mr coxe who with lord herbert was presented to the empress on the birthday of the grand duke who is next heir to the throne and when a brilliant court was assembled gives us the following account of it at the entrance of the drawing room stood two sentinels of the footguards their uniform was a green coat with red cuffs and cape white waistcoat and breeches they had silver helmets fastened under the chin with silver clasps and ornamented with an ample plume of red yellow black and white feathers within the drawing room at the doors of the passage leading to her majestys apartments were two soldiers of the knights bodyguard a corpse more sumptuously accoutred than any in europe they wore casques like those of the ancients with a rich plumage of black feathers and their whole dress was in the same sle chains and broad plates of solid silver were braided over their uniforms so as to wear the appearance of a coat of mail and their boots were richly ornamented with the same metal  in the drawing room were a numerous assembly of foreign ministers russian nobility and officers in their different uniforms waiting the arrival of the empress who was attending divine service in the chapel there amid a prodigious concourse of nobles stood the empress foremost by herself behind a railing the only distinction by which her place was marked immediately next to her stood the great duke and duchess and behind an indiscriminate throng of courtiers the empress bowed and frequently crossed herself agreeable to the forms of the greek church when she left the chapel she was preceded by the chief officers of her household the mistress of the robes her maids of honor and other ladies of the bedchamber advancing two by two her majesty followed with slow and solemn pace walking with great pomp and bowing continually to the right and left she stopped at the entrance of the drawing room and spoke with great affability to the foreign ministers whilst they kissed her hand her dress was a robe with a short train and a vest with sleeves reaching to the wrist like a polonese the vest was of gold brocade and the robe of light green silk her hair was dressed low and lightly powdered she wore a cap set thick with diamonds and had on a great deal of rouge  in the evening was a ball at court which is always held on the third day the great duke and duchess opened it with a minuet after which these great personages danced a minuet each with the principal nobility the duke with a lady and the duchess with a gentleman several other couples dancing minuets in different parts of the circle these minuets were succeeded by polish dances and these by english countrydances during the latter the empress came in more richly apparelled than in the morning and wearing a crown of diamonds upon her head  on her majestys appearance the ball was suspended and the principal people paid their respects to the empress this done she ascended an elevated seat and the dancing was resumed after this she withdrew to an inner room to cards and played at macao at an imperial or twopound a game with the foreign ministers her majesty retired about  0 and all was over  the empress has a drawing room every sunday morning about    the richness and splendour of the russian court surpasses all the ideas which the most elaborate descriptions can suggest retaining many traces of ancient asiatic pomp blended with european refinement an immense retinue of courtiers always precede and follow the empress the costliness and glare of their apparel and a profusion of precious stones create a splendour of which the magnificence of other courts can give only a faint idea the courtdress of the men is in the french fashion that of the ladies is a gown and petticoat with a small hoop the gown has long hanging sleeves and a short train and is of a different color from the petticoat the ladies wore in      very lofty headdresses and were not sparing of rouge the men wear diamonds as well as the women their buttons buckles swordhilts and epaulets are composed of several rows of pearls and a diamond star is scarce a distinction this passion for jewels seems to pervade the lower class of people for even private families abound with them and the wife of a common russian burgher will appear with a headdress or girdle of pearls and other precious stones worth two or three hundred pounds  at certain times the empress dines in public on the  d of december she gives an entertainment to the officers of the regiment of which she as sovereign is the colonel at this time she is dressed in the uniform of the regiment in a habit resembling a ridingdress they sit with her and she is very attentive to them at another time she dines with the knights of the several orders and is then habited like them at these public dinners she hands each person present a glass of wine who after a low obeisance drinks it off at the conclusion of this ceremony which is generally about one oclock her majesty leads the way into an adjoining apartment she takes her place in the middle of the table and the officers are ranged on each side according to their respective ranks her majesty upon these occasions condescends to help the soup herself and pays throughout the greatest attention to her guests after the repast which usually lasts about an hour her majesty rises from table and withdraws  the empress on days of high ceremony generally wears a crown of diamonds of immense value and appears with the ribbands of the order of st andrew and merit flung both over the same shoulder with the collars of their orders and the two stars emblazoned one above the other upon her vest  the palace of peterhof situated about  0 miles from the capital has gardens which are celebrated for their taste and elegance and are the frequent scenes of the most splendid entertainments they have from their number of jet d eaus etc been compared to those of versailles and indeed in one respect they are far superior for those of the latter only play upon particular occasions while those of peterhof are perpetual in the garden is an elegant pavilion constructed by order of the empress when she was great duchess it contains eighteen apartments each furnished in different tastes namely the greek turkish chinese etc and is situated in the middle of a thick wood its approaches being circular we have not the least glimpse until we arrive at it and as it generally causes an emotion of surprise it has for that reason received the appellation of ha  i shall not detain the reader with a description of the silver dolphins and gilded statues which are scattered in great profusion but there are some few particulars which as they may afford entertainment i must not omit these are two gladiators placed in a basin of water they are represented not with the ancient weapons a sword and buckler but with the more modern instruments of war a brace of pistols which as they point to each other in threatening attitudes the water gushes impetuously from the barrels  among the numerous buildings the garden contains is one erected by peter i and by him called monplaisir the name by which it is now distinguished he conconstructed this small house close to the gulf of finland from a prepossession that the air from the water was the most wholesome for his constitution it is brick of one story and roofed with iron the windows reach from the ground to the top which added to the length and lowness of the building gives it the appearance of a greenhouse the habitable part consists of a hall and six small rooms all furnished in the neatest and plainest manner the mantlepieces are ornamented with curious old porcelain which he greatly prized as being brought into russia when the communication was first open with china the bedroom is small whitewashed and the floor covered with a colored sailcloth it contains a barrackbedstead without curtains several pictures of himself are here under the character of master peter when he worked at sardam  the mountain of sledges or as some travelers term it the flying mountain in the gardens of peterhof is a most extraordinary building and merits particular observation and for which i shall quote mr coxe  it stands in the middle of an oblong area enclosed by an open colonade with a flat roof is railed in for the convenience of holding spectators the circumference of this colonade is at least half a mile in the middle of the area stands the flying mountain stretching nearly from one end to the other it is a wooden building supported upon pillars representing an uneven surface of ground or a mountain composed of three princpal ascents gradually diminishing in height with an intermediate space to resemble valleys from top to bottom is a floored way in which three parallel grooves are formed it is thus used a small carriage containing one person being placed in the center groove upon the highest point goes with great rapidity down one hill the velocity which it requires in its descent carries it up a second and it continues to move in a similar manner until it arrives at the bottom of the area where it rolls for a considerable way on the level surface and stops before it attains the boundary it is then placed in one of the sidegrooves and drawn up by means of a cord fixed to a windlass at the top of the mountain is a handsome apartment for the accommodation of the court and principal nobility there is also room for many thousand spectators within the colonade and upon its roof but her present majesty does not seem so fond of this diversion as the late empress these elegant gardens are frequently illuminated in the most superb manner  the winterpalace at petersburgh is built of brick stuccoed white and was erected by the late empress elizabeth it is very large and very heavy it is not yet quite finished like almost every thing else in russia the situation is very lively on the banks of the neva and in the center of the town contiguous to it is a small palace built by the present empress called the hermitage communicating with the palace by means of a covered gallery when her majesty resides in this part of the building she is in retreat and there is no drawing room or court from this it takes its appellation but bears no other resemblance to a hermitage except in its name the apartments being extremely spacious and decorated in a superb style of regal magnificence to this favorite spot the empress usually repairs for an hour or two every day and on a thursday evening gives a private ball and supper to the principal persons who form her court foreign ministers and foreign noblemen being seldom invited at this entertainment all ceremony is said to be banished as far as is consistent with that respect which is paid to a great sovereign the attendance of servants is excluded while the supper and various refreshments are presented on small tables which rise through trapdoors there are two galleries of paintings which have been lately purchased at an immense expense in italy  a winter and summergarden comprised within the site of the building are singular curiosities and such as do not perhaps occur in any other palace in europe the summergarden in the true asiatick style occupies the whole level top of the edifice the wintergarden is entirely roofed and surrounded with glassframes it is an high and spacious hothouse laid out in gravelwalks ornamented with parterres of flowers orange trees and other shrubs and peopled with several birds of sundry sorts and various climates flitting from tree to tree this exhibits a most pleasing effect and is wonderfully delightful when contrasted with the dismal and dreary winterseason in russia  before i quit petersburgh i must observe that from its low and marshy situation it is much subject to inundations which have occasionally risen so high as to threaten the town with a total submersion these floods are chiefly occasioned by a west or southwest wind which blowing directly from the gulf obstructs the current of the neva and causes a vast accumulation of its waters but these floods become less and less alarming from the gradual raising of the ground by buildings and other causes  in the evening of the  th of september      a most violent storm of wind blowing at first s w and afterward w raised the neva and its various branches to so great a height that at five in the morning the waters poured over the banks and suddenly overflowed the town and vast numbers of the people were drowned the torrent rose in several streets to the depth of fourfeetandanhalf and overturned by its rapidity various buildings and bridges about seven the wind shifting to n w the flood fell as suddenly and at midday most of the streets which in the morning could only be passed in boats became dry for a short time the river rose ten feet seven inches above its ordinary level  about  0 miles from petersburgh by water lies the island retusari a long slip of land near  0 miles in circumference and containing at present about  0000 inhabitants including the sailors and garrison the former amounting to   000 the latter to   00 men on the southeastern extremity of this island is built the town of cronstadt defended toward the sea by wooden piers projecting into the water and toward the land by ramparts and bastions it is a very straggling place and occupies like all russian towns a larger space of ground than the number of dwellings seem to require this island was fortified for the security of the russian fleet for on the south side of the island is the only passage for ships of burden up to petersburgh through a narrow channel  it was in the fortress of cronstadt that peter iii hoped to have secured himself at the time of the late revolution but the present empress anticipating his intention had secured it and peter not having the courage to attempt to land returned back to oranienbaum where resigning all power into her hands this mighty revolution was effected in a few hours almost without any confusion or uproar peter was then secured within the citadel and on the ninth day consequent to his seizure it was reported he had a disorder in his bowels and soon after his death was announced  moscow of which i have already treated very fully in the second volume is in rank the second city of this empire though it was formerly the first it is situated in    degrees    minutes and    seconds of northern latitude here the chief nobles who do not belong to the court of the empress reside and here support a large number of retainers they love to gratify their taste for a ruder and more expensive magnificence in the ancient style of feudal grandeur and are not as at petersburgh eclipsed by the superior splendour of the court  there is a sort of savage and barbarous grandeur in their taste which here appears in the edifices and productions of athenian sculpture or architecture the empress has begun to erect a palace which is designed to be two or three english miles in circumference the city itself is an immense aggregate of villages and the muscovite lords commonly go near forty of our miles to make morning visits to each other from the windings of the river and from many eminences which are covered with groves of fine tall trees and from numerous gardens and lawns that open to the water the city has a most pleasing airy appearance in short according to marshall it is a finer city than petersburgh  novogorod is one of the most ancient cities in russia and no place ever filled the mind with more melancholy ideas of fallen grandeur richard chancellor who passed through it in      in his way to moscow says that though in majesty it is inferior to moscow in greatness it exceeds it the commodiousness of the river makes it much frequented by merchants and more famous than moscow itself in its most flourishing condition it contained at least  00000 souls at present it contains scarcely  000  in    0 under the reign of ivan ii novogorod experienced a downfall from which it has never recovered that monarch having discovered a secret correspondence between some of the principal inhabitants and the king of poland relative to a surrender of the city into his hands inflicted the most inhuman vengeance upon them during the space of five weeks which the court of inquiry continued upwards of  00 daily fell victims to incensed despotism this barbarous transaction and the savage ferocity with which it was executed equals if not surpasses in cruelty the massacre at stockholm under christian ii  although the splendour of this once flourishing court received a very considerable diminution by this horrid catastrophe and the subsequent oppressions which the town experienced under that sanguinary prince yet it was not totally obscured until the foundation of petersburgh to which favorite capital peter the great transferred all the commerce of the baltic which before centered in novogorod in      the swedes took it by storm but afterward surrendered it to the muscovites the town stretches on both sides of the wolkof a river of considerable depth and rapidity and somewhat broader than the thames at windsor this river separates the town into two divisions which are united by means of a bridge partly wooden and partly brick the first division excepting the governors house differs only from the common villages by a vast number of brick churches and convents which stand melancholy monuments of its former magnificence while halfcultivated fields enclosed within high pallisadoes and large spaces covered with nettles attest its present desolate condition toward its extremity is erected a manufactory at the empresss expense for ropes and sails the opposite division denominated the quarter of st sophia comprehends the fortress which is of an irregularly oval form and surrounded with a high brick wall strengthened with round and square towers the fortress contains the cathedral of st sophia the old archiepiscopal mansion with its staircase on the outside part of a new palace not yet finished and a few other brick buildings but the remaining space is a waste overspread with weeds and nettles and covered with ruins  the cathedral is probably one of the most ancient churches in russia it was begun in  0   and completed in  0   it is a high square building with a gilded cupola and four tin domes in the inside of this cathedral to which we enter through a pair of brazen gates ornamented with various scriptural histories in altorelievo are    massy pillars whitewashed which as well as the walls are thickly covered with the representations of our savior the virgin mary and various other saints some of these paintings are of very high antiquity several princes of the ducal family of russia are interred within this cathedral the most ancient of whose sepulchers are of carved wood gilt and silvered and surrounded with iron rails the others are of brick and mortar within the sanctuary the walls are covered with curious mosaic compartments of coarse workmanship and seemingly very ancient  the country about novogorod abounds in grain flax hemp honey and wax and it is here they manufacture the best russia leather the price of provisions in this place is as follows butchers meat per lb    oz english   d to   d black bread ditto white ditto   french ditto   butter ditto   ten eggs   d to   d couple of fowls   s   d to   s   d fat goose   s couple of wild ducks   d tame ditto a couple   s   d brace of partridges  0 black game cock and hen     hare   quart of milk   best spirituous liquors per quart     inferior sort ditto   peasants shoes     boots    0 round hat     shirt no collar or wristbands very short       moscow is afflicted with very frequent and dreadful fires the account of that in may      is immense they mention   000 houses which is hardly credible and what is remarkable that fire in two hours time was carried to the extent of two english miles but by a decree of the russian senate the woodhouses are now limited to certain quarters of the city and in all other places they were ordered to be rebuilt with brick and stone there is a very considerable manufacture at moscow of various hempfabricks which employs some thousands of looms and many thousands of people this city is almost in the center of the most cultivated parts of the empire and is therefore independent of various other advantages it possesses better situated for the metropolis of the empire than petersburgh founding that city and making it the seat of foreign commerce and naval power was an admirable exertion of genius but the seat of government should always have been at moscow  for any further particulars i must refer my readers to the beginning of the second volume  kiovia or kiof the capital of the ukraine is also one of the most considerable cities of russia a place wellknown in the history of that empire which though compared to its former grandeur it has been reduced to a low state by many revolutions yet it has now recovered all those ancient blows and is well built of brick and stone the streets are wide strait and wellpaved it has a bishop a noble cathedral much of it lately rebuilt and    other churches it has  0000 inhabitants and is strongly fortified the nieper is here a noble river has several larger rivers falling into it after washing some of the richest provinces of poland and enables this town to carry on a very considerable commerce it is the grand magazine of all the commodities of the ukraine particularly hemp and flax which in this fine province are raised in greater quantities and of a better quality than in any other part of europe the ukraine is the richest province in the russian empire and lies between the nieper and the don it is on an average   0 miles long from east to west and   0 broad from north to south part uf it was formerly a province of poland and the rest an independent sovereignty under a tartar prince but the whole now is a mere province of russia inhabited by circassian traders and is much the richest acquisition the crown has made  the inhabitants of the ukraine are not vassals but chiefly little freeholdfarmers and are the best husbandmen in all russia mr marshall says he thinks he never saw such deep ploughing as these peasants give their grounds he measured nine inches perpendicular after a plough drawn by four oxen their ploughs are very well constructed and are made wholly of iron without wheels they have very noble crops of cabbages of a red sort that grow to the weight of    or  0lb with which they feed their cattle an acre of them will winter four or five large oxen they have also whole fields of potatoes which yield from    to   00 bushels per acre numbers of them as large as the body of a quart bottle they plant them as we do in slices they grow also tobacco in short it is this district which raises ninetenths of the hemp and flax which we import at such a vast expense from russia the soil is a very rich deep mould between a loam and a dry clay but without any of that tenacious thickness so disagreeable in stirring in our claylands in england  riga is another and the next considerable place of trade to petersburgh it is the metropolis of livonia and stands very advantageously for commerce about  0 miles from the mouth of the river duna in the baltic sea which river extending a great way into poland and russia brings down immense quantities of commodities which are there exported more than  00 sail of ships are loaded here in a year from   0 to  00 tons burden half of them english this province was taken from the swedes in    0 and of all the russian conquests it is one of the greatest on account of its products ports and situation it is nearly a square of  00 miles every way and contains better than    millions of acres and near    millions of people half the lands are under profitable cultivation and its annual product is estimated at    millions steriing  riga itself is invested with deep barren sands and has nothing agreeable about it it is surrounded with fortifications the houses are all high the streets very narrow ill paved and very dirty and contains about   000 inhabitants but the bridge over the river is one of the most singular and surprising in europe it is  00 paces long and far exceeds the bridge at rouen it consists of transverse beams of timber jointed together and rises and falls with the tide it is erected in spring always when the river is free from ice and removed in november before the frost sets in  russian finland is a province of russia which formerly belonged to the swedes and which they are now contending for this province retains most of its ancient privileges its own civil and criminal courts of justice but their punishments do not extend to death the peasants speak the fin language but the inhabitants of the towns swedish and german the lutheran religion is the established one but the greek church has been lately introduced it is so unpeopled uncultivated and unfertile that  0 english miles of land have been lately sold for  00 l sterling  wiburgh is the capital of this province is a fortified town and contains about  000 people but the exports of the place in planks tallow pitch and tar load annually  00 sail of ships the greater part of which are english  archangel is another port of the russians on the north sea it is a small town almost on the mouth of the duiria about  00 miles from petersburgh where the river which is very broad and deep forms an excellent harbor it was formerly the residence of the british factors till they removed to petersburgh in those days it was not uncommon to see   or  00 sail of ships in the harbor at one time but the trade being transferred to petersburgh it is now a poor place of very little resort and the buildings contain nothing worthy of notice they have a cathedral and an archbishop of the greek church but every thing looks on the decline  of russ poland that part of poland which russia has now taken to herself rzeezyka is the capital it is large populous and strongly fortified but as much russian as is moscow a russian garrison russian government scarcely any thing polish in it all the houses deserted by the poles being filled with russian families indeed near half the kingdom of poland is in the hands of the russians who receive pretty heavy taxes from it and recruit their army against the turks from it the polish nobles who declare against russia are driven from their estates and great numbers of the peasantry are removed immediately into russia and their places filled by russians the empress by this acquisition gets an increase of subjects to the number of   00000  chap iii of their amusements customs manners etc among their various amusements that of their masquerades and illuminations in the gardens at peterhof deserve to be particularly noticed they are given by the empress upon a great occasion and convey a most extensive proof of the splendour and magnificence of the russian court  the masquerade is rather a bal pare en domino as there are very few or no fancydresses nor is any character supported every person without distinction is admitted on these occasions and there are sometimes not less than   or  000 persons present amongst whom is her majesty who sometimes plays cards most of the night  the illuminations in the garden are far beyond any seen elsewhere for in this as well as in fireworks the russians excel every nation in europe on these occasions two prodigious arcades of fire are extended in front of the palace the canal which reaches to the gulf of finland has been illuminated on both sides the view terminating by a rock lighted in the inside and affording a most beautiful effect from either side of the canal long arched walks illuminated and beyond these in the woods hanging festoons of lamps differently colored all the jets d eaux playing artificial cascades with the water tumbling from one declivity to another and under each lights so artfully disposed as at once to amuse and surprise the spectator besides these summerhouses pyramids and temples of flame and beyond all the imperial yatchts appearing in the same brilliant and dazzling ornaments  two or three times in the winter there are masquerades at the court at petersburgh to which persons of all ranks are admitted a magnificent suite of  0 apartments is opened upon these occasions all handsomely illuminated from   to  000 tickets are distributed and mr coxe says that at one at which he was he should suppose that number were actually present one of the apartments a large oblong room the same in which the common balls at court are held has a space in the middle enclosed with a low railing appropriated to the nobility who dance a most elegant saloon of an oval form nearly as big as the rotunda at ranelagh but without any support in the middle is allotted for the dances of the burghers and other persons who have not been presented at court the remaining rooms in which tea and other refreshments are served are filled with cardtables about seven the empress usually makes her appearance at the head of a superb quadrille consisting of eight ladies led by as many gentlemen her majesty and her attendants are always upon these occasions most sumptuously apparelled and as usual with a profuse decoration of diamonds the empress after walking round the saloon two or three times sits down to cards in an adjoining room where the company flock in crowds without distinction and arrange themselves as they can find admittance round the table at a respectful distance about eleven the empress usually withdraws  in the summer season when the court is out of town there are scarce any public spectacles at petersburgh except at the imperial palace where a french and russian comedy are performed generally once a week the seats are adjusted by rank and no money is paid for admittance as it is the empresss own amusement and limited to people of condition boxingmatches are very favorite diversions among the common people they generally assemble   or  00 and divide themselves into two parties each of which chooses a chief who calls out the combatants and pits them against each other they do not strip as with us and have on thick leathern gloves from the stiffness of the leather they can scarcely double their fists so that many of them strike openhanded their attitudes are very different from those used by boxers in england they advance the left foot and side stretch the left arm toward the adversary in order to repel his blows and keep the right arm swinging at some distance from the other they generally strike in a circular direction at the face and head never attack the breast or sides and seem to have no notion of aiming a blow directly forward when any combatant fells his antagonist to the ground he is declared victor and the contest between that pair immediately ceases their mode of fighting prevents any mischief from its exertion nor do we therefore seldom see any of those fractures and contusions in which boxingmatches in england so frequently terminate  the tournament is a favorite diversion in russia i shall describe one from mr coxes travels at which he was present  his imperial highness the great duke who two or three times in a week takes this diversion and eleven of his nobles dressed in uniforms of buff and gold and armed with a lance sword and pistols were assembled at nine oclock although it was as yet dusk the great duke drew them up by pairs and upon the sound of the trumpet he and the knights immediately mounted their horses and retired in due order without the rails two rings were suspended on opposite sides of the wall on each side of the manage at each corner was a moors head of pasteboard or an apple fixed upon a pole and between them two heads with a squib in their mouths these were all placed upon stands almost as high as a man on horseback and at some paces from the wall at each end was also a helmet of pasteboard raised upon a stand about a foot from the ground and about four from the wall the two judges with lord herbert and myself who were the only spectators took our station on the outside of the rail upon a second signal from the trumpet two knights entered at opposite ends of the manage a band of music played a quick air while each knight galloping his horse to the right and making a vault saluted with their lances at the same time then continuing their course round the manage each ran with his lance first at the rings suspended from the walls and next at the moors head after which they delivered their lances as they went on to their servants on foot the knights then drew their pistols and each making a second vault round the others head discharged them in order to set fire to the squib then pursuing their course round the manage they drew their swords and making a third vault round the apple endeavored to strike it to the ground they finished their career by stooping down as they galloped by thrusting their swords through the helmets then poising them in the air they met in the middle and riding toward the judge saluted him related the attempts in which they had succeeded and demanded their prizes the prize was about four shillings for each achievement and an equal value was paid for every failure the whole was performed on a continued gallop and always to the right in running at the ring the head or the helmet it is esteemed honorable to put the horse into full career which increases the difficulty the judge having bestowed the rewards and taken the forfeits ordered the two knights to retire the trumpets again sounding two others made their appearance and performed the same maneuvers this exercise was repeated twice by each pair of knights the whole troop then entered at the same time marched charged formed drew returned their swords and dismounted by word of command from the great duke at the conclusion they adjourned to the fire chocolate was brought in and after a short conversation the great duke bowed and retired  hawking and coursing with greyhounds is also very much a favorite amusement of the russians before the days of peter the great they were barbarous ignorant and very much addicted to drunkenness no fewer than  000 brandyshops have been reckoned in moscow not only the common people but many of the boyars or nobles lived in a continual state of idleness and intoxication and the most complete objects of misery and barbarity presented themselves in the streets while the court of moscow was by far the most splendid of any upon the globe the russians before the time of peter had no places of public diversion and they entertained a sovereign contempt for all improvements of the mind at present a french or english gentleman though a fine day does not tempt him to take a walk and he has few rural scenes to enchant his eyes may make a shift to live as comfortably and sociably in russia as in most other parts of europe and if he lives genteely at petersburgh he is sure to get easily into the best of company  the stoves they make use of diffuse a more equal and genial warmth than our grates and chimnies their polite assemblies have since the accession of the present empress been put under proper regulations and few of their ancient usages remain but such as are of public utility and adapted to the nature of the country  the czarina and grandees according to captain perrys account dressed after the most superb asiatic manner and their magnificence exceeded every idea that can be conceived from modern examples and the earl of carlisle in the account of his embassy says that he could see nothing but gold and precious stones in the robes of the czar and his courtiers the manufactures however of these and all other luxuries were carried on by italians germans and other foreigners  peter who saw the bulk of his subjects at his accession to the throne little better than beasts of burden to support the pomp of the court forced his great men to lay aside their long robes which hung down to the middle of the small of their legs and was gathered and laid in plaits upon their hips little differing from womens petticoats and appear after the english fashion to compel this he adopted different methods one of which from its oddity i shall mention he had clothes made according to the english fashion hung up at all the gates of the city of moscow and issued a proclamation that all persons excepting the common peasants who brought goods and provisions into the city should have their clothes according to those patterns and in disobedience to it should either pay a fine of twenty pence english or be compelled to kneel down at the gates of the city and have their coats cut off even with the ground when they knelt in consequence of which many hundreds coats were cut and as it was done in good humor it occasioned mirth among the people and soon broke the custom of their wearing long coats the women but more particularly the ladies about court were also ordered to reform the fashion of their clothes and a reformation of peters in another point the sooner reconciled them to this  it had been an invariable custom in russia at all entertainments for the women not to be admitted into the sight or conversation of men and the very houses of persons of any quality or fashion were built with an entrance for the women apart and they used to be kept up separate by themselves but the czar being not only willing to introduce english habits but to make them more particularly pleasing to the russ ladies made an order that from thenceforward at all weddings and at other public entertainments the women as well as the men should be invited but in an englishfashioned dress and that they should then be entertained in the same room with the men  from these circumstances did the reform in their manners of dress take place which has improved with time so that people of distinction now dress as nearly as the climate will admit after the english and french manner the common people who are in general a coarse hardy race of great bodily strength are clothed still with long coats reaching below the knee made of dressed sheepskins with the wool inwards trowsers of linen almost as thick as sackcloth a woollen cloth wrapped round the legs to a great thickness instead of stockings sandals woven from slips of pliant bark and fastened by strings of the same materials which are afterward twined round the leg and serve as garters over their legs so swathed they will often draw boots in summer the men will often wear coats and shirts only and trowsers but always swathe their legs their hair they suffer to hang down over the forehead and cut it short in the poll their caps or hats are round with very high crowns lined with fur and cover their ears and neck as well as their heads they wear sashes round their waist and double gloves one of woollen and the other of leather which take in the hand without any distinction except the thumb and these are also an essential part of their clothing the women besides their petticoats wear sheepskins as well as the men  it had been the manner of the russians to wear long beards but peter desirous of making them like other europeans levied a tax upon his subjects excepting only the priests for the wearing of their beards but notwithstanding these rigorous edicts issued by peter the men among the lower class universally wear the beard  russians   the women in general bind their heads with pieces of silk or linen so as to resemble the eastern turband but in other respects in summertime dress like europeans excepting that they display more luxury their dresses particularly at court as i before observed are more splendid and more expensive than are seen any where else all gold silver and jewels but says mr marshall scarcely any taste they have in their dresses but one ambition which is to be as rich as possible and to have a great change but as to having an idea of taste and real elegance even the nobility continues he seem not to know what it is   the plate represents a peasant bowing to a russian nobleman after the manner of their country  mr wraxall says he was a spectator of one of their customs which not a little surprised him that of a promiscuous bathing of more than  00 persons of both sexes there are several of these public bathingplaces in petersburgh where every one pays a few copecs or halfpence for admittance and bathe once or twice aweek there are indeed separate places for the men and women but they seem quite regardless of this distinction and sit or bathe promiscuously quite naked they go first into a room heated to such a degree that it is scarce possible to breathe in it and after staying in this room till they are in a strong perspiration either plunge into the cold water of the river neva or throw a quantity of cold water over them from little buckets kept for the purpose  this may harden a russian constitution but would ill agree with an english one  mr coxe is more particular in describing these baths which are general all over russia the common bathinghouses are wooden buildings of one room close to some river with small windows like cottagewindows this room within is provided with ranges of broad benches placed like steps one above another almost to the cieling an old woman is generally the attendant of this room on these benches you will see numbers of persons naked some lying on the benches some sitting others standing some washing their bodies with soap others rubbing themselves with small branches of oakleaves tied together like a rod some pouring hot water on their heads others cold water whilst the woman having made a fire under an arch of granitestone about four feet high sprinkles water over this arch when it is sufficiently heated and the vapor arising therefrom heats the room almost beyond bearing some exhausted thus by the heat go out and nd in the open air or throw themselves into the river to cool them when a person goes singly to one of these baths this old woman having heated the room strips the bather lays him on the bench and lathers him with soap from head to foot then washes him and dries him with napkins this operation renders the body insensible to cold even in the coldest weather and communicates a glow of warmth that continues the whole night  in the month of december i was witness says mr coxe to a very singular entertainment given to the public by a russian who had acquired a large fortune by farming four years only and vending spirituous liquors on surrendering his contract he gave as a proof of his gratitude to the lower class of people by whom he had enriched himself a feast in the garden of the summerpalace which was announced by handbills distributed through the city a large semicircular table was covered with all kinds of provisions piled in different shapes and in the greatest profusion large slices of bread and caviare dried sturgeon carp and other fish were ranged to a great height in the form of penthouses and pyramids and garnished with crawfish onions and pickles in different parts of the garden were rows of casks full of spirituous liquors and still larger vessels of wines beer and quas among the decorations was the representation of an immense whale in pasteboard covered with cloth and gold and silver brocade and filled within with bread dried fish and other provisions  all sorts of games and diversions were exhibited for the amusement of the populace at the extremity of the grounds was a large square of ice well swept for the scaters near which were two machines like the swinging vehicles at bartholomewfair one of these machines consisted of two cross beams fixed horizontally to a pole in the center by means of a pivot from the ends hung four sledges in which the people seated themselves and were turned round with great velocity the other had four wooden horses suspended from the beams and their riders were whirled round in the like manner as their rivals in the sledges beyond these were two icehills such as i have described below and for the same diversion two poles above  0 feet high were also erected with colors flying and at the top of each was placed a piece of money as a prize for those who could swarm up and seize it the poles being rubbed with oil soon froze in this severe climate and of course many and tedious were the attempts of the various competitors in this slipping ascent to fame the scene was lively and gay for above  0000 persons of both sexes were assembled on the occasion  it had been preconcerted that on the firing of a rocket the people were to drink a glass of spirituous liquor and upon the discharge of a second to begin the repast but the impatience of the populace anticipated the necessity of the second signal and the whole multitude was soon and at once in motion the whale was the chief object of contention within a few minutes it was entirely divested of its gaudy trappings which became the spoils of its successful invaders they had no sooner flayed it of its drapery and secured the fragments of rich brocades than they rent him into a thousand pieces in order to seize the provisions with which its inside were stored the remaining people who were too numerous to be all engaged about the whale were busy in uncovering the penthouses and pulling down the pyramids in conveying provender with one hand to their mouths and the other to their pockets others crowded round the casks and hogsheads and with great wooden ladles lapped incessantly wine beer and spirits the confusion and riot which soon succeeded is better conceived than described the evening was closed with a superb illumination of the gardens and a magnificent firework  but the consequences of this feast were dreadful the cold had suddenly increased with such violence that fahrenheits thermometer which at midday stood only at   sunk toward the close of the evening to    below the freezing point consequently many intoxicated persons were frozen to death not a few fell a sacrifice to drunken quarrels and others were robbed and murdered in the more retired parts of the city as they were returning home late from a comparison of the various reports at least  00 persons lost their lives on this melancholy occasion murders used to be frequent in petersburgh but the police is now so well regulated that we seldom hear of one among other parts of the police no apothecary dares sell a medicine unless a regular prescription is brought him signed by a physician  a law very beneficial to the faculty and not without its use another regulation here not without its advantages though troublesome is that no stranger can quit the capital to pass the frontiers without having been first advertised in all the public papers for  0 days preceding his departure let his business or his affairs be ever so urgent petersburgh however being no thoroughfare the inconvenience is not so great as one would suppose  nothing can be more lively and diversified than the winterscenes upon the neva many carriages and sledges and numberless foot  passengers perpetually crossing it afford a constant succession of moving objects and the ice is also covered with different groupes of people dispersed or gathered together and variously employed as fancy leads them in one part we see several long areas railed off for the purpose of scating a little further an enclosure wherein a nobleman is training his horses and teaching them the various evolutions of the managed in another part the crowd are spectators of what is called a sledgerace the course is an oblong space about the length of a mile and sufficiently broad to turn a carriage it can hardly be called a race for there is only a single sledge drawn by two horses and the whole art of the driver consists in making the shafthorse trot as fast as he can whilst the other is pushed into a gallop  ice hills   the icehills i have mentioned are exceedingly common and afford a perpetual fund of amusement to the populace they are in imitation of the flyingmountain at the palace of peterhof and are constructed in the following manner  a scaffolding is raised upon the river about  0 feet high with a landingplace on the top the ascent to which is by a ladder from this top a sloping plain of boards about four yards broad and  0 yards long descends to the surface to the river supported by strong uprights or poles gradually decreasing in height and its sides defended by a parapet of planks on these boards are laid square pieces of ice about four inches thick which being first smoothed with an axe and laid close to each other are then sprinkled with water by these means they unite and adhering to the boards immediately form an inclined plain of pure ice from the bottom of this plain the snow is cleared away for the length of  00 yards and the breadth of four yards the level end of the river and the sides of this course as well as the sides and top of the scaffolding are ornamented with firs and pines each person being provided with a sledge resembling our butchers tray mounts the ladder and when on the top of the scaffold seats himself in this sledge or tray at the upper end of the inclined plane down which he slides with considerable rapidity poising it as he goes down when the velocity acquired by the descent carries it on above  00 yards on the level ice below at the end of this course there is a similar icehill nearly parallel to to the former which begins where the other ends so that the person immediately mounts again and glides down as on the first and so on and this diversion he continues as long as he pleases the difficulty of this pastime consists in steering and balancing the sledge as it is hurried down the inclined plane for if the person in it does not sit steady but totters through inadvertency or fear he is liable to be overthrown and runs no small risque of breaking his limbs if not his neck the boys also will scate down this hill on one scate and are better able to poise themselves on one leg than on two these icehills exhibit a pleasing appearance on the river as well from the trees with which they are ornamented as from the moving objects which at particular times of the day are sliding down without intermission  the game of chess is so common throughout russia that tradesmen and common people at moscow are seen playing in the street at their shopdoors  the market on the neva has been described before  the cottages of the peasants are constructed in a square shape are formed of whole trees piled upon each other and secured at the corners where the ends meet with mortasses and tenons and the spaces between the trees are stuffed with moss within the timbers are smoothed with the axe so as to resemble wainscot but are left without in their rude state with the bark on the roofs are in the penthouse style composed of the bark of trees or shingles and covered with turf they usually raise the whole house without the assistance of a saw the axe or hatchet being their chief instrument they finish the shell and roof of the house before they cut out the windows which are merely openings a few inches square closed with sliding shutters and the door is generally so low as not to admit a middlesized man without stooping sometimes though rarely these cottages consist of two stories in which case they make the lower apartment a kind of storeroom and live in the upper mounting to it by a ladder in the villages the site of the houses is generally an oblong square surrounding an area enclosed with a high wooden wall with a penthouse roof the whole resembling a large barn in one angle of this enclosure stands the house fronting the street with the staircase where there are two stories on the outside the door opening underneath the penthouse roof  the furniture consists chiefly of a wooden table or dresser and benches fastened to the sides of the room on which last the family sleeps in their clothes promiscuously almost in a state of nature and frequently with their heads hanging off the bench the utensils are platters bowls spoons etc all wood with perhaps one large earthen pan in which they cook their victuals over a stove erected in the middle some houses have openings in the roof to let out the smoke some none  in the midst of every room hangs from the cieling a vessel of holy water and a lamp which is lighted on particular occasions every house has a picture of some saint coarsely daubed on wood resembli more a kalmuck idol than a human head to this the highest marks of veneration are paid all the members of the family the instant they rise and before they go to rest standing before it and crossing themselves on the sides and forehead for several minutes bowing very low and often prostrating themselves on the ground before it every person also on entering the room pays his obeisance first to this object of worship  perry says that in bowing to this picture they cross themselves and cry  hospi miio that is lord have mercy upon me  and if it happens in a poor mans house who has but one picture and the room is either dark or the painting so effaced or covered with smoke so as not to be immediately visible to strangers a person entering will presently ask  ogdea boag where is god  which being shown to him he will immediately reverence it as before  their food is black ryebread sometimes white eggs saltfish bacon mushrooms and a kind of hodgepodge made of salt or fresh meat groats and ryeflour highly seasoned with garlic and onions their bread they also stuff with onions and groats carrots or green corn in order to render it more palatable and season it with sweet oil mushrooms are so exceedingly common in this country as to form a very essential part of their provisions i seldom entered a cottage says mr coxe but i saw a great quantity of them nor did i ever pass a market but i was astonished at their vast abundance and of all colors white black brown yellow green and pink the common drink of the peasants is quas a fermented liquor something like sweetwort made by pouring warm water on rye or barleymeal and is deemed an excellent antiscorbutic they are extremely fond of whisky a spirituous liquor distilled from malt which the poorest can occasionally command and which they often use to excess  the backwardness of the russian peasants in all the mechanical arts when compared with those of other nations is visible to every one near petersburgh they are somewhat better furnished with the conveniences of life and their cottages are rather better constructed but still their progress toward civilization is very inconsiderable i will mention one instance says coxe because it will show into what a wretched state of ignorance the common class of people are still plunged in many families the father marries the son whilst a boy of seven eight or nine years old to a girl of a more advanced age in order as it is said to procure ablebodied women for domestic services he cohabits with this person now become his daughterinlaw and frequently has several children by her so that in some cottages there are two mistresses of a family one the peasants real wife who is old enough to be his mother and the other nominally the sons wife but in reality the fathers concubine  certain peasants called yamshics are obliged to furnish horses at a fixed rate for traveling and are allowed particular privileges for so doing namely exemptions from the polltax or serving as soldiers but notwithstanding these immunities the price for each horse being but from one halfpenny english to three halfpence for each verst or threequarters of a mile they produce their horses with great reluctance the instant a traveller demands a fresh supply of horses the yamshics assemble in crowds and frequently wrangle and quarrel to such a degree as to afford great amusement to one not impatient to set off an hour is often spent in such disputes and the postmaster is frequently obliged to settle them by obliging the yamshics to draw lots who shall furnish the horses the only mode of traveling with comfort is by having a russ soldier with you which can be procured with the passport this soldier immediately on his arrival at the post house instead of attending to the arguments of the yamshics or waiting for the mediation of the postmaster summarily decides the business by the argumentum baculinum or the powerful interposition of the cudgel  the peasants act in capacity of coachmen and postilions they always harness four horses abreast and commonly put eight and sometimes ten to a carriage the stages being generally from  0 to  0 miles long and the roads extremely bad they seldom use either boots or saddles and have no kind of stirrup but a rope doubled and thrown across the horses back each horse is equipped with a safflebridle seldom put into the mouth but hanging loose under it their general method of driving is by starts and bounds not an even pace seldom trotting their horses but often galloping them even in the worst roads and as often checking their speed on the most level ground a common piece of rope serves them for a whip as they urge their horses on hooting and whistling like catcalls the intervals of these noises are filled with singing to which the natives have a great propensity no sooner are the postilions mounted but they will begin to warble an air and often continue it without intermission for hours nay they will occasionally sing in parts and in a kind of musical dialogue chanting as it were their common conversation thus the postilions sing from the beginning to the end of a stage the soldiers sing during their march the countrymen sing during the most laborious occupations the publichouses reecho with their carrols and in a still evening the air will vibrate with the notes of surrounding villages  sthlin who resided a long time in russia and who has turned his attention to the study of the national music gives us the following information on this curious subject  the general music that prevails among the common people in russia from the duna to the amur and the frozen ocean consists in one species of simple melody which admits of infinite variation according to the ability of the singer or the custom of the several provinces in this extensive empire the words of the songs are mostly in prose and often extempore according to the immediate invention or recollection of the singer perhaps an ancient legend the history of an enormous giant a declaration of love a dialogue between a lover and his mistress a murder or a beautiful girl sometimes they are merely letters and syllables taken from some old accidence metrically arranged but seldom in rhyme and adapted to this general air these latter words are chiefly used by mothers in singing to their children while boors at the same time perform their national dance to the same tune accompanied with instrumental music the subject of the song shall also frequently allude to the former adventures of the singer or his present situation and the peasants will adapt the topics of their common discourse and their disputes with each other to this general air which altogether forms an extraordinary effect and leads one to suppose that they chaunt their ordinary conversation  in their common intercourse the peasants are as i have observed very polite to each other in higher life the gentlemen bow very low and the ladies incline their heads instead of curtesying sometimes the gentlemen kiss the ladies hands as a mark of respect and if the parties are wellacquainted or of equal condition or if the lady is disposed to pay a compliment she will salute the gentlemans cheek whilst he is kissing her hand and frequently whilst she stoops to touch his cheek he takes that opportunity of saluting her if the gentleman is a person of very high rank the lady offers first to kiss his hand which he prevents by saluting her cheek men particularly relations exchange salutes in this manner each kissing the others hand at the same instant and afterward their cheeks  in their usual mode of address the russians never prefix any title or appellation of respect to their names but persons of all ranks even those of the first distinction call each other by their christian names to which they add a patronymick these patronymicks are formed in some cases by adding vitch similar to our fitz to the christian name of the father in others by of or of the former is applied only to persons of condition the latter to those of inferior rank thus ivan ivanovitch ivan ivanof is ivan the son of ivan and so on  the female patronymick is efna or ofna as sophiaalexeefna or sophia the daughter of alexey maria ivanofna or maria the daughter of ivan  great families are distinguished in general by a surname as those of romanof galitzin sheremetof etc  the houses of the nobility are furnished with great elegance and their suites of apartments where they receive company are uncommonly splendid  their grounds are prettily laid out in the style of our parks with gentle slopes spacious lawns scattered plantations and water fringed with wood most of the russian nobles having english gardeners and resigning themselves implicitly to their direction  the english merchants live in a very social and even splendid manner besides constant meetings at their respective houses they have once a fortnight a regular assembly in a house hired for the purpose to which they obligingly invite all their countrymen who happen to be at petersburgh and occasionally some russian ladies here is a ball cards and supper  the great road from moscow to petersburgh is continued during a space of  00 miles almost in a straight line cut through a forest and is extremely tedious on each side the trees are cleared away to the breadth of  0 or  0 paces and the whole way lies chiefly through endless tracts of wood only broken by villages round which to a small distance the grounds are open and cultivated this road is of a uniform breadth and formed in the following manner trunks of trees are laid handsomely in rows parallel to each other and are bound down in the center and at each end by long poles or beams fastened into the ground with wooden pegs these trunks are sometimes covered with boards like a flooring and sometimes with layers of boughs strewed over with sand or earth hanway has made a calculation and says that  00 miles of such road takes up   00000 trees whilst the road is new it is remarkably good but as the trunks decay or sink or as the sand or ground is washed off as is the case often for miles together it is full of holes and ridges and of course very rough to travel on the villages which occasionally line this route are all like each other a single street with wooden cottages and here and there a brick house  the common carriages of this country are called kibitkis a kibitki is a small cart capable of containing two persons abreast whilst the driver sits on the further extremity close to the horses tails it is formed like a childs cradle about five feet long and the hinder part covered with a tilt made of laths and interwoven with birchbark but open in front there is not a piece of iron in the whole machine it has no springs and is fastened together by wooden pins ropes and sticks to the four wheels the boxes of which are of an extraordinary length and project above a foot beyond the orbit of the wheels the russians when they travel in these carriages place a featherbed in the bottom and with this precaution the roughness of the roads is not felt and a traveller stretched on this bed may doze away a journey in perfect tranquillity and that he may know how far he travels each verst or threefourths of an english mile is marked all through the high roads of russia by a post    feet high and painted red  in winter people travel on sledges of which there are several kinds in this country some entirely close others quite open some between both the latter sort are shaped also like a cradle its tilt which rises from the hinder part and projects about two feet is open in front but has curtains the outside is secured with matting and oilskin and the inside with coarse cloths within is a mattrass featherbed and coverlid or quilt of coarse cloth in this machine the traveller sometimes lies down at full length sometimes sits up crosslegged like a turk and at other times sits on cushions this sledge is drawn by two horses abreast empress of russia traveling or one before the other according to the width of the roads it is to pass and the usual rate of traveling is from six to eight miles an hour the motion of this carriage over the beaten snow is easy and almost imperceptible many of the roads from petersburgh toward sweden through wiburgh are scarce a yard wide sunk two or three feet below the level of the snow and though the path itself is beaten and hard yet if two such carriages meet and one has to turn out for the other the horses that turn out will sink in the untrodden snow up to their girths  when the empress travels she is drawn in a large machine like a room which contains her bed a table and other conveniences where four persons may sit to dinner this machine in winter is set on a sledge and drawn by    posthorses if any of them fail on the roads others are ready to supply their place and there are several small palaces on the roads she travels where she sometimes sleeps and refreshes herself peter the great once traveled from moscow to petersburgh     english miles in    hours but it is easily performed in three days and a half the empress as she travels by night as well as day is conducted on by the light of fires blazing on eminences by the roadside these fires are great piles of wood placed there for the purpose and the road where the country is open is marked out by firtrees planted on both sides at the distance of  0 yards from each other  it was formerly a custom in russia with respect to marriage for the match to be made up between the parents on each side without any previous meeting consent or liking of one another and often before the parties were of sufficient age to judge for themselves but peter i taking into consideration this unacceptable way of joining young people together without their own approbation and to which might be owing a great deal of that discord and little love shown to each other it being a common thing in russia for husbands to beat their wives cruelly so as often to kill them which the law winked at and of course led wives often to murder their husbands in revenge for which they were buried up to the neck and thus left guarded to starve to death the czar too often a witness to these sad sights in pity to his people enacted a law that no young couple should be married without their own free consent and that all persons should be admitted to visit and see each other at least six weeks before they were married this regulation pleased the russians much and has been the means of their adopting other foreign customs which before they set their faces against  they have many whimsical notions respecting the state of the dead when a corpse is dressed a priest is sent for to pray for its soul to purify it with incense and sprinkle it with holy water after keeping it eight or ten days above ground thus purifying it daily the priest produces a ticket signed by the bishop and another clergyman as a passport to heaven and the body is carried to the grave with many gesticulations of sorrow being interred the mourners return and drown their sorrow in intoxication which among the opulent lasts with few intermissions for  0 days during this time the priest says prayers daily over the grave of the deceased for though the russians do not believe in purgatory they conceive their departed friend may be assisted on his way to heaven by prayers  chap iv on their population and trade little russia in general is a very level and fertile country abounding in all the necessaries of human life the air is serene and good with not the  0th part of the fogs and a fifth part less rain than we have in england the russes have a saying that they are very rich in fish and in bread and it may be added that they have good store of horses of cattle and of wild game  we are not to look for that population in russia that we meet with in the eastern countries of europe if such was to be found this empire which is of a much greater extent than that of the romans would be as powerful also but the common ideas of its being all a desert we have already seen carried too far in siberia there are rich meadows  00 miles square it is very badly peopled taking the whole together but many of the provinces are very populous much of the territory in a good state of culture and the appearance of it in many parts flourishing to this may be added the great increase of people constantly gaining by the reception and encouragement given to foreigners to settle who flock here in whole troops this encouragement which the empress always grants consists in several very important articles all the expenses of the journey or voyage from their native country are borne by her she feeds and supports them by the way on their arrival at the territory appointed them to cultivate which has always been part of the crown lands every family has a cottage erected at her expense to which they contribute labor they are next furnished with implements necessary for cultivation and one years provision for the whole family and they are exempted from all taxes for five years thus since the accession of the present czarina to the year    0 upwards of six hundred thousand persons germans poles and greeks from turkey have settled in russia from the courts of germany shiploads at a time and from poland and turkey whole towns and districts and as all the promises that have been made to them and even more have been inviolably kept and fresh settlers are continually pouring in there is no doubt but by this time she has upwards of   00000 new subjects which must annually increase the trade revenues and power of this country  the product or manufactures of russia which constitutes its commerce with other nations is potash woodash russia leather furs linen thread flax hemp sealskins trainoil rosin pitch tar caviare tallow honey wax isinglass for glue and ship windows soap feathers musk rhubarb and other drugs also masts timber plank and firs to these articles of trade may be added the produce of their iron and copper mines and the raw silk they bring from china to which place they carry on a trade by land in caravans carrying out furs and bringing back tea silk cottons gold etc  russia has made great strides in the improvement of her commerce for several years past enjoying some advantages beyond any other nation the number and greatness of her rivers opens a communication almost to every part of the globe but particularly within her own extended dominions as to timber hemp and iron which are the instrumental causes of trade no country in the world produces a greater quantity which is a natural consequence of the cheapness of land and labor  it seems to be a maxim established in all countries where commerce has made any progress that the value of exports must exceed that of the imports otherwise the balance must necessarily be paid in money against this the russians though they have both silver and gold mines and of course bullion should be considered as a commodity have taken the precaution to make it next to death to export their coin nor can any plate or bullion be carried out of the country but by express permission in its commerce with england the balance of trade is greatly against us  the customhouse books of petersburgh and cronstadt contain the following accounts for      exports  0       rubles imports          ditto forming a balance of nearly five millions in their favor  there is an english factory at petersburgh which was in the reign of mary i established at archangel but removed to petersburg soon after its foundation and half the trade of that city is in the hands of the english yet the russian trade in the baltic is carried on also at riga revel narva and wiburgh from riga a considerable quantity of corn is exported by the english swedes and dutch  though the english engross so much of the russian trade it is but justice to observe that there are no monopolies or exclusive privileges assumed by the russia company nor any rule of conduct established which has the least appearance of bringing discredit to this nation for any naturalborn subject may for   l take his freedom of the company go into russia and establish a house of business under the protection of the british crown and may send russian goods into england paying the legal duties  the english having opened a trade with the persians across the caspian sea in which they were interrupted in      the russians pursued their track with perseverance the caspian sea i have had occasion to mention before i will only observe now that it is about   0 miles long and   0 miles broad has no tide but one small island in it uninhabited that its water is salt and that on account of its numberless shallows it is navigable only by vessels drawing from seven to ten feet water the russian ports on this sea are gurjef at the mouth of the jaik and kislar on the eastern coasts the havens on the opposite side belong to persia  the principal commodities exported by the russians to persia are english dutch french and siberian cloths vitriol soap alum sugar russia leather needles coarse russia linen velvets glassware paper furs skins tea provisions furniture iron brass tin lead hardware watches etc and those imported are raw and manufactured silks bucharian lambskins rice dried fruits spices drugs saffron salt sulphur and naptha also gold and silver in bars golddust precious stones and pearls  with the bucharians who inhabit the southwestern part of independent tartary and who are a very commercial people their caravans traveling through the whole continent of asia trafficking with thibet china india and persia the russians trade largely but the chinese trade carried on at kiachta as we have seen and situated on the frontiers of the chinese and russian empires is by far the most important of all russias asiatic commerce the gross amount of this trade in exports and imports reaching to near  00000 l sterling per annum  the russians carry on also a commerce with the turks upon the black sea which in times of peace is very considerable their great wish is to establish an intercourse with the parts of the mediterranean through the dardanelles this trade as the russians had not till lately any port on the black sea was carried on by the greeks armenians and turks the imports were greek wines raisins dried figs almonds oil rice saffron painted linens and cottons the exports hides and leather coarse linen hardware caviare etc these greek and armenian merchants returning to constantinople supplied the ports of the sea of azof and the euxine with russian and european commodities  the mines of siberia have been already treated of to speak more would be needless i will then take notice of the new canal of vishneivoloshof cut by peter and improved by the present empress which opens a communication between the caspian sea and the baltic indeed there is no kingdom on the globe wherein the inlandnavigation is carried through such an extent of country as in russia for it is possible to convey goods by water      miles from the frontiers of china to petersburgh with an interruption only of about  0 miles and from astrachan to the same capital through a tract of      miles without once landing them a plan was also set on foot to open a communication also with the black sea by means of a canal and captain perry an english engineer was actually employed for the purpose the canal was begun and the length of a mile and a half cut but it then dropped from an idea that it was not practicable the present empress however revived it and employed professor lovitz to undertake it he took a level of the ground and traced out the canal which required to be only five miles long the great difficulty was how to procure a sufficient supply of water however it again fell to the ground professor lovitz being wantonly murdered by the rebel pugatchef  chap v of their learning institutions etc hitherto the russians have made but an inconsiderable appearance in the republic of letters but the late institutions of academies and other learned seminaries have given rise to a number of scientific papers which have been very favorably received all over europe and are the best test of their growing eminence in arts and sciences three colleges were founded by peter i at moscow one for classical learning and philosophy one for mathematics and a third for navigation and astronomy to these he added a dispensary lately a university has been there founded and the present empress has founded one at petersburgh with    professors and two seminaries where youth are taught greek latin russ german italian french and tartar history geography mathematics architecture fortification artillery algebra drawing painting music fencing dancing reading and writing  the imperial academy of sciences at petersburgh owes its institution to peter i catharine i settled a fund of  000 l a year on it and    persons men eminent for learning and talents were appointed professors and the present empress has largely encouraged it  an academy of arts is also here established with a revenue of   000 l a year which brings up  00 scholars from the age of six to eighteen they are clothed fed and lodged at the expense of the crown are instructed in reading writing arithmetic drawing french and german at    they may choose any of the following arts painting architecture engraving carving watchmaking turning casting statues gilding and making artificial gems prizes are annually distributed to the best proficients and    of those who have obtained four prizes are sent abroad for four years at the expense of the crown  there is also at petersburgh a free oeconomical society for the encouragement of agriculture well endowed and in the true spirit of this institution several young men are annually sent to england to learn husbandry here is also established a mode of making experiments in agriculture as singular in its kind as it is praiseworthy and political at a place called sophisk is a farm of about  000 acres which is provided with dwellinghouses and other necessary buidings here a clergyman of learning and abilities who studied husbandry many years in england is settled and under him as assistants several young men who have been educated in england every species of husbandry is to be introduced and lectures on the theory and practice given from each seminary of the empire two children of priests who are likely to succeed their fathers in their benefices are to be placed in this rural establishment to learn farming so as to be able to teach their parishioners any nobleman desirous to improve his tenants may send a young man also to this school to learn  in petersburgh also there are two seminaries for the education of the nobility one for boys called corpse de cadets the other for girls called le couvent des demoiselles nobles  in the first the number of persons residing in the house including the cadets is  000 the annual income is  0000 l for the reception of  00 scholars in      there were   0 nobles and    boys of inferior rank bred up to be tutors to noblemens children the nobles are dressed in uniform and are intended for the army they are received at six and remain    years and are taught french german and all military accomplishments in the summer they are encamped for six weeks near the town are reviewed and taught all the maneuvers of war some are annually selected according to their merit to travel into foreign countries the boys are all brought up in the hardiest manner not clad in furs even in winter nor too much indulged with warmth they are habituated to all kinds of exercises and particularly to running and leaping at the further end of a large hall stands a leather horse some parts of which are six feet high this they leap over in every direction spring on its head vault upon its back turn themselves round upon it poise themselves upon their hands with their head upon the saddle and their feet in the air and then throw themselves on their feet upon the ground once or twice in the winter these cadets are permitted to give a masquerade and ball to the principal nobility and on these occasions some of the young ladies from the female seminary are invited as partners to the bigger boys  the female seminary is a large building erected for a nunnery it was opened on its present plan in      and is endowed by the empress with a revenue of   000 l a year it receives   0 nobles and   0 tradesmens daughters the girls are admitted at five years of age and kept till    these two classes are differently taught according to their rank the whole society is taught reading writing accounts and needle work the young ladies learn history geography french german italian dancing music and drawing the other girls are employed in housholdaffairs they prepare and wash their own linen are taught to make bread and the art of cookery once a year  00 poor women dine in their hall and are attended by the oldest ladies of the seminary to each of whom these ladies give a piece of silver coin and a few yards of linen to teach them to administer to the wants of others within their walls they have a theater where these young folks act plays and at certain times are permitted to invite their friends and some few of the cadets to a ball and supper  backward however as the russians are in learning this country can boast the earliest historian of the north for at a period when poland sweden and denmark were unlettered when even the annalists of iceland were mute a monk of a convent at kiof was compiling a history of russia he died in      and since him there have been some eminent writers in history and the different sciences but in order to spread a taste for literature among her subjects catharine appointed in      a committee to order and superintend translations of the classics and the best modern authors into the russian tongue and allowed  000 l a year toward defraying the expense of the undertaking in consequence of this    books were translated before      translations were then making of    more and    were proposed to be translated  with respect to classical literature the greek language is yet taught in very few schools is scarcely known to the laity and is a rare qualification even among the regular clergy latin is more common being understood by many of the regular clergy and not unfrequently cultivated by persons of improved education many of the classics have been translated by natives into the russian tongue several editions of the most approved greek and roman authors have been published at moscow and petersburgh but the editors have been chiefly foreigners encouraged to it by the russian nobility the archbishops however of moscow and kherson are men of profound learning and good greek scholars  the common language of russia is a mixture of the polish with the schlavonian their priests and learned men speak what is called modern greek which those who are well acquainted with the ancient greek may very well understand the forms of the russ letters have also a strong resemblance to the old greek alphabet  chap vi of their religion the established religion of russia is that of the greek church which is a kind of reform from the romish church they disclaim image worship but yet have a number of pictures of saints in their churches and houses to which they pay veneration but only as they say under the idea of mediators they deny the popes supremacy yet observe a number of fasts and lents they oblige their bishops but not their priests to celibacy who have no fixed income for their support but depend on the voluntary contributions of their flocks nunneries and monasteries were once very frequent but many are now abolished and the abuses of those that remain very much removed no man can become a monk till he is turned of  0 nor any female a nun till she is  0 years of age and not even then but with the express permission of their superiors  the head of their church was a patriarch whose authority and jurisdiction the russians relate were derived from the patriarch of the greek church who formerly resided at constantinople and afterward at the isle of scio to whom they had long paid their spiritual subjection as the roman catholics to the pope and used to send presents annually and who being at length pressed and driven from thence by the turks hieronymo the then great patriarch being invited and encouraged by the czar did in      come to moscow and there resign his patriarchal see to the metropolitan of moscow as supreme bishop and pastor of the greek church this patriarch of moscow was afterward in very high esteem with the people and bore with the czar a kind of sovereignty in the empire for he was not only supreme judge in ecclesiastical matters but had a power to reform by his own authority whatever he thought prejudicial to good morals and could pass sentence of death without acquainting the court with it former czars having ordered such sentences to be put into execution without the least demur or hesitation  but on the death of the eleventh patriarch in      who was a very old man and who happened to die soon after peter i returned from his travels he refused to have any other patriarch elected and took upon himself to be the sole head and governor of his church giving only to the metropolitan of razan the administration of ecclesiastical affairs who was in matters of moment to apply to the czar for directions this transaction chagrined the clergy and it coming to peters ears that a bishop had talked a little too freely against this new authority of his his majesty ordered him to be formally degraded but the other bishops remonstrating against this order and saying among other things that they being all bishops and but of equal rank could not do it unless a new patriarch or supreme was first elected the czar created a new bishop on purpose and ordered him to do it and accordingly the mitre was taken from the head of this contumacious bishop by the one new created  the ministers of their churches whom they call popes and proto popes or priests and archpriests never preach to the people says perry who wrote the beginning of this century some few only excepted who preach before the czar in the cathedral church on great holidays the height of the learning which the common clergy can be said to be masters of or indeed that is required of them as a qualification for holy orders is that they can chant or read over distinctly the service of the church have a good clear voice a fair character and can repeat hospidi pomilio that is lord have mercy upon us    or    times in a breath nor did they much regard from whence they took their priests but since the establishment of their universities there is a reform in this as in other things  of all their saints the russians hold st nicholas most in esteem and often speak of him as a god if you ask them on crossing a lake how far it is to such a place they will tell you that if it pleases st nicholas to send them a fair wind they shall get there by such a time  there is no great difference between the russ religion and that of the papists with respect as i have observed to their holding saints in adoration and keeping of holidays in their belief that it is in the power of the priest to forgive sins and in the point of damning or inveighing against all people of any other religion than their own they oblige the clergy to marry one wife agreeable to st pauls direction but no more and if she dies he can officiate no longer than one year afterward but usually retires to a monastery for bread on this account it is that priests in russia use their wives better than any men in the country they administer the sacrament in both kinds to the laity as well as the clergy and though they pray for the dead they believe if a man receives the priests blessing before he dies and has a certificate for st nicholas that he departed in the true christian faith which certificate is put between his fingers when laid in his grave that he shall be admitted into heaven they differ also from the papists and the reformed churches concerning the holy trinity they say the holy ghost proceeds from the father only not from father and son and so much reverence his descent in the form of a dove that very few of them will eat a pigeon one of the strongest and hottest disputes they have among them about any difference in point of religion is the manner of holding their fingers when they cross themselves one of their patriarchs having enjoined that laymen should only cross themselves with two fingers whereas there is an obstinate sect among them that will do it with three  from a general opinion that no man can be saved but those who profess the greek religion it is reckoned a great merit in men of opulence and rank to bring over proselytes to the russian faith nor is a man accounted a christian till he has been rebaptized in this ceremony he is to spit three times over his left shoulder says perry and repeat these words after the priest cursed are my parents that brought me up in the religion that i have been taught i spit upon them and upon their religion thus do they dispute for trifles whilst they neglect the solid things of christianity  like the roman catholics they have also their miracles and those equally as ridiculous for the amusement of my readers i will relate one or two of them there are    monasteries belonging to the district of the city of novogorod the chief of which is dedicated to the famous st anthony of whom the russians relate this story  that he being guided by the vision of an angel came about  00 years ago from the mouth of the river tyber on the coast of italy round through the great ocean up the baltic and by way of the lodoga sea and river volcoff to the city of novogorod in four days upon a millstone and by this miracle occasioned the thorough conversion of the country to the christian faith  in the month of june they have a procession about the city in commemoration of the day of st anthonys arrival a monastery is built on the spot where he landed and the millstone on which he floated is still to be seen placed upon one edge in the church belonging to this monastery near which the body of st anthony is buried in a stonecoffin and the russians affirm as an undeniable testimony of the truth of this miracle that god has preserved his body from corruption and they generally expose it to the view of such persons as humbly come to pay their devotions at his tomb  in the district of novogorod also by the river tiffin which falls into the lodoga sea there is a monastery dedicated to the blessed virgin of which they relate the following miracle viz that the church which is now standing within the walls of the monastery was originally built on the opposite side of the river and that the place where it now stands which is a hard gravelly bank for several miles above and below it was then a mere bog but that the mother of god came through the air in    hours from constantinople and in the night removed the said church over the river into the said bog which immediately became hard ground and that she did this in order to be worshipped by the people on that side of the river to which she removed the church  carved images are forbidden in their churches agreeable to the law of moses which forbids the worship of any graven image but pictures of their saints they say are no images and are approved by god and tell the following story as a confirmation  that a painter trying to paint a likeness of our savior and finding that what he painted at one time did not agree with the likeness he had given at another was exceedingly uneasy that our savior accordingly took compassion on him appeared and called the painter to him asked him for his pockethandkerchief laid it on his face and returned it to the painter saying he would when spread find his picture upon it  that from this original the russ painters copy the likeness of our savior with great exactness and of course it benefits the limners trade in this country  one more and i have done  they represent the virgin mary with three hands and on the following account in the kingdom of casan a painter had been drawing the virgin with our savior in her arms and had so disposed the picture as to show both her hands but having left it and returning to finish it instead of two hands he found three conceiving it to be a trick he rubbed out the additional one and having finished it locked it up and put the key in his pocket but returning the second morning he found a third hand painted again as before on which he crossed himself and was greatly surprised but after a little reflection still looked on it as a trick put upon him rubbed it out a second time and secured the room thoroughly coming again the third morning he found the third hand painted again and going to efface it the virgin herself appeared bade him forbear and told him it was her will to be drawn with three hands which the russians to this day follow and call her the cazansky boagaroditza or cazansky mother of god  the churches i have already spoken of except that they have no seats the greek ceremonial requiring all persons to stand but i must not forget their bells which form no inconsiderable part of their divine worship as the length or shortness of their peals ascertains the greater or lesser sanctity of the day they are hung in belfries detached from the church do not swing like our bells but are fixed immoveably to the beams and are rung by a rope tied to the clapper and pulled sideways some of these bells are of stupendous size one in the tower of st ivans church at moscow weighs      russian puds or        english pounds it has always been esteemed a meritorious act of religion to present a church with bells and the piety of the donor has been measured by their magnitude according to this mode of estimation boris gudonof who gave a bell to the cathedral of moscow that weighed    000lb was the most pious sovereign of russia till he was surpassed by the empress anne at whose expense a bell was cast that weighs       lb and which exceeds in size every bell in the known world its value at   s a lb is      l a vast sum  but every one ambitious to contribute toward it threw some gold or silver into the furnaces which were four in number and these furnaces having cocks let off the metal into the mould its height is    feet its circumference at the bottom    yards    inches its greatest thickness    inches this bell was hung to a beam in a pit but the beam having been burnt in a great fire which happened at moscow gave way and the bell fell and a piece broke out of it large enough to admit two persons abreast without stooping its diameter at bottom is    feet   inches at top   feet   inches  to give my readers some idea of the ceremonial of the greek church i will lay before them a description from coxe who was present at moscow when the archbishop performed the service one sunday morning on his entrance the choristers sung a hymn taken from psalm cxiii verse   which they finished as he approached the shrine or sanctuary having then said a short prayer he placed himself on a raised seat in the middle of the church the bishops alone have the privilege of robing in the middle of the church the common priests put on their vestments in the shrine or sanctuary  and taking off his mandyas or common garment the attendant priests kissed his hand whilst they delivered to him the different parts of his costly pontifical vestments which in receiving he raised to his lips to kiss the cross embroidered on them before he put them on he also placed on his head a crown richly ornamented with pearls and precious stones his dress was similar to the imperial robe formerly worn by the greek emperors of constantinople and which they permitted the supreme dignatories of the church to wear during divine service and the same attire still continues to distinguish the hierarchy of the greek church established in russia from the lower orders the archbishop being robed repaired to the sanctuary and soon after began the service part of which was performed in the sclavonian tongue by the different priests and part by the archbishop in the greek language which he pronounced according to the accent of the modern greeks in conformity to the rules of the church no organ or other musical instrument was introduced but the vocal harmony which consisted in hymns was exceedingly pleasing lighted tapers and incense seemed no less essential parts of their worship than among the roman catholics toward the conclusion of the prayers the archbishop and clergy retired within the sanctuary to receive the communion the foldingdoors that enclose that place were immediately shut and none of the laity at that time partook of this rite but a stranger is permitted to view the whole through a sidedoor the communicants stood through the ceremony and the wine was according to usual custom mixed with warm water the bread cut into small pieces was put into the wine and the elements of both kinds were given at the same time in a spoon  the whole service lasted about an hour and the archbishop having pronounced the final benediction again seated himself in the middle of the church and unrobed  on the  th of january old style they have an annual ceremony of a religious nature that of blessing the waters this used to be held upon the neva on which occasion the sovereign attended in person upon the ice and all the regiments of guards were drawn out in great solemnity its pomp though still splendid is now much diminished  the principal circumstances are as follow  on the frozen surface of a small canal between the admiralty and the palace is erected an octagon pavilion of wood painted green and ornamented with boughs of fir open at the side and crowned by a dome supported by eight pillars on the top is the figure of st john with the cross and four paintings representing some of our saviors miracles on the outside a carved image of the holyspirit under the emblem of a dove was suspended as is usual in the sanctuaries of the greek churches the floor of this edifice is carpeted excepting a square vacancy in the middle in which an opening in the ice is cut and a ladder let down into the water the pavilion is enclosed by pallisades adorned with firtwigs and the intermediate space also carpeted from one of the windows of the palace a scaffold is erected to the extremity of the canal and lined with red cloth at a time appointed says mr coxe who was present on one of these occasions the empress appeared at this window and the archbishop who was to perform the benediction passed at the head of a numerous procession along the scaffolding into the octagon round which were drawn up a few soldiers of each regiment quartered at petersburg after having pronounced a few prayers he descended the ladder plunged a cross into the water and then sprinkled the colors of each regiment at the conclusion of this ceremony the archbishop retired and the people rushed in crowds into the octagon drank the water with eagerness sprinkled it upon their clothes and carried home some of it to purify their houses  chap vii of their constitution government laws revenue etc the government of russia is the most absolute in europe there is not even the appearance of the least barrier between the people and the will of the sovereign all ranks are equally slaves to the crown not subjects and their punishments show the spirit of the legislature the greatest nobility are liable to be seized for the most trifling offense and banished to siberia their estates confiscated and their families ruined or they are liable to suffer the knout that is to be whipped to death or undergo other violent punishments such as having their tongues cut out to be hung up by the ribs and many other inflictions of barbarity which show the cruelty of despotism without having its good effect the secret court of chancery which is a tribunal composed of a few ministers chosen by the sovereign leaves the lives and fortunes of all families at his mercy and the nobles of russia thus brought under the yoke of the most dreadful slavery do not fail to retaliate on the people who are slaves to the nobles as well as to the sovereign  the inhabitants in general may be divided into four orders    that of the nobles and gentry   that of the clergy   that of the merchants and tradesmen and   that of the peasants  the first three include almost all the free subjects of the empire the latter all the vassals or slaves  the nobles and gentry are the sole persons who in the spirit of feudal despotism have a right to possess land but instead of appearing themselves according to the tenure of that system at the head of their retainers are now only expected to serve in the army and are obliged to furnish recruits in proportion to their estates  in russia as in oriental governments there is little distinction of rank among the nobility excepting what is derived from the service of the sovereign no family of rank derives any solid benefit from hereditary descent the importance of a noble house of immense property and official honors is almost annihilated on the death of the chief because the property he leaves behind him is equally divided among his sons and because titles though hereditary do not independent of the favor of the crown add any weight to the wearer those of prince count or baron conveying in themselves little distinction unless accompanied with some high civil or military employ according to the system introduced by peter i but which has been abused since his time every person takes precedence from his military station and he must rise in regular gradation from a corporal to a fieldofficer yet this is rather eluded gentlemens sons being made corporals in their infancy and although the law of peter i which compelled every gentleman to serve in the army on pain of degradation is now overlooked yet no one under the rank of a major let his fortune be ever so large is permitted to drive more than two horses under that of brigadier more than four a nobleman of the highest fortune and distinction who has never been in the army is not allowed but by especial favor of the crown to use a carriage in the capital drawn by more than one horse though a merchant may have two there are various methods however of conferring military rank and the privileges attendant on it the highchamberlain ranks as major general secretaries of state as officers and contributors to the foundlinghospital at moscow as lieutenants  these regulations and the easy acquisition of military rank has induced mr schloetzer a german settled in russia to express himself with some humor in the following manner  a nobleman is here nothing his situation in the army alone marks the value of his existence a physician has the rank of major and dares as a staffofficer put four horses to his carriage whilst others can only drive two an apothecary in the imperial service has the rank of a captain his apprentices that of ensigns and the two surgeons of the district have the rank of lieutenants  but however ridiculous these promotions may appear they are founded on principles of the soundest policy for as by a decree of peter the great every officer is noble during life and the children of a staffofficer are classed among the nobility any institution tending to increase the number of this order of men who alone are entitled to possess land must be beneficial to society on their own estates the nobles and gentry are almost uncontroled    of the church the sovereign is the head the ecclesiastic authority being consigned to a tribunal called the sacred synod which is composed of the sovereign as president the metropolitan archbishop the vice president and a number of counselors and assessors  the clergy are divided into regular and secular the first are monks the second parish priests the principal wealth of the church was centered in the monasteries which had estates to the amount of  00000l a year and like all other landholders enjoyed uncontrouled authority over their peasants who held under them but the present empress has annexed these church lands to the crown and given annual pensions to the hierarchy the dignified clergy and the monks the archbishops and bishops receive about  000l a year and the subordinate eeclesiastics in proportion  all the dignitaries of the church are chosen from the order of monks these are archbishops and bishops archimandrites or abbots and igoomens or priors there are    archbishops and bishops and throughout russia     monasteries governed by    archimandrites and    ignoomens and    nunneries there are      monks and      nuns other priests and ecclesiastics belonging to the nunneries and cathedrals are in number       the papas popes or parish priests in russia are generally the very refuse of the people many of them cannot even read these deliver the service from memory a chapter of the new testament or part of a homily which they repeat every friday and sunday besides the surplicefees which in the poorest benefice amounts to  l a year and in the most profitable to but   l they have only a wooden house scarcely superior to that of the meanest of their parishioners and a small portion of lands which they cultivate usually with their own hands whilst the highest dignity to which they can ever attain while they continue married is that of protopope of a cathedral whose income scarcely exceeds  0l a year  no wonder then they are so illiterate when they have so little encouragement to be otherwise the empress has to make amends for this had a number of sermons inculcating the moral duties printed in the russian language and these are distributed among the parochial clergy and occasionally read by them in time of divine service the children of the secular clergy are all free and are usually brought up for orders or employed in the service of the church  all the clergy wear long beards and are distinguished from the laity by suffering their hair to stream for a considerable length over their shoulders without being tied or curled their dress is a square bonnet and a long robe of a black or dark color reaching to their ancles the clergy do not mix with the polite world being men of low breeding and extremely ignorant and the dignitaries of the church seclude themselves from choice    the third class are those between the nobles and the peasants the mercantile part of the people these are exempted from the polltax and from being draughted for either army or navy on condition of their paying one per cent of their capital employed in trade to the crown two situations considered in this country as indubitable marks of servitude  it is a circumstance worthy of remark that the russian merchants and tradesmen seldom keep any book of account as few of them can either read or write and are unacquainted with the knowledge of figures their manner of reckoning is by a kind of machine with several rows of wires on which beads are strung the beads on the first row stand for units those on the second for tens and so on and by this machine they can add subtract multiply and divide with facility and exactness    the fourth order of subjects are the peasants which except those of finland and carelia the ukraine and a few others are all vassals or slaves these may be divided into peasants of the crown and peasants of individuals  those of the crown inhabit the imperial demesnes and are about a sixth part of the whole they are under the jurisdiction of the imperial bailiffs and though liable to great exactions from these petty tyrants yet being under the protection of the crown are much more secure of their property than the peasants of individuals many of these have been made free and have enrolled themselves among the merchants and traders but  the peasants belonging to individuals are the private property of the landholders as much as are their implements of husbandry or herds of cattle and the value of an estate is estimated as in poland by its number of boors and not by its number of acres with respect to the lords own demands upon his peasants he is restrained by no law either in the exaction of any sum or in the mode of employing them he is absolute master of their time and labor some he employs in agriculture a few he makes his menial servants and perhaps without wages and from others he exacts an annual payment each vassal is rated according to the arbitrary will of his master some pay four or five shillings a year others engaged in trade contribute in proportion to their profits a mason shall pay  l a year a smith   l and some as high as  0l the capital they may acquire by trade is liable to be seized and there can be no redress for according to an old feudal law a slave cannot institute a process against his master some of the russian nobility will send their vassals to moscow or petersburgh to learn trades and then employ them on return on their own estates let them out for hire sell them at an advanced price or receive from them an annual compensation for a permission to carry on their trades for their own advantage  they formerly could punish their slaves as they pleased and with any degree of cruelty so that it extended not to death but by the new code of laws now enacted this enormous power of the lords is restrained a peasant may however obtain his liberty three ways   by manumission which on the death of his master is frequently granted to his domestics   by purchase and   by serving in the army or navy a peasant being free from the moment of his enrollment and continuing so when discharged a law is now past to oblige every nobleman whose estate consists of a certain number of families to enfranchise one of the most industrious families yearly when so set free he has a farm assigned him and the empress makes him a present of some implements and after three years he is obliged to pay his old master a good rent for that farm this is done to induce the landholders to take rent for their land instead of services  the vast empire of russia was distributed into nine extensive governments each government was subdivided into provinces and each province into districts or circles over each government was appointed a governor over the provinces a waywode and his officers who formed a chancery and over the districts an inferior waywode or a kind of justice of peace this mode of governing was found defective and the empress has established a new one the heads of which are as follow  the nine extensive governments are distributed into a larger number each containing from   to  00000 people one or more of these governments is superintended by a namestnick  lord lieutenant and each of them has a vicegoverno a council civil and criminal courts of judicature some of whose members are appointed by the crown the others chosen by the nobles and in each government there are also superior tribunals to appeal to without coming to moscow or petersburgh  in short russia with respect to the vast mass of its people is now nearly in the same state in which the greatest part of europe was plunged in the   th and   th centuries when the feudal system was gradually declining when the unbounded authority of the landholders over their slaves was beginning to be counterbalanced by the introduction of an intermediate order of merchants when new towns were continually erecting and endowed with increasing immunities and when the crown began to give freedom to many of its vasfals the completion of these plans have in a few centuries brought europe to its present state and as the legislature of russia has now the history of other nations to refer to it is not to be doubted but this country under a wise institution will reach the perfection of european states in a much shorter period  the revenues of russia besides the imposts paid by the ukraine and the provinces conquered from sweden chiefly arise from the polltax the duties of import and export an excise upon salt the crown and church lands the mint the sale of spirituous liquors etc which in the whole amount to about        l sterling which at the accession of peter the great did not exceed one million much of the revenue arises from monopolies the whole trade to china belongs to the crown so does that of rhubarb potashes and spices hemp iron beer and brandy of this revenue the expenses of army and navy amount to about  0     l those of the civil establishment to        l and the remainder or  00000l is appropriated to the privypurse of the empress but though this  00000l is equal to   00000l english it is difficult to conceive how she is able to maintain the magnificence of her court the number of public institutions the numerous buildings which in time of peace rise to  00000l yearly which are raised at her expense the liberality with which she encourages the arts and sciences the many purchases she is continually making all over europe and the immense distinctions which she confers on the most favored of her subjects  and yet the state is free from debt  the standing army of russia is computed at near   0000 regular men besides which the empress can always assemble a body of  0 or  0000 kalmucks cossacks and other irregular troops and as excellent a train of artlllery as any in the world the regulars consist chiefly of infantry except about  0000 horse and include all those who wear uniforms and are trained to european discipline when properly disciplined they are very excellent soldiers being brave steady obedient patient of fatigue and hardship and scarcely ever guilty of desertion  they are so naturally fearless says captain perry as not to be discouraged at death i have seen says he several of them walk to execution with chains on their legs and wax tapers burning in their hands and as they passed the crowds bow to them and say prostee brats that is adieu brothers and the people make the like reply to them bidding them adieu and have laid down their heads on the blocks and resigned their lives with a steady countenance this natural fearlessness their being constantly exposed to the extremes of heat and cold and their custom of bathing once or twice aweek through their lives as i have described makes them fit to encounter any thing so that it is said let the russians have but good officers and they will not fail to make good soldiers the uniform is green turned up with red white waistcoats and breeches the troops in general are raised at little or no expense and whilst in their own country subsist chiefly on provisions furnished them by the country people according to their internal valuation  if we judge from the present state of the russian army we may look for great success in any war the men may be all called veterans it has not any neighbors to whom it is not much superior in force poland is at its mercy prussia is not equal to her and will never be able to make another stand against her the russian army being now more powerful more numerous and with an artillery inferior to none  an advantage she never had before poland behind her threefourths of it absolutely in her power to winter in in a turkish war instead of falling back to russia  the present state of the russian navy promises also well to the empire full of hands and full of ships new ones every day launching at petersburgh and all the old ones repairing she has many shipcarpenters at tanais on the black sea and will be there extremely formidable russia produces every article necessary for the construction and equipment of ships which are chiefly built at cronstadt petersburgh and archangel manufactures of cordage and sailcloth are established in different parts of the empire and the magazines of petersburgh and archangel are always plentifully stored with large quantities of both these articles in      the navy of this country consisted of    ships of the line    frigates   prames and  0  galleys at cronstadt there is an imperial hospital for sailors and an academy for marines and officers of the navy this in      contained   0 cadets who are clothed maintained and taught at the expense of the crown they are admitted at the age of five and are suffered to remain there till    they learn accounts mathematics drawing fortification and navigation and have masters in the french german english and swedish languages they are trained to naval affairs and make an annual cruise on the baltic as far as revel  indeed what gives great weight to the naval strength of russia is the number of her galleys which carry from  00 to  00 men six or eight only of which are sailors rowing is to the russian soldiers what swimming was to the romans every footsoldier learns to handle the oar at the same time as the musket by which means without maritime commerce and without embargoes the russians have always crews ready for their galleys these says count alzarotti are here the proper things be there never so little water there is always enough for them they glide between the little islands and the rocks and can land any where they are all armed with two pieces of cannon on the prow and furnished with chase and swivelguns on the sides an army of  0000 men is transported in them with ease they cast anchor every night and land where it is least expected when disembarked they draw them up on land range them in a circle with their prows and artillery pointed outward and thus they have a fortified camp presently they leave five or six battalions to guard it and with the rest of their troops overrun the country and lay it under contribution the expedition ended they reembark and begin again in other quarters and sometimes they transport these vessels from one water to another over a steep of land as was practiced by the ancients these galleys are built at petersburgh of a species of oak which is at least two summers on the road before it arrives it comes ready cut by the carpenters in the province of casan brought all the way by water  could russia obtain a free passage from the black sea through the dardanelles into the mediterraneax which she aims at with azoph and the crimea in her hands as it is she would then have a free navigation from all parts of the empire by means of the rivers tanais and donetz down to azoph that port would then be the grand magazine of all the commodities of the empire where her ships would load for distributing them through all the fouthern countries of europe and on the coast of africa at the same time that petersburgh sent them to all the northern ones this trade would give them a new export perhaps of more consequence than all the others put together that of corn the finest territories of europe for husbandry are said to be the tracts on the north of the black sea including the province of the ukraine at present these countries have no vent for such a product and therefore raise no more than for their own consumption but open the dardanelles to them and this territory would be much better for supplying the best cornmarkets in europe than those which at present supply them and would gain the exclusive trade likewise of serving them with naval stores  the turks will never submit to a russian navigation through the heart of constantinople which would be an overthrow of their empire unless they were first reduced to the last extremity this will depend on the naval force of the two empires in the black sea  though capital punishments except in cases of high treason in this country are apparently suppressed they are not so in fact for though the criminal laws do not literally sentence malefactors to death they still consign many to that doom through the medium of punishments in some circumstances almost assuredly if not professedly fatal which mock with the hopes of life but in reality protract the horrors of death and embitter with delay an even which reason wishes to be instantaneous for when we consider that many felons expire under the infliction of the knout that several are exhausted by the fatigue of a long journey to the remotest regions of siberia a distance of      miles and that the forlorn remnant perish in general prematurely from the unwholsomeness of the mines it will be difficult to view the doom of these unhappy outcasts in any other light than that of a lingering execution  according to the present penal laws offenders are punished in the following manner persons convicted of high treason are either beheaded or imprisoned for life felons after receiving the knout having their nostrils torn and their faces marked are condemned for life to work in the mines of nershink petty offenders are either whipped with a kind of catonine tails transported into siberia as colonists or sentenced to hard labor for a stated period among the colonists are included peasants arbitrarily consigned to banishment by their masters who are empowered to inflict this punishment assigning only the cause of the offense  all these persons felons and others are transported in spring and autumn from different parts of the russian dominions they travel part of the way by water and part by land are chained in pairs and fastened to a long rope at night they are carried to different cottages and guarded by the soldiers who conduct them when the whole troop arrive at tobolskoi the governor assigns the colonists who have been bred to handicraft trades to different masters in the town others he disposes of as vassals in the neighboring country the remainder of the colonists go on to irkutskaja where they are disposed of by the governor in the same manner the felons then proceed alone to the district of nershinkaja where they are condemned to work in the silver mines or at the different forges  the knout or knoot is a thong about the thickness of a crownpiece and about threequarters of an inch broad and rendered extremely hard by a peculiar kind of preparation it is tied to a thick plaited whip which is fastened by an iron ring like a flail to a short wooden handle the executioner before every stroke recedes a few paces drawing back his hand which holds the knoot then bounding forwards applies the fiat end of the thong with considerable force to the naked back of the criminal in a perpendicular line reaching six or seven inches from the collar to the waist he begins by hitting the right shoulder and continues his strokes parallel to each other quite to the left shoulder nor does he cease till he has given the number of lashes agreeable to the sentence from one to three hundred or more the reader may judge of the great force which a skilful executioner can give to this instrument when he is told that if he receives a private order he can dispatch the criminal by striking him two or three blows upon the ribs there are other ingenious contrivances to punish criminals far worse than death but as i trust the feeling of an english reader will rather be excused the relation of them  i will close this subject with some account of the pirates that infest the larger rivers which is attributed to the severities of the masters of fisheries to their vassals near the mouths of the jaik and the wolga whenever they are warmly pursued and distrested for support they run their vessels ashore turn mahomedans and put themselves under the protection of the persians these robbers often go in gangs of  0  0 and sometimes  0 persons in rowboats which carry from  0 to  0 hands they equip themselves with firearms and their general practice is to board immediately for where a fierce resistance is apprehended they seldom attack few of the russian merchants transport any cargoes of value down the wolga without a convoy the soldiers who are sent after them are ordered to take them alive from an apprehension that a latitude to kill might through the strong temptation to plunder in a soldiers breast subject the innocent to suffer for the guilty  the armenians are generally intrepid and fight bravely in defense of their property but the bourlacks who navigate the wolga are so extremely intimidated by these robbers that as soon as they appear they are panicstruck they submit immediately and the master of the vessel or the merchant being thus at their mercy is happy to escape with life if he attempts to defend himself and is conquered he may be sure of being barbarously murdered  as the cruelties of these men are very great so is their punishment when taken a float is built in size according to the number of delinquents and a gallows erected on it to contain a sufficient number of iron hooks on which they are hung up alive by the ribs the float is launched into the stream with labels over their heads signifying their crimes and orders are given to all towns and villages on the borders of the river on pain of death not only to afford no relief to any of these wretches but to push off the float should it land near them sometimes their partners in wickedness meet them and if there are any signs of life take them down or shoot them dead but if they are caught in these acts of illegal mercy they are hung up without the ceremony of a trial  they tell of one of these miscreants who had the fortune to disengage himself from the hook and though naked and trembling with pain and loss of blood got ashore the first object he saw who could afford him any relief was a poor shepherd whose brains he beat out with a stone and then took his clothes  these malefactors sometimes hang thus three or four days and sometimes five days alive the pain generally produces a raging fever or phrenzy which carries them off imploring the relief of water with the most horrid imprecations  a map of the empire of china   a description of china from amiot verbiest lockyer premare du halde le comte dampier cunningham kircher and others chap i of the country rivers canals etc as the chinese are at so great a distance from us and are so very unwilling to admit foreigners among them the best accounts of them we can collect are from those jesuit missionaries who dwelt among them and who traversed the whole empire in order to make converts to christianity and though the accounts we have received from these missionaries have been written some years yet as the chinese are so bigoted to their ancient customs and so prejudiced in favor of what their ancestors did that the same usages manners etc which were prevalent in china  000 years ago have not been changed with time but have continued exactly the same for  0 centuries we may rely on the faith of these men and believe that no alteration has taken place within the last  0 or  0 years as the persons employed by the several indiacompanies in europe never penetrate further than into the suburbs of canton we can learn very little from them  great tartary and china are now united and make but one mighty empire comprending all the eastern side of the continent of asia chinese tartary is bounded on the north by siberia a vast tract of country belonging to the russians as we have seen in the second third and fourth volumes of this work on the east by the gulf of kamtschatka another country of the russian empire and on the west by the country of the kalmucks established between the casghar and the caspian sea on the south it is united to china separated only by the famous wall and with this makes but one empire china extending to the chinese or great south sea  this celebrated wall of which so many travelers have spoken divides chinese tartary from china and was built   0 years before the birth of christ it was erected to defend china from that part of tartary which is now become a branch of the empire of course this astonishing barrier is become almost useless there is nothing in the whole world equal to this work which is continued for   00 miles through three great provinces not only carried through low lands and valleys but also over hills and up the steep brows of the highest mountains onethird part of the ablebodied men in china were employed in building it and the workmen were enjoined under pain of death to place the materials of it so close that the least entrance might not be left for any instrument of iron its solidity therefore has preserved it to this day entire verbiest had the curiosity to take the altitude of one of those mountains over which it extends and found it was  0 0 feet above the level of the spot where he stood so that it is built in places which seem inaccessible and is strengthened with a series of forts the beginning of this wall is a large stone bulwark raised in the sea to the east of peking and reaches to the mountains near the city of kin on the yellow river and between these two places it meets with no interruption except to the north of the city of suen in the province of petcheli where it is intercepted by a ridge of hideous and inaccessible mountains to which it is closely united and by the river hoangho which passes through it in its course to the sea as to other rivers of inferior size arches have been constructed like those of a bridge through which they find a passage it has no kind of support but what is usually given to common walls and is almost of the same form the foundation consists of large blocks of square stones laid in mortar but all the rest is of brick it is through its whole length wide enough for five or six horsemen to travel abreast with ease and at the top flat and well paved with cut stone it is built like the walls of the common cities of the empire terraced and cased with brick and is from  0 to    feet high with square towers at the distance of two bowshots from each other and embrasures at equal distances and where it rises over a rock or mountain there is an ascent by easy stonestairs mr bell who accompanied captain ismailof in his embassy to peking in      tells us this wall was begun and completely finished in the short space of five years and it is reported that the laborers stood so close for many miles that they could hand the materials to one another the whole is so strong and well built that it scarcely needs any repairs and in such a dry climate may remain in he same condition for many ages the gates of this wall are all strongly fortified  before i proceed in the description of this empire i will give my readers a short account of the great revolution which happened in that part of the world about   0 years ago which united china with many tartar kingdoms and which seated a tartar prince upon the throne and by whose descendants it has been governed ever since  a king of niuche one of the little tartar kingdoms northeast of china complained of some abuses put upon his people by the chinese merchants which not being redressed he resolved to make reprisals and accordingly invaded the province of leotong which lies without the great chinese wall the emperor sent an army against the tartar prince and the war continued some time with various success  in the mean time there happened a famine in some provinces of china and the people unable to pay the usual taxes rebelled under one lycungz their leader and to oppose this man a great army was raised but this army deserted to the rebels who advanced to the city of peking and having a correspondence with the emperors eunuchs who had then a principal share in the administration were treacherously admitted within the walls and had absolutely entered the palacegates before the emperor had notice of their approach the unfortunate prince finding himself betrayed resolved to break through the rebels with  00 of his guards then about him or perish in the attempt but these also basely abandoning him he retired into a garden with his only daughter and having first written a letter to lycungz advising him to spare his subjects he first stabbed his daughter and then hanged himself the empress the governor of the city and many more of the court of both sexes either to prevent the barbarous usage they expected from the rebels or in compliment to the emperor chose to dye with him and became their own executioners the usurper immediately took possession of the throne and exercised all manner of cruelties on the poor citizens of peking  the usurper then left a garrison in peking and marched against the chinese general sent out against the tartar prince carrying that generals father with him and having laid siege to a town where that general had shut himself up he threatened to put his father to death in the most cruel manner he could invent unless he surrendered and soon after put his threats into execution this general whose name was usangucy provoked by his fathers death and the destruction of his prince made pece with the tartars and craved their assistance against the usurper accordingly they marched against him with their united forces but he fled back to peking where having burnt and plundered his people with the spoils he retired into the province of xensi  the citizens of peking having suffered much from the usurper considered the tartars as their deliverers and usangucy leaving them in possession of peking whilst he pursued the rebel lycungz and the rest of the empire being distracted by several potent factions some declaring for a son of the late emperors whilst others under the specious pretense of maintaining their liberties set up for themselves xunchi who was already in possession of the capital got himself declared emperor and invited all the tartars who were before settled in china as well as the little tartar princes his neighbors to remove to peking and by force expelled all the chinese inhabitants from the city the descendants of this man have continued on the throne to the present day  great tartary with china as now united extends from    degrees northlatitude to    degrees so that the whole length from north to south is    degrees or  0 0 english miles if we extend it to  0 degrees north as some do and take in the island of haynam in the south which lies in    degrees of latitude it makes the length of the empire    0 miles in breadth from east to west in most places it is  000 miles and consequently its circumference must be  000 miles and upwards  china then is so extensive that all its provinces of which there are    cannot enjoy the same temperature their climate and the nature of their soil varies the nearer to or more remote they are from the south severe cold is felt at peking whilst the southern provinces are exposed to excessive heat mandesoe says that in the northern parts the complexions of the people are white and their fruits like those of europe whereas in the south the people are black and their fruits such as are the produce of india and hackluyt says the post is three months traveling from the seacoast to the city of peking  the principal mountains of china are in the northern and western parts of the empire and the latter are rendered fruitful by the labor and industry of the inhabitants but the former being bleak and rocky are uncultivated some are covered with forests of tall strait trees of every species fit for building and shiptimber and very enormous trunks are sometimes removed to the distance of  00 leagues by land and watercarriage for public works other mountains are rich with quicksilver iron tin copper gold and silver but the wisdom and prudence of early dynasties prevented the latter mines from being opened lest the people should be induced to neglect the natural riches of their soil by applying to other labors than those of agriculture  superstitious natives relate some singular and extraordinary phenomena of their mountains there are several they say which produce nothing but useful and salutary herbs and where nothing else will grow they assure us that others have the property of rendering those immortal who retire to them that a mountain of chensi which has the figure of a large cock crows sometimes so loud that it may be heard at the distance of three leagues that another in the province of fokien trembles at the approach of a storm and shakes to and fro like a tree agitated by the wind but the chinese admire above all others a mountain of fokien the whole of which is an idol or statue of the god fo this colossus is of so monstrous a size that each of its eyes is several miles in circumference and its nose several leagues in extent it is very extraordinary that the chinese who consider a flat nose as a beauty should have given their favorite idol one of so prodigious a length but it evidently appears that the shape of this mountain is not the work of art there are some mountains however that have been shaped by labor such are those of the five horses heads from their resembling such some have very deep and spacious caverns excavated and others are pierced through for a great length in that of the province of fokien near the city of hengoa is a handsome terrace six feet wide    miles long at the foot of two hills paved all the way with broad stones and planted on each side with shady trees and benches to rest on there are many of these causeways cut in the same manner some between others by the sides of the mountains with horrid precipices above and below and others have steps cut into the rock from the bottom to the top  there are not wanting in this country volcanoes or burning mountains the most remarkable is that called linosing which is very high and vomits fire cinders and ashes and sometimes torrents of sulphur and other minerals  though the gold mines here are not suffered to be opened the chinese carry on a good traffic in gold having plenty of goldsand washed down by torrents from these mountains in rainy seasons and caught by fleeces and other strainers laid across the water or found among the sand and mud of their rivers multitudes of people live wholly by this business of gathering gold which is so pure as to need no refining as gold is not here coined it is sold like other merchandise the emperor is the only person who possesses any quantity of goldplate they have some few lead mines but this mineral is very scarce  besides common copper the chinese have another kind which they call petang or white copper it is known in england under the name of tutaneg and is so pure and fine that it approaches near to silver a number of experiments have been made of it at peking which sufficiently prove that this copper does not owe its whiteness to any mixture different works are made of it but to render it malleable they mix it with a little zinc and to add to its color with a about a fifth part of silver they have also a yellow copper resembling gold  on the seacoast there are found many salt pits the salt of which is conveyed over all the empire and the province of kiannan supplies such a quantity as to bring in    millions of taels each tael   s english or   00000l into the emperors treasury  in several parts of the province of honan there is found a sort of saltearth which being boiled and chrystalized makes a very good white salt and in some places the ground after rain spews up a kind of froth which is made into an excellent soap the province of quangsi is famed for a yellow earth which taken internally is an antidote to poison and by outward application heals the bite of venomous creatures there is here also a kind of earth of a fine vermilion color and another of a beautiful white which the ladies use as cosmetics and rouge the same province furnishes also that valuable clay in great abundance of which the porcelain is made  quarries of marble and coalmines are so abundant in every province of the empire that there is perhaps no country in the world where it is so plentiful but they make not much use of the marble in their public buildings here are also to be found in many places lapis lazuli and the most beautiful rockchrystal in the world of which they make seals buttons and a variety of toys the province of yunnan furnishes real rubies but they are very small the neighboring kingdom of laos however has a mine full of precious stones from which rubies are dug sometimes as large as a walnut emeralds are also found there the king of laos has one in his possession equal in size to an orange but many are wshed down the current by a river that crosses this mountain that weigh a quarter or a third part of an ounce  in various channels made by torrents and in rivers flowing at the bottom of mountains are found certain sonorous stones resembling those pebbles which are found in the streams that rush down through the clefts of mountains this stone is called you large ones are very rare the biggest yet found was only three feet long and about    inches broad  five distinct properties are remarked in this stone hardness weight color grain and sound beautiful you are so hard that when cut and polished like agate the best tempered steel glides upon them without making any impression the more careful nature has been in their formation the more difficult it is to cut them but the harder they are the better polish they receive  the weight of the you is proportionable to its hardness an unpolished block in the emperors palace which to all appearance one man can lift it measuring no more than  0 inches by   cannot be moved but by four men it is of an irregular figure and has a green color but the most esteemed color is that of whey though there are some of a bright blue azure indigo citronyellow orange logwoodred pale green seagreen deep green cindergrey etc and some variegated in veins and shades the hardiest and heaviest have always the finest grain the you emits sparks when struck with steel and resembles agate  but the rarest quality of this stone is its singing or sounding when struck and yielding an excellent tone various stones yield various sounds according to their grain and hardness very hard stones are exceedingly sonorous some soft ones emit a very sweet sound and there are others as light as a pumicestone which give a very agreeable sound of these stones the chinese make musical instruments  the chemists and naturalists of europe have never yet attempted to find out whether some of our stones may not have the same properties the romans were certainly acquainted with a sonorous stone for pliny when speaking of curious stones observes that the stone called calcophonas or brazen sound is black and that according to the etymology of its name sent forth when struck a sound like that of brass his words are calcophonas nigra est sed illisa aeris tinnitum reddit lib xxxvii sect     the chinese tell us that this stone was known in their country so early as  0  years before the xtian era and was then the most valuable present that could be made to the emperor the musical instrument made in china of this stone is called king such an instrument was brought to france and the late duke of chaulnes took great pains to search into the nature of the stone the result of his enquiries is that it is a species of black marble this stone resembling externally what we call touchstone he accordingly had a king made of the black marble of flanders and it was almost as sonorous as that from china but the stone you of which the chinese form their most beautiful king is nothing more than a kind of agate  among a number of lakes one of which is  0 leagues in circumference and another in the province of kiangsi  00 leagues in length subject like the sea to storms and tempests i say among these and an infinity of great and small rivers that water this vast empire there are two particularly celebrated the first is the yangtsekiang or son of the sea it rises in yunnen and after flowing through an extent of  00 leagues and watering four provinces empties itself into the eastern sea forming an island at its mouth from the sand it throws up the chinese have a proverb viz  the sea has no bounds and kiang no bottom  before nanking and at the distance of  0 leagues from its mouth it is half a league wide its navigation is dangerous and a number of vessels are lost in it almost every day it flows with great rapidity from several islands in its course produces a multitude of reeds from  0 to    feet high which serves the provinces through which it passes with fuel but when swelled with torrents carries away the greater part of these islands and forms others from their wrecks  the other great river is the hoangho or yellow river so called from the yellowness of its water occasioned in time of rain by the yellow clay and sand washed into it this rises in the mountains which border the province of tetchuen on the west and after a course of near  00 leagues across tartary and china discharges itself into the eastern sea not far from the mouth of the kiang it is very broad and rapid but so shallow as scarce to be navigable yet often overflows its banks and drowns whole villages precautions are taken to prevent this by dikes but these do not entirely free the neighborhood from fear of inundation the inhabitants of the province of honan to avert this evil have surrounded most of their cities at the distance of three furlongs with strong ramparts of earth faced with turf  the ingenuity which the chinese display in turning the happy situation of their lakes and rivers to the best advantage is the admiration of all europe one of their chief works for the convenience of trade is the celebrated royal canal  00 leagues in length reaching from canton to peking and forming a communication between all the southern and northern provinces its navigation being no where interrupted but by the mountain meiling where passengers are obliged to travel ten or twelve leagues over land but if they will go some way round through the provinces of quangsi and houquang they need not quit their barks at all it may readily be conceived what immense labor it must have cost to form a communication between so many rivers and how many obstacles must have occurred in a canal of so vast an extent in the course of which they have overcome the resistance of nature with dikes moles etc in this principal canal a number of others end which stretch out into the country and form a communication between the cities towns and villages as they pass the patience and perseverance of the chinese in these useful undertakings have surmounted obstacles that would have discouraged any other people such for example is part of a canal from chao king to ningpo near these cities there are two canals the waters of which do not communicate one being    feet above the level of the other to render this place passable for boats for they have not yet the art of making floodgates as in europe they have constructed a double glacis of large stones or rather two inclined planes which unite in an acute angle at their upper extremity like the ridge of a barn and extend on each side to the surface of the water if the bark is in the lower canal they draw it up the plane of the first glacis by the assistance of several capstans till it reaches the angle when by its own weight it slides down the second glacis into the water of the higher canal with the velocity of an arrow and it is wonderful that these barks which are generally very long and heavy laden never burst asunder when balanced in the air on the edge of this acute angle they are indeed constructed for the purpose and no such accident ever happens  though their skill in navigation is but poor yet as there is scarce a city or a village throughout the empire especially in the southern provinces but what enjoys the convenience of a navigable river dike canal or arm of the sea wherever there is a town upon the shore there is another of boats upon the water and some ports are so blocked up with vessels that it will take several hours to get cross them to land these vessels are made as commodious as houses and there are many born here and die in them and on board they keep hogs poultry dogs and other domestic animals as if they were on shore  besides these vessels there are a prodigious number of floats of timber perpetually going up and down the rivers and canals which carry whole villages of people on them this timber is cut chiefly in the province of suchuen adjoining to india on the west these floats are some of them a mile in length rising two or three feet above the water on which the people build little wooden huts or cabins at equal distances where they live till they have disposed of the timber on which they are built great quantities of it are thus conveyed as far as peking being above  00 leagues from the place where it is cut  the emperor has      large vessels in his service in the southern provinces magaillans says they affect this number because   with them sounds very pompous these vessels kieou are as large as ships from  00 to  000 tons burden and yet they work them with great dexterity with a few hands they are flatbottomed the head and stern square but the forepart not quite so broad as the stern and the stern open in the middle to the end that the rudder which they shut up as in a chamber may be defended from the waves they have a mainmast and a foremast the foremast has a yard and a square sail but the sail of the mainmast is narrow at top like a sloops sail their masts are not pieced as ours are and set one on the head of the other but are one single tree prodigously high and thick and strongly siezed by two sidebeams that strengthen it wonderfully their sails are made of a thick matt strengthened with laths or split cane at about two feet distance upon the deck they build little rooms or cabins from one end to the other raised about seven or eight feet high painted and gilded within and without and so very neat and commodious as to make the longest voyage tolerable the mandarins or great officers of state often travel together in this manner and no where spend their hours more agreeably for here they visit each other without ceremony and play and pass away their time as if they were of one family which freedoms are never taken by magistrates on shore all ships carry frightful images of their gods and have altars and lamps burning before them  the canals are often lined on each side to the depth of  0 or    feet with fine square freestone and in some places with gray marble some have banks  0 or    feet high on each side so as to require a great number of engines to raise the water into the fields over them some are cut more than ten leagues in a straight line the canal northwest of the city of hangtcheou is lined on each side with freestone with a stone causeway on the top and houses are built on each bank as close together as those in a street and are as full of people and both sides of the canal are covered with barks a number of stonebridges are thrown over these canals of from three to seven arches the middle one always high enough to let a bark pass without taking down the mast  nieuhoff says the ships of the emperor and governors of provinces lie in the water like castles and are divided into apartments for all the uses of state and convenience and are very well furnished the windows and doors are made like grates with thin transparent oystershells instead of glass or else fine linen or silk spread with clear wax ornamented with flowers galleries are made without and the inside is painted with all manner of curious colors the timberwork is so well jointed with oakum that there is scarce any appearance of ironwork  i shall have occasion to speak of these barks again when i mention their modes of traveling  the ships which carry fish called saull and the emperors silks to court are     in number finely gilt within and without and painted red and all other vessels strike sail to these in the province of nanking there is a multitude of pleasureboats richly gilt and painted and more like houses than ships in which many of the chinese spend their estates and there is such a vast number of vessels in fokien that nieuhoff says the inhabitants offered the emperor when he was going to war with the japanese to make him a bridge of boats which should reach from china to japan two days sail indeed there is such a continual and uninterrupted plying of boats from one place to another over all the southern provinces and navigable rivers and these so numerous that the country resembles so many venices where all the ways and streets are canals  but notwithstanding the sailing on their rivers and canals is exceedingly pleasant in general it is sometimes very dangerous from the several rapid torrents they have to pass le comte tells us he was once on such a stream when the vessel was whirled round with an incredible swiftness for a considerable time and at last dashed upon a rock that in the province of fokien for eight or ten days sail vessels are in continual danger of perishing for there are so many cataracts and rocky straights that it is hardly possible for the boats to pass through without being dashed to pieces on one side or other every day almost some vessel or other is shipwrecked in these torrents but they have often the good fortune to split near the shores and the passengers are saved though sometimes the vessel is dashed to pieces and the crew buried in a moment they are usually under sail or tugged with ropes but on great rivers and in crossing lakes oars are made use of the chinese continues le comte who was often in their perilous voyages have a knack of sailing in rapid torrents which is wonderful and incredible they in a manner force nature and make a voyage without any dread which other nations would even look at with horror in some of their rivers the cataracts are continually broken by a thousand points of rocks that scarce leave breadth enough for the passage of a bark nothing but turnings and windings waterfalls and contrary currents that dash one against another and hurry a boat like an arrow from a bow you are always within two feet of shelves and if you avoid one you fall upon another and from that to a third yet the pilot with a skill not sufficiently to be admired escapes shipwreck every moment there is no people in the world capable of undertaking such voyages but the chinese who are not discouraged at the daily wrecks that happen and who if they carried double the number of men fifteen instead of eight would avoid many of these calamities but they would rather hazard their effects and their lives than be at a trifling charge more than they thought absolutely necessary  their barks however are constructed accordingly they are divided into five or six apartments so that if they touch upon a rock and make a breach in one the others are watertight and keep them afloat till they can stop the hole and to moderate the rapidity of the motion in places where the water is not too deep they check the velocity of the vessel by thrusting a pole to the bottom and bearing against it so that when the torrent is even and uniform let it be as rapid as it will the boat flows as slowly as on the calmest channel but when it winds in and out they have recourse to a double rudder made in the fashion of an oar  0 or  0 feet long which the mariners manage with such skill and dexterity to drive their vessel on or turn it right as they would have it to fall just into the stream to shun one rock without dashing on another to cut a current or pursue the fall of the water without dipping headlong into it  the chinese have had stout ships from all antiquity which in some measure accounts for their address in navigation they boast the invention of the mariners compass though they have made very little improvement in it as they have never been exposed to the necessity of fighting naval battles except on the river kiang round and near their own coasts or in the neighborhood of the isles of japan they are bad sailors in an open sea of vessels destined for seaengagements they have several kinds those belonging to the port of canton are much larger than those employed on the coasts of fokien the latter are built only of fir whereas the vessels at canton are constructed of ironwood in naval battles they are found to be much stronger and more useful though they are heavy and slow sailors but these vessels last a long time and worms never pierce them they have fast sailing vessels for pursuing pirates and carrying dispatches that draw from six to seven feet water and no weather prevents them from putting to sea they have others to open the waves that draw only three or four feet water these have a sharp prow a helm a sail and four oars and will carry from  0 to  0 soldiers these they say fear neither wind nor billows the anchors are made of ironwood  they have also other vessels to run among sandbanks constructed with a flat bottom for gliding along the coasts of the northern sea where there is little depth of water but their best vessels the swiftest and lightest for sailing are the hawksbill vessels the prow and poop of which are built in the same manner so as that they can advance or retreat without putting about and the decks are defended on each side by a kind of parapet made of bamboo which shelters the rowers and the soldiers from the weapons of the enemy  some of these vessels are armed with cannon each ship has a captain as ours have but his business is only to keep the crew in awe and victual them in seaengagements the soldiers will place a pair of corks under their arms throw themselves into the sea and with their scymitars attack their enemy as actively as if on land  the plate represents an attack by pirates in one of their large canals  but with all this adroitness and courage it may easily be perceived that a whole fleet of such armed barks would not be able to stand an attack from only a few of our european ships of war and if at the close of this naval account of the chinese we may hazard a reflection  fifty years hence may put them on another system of naval war when they will probably have such powerful neighbors as the english colonies in new zealand may hereafter prove to them  chinese naval engagement chap ii of the productions all travelers agree in their accounts of the fertility of china and of the extent and beauty of its plains neither enclosures hedges or ditches are seen in them scarce even a single tree so careful is the husbandman not to lose an inch of his land the northern plains produce wheat the southern being low and watery rice in many places the ground yields two crops a year and in the interval between the harvests the people will sow several sorts of pulse and other small grain and yet famines are frequent in this country and why because in times of scarcity the chinese from their situation can receive no assistance from their neighbors and are often under the necessity of supplying them  their neighbors on the north are the mongol or mogul tartars tributaries indeed to china but a people so extremely lazy sowing millet only for their own use and living principally on flesh  on the northeast the province of leaotong is very fertile but too far from peking to send its provisions there besides all carriage is impracticable but in winter when provision is transported frozen  korea does not supply china with corn and as to japan on the east though only three or four days sail from the continent no chinese vessel ever yet attempted to go there for provisions the japanese either having nothing to spare or foreign merchants meeting there with too many insults  the other islands so far from being able to supply china are often in want of a supply themselves what prevents famines in europe is the facility with which one country can be supplied from another but china is destitute of this advantage situated alone in the extremity of asia surrounded by barbarous nations it must procure from its own soil sufficient nourishment for its numerous inhabitants or a famine will ensue to avert this calamity is the constant grand object of its publlc ministers granaries and magazines are erected in every province and in most of the principal cities for the relief of the people in times of scarcity  china in its vast extent contains almost every species of tree known in europe and in the mountains in the province of tchekiang grow pines so large that  0 men may be enclosed in their trunks but i shall only describe such trees as are peculiar to this country  one is the tallowtree the size of our cherrytree its branches are crooked its leaves shaped like a heart and of a bright red color it has a smooth bark a short trunk and its top is round and bushy the fruit is contained in a rind which when ripe and opened divides into three parts like a chestnut and about the size of a walnut it is the pulp with which these kernels are covered that has the properties of tallow and of which candles are made not having the art of purifying it as we do our tallow it has a disagreeable smell produces a thick smoke and a faint light but they mix it with linseedoil which softens and sweetens it  the next is their waxtree which produces a white wax almost equal in quality to beeswax this wax is deposited by a small worm that buries itself in the bark and forms there a kind of comb much smaller than a honeycomb there are two trees in this country and two only that afford food to this insect and of course two only from which they can gather wax one thrives best in dry sandy soils the other in moist watery places the first being of a shrubby kind thrives in the worst of soils and will grow in any climate walls may be covered with it  0 or    feet high and hedges made of it in the open fields the insect that frequents this tree does not naturally attach itself to it but must be placed there this operation is not difficult and the tree once stocked always retains them at the approach of winter small tumors are observed in the bark which increase till they are as large as walnuts these are so many nests filled with the eggs of the insect which are called pelatching when the tree shoots forth its blossoms in spring it gives life to the insects that cover it this is the season to deposit nests on those trees that have none which is thus done small bundles of straw are made on each of which seven or eight nests are placed these bundles are tied to the branches so as to place the nests immediately on the bark when the insects are hatched they run upon the branches disperse themselves over the leaves and perforate the bark under which they retire but always come forth at the proper season for making their wax  about the middle of june this wax makes its appearance first like the fine filaments of soft wool rising from the bark and enclosing the body of the insect by degrees these filaments become a kind of down and so thicker and thicker during the summerheats till it forms a crust defending the animal from heat rain and ants this crust is the wax which is gathered before the hoarfrosts come in september the chinese say if the wax was left too long on the tree the insects would not make their nests the wax is white and bright and preserves its transparency to the depth of an inch if an ounce of it is added to a pound of oil it forms a wax little inferior to beeswax it is used also to heal wounds prevent swoonings and allay palpitations of the heart  the next curious tree they have is their tsichu or varnishtree whose bark and leaves resemble those of the ash but bears neither fruit nor flowers it seldom grows higher than about    feet or larger in the trunk than about two feet or two feet and an half in girth the varnish procured from this tree is a kind of gum distilled only in summernights from incisions made in the bark drop by drop into small shells placed to receive it in a thousand trees in one night will yield about  0 pounds of varnish  this varnish is not extracted by the owner of the trees but by merchants who purchase a grove of them for the season at the rate of threepence a foot one workman is sufficient for  0 feet of timber and his pay is an ounce of silver per month whilst this varnish flows it exhales a malignant vapor the bad effects of which is prevented by the workmen anointing their faces and hands with rapeoil in which a quantity of those fleshy filaments are boiled that are found in hogs lard and which do not melt after eating they wash their whole bodies with a decoction of chesnuttree bark mixed with certain drugs and when at work near the trees put their heads in a sailcloth bag in which there are two holes for their eyes and cover their bodies with a doeskin apron tied round their necks and waists with boots of the same on their legs and coverings on their arms without this precaution a collector of varnish would be punished for his rashness he would be soon afflicted as with a universal leprosy and would fall a sacrifice to the distemper if not relieved by those remedies that are sometimes applied with success in such cases  when the varnish is collected it is put into small casks closely stopped a pound of it newly made costs him about  0 d sterling and he sells it at a profit of cent per cent  besides the luster and beauty this varnish gives to many of the chinese manufactures it has the property of preserving the wood from dampness and worms it often happens that the gloss of varnished tables and other furniture is insensibly destroyed by tea and other warm liquors but the secret of restoring to this varnish its shining black color says a chinese author is to expose it for one night to a white hoarfrost or to cover it some time with snow  a method any of our readers possessed of such varnished wood may readily try  a fourth tree peculiar to this country is the tielymou or ironwood which grows to the height of our large oaks of this wood the chinese make their anchors as i have observed before it being exceedingly hard and so heavy as to sink in water  a fifth is the nanmou or chinese cedar this tree is one of the tallest they have its branches shoot up vertically grow from the bark only to a certain height and terminate in a bush or tufted top though called a cedar its leaves are not like the cedar of lebanon its wood here is considered as not liable to decay all the palacepillars beams and doors are made of this timber  the tsetan or rosewood is the next uncommon tree and the most beautiful and valuable wood the chinese have it is of a black color inclining to red shaped and variegated with delicate veins which resemble painting we have seen this wood in england  the tchang or camphire tree is also a production of china some of them are above  00 cubits high and so large in the trunk that  0 persons cannot enclose them when old the bodies of these trees will emit sparks of e but their flame is so subtle as not to injure even the hair of those who are near it common camphire at peking is only one penny english per ounce but it is inferior to that of borneo the camphire is obtained from this tree by chopping the branches very small steeping them for three days in spring water and afterward boiling them stirring them with a willowstick when they perceive the sap of this chopped wood adhere to the stick in the form of white frost they strain it and throw away the dregs next morning this decoction will coagulate and form a solid mass which is afterward purified by another process  they have another tree called the siang which grows as tall as our chesnuttrees and bears a fruit which dyers use as a substitute for the gallnut it grows in barren and mountainous countries  they have also a kind of pine tree called keououai which grows in tartary its wood is very hard soon petrifies and is converted into hones to sharpen tools but its sap is poisonous and if any drops spurt on the skin of the woodman it raises incurable blisters  the tchake is another uncommon tree that grows in the northern coasts of china it has no bark and will when green burn as readily as the driest wood it makes very good charcoal that burns free without either smell or smoke  the tchukou or papertree is of great value to the chinese the inner rind furnishing them with the greatest part of their paper when its branches are broken the bark peels off in form of long ribbands it is a kind of sycamore and something like the wild mulberry but bears fruit like the fig being full of milk and adhering to the branches without a stalk it grows on the mountains in a rocky soil the paper is made of the bark  in the province of quangsi they have a tree which instead of pith contains a soft pulp yielding a kind of flour and the bread made of it is said to be exceedingly good  the tse songyuenpe or junipercypress is one of the singularities of nature partaking of the properties both of the juniper and cypress in leaves and branches some resembling the juniper others the cypress when the tree is young its leaves are like those of the former when old like those of the latter  the bamboo we are acquainted with it is a kind of reed which grows to the height and size of large trees although the trunk is hollow and divided at certain spaces by knots it is very strong and capable of sustaining enormous weight these reeds are used as pipes to convey water split and divided into thin slips they weave them into mats and paper is made from a paste procured from them by bruising them and steeping them in water and canoes or wherries are also built with them in some parts of china there are whole forests of them  the cottonshrub is one of the most useful in all china on the same day that husbandmen get in their harvest they sow cotton in the same field merely raking the earth over the seeds as soon as the land is moistened with rain or dew a shrub grows up about two feet high the flowers of which appear about the middle of august generally yellow but sometimes red to this flower succeeds a button in the shape of a pod about the size of a nut forty days after the appearance of the flower the pod opens and yields three or four wrappings of cotton extremely white and of the same figure as the cod of a silkworm they are fixed to the bottom of the open pod and contain seeds for the following year  with the milky juice distilled from incisions in the stem of the konchu shrub they lay on their gold leaf in gilding it is stronger than our size and with the pith of another shrub called tongtsao a kind of cane resembling our aldertree they make their artificial flowers fruits and butterflies  betel and tobacco is raised here in great abundance the betel leaf they chew continually as strengthening the gums expelling bile comforting the brain and a preservative against asthmas this shrubs grows like ivy and twines round other trees they have also sugarcanes in great quantities and some spicetrees ginger grows wild which makes a very pleasant sweetmeat when preserved green  but of all their trees and shrubs that which merits most our attention is the teaplant called by them tcha or tha of this there are two sorts the songlo or what we call singlo or green tea and the vouytcha or bohea  the teaplant is cultivated in the fields almost like vines and is cropped at a certain height to prevent it from growing too tall but we must not confound with real tea every thing which the chinese call tcha what is sold in the province of canton as a delicate tea is merely a kind of moss which grows on the rocks near the city of manginghien if this commodity is adulterated even in china can we flatter ourselves with having pure and genuine tea in europe perhaps we taste nothing else like many of the chinese than moss from the rocks of manginghien  when the tealeaves have been collected they are exposed to the steam of boiling water after which they are put upon plates of copper and held over the fire till they become dry and shivelled such as we receive them in europe common tea is preserved in narrowmouthed earthen vessels but that used by the wealthy is enclosed in porcelain vases or in leaden and tin canisters covered with fine bamboomats the chinese and people of japan generally keep their tea a year before they use it having as they say when new a narcotic quality when they drink it they infuse it in hot water as we do but drink it without any mixture and even without sugar  the teashrub seems to be a species of the myrtle seldom grows beyond the size of a rosebush loves a gravelly soil and is usually planted in rows upon little hills three or four feet distance from each other its leaves are about an inch and a half long narrow tapering to a point and indented like our rose or sweetbriar leaves and its flowers are much like those of the latter the shrub is an evergreen and bears a small fruit which contains round blackish seeds about the size of a large pea but scarce one in a hundred comes to perfection by these seeds the plant is propagated nine or ten being put into a hole together and the plants thence arising are transplanted into proper ground  the chinese know nothing of imperial tea and several other names which in europe serve to distinguish the goodness and price of this fashionable commodity in truth though there are several kinds of tea they are the product of the same plant only differing in color fragrancy etc according to the difference of the soil choice of leaves time of gathering and mode of preparation the vouy bohi or bohea is so called from its black color this differs from the songlo singlo or green tea by its being gathered six or seven weeks sooner when the plant is in full bloom and the leaves full of juice whereas the other by being left so much the longer on the tree loses a great part of its juice and contracts a different color taste and virtue being more rough to the palate and more raking to the stomach the green tea is most used in china the bottom leaves of the tree are generally coarser than the upper leaves and will not fetch so good a price but the best of tea in china will not sell for more than   d apound english the worst   d bohea tea if good should be all of a dark color crisp dry and with a fine smell green tea should have a bluish cast none of the leaves brownish and should be also crisp and fragrant  the chinese have many floweringtrees unknown to us one of which i will mention for its curiosity  this is the outomchu very much resembling our sycamore the leaves are between eight or nine inches diameter growing to a stalk a foot long it is extremely tufted and laden with clusters of flowers so very thick that the sun cannot pierce it with its rays though the tree is large the fruit is very small and is produced in the following manner about the month of august there springs out from the tops of the branches little bunches of leaves different from the other being whiter and softer though equally as broad these are a substitute for flowers and on the borders or edges of each of these leaves grow three or four small grains or kernels the size of peace enclosing a white substance of a very pleasant taste like that of a haslenut not ripe  besides all the fruits common to europe they have some peculiar ones of their own they have no good kinds of cherries and excepting grapes and pomegranates the fruits they have in common with us are much inferior they have several kinds of olives different from ours and their manner of gathering them is curious and convenient  they bore a hole in the trunk of the tree put some salt into it and stop it up and at the end of a few days all the fruit drops of itself  oranges lemons and citrons are very common they have many species besides those transplanted into portugal they have one sort no larger than a billiardball which is most valued and sent as presents to india and a fine species of melons apricots grow wild and as to vines they are considered as bushes encumbering the ground and are generally rooted up to give place to other things no wine being here made great quantities are raised in the province of petchli but the fruit is dried to make raisins of  the simples and medicinal plants of china form one of the richest and most extensive branches of its natural history but as it is not my intention to give a chinese herbal i will only mention the rhubarb and the ginseng  the taihoang or rhubarb grows in several provinces of the empire its stem is hollow resembles a small bamboo or chinese cane and is very brittle it rises to the height of three or four feet and is of a dusky violet color in the month of march it shoots forth long thick leaves very rough to the touch and these leaves ranged four by four on the same stalk form a calix the flowers are yellow and sometimes violet and in june it produces a small black seed the size of a grain of millet which is gathered in september those rhubarb roots are reckoned best that are heaviest and most variegated with veins some druggists will disguise their old decayed rhubarb by giving it a yellow tincture but by handling it the cheat is discovered as the powder they use for this purpose will stick to the fingers rhapontic is often mixed with rhubarb by those who send it to europe but this imposition may likewise be discovered the true rhubarb being usually in roundish pieces and its internal grain or streaks running transversely whereas rhapontic is in longish pieces with its streaks running lengthways besides rhapontic being chewed leaves a clamminess in the mouth which rhubarb does not it is sold cheap in china a pound of the best costs only twopence  but the most esteemed and valuable of all the plants in china is the ginseng which the manchew tartars call the queen of plants the chinese physicians speak of it with a kind of enthusiasm and enumerate its wonderful properties without end the root of the ginseng is white and tough its stem smooth round and of a deep red color its height in proportion to its vigor from the extremity of the stalk proceed a number of branches like radii from a center each branch has five leaves finely jagged or indented of a dark green color above and a shining whitish green underneath and on the upper side they are beset with small whitish hairs from the center of these branches rises a second stem without leaves and bearing a bunch of round berries of a beautiful red color but not fit to eat jartoux who saw such a bunch counted    berries containing a white pulp and two rough stones like lentil stones the pedicles on which the berries grow rise from the same center and spreading like the radii of a center make the cluster of a circular form this plant dies every year and its age may be known by the number of stems it has shot forth of which there are always some marks left on the root  the chinese never sow the seed because it never has been known to grow this probably gave rise to the tartar fable that a bird eats the seed when put into the earth or when it drops but not being able to digest it voids it with its dung after it has been purified in its stomach and that it springs up in the place where it is dropped it is far more probable that the germ of this plant is slow in opening and that the husk which contains it remains long in the earth before it sends forth any root  this plant has at all times been the principal riches of eastern tartary where it grows being never found but between the   th and   th degrees of northern latitude and between the  0th and  0th of eastern longitude from the meridian of peking all that extent of country is occupied by a long chain of mountains covered with almost impenetrable forests it is on the declivity of these frightful mountains and in the forests in the neighborhood of fissures made by floods below rocks at the roots of trees and in the middle of herbs of every species that this valuable plant is found it never grows elsewhere it delights in the shade and seems every where desirous of sheltering itself from the sun of course it is naturally an enemy to heat  no private person is allowed to gather it it belongs to the emperor and he sends annually  0000 soldiers into tartary to collect it and this army of herbalists spread themselves over the ground methodically and do their business with great arrangement they suffer many hardships upon this expedition carrying with them neither tents nor beds but a quantity of baked millet as provision these men sleep in the open air and are thus employed six months in every year  the chinese physicians says jartoux have written whole volumes on the virtues of this root and introduce it into almost all the remedies they prescribe to the great notwithstanding the great quantities of it procured from tartary it is always very dear in china one ounce of this root even at peking costs seven or eight ounces of silver  lafitau a jesuit missionary discovered this root in canada in the mountains not far from montreal the indians called it garentoguen which signifies legs and thighs of things separated and the chinese name ginseng implies mans thigh the root resembling but badly the shape of a man downwards lafitaus garentoguen answers jartouxs description of the ginseng exactly and leaves it beyond a doubt but that they are one and the same plant which lafitau conceives to be a species of mandragora or mandrake and to be the mandragora of theophrastus which was known to the ancients and lost since their time such naturalists as wish to know more of this root and the conjectures above concerning it may peruse the abbe grosiers general description of china  none of it is found at quebec but it is known to every one at montreal being sold there by the iroquois indians at a great price it is to be met with in abundance toward the south round montreal in the neighborhood of lake huron and in the country of the iroquoise which is similar to tartary lafitau makes the following reflection on the similarity of the chinese and canadian names  that the same signification could not have been affixed to the chinese word and to that of the iroquoise without a communication of ideas and consequently of persons of course it confirmed him in the opinion that he had before entertained and since corroborated by the last voyage of captain cook that america and asia formed only one continent and that they were originally united either by tartary or to the north of china  before i close my observations on the drugs of china i must not omit one the composition of which will doubtless appear as singular as the numerous properties ascribed to it it is called ngokia from the city ngohien in the province of canton where there is a natural well  0 feet deep and which as the chinese say has a communication with some subterranean lake or other large reservoir the water drawn from it is very clear and much heavier than common and if mixed with muddy water purifies it and renders it limpid by precipitating all its impurities to the bottom of the vessel this water is employed in making the ngokia a kind of glue procured from the skin of a black ass the animal is killed and flayed and the skin steeped for five days in water drawn from this well after which it is scraped and cleaned cut into small pieces and boiled over a slow fire in the same kind of water till reduced to a jelly which is then strained whilst warm through a cloth when this glue is cool it is formed into square cakes on which the chinese imprint characters their coats of arms or the signs of their shops  this well is the only one of the kind in china it is always shut and sealed by the governor of the place with his own seal till the customary day of making the emperors glue the operation continues from the autumnal harvest till march during which time merchants treat for the purchase of the glue with those who guard the well and with the people who make it  as this drug is much sought after and the quantity made at ngohien not sufficient to supply the whole empire there are not wanting persons who counterfeit it and make a spurious kind from the skins of horses mules camels and sometimes even from old boots a number of virtues are ascribed to this drug they assure us that it dissolves phlegm facilitates the play and elasticity of the lungs removes difficulty of breathing comforts the breast increases the blood stops dysenteries promotes urine and strengthens children in the womb  chap iii of their agriculture and animals having spoken of the national productions of this country i cannot more opportunely speak of chinese agriculture their gardening i will defer till i treat of their houses  several of the chinese emperors have thought it worthy their royal care to promote and teach their subjects husbandry particularly the emperor ven who held the plough himself and his empress planted mulberrytrees and bred silkworms in the palace to set their subjects a good example all the clothes that the empress wore were of her own making and a feast was instituted and is continued to this day when the governors of the several towns and provinces assemble the peasants about the vernal equinox and march before them in procession with garlands music and streamers and the instruments of husbandry carried before them  on the   th day of the first moon in every year which corresponds to the beginning of march the tribunal of ceremonies announces the return of spring to the emperor by a memorial pointing out every thing he is to do on this festival he first names    of the most illustrious persons in his court to accompany him and to hold the plough after he has performed his part of the ceremony among these are always three princes of the blood and nine presidents of supreme courts if they are too old or infirm for this task proxies are appointed by the emperor to act for them  this feast is preceded by the sacrifice of a bullock which the sovereign offers to the changti or supreme being throwing himself prostrate on the earth or knocking his head nine times against the ground he and his suite prepare themselves for this duty by three days fasting and continence others are appointed on the evening before the ceremony to go and prostrate themselves at the sepulcher of his ancestors and to acquaint them what he is going to do the day following  the sacrifice being performed and plenty being prayed for in favor of his people by the emperor under the title of sovereign pontiff in an open place without the city he lays aside his royal robes takes the plough in his hand to which two oxen are yoked magnificently clothed and turns up several furrows forty laborers are selected to yoke these oxen and prepare the seeds which the emperor afterward sows namely wheat rice millet and beans these are brought to the spot in sumptuous boxes by persons of the most distinguished rank having plowed two or three furrows the whole length of the field the emperor quits the plough and the princes do the same after him and after them the nine presidents the same this done the emperor sows a little of each of the seeds abovementioned and is followed also by his suite four pieces of cottoncloth proper for making dresses are then distributed to each of the  0 laborers as presents and an equal quantity to  0 other persons more advanced in years spectators of the ceremony and the whole concludes with the most active ploughmen present finishing what the emperor began  agriculture is the principal and almost the only resource of the chinese and they consider it as the first and most honorable of all professions it being that from which society derives the greatest benefit the husbandman in china enjoys many great privileges and ranks before the mechanic or the merchant and the magistrates and grandees are for the most part the sons of simple husbandmen whose merit has raised them to the first dignities of the empire  the people are permitted to employ part of every crop in brewing beer and distilling spirits but if the harvest is a bad one they are prohibited from this by an order from administration  they have an idea that as the strength or power of a state rises from its wealth and the wealth of a state arises in proportion to its population the best method of augmenting the number of people is to extend the cultivation to the utmost philosophers have reasoned in the same manner from the superintendence of providence and the universal observation of providence keeping up an equilibrium turn five or six couple of rats into a barn with a scarcity of corn and they will not breed in the same proportion as they would do if that barn was better stocked with grain providence never sending mouths where there is no meat so one man and one woman might have  0 children but in land where provisions are not raised in an adequate proportion to such an increase in the species men do not multiply as they otherwise would in switzerland and in china where they cultivate the hills to their tops the lands swarm with inhabitants in the former the country is so full that they are enabled to lend out their soldiers to other countries and in china where there is greater extent of territory but not more than four times as large as great britain there are more than  0 times as many inhabitants the people of england whether from this way of reasoning or not are now enclosing their wastes cutting canals and thus extending not only commerce but cultivation and there is little doubt but if they go on in the same manner that in another century the number of inhabitants will be doubled and the people then living from an increase of national wealth will find themselves free from any internal debt  this is a prophecy of mine which i leave to the world and which i trust on the data here laid down will be fulfilled  but to return to the agriculture of the chinese  the country as i have observed like others has its plains and its mountains but all the plains are cultivated neither hedge nor ditch is to be seen and but few trees so covetous are they of their ground provinces in the north and northwest produce bread corn barley millet tobacco peace that are always green black and yellow peace which they give to horses instead of oats and some rice those of the south produce more rice because the land is low and watery in provinces where the plains are mingled with mountains some of them must needs be barren but the greatest part have good soil and they cultivate them to the very edge of the precipices  it is a delightful prospect to see in some places plains to the extent of three or four leagues surrounded with hills and mountains cut into terraces from the bottom to the top each terrace rising one above another sometimes to the number of  0 or  0 every one being three or four feet high these mountains are not in general rocky as in europe the soil being light and porous and easily cut and so deep in several provinces that one may dig three or four feet before the rock appears where the mountains are rocky the chinese loosen the stones and make little walls of them to support the terraces then level the good soil and sow it with grain  husbandmen divide into plots that which is of the same level and that which has greater inequalities is separated into stories in the form of an amphitheatre and as the rice will not flourish without water they sink reservoirs at proper distances to catch the rainwater descending from the mountains never complaining of the pains and labor they take either in conducting the water according to its natural bent from the reservoirs above to those below or from the lower ones to the higher by hydraulic machines that raise the water so that the husbandmen is almost certain to reap a harvest proportionable to his industry and his labor and the traveller receives a deal of pleasure in passing through these delightful fields and valleys wherein the scenes are agreeably diversified by the different disposition of the mountains that surround them and finds himself every hour pleasantly surprised by a new landscape that perpetually appears in view in a constant succession of verdant amphitheatres which open to his eye one after another in his journey  the chinese have no meadows national or artificial and have not the least conception of fallowing never permitting their lands to lie the smallest time idle they would consider meadows as lands in a state of nature all their land such as an english farmer would lay down in meadow they sow with grain affirming that a crop of wheat or barley will yield as much straw for the nourishment of cattle as it would have produced hay besides the additional grain for the maintenance of man but of which in plentiful seasons they spare some for the animal creation such is the system from one end of the empire to the other confirmed by the experience of  000 years amongst a people the most attentive to their interest of any nation in the universe  without meadows they breed and maintain a great number of horses buffaloes and other animals necessary for labor for sustenance and manure these are fed some with straw others with roots beans and grain of every kind it is true they have fewer horses and horned cattle in proportion than we have yet they do not find it necessary to have more  in their rice countries the soil is so light that they plough with a single buffalo or heifer after ploughing they clean the land from weeds and if it is to be sown with rice let in the water and moisten the earth till it is quite a pulp or hotchpotch the rice is first sowed in little beds or plots and when six or eight inches high transplanted into the fields when the ground is tilled in rows as we do our beans these plantations they continually supply with water till the rice ripens then the water being dried up it is cut and threshed often in the field where it grows rice has an ear the most like bearded barley of any european grain and grows usually four feet sometimes six feet high  in order to make rice grow the better in places where they sow it they bury balls of hogs hair or any other hair even human hair and those whose business it is to shave the men are very careful in saving the hair they shave off for they sell it to the farmers of these low countries at a halfpenny english per pound it is conveyed in bags and barks are often loaded with this and nothing else  for wheat and barley they grub up the grass and roots and having burnt all together with straw and sifted the earth fine they sow it with seed in drills as some of our farmers do riceland requires no dressing water is sufficient and for other grain they use ashes and all sorts of dung even human dung  the mountains and vast forests of china abound with wild animals of every species such as the rhinoceros elephants serpents tigers bears wolves foxes buffaloes camels horses wild mules etc but no lions some beavers sables and ermines are met with in the northern provinces but much inferior to those caught in siberia  a kind of tiger is seen in china which has a body like a dog but no tail he is remarkably swift and ferocious if any one meets this animal and to escape from his fury climbs up a tree he immediately sends forth a loud yell and several others join him who all together dig up the earth round the roots of such tree and overturn it but the chinese have lately found out a method of destroying them a certain number of people assemble toward evening and raise a circle of strong pales in which they shut themselves up then imitating the yell of the animal they draw all those in the neighborhood round them and whilst these ferocious beasts are digging up the earth to overturn the pallisade the men within dispatch them with their bows and arrows  camels are found in the northeast part of china both wild and domestic they have a species of camel no larger than a horse with two bunches on his back having a head like a sheep a long neck and hanging ears he chews the cud endures cold without pain sheds his hair and becomes quite naked in summer he can bear a burden of  000 chinese pounds in weight and can travel  0 english miles a day by natural instinct he foresees an approaching storm and discovers springs in the earth by digging where a camel beats with his foot one is certain of finding water below and when camels flock together with loud cries and bury their noses in the sand it is a sure sign the wind is about to blow of course they seem ordained for traveling the sandy deserts there are others that from their swiftness can travel  00 miles a day  china abounds in several species of apes some equal in height to a commonsized man they walk on their hind legs and all their actions have a similar conformity to ours  but the most beautiful quadruped they have is a stag about the size of a common dog which are bought at a very great price and kept as curiosities they have also stags of an enormous size called horsestags but their muskdeer is of all animals that which they most pride themselves in being met with no where else it is here very common has no horns and its hair almost black the bag which contains its musk is formed of a very thin membrane covered with soft hair the flesh is served up at the most delicate tables this animal lives on the flesh of serpents which though of an enormous size they find no difficulty in killing for a serpent at a certain distance is immediately overcome by the effluvia of its musk and rendered senseless and immovable the peasants convinced of this when they go into the mountains for coals or wood take a little of this musk with them as the best preservative against serpents for should they lie down to sleep no serpent can approach them  in the forests of chinese tartary there are flying foxes and flying rats similar to the flying squirrels i have described in tartary but a much more extraordinary rat called the fenchou is found upon the coasts of the northern sea which is almost always frozen this animal is formed like a rat but as large as an elephant it dwells in obscure caverns and carefully shuns the light the ivory it produces is as white as that of the elephant another kind of a less size but as large as a buffalo burrows in the earth like a mole flies from the light and remains almost always shut up in subterranean retreats  the account i have given of these rats is extracted from a printed collection of observations written by the celebrated emperor kanghi  chinese horses have neither the strength the beauty nor the swiftness of ours and the inhabitants have not the art of breaking them in properly they castrate them to make them gentle but they are so timid that they will fly at the neighing of a tartar horse besides as they are not shod their hoofs are soon gone and they are useless  game is so common that the squares or markets of peking in wintertime are supplied with different heaps of wild fowl and animals of the chase frozen stiff and thus perfectly secure against all putrefaction prodigious quantities of deer elks stags wild boars goats foxes rabbits cats squirrels and wild rats geese ducks partridges pheasants and quails are seen there with several other kinds of game not to be met with in europe  china has birds of every kind and every species and parrots inferior to none either in the variety or beauty of their plumage or in the facility of learning to talk but the most beautiful bird of china is the pheasant many of which have been brought to england it is called the kinki or golden fowl its body is proportioned with wonderful elegance and the brilliancy of its plumage seems to be the utmost effort of the pencil of nature the shades of its wings and tail are a mixture of bright red and yellow and a beautiful plume waves over its head its flesh is more delicate than that of our pheasants  their manner of catching waterfowl in china as well as in india is very curious when the fowler spies his game he wades into the water as high as his chin covering his head with a pot full of holes to give him air and sight this pot is covered over with feathers to deceive the game so that when he draws near them by either swimming or walking they are not in the least frightened the fowler then lays hold of them by the feet draws them down under water and the rest of the fowls thinking their companions have only dived are not in the least disturbed but keep swimming about the place till most of them are taken in the same manner  the butterflies found in the province of canton are so much prized as to be sent to court they are larger than any european ones and their wings much broader they begin to flutter about in the evening like bats and seem nearly as large in the extent of their wings their colors are wonderfully variegated and have an extraordinary brilliancy  as to insects they have at times such swarms of locusts as to become a plague and destroy the fruits of the earth one sees says a chinese author such prodigious multitudes of them that they darken the sky and are so close that their wings seem to touch each other their numbers are so great that on lifting up your eyes you would imagine you saw over your head high green mountains and the noise they make in flying is like the beating of a drum  the same author observes that this incredible quantity of locusts never appears but when great floods are followed by a very dry year it being his opinion that the spawn of fish left on the ground and afterward hatched by the heat of the sun produces this vast multitude of insects which in a short time destroys the hopes of a plentiful crop  with respect to fish they have the greater part of such as have been seen in europe but they have one which they call tchokioyu or the fish in armor because its body is defended by sharp scales ranged in straight lines and laid one over the other like tiles on a roof its flesh is white and tastes like veal and it generally weighs  0 pounds the gold and silver fish we have in england are originally from china  the missionaries speak of another fish the figure of which is as singular as it is frightful and disgusting it is called hai seng and generally makes a dish at every entertainment it is usually seen floating and looks like a shapeless lump of inanimate matter it has neither mouth nor bones and dies on being pressed but the most singular of all chinese fishes is the pimouyu this appears to be but half a fish being flat like the sole of a shoe having but one eye and one of its sides without any scales or fins this fish cannot swim but when it unites itself to a companion and the two fishes joined appear to be but one  they have also a salt water fish with a round head and its mouth like the beak of a falcon it has eight legs round its head but has neither scales tail nor bone monkden in his geography says it has two tufts of a beard which resemble two bunches of cord and that during a storm or when the waves of the sea are too much agitated it extends this beard using it as cords to attach itself to the bottom of the sea or to the rocks the name niomere which the mantchew tartars give it implies a moored bark  great numbers of whales are met with here every year toward the northeast on the coasts of korea and in many of their bodies are found darts and harpoons of the french and dutch from whom they have escaped in the northern extremities of europe which seems to indicate the existence of a passage from thence into those seas to the north of america  the chinese fertile in contrivance have two methods of fishing which are curious the one is practiced in the night by moonshine they take two long straight boats and nail a board about two feet broad painted white and varnished on the sides from one end of each boat to the other this plank slopes outward and almost touches the surface of the water in order to catch fish they turn the face of this plank toward the moon that its reflection may add to the brightness of the board when the fish playing and mistaking the color of the board for that of the water leap up to it and often fall upon it or into the boat so that fishermen almost without pains fill a small bark with fish in a very little time  the other method is more surprising as europeans and others train up hawks to fly at game and catch birds the chinese train up cormorants to catch fish one fisherman can easily look after a hundred of these birds he keeps them perched on the sides of his boat waiting patiently for orders till they reach the place where he means to fish and then at the first signal each takes its flight and flies the way assigned it it is pleasant to see them divide among them the whole breadth of the river or the lake they seek up and down swim dive come up again and hover over the water till they perceive their prey when they instantly dart upon it seize it with their beak and bring it to their master when the fish is too big they help one another one taking it by the tail and another by the head and so carry it to the boat where the men hold out long oars or strong canes for them to perch on nor will they quit the fish till they are sent in search of others which they will repeat  00 times when they are weary the fishermen suffer them to rest but give them nothing to eat till the fishing is over during which employ the throat of each cormorant is tied with a small cord lest they should swallow the small fish and prevent their having any inclination to return but when the fishing is over they untie the cord and let them fill their bellies  in the province of quangtong a prodigious number of tame ducks are raised by hatching their eggs in ovens and dunghills but it does not appear that they derived this custom from egypt they load a great number of small barks with them and carry them in flocks to feed on the seashore where at low water these birds find shrimps oysters and other kinds of shellfish these small fleets generally sail in company and the ducks soon mix together on the shore but when night approaches they are collected together by only beating on a basin as swarms of bees are collected at this noise they immediately form themselves into different flocks and each returns to the vessel it belongs to  such flocks of ducks are thus rendered useful on the ricegrounds and the master of a flock like the owner of a stock of sheep in england shall be paid for the service they do to the land at certain periods in the growth of rice it is necessary to clear the ground of vermin the master of such a flock of ducks is applied to and he will conduct his whole flock into the riceground he is employed to clear where they will in a few hours devour all the frogs and insects as would injure the crop and he then by a call or whistle takes them back to his boat such boats as are employed for this purpose are flatbottomed and have three or four apartments above each other on the uppermost the ducks hatch their eggs on the lower they sit with their brood the drake at the call of a whistle drives the young ones into the water and goes before them to show them the way a piece of board is fastened to the side which serves as a bridge for the ducklings to go out and in by and the old ducks are so well trained that on the master of the boat winding a whistle the whole flock will follow him on their return from the grounds the old ducks divide into two parts one guards the side lest any strange duck should enter with their own tribe the other guards the rear to see that none is left behind and when all are embarked the old guardians enter and take their proper posts  chap iv of the people cities towns and gardens of china china abounds in great cities a traveller no sooner has left one but he enters another there are reckoned to be   0  that are walled in which are divided into three classes as to size of the first are   0 many of which are three or four leagues in circumference in the provinces of xensi and xangsi their villages are surrounded with walls and ditches and have irongates which are shut every night and guarded in the daytime by the country people as well against the insults of the soldiers as the depredations of robbers  the cities are divided into two classes civil and military the first contains  0   the rest      and these are subdivided into classes according to their size soldiers are quartered in some of the military ones and a certain quantity of land assigned them in the neighborhood for their support the frontiers and seacoasts are defended by     castles well fortified and kept in order along the same coasts are    0 towns many of which are equal in extent and population to several of the walled cities and as to the towns and villages in the interior part of the country they are almost innumerable and the greater part of them are rich commercial and populous  the public institutions correspond with the extent of the empire there are      royal lodgingplaces for the use of the mandarines governors of provinces officers of the court and couriers that travel at the expense of the crown the towers triumphial arches and other monuments erected in honor of good kings or illustrious heroes are in number      the virtues of women being equally here renowned as those of men  0  monuments are to be seen consecrated to the memory of as many females who by their modesty virtue and attention to the duties of their sex have merited the esteem and veneration of their fellowcitizens two hundred and twenty celebrated libraries are constantly open to the literati and men of genius and the schools or colleges established by confucius and others founded in honor of him are multiplied as much as cities and towns  every principal city has a palace for the viceroy governor or mandarin a public lodging place or inn for those who travel on the kings account and every metropolis has a stately high tower nine stories high and another of seven erected chiefly for ornament being to be seen at a great distance and from their tops affording an extensive prospect of the adjacent country du halde mentions some of these    or    stories high every one lessening the over other with surprising symmetry and all adorned with fine painting carving gilding and also with bells round the top of the upper story hung by a chain so long that the least wind sets them a tinkling the music of which when it blows hard is uncouth yet not disagreeable these towers are similar to the porcelain towers at nanking a model of which is erected in kewgardens near london  the cities are generally square or an oblong square with great high walls towers etc and one or more stately gate at each front two great streets which cross one another in the middle of the town divided in four quarters and the gates stand due east and west the other streets run in a direct line from one to its opposite and are intersected with lanes running parallel to each other and adorned with spacious piazzas temples and other public buildings other cities are perfectly round others oval but within of the same uniform symmetry the far greatest part of them are well supplied with water from rivers or artificial canals which run through them branching into the principal parts of the town and furnishing fountains cascades etc in streets houses gardens etc  the buildings they bestow most on and are whimsically extravagant in are their temples which they rear to a considerable height adorned with every thing curious and filled with an incredible number of idols before which hang lamps continually burning they reckon about   0 of these temples of the first rank besides a prodigious number of others which are served in the whole with   0000 bonzas or priests of bridges there are a vast number one of the most celebrated is that over the river saffrang which joins two mountains together and is  00 cubits long and  00 high and all of one single arch whence travelers call it the flying bridge there is another at the city of changchew at the place where the two great rivers of kiang and kan meet this is built upon   0 barges chained to one another yet so as to open a way in any part of it to let vessels pass there are many such bridges over the country a third sort is built on pillars without any arch some of considerable length and breadth particularly that in the province of fokien which stands on  00 pillars and is   0 perches long and one and a half broad curiously built and adorned with parapets and great variety of sculpture and imagery others are built with arches as with us but of great length breadth and beauty that at oxu the capital of fokien consists of  00 arches and above   0 fathoms in length  their triumphal arches consist of three great arches made of marble the middle arch higher then the other two supported by four columns sometimes round but oftener square of one single stone the frieze is adorned with inscriptions beautiful figures and sculpture with knots and flowers finely carved and birds flying as it were from the stone le comte considers these as their masterpieces in architecture  having described the cities in general i will give my readers a description of the three principal ones peking nanking and canton which will enable him to form a good idea of the rest  peking is the metropolis of the empire and where the court is held it is situated in about the fortieth degree of north latitude in a very fertile plain  0 leagues from the great wall  amiot who was at peking in      speaks thus of the climate from many experiments that i made i am convinced that the water air and earth for the space of seven or eight leagues round equally abound with nitre in this year there was a longer continuance of hot weather then was generally observed before in the months of june and july reaumurs thermometer continually rose from the   th to the   d degree above zero and on the third of july the thermometer rose at three in the afternoon to    degrees ice at this time of the year when first taken from the icehouse dissolves with difficulty and is transported from place to place during the greatest heats of summer in open wheelbarrows with as little precaution as if it were flints or bricks and leaves no other traces behind on the sand then a few drops that fall here and there which convinces me that the ice being so long in dissolving is owing to its being impregnated with so great a number of nitrous particles which preserves it along time in a state of congelation a number of people at this and other seasons are employed by the emperor to give fresh water gratis to all who ask for it  every kind of water at peking whether taken from springs or rivers has a very singular quality it leaves a kind of tartar in those vessels in which it has been kept and in those in which it has been boiled that the air at peking is impregnated with nitre appears from the following reasons   notwithstanding the variety of unwholesome food which the people eat and all the filth and inconvenience resulting from low damp and confined lodgings the plague never makes its appearance in the province of petcheli and the people are seldom attacked by any of those epidemical disorders so common in europe   provisions may be kept a long time at peking without being subject to putrefaction raisins are eaten there fresh till may apples and pears till midsummer wildboars stags deer roebucks rabbits hares pheasants ducks geese and all kind of game brought from tartary to peking in the winter will keep without salt for two or three months though they are exposed every day in the markets and carried about from their houses to the market and back till they are sold nay this may be done till the end of march   whole fields in the neighboring of peking may be seen covered with a nitrous salt every morning at sunrise   the earth is frozen in winter to the depth of two or three feet and does not become soft before the end of march this is the reason that the frost will kill plants at peking which linnaeus raised in sweden though  0 degrees further to the north  this city was anciently an exact square being four leagues about but when the tartars expelled

the palace raised on   bases of white marble  out of it they permitted them to build a new one adjoining which new with the old one makes an irregular figure considerable longer then it is broad so that peking is indeed two cities joined in one as london and westminster is with us one is called the tartar city the other the chinese city but the latter is by far the most populous they are both together six leagues in circumference reckoning   00 paces to a league le comte measured them by the emperors order and he thinks them to be four times as big as paris but as the houses in peking are but one story high and those at paris five peking may not have more inhabitants than paris especially if we consider that the streets are wide and that the emperors palace is of vast extent containing parks gardens canals etc yet he seems to be of opinion that the inhabitants must be more numerous as  0 chinese will live in as little room as  0 europeans  the height and enormous thickness of the walls of the old tartar city excite admiration they hide the whole town by their height and are so thick that    horsemen may readily ride on them abreast they have spacious square towers raised on them about a bowshot distant from each other and large enough to contain bodies of reserve in case of necessity  the city has four gates lofty and well arched that at a distance make a great show over them are large pavilionroofed towers divided into nine stories each having several port holes the lower story forms a large hall for the use of the soldiers and others who quit guard and those appointed to relieve them and before each gate is a space of more than   0 feet large enough for  00 men to be drawn up a kind of redoubt surrounded by a semicircular wall equal in thickness and height to the citywalls the arches or gateways are built of marble but the rest of the walls of brick the great road which ends here is commanded by a pavilionroofed tower like the gates so that as the cannon of the former can batter the houses of the city those of the latter can sweep the adjacent country the chinese city is also walled round and has seven gates and a large suburb at every gate  the streets of peking are straight and a league in length the principal of them   0 feet wide and bordered with shops those in which they sell silks and chinaware generally take up the whole street and make a very pleasing appearance and that which renders it more so is the custom tradesmen have of fixing up a long board in front of their shops about  0 feet high painted and gilt on which are written the names of the goods they sell these being placed on each side of the street almost at equal distances in most of the cities in china and having pendants and streamers on the top make a very agreeable show they have no signs but the name of every tradesman is written in large letters over his door was it not for this the streets would look mean notwithstanding their length and breadth the houses being so low and mean in front  all the great streets are drawn by a line from one gate to another and have several corpse de guard night and day the soldiers with their swords by their sides and whips in their hands are ready to correct those who make any disturbance and they are authorized to take into custody such as resist or create any quarrels  the little streets that open into the greater have latticegates at the end which does not prevent seeing all that pass along and these are guarded also the latticegates are shut at night and are seldom opened but to persons known who carry a lanthorn in their hand and who give a good reason for coming out such as fetching a physician etc in all chinese cities there are very large bells at peking there are seven one according to magaillans weighs   0000 lb is    feet in diameter and    round and    high besides the ear which is three feet more though they exceed ours in size they are inferior in sound having wooden clappers on the outside in form of mallets that make but a dull noise these bells are almost in form of a cylinder near as wide at top as at bottom but their thickness lessens gradually from the bottom to the top the metal is brittle ill cast and full of knots but its sound which is prodigiously loud and strong has a most awful effect in the night by its reverberating round the walls and by the echo of the surrounding country one of these bells is admired for the beautiful characters with which it is covered being as neat and perfect as if traced out by the finest writer or formed of wax by a stamp rougement tells us that two of these bells were raised to the top of a tower   0 french feet high by  00 men only under the direction of verbiest a missionary to the great astonishment of the chinese who imagined it would require several thousand men and that two years afterward he raised another with only   0 young men by a stroke on these bells the five watches of the night are distinguished on the commencement of the first they give one stroke which is repeated every minute for two hours till the second watch they then give two strokes repeating them at certain intervals till the third watch and so on increasing the number of strokes according to the watch the bells are hung in towers built for that pupose and begin to sound at seven or eight in the evening they make use of enormous drums for the same purpose  0 feet in circumference  as soon as the first stroke is given by the watch on the bells a soldier or two comes and goes from one corpse de guard to the other and as they pass they play continually on a sort of rattle they do not suffer any person to go about at night and examine even those who are sent on the emperors business if their answers are equivocal they take them to the guardhouse where the person commanding must answer every call of the sentinel on duty by this beautiful order which is observed with the greatest strictness peace silence and safety reigns throughout the city the governor is obliged to walk round the towers and often comes when he is least expected and the officers on guard at the walls and at the gates where they beat the watches on great drums of brass send subalterns to examine their respective quarters the least neglect is punished the next day and the officer broken  this exact discipline which prevents all nocturnal assemblies will no doubt appear very extraordinary with us and will not please our persons of fashion but is it not the duty of the chief persons of a state to prefer good order and public safety to diversions and amusement which give rise to a variety of attempts against the property and lives of the inhabitants nothing appears more agreeable to reason since the tartars a people without learning lately come from the midst of woods and forests not enlightened by christianity are governed by these principles and by this prudent vigilance cut off the root of the many crimes which are but too common in states not so well regulated  this regulation is expensive to the state for part of the soldiers are kept entirely to take care of the streets they are called infantry and their pay is large besides their watching night and day it is their duty to see that every person cleans before his own house that the streets are swept every day and watered night and morning in dry weather and the dirt taken away after rain and as the streets are wide it is their duty also to keep the middle of the street clean themselves for the covenience of passengers as the town is not paved when the dirt is removed they level it or dry it after it has been turned and mixed with other earth so that two hours after rain every one may walk clean in all parts  but if the streets are kept so quiet at night there is noise enough in the day it is astonishing to see the immense concourse of people that fill them and the confusion caused by the prodigious number of horses mules asses camels carts wagons and chairs which cross and meet each other without reckoning the crowds of one or two hundred men in different parts of the streets listening to fortune tellers jugglers masters of infinite dexterity balladsingers and a thousand mountebanks and buffoons who read and relate stories to promote laughter and distribute medicines the wonderful effects of which they display with all the eloquence peculiar to them  i say crowds of men for not a woman is seen in the streets  as all the riches and merchandise of the empire are continually pouring into this city the number of strangers that resort here is immense they are carried in chairs or ride on horseback chiefly the latter but they are always attended by a guide acquainted with the streets and who knows the houses of the nobility and principal people they are also provided with a book containing an account of the different quarters squares remarkable places and residence of public officers in summertime temporary shops are built in the streets which add to the confusion where persons are served with icewater and every where we find eatinghouses and places of refreshment for tea and fruits hackney horses and chairs are always at hand for there are no coaches and for    or    pence a horse or mule may be hired for the whole day from the continual crowd in the streets the owner of such horse leads his beast by the bridle to make way  added to all this people of distinction oblige all their dependants to follow them a mandarin of the first rank is always accompanied in his walks by his whole tribunal and to augment his equipages each of the inferior mandarins in his suite is generally attended by several domestics the nobility of the court and princes of the blood never appear in public without being surrounded by a large body of cavalry and as their attendance is required at the palace every day their train alone is sufficient to crowd the city and create confusion it is very singular as i have observed that in all this prodigious concourse no women are ever seen hence we may judge of the population of china as the number of females here as well as every where else is greater than that of the other sex  another addition to the general crowd is that but few artificers such as smiths tailors carpenters etc work but in the houses of their employers and of course are all day about the streets seeking for employment multitudes of country people resort here daily to market and no river coming up close to the city all manner of goods are brought to peking by landcarriage which fills the streets with wagons beasts of burden and their drivers insomuch that morning and evening the gates are so thronged that a man may wait some hours before he can go by and yet in all this bustle very few accidents happen the police is so judicious as to keep all quiet the city is divided into four quarters and these four into lesser divsions every ten houses has an officer like our constable who presides over the other nine and informs the magisrate if any thing happens and the governor of peking has jurisdiction not only over the soldiers but over all the citizens and every thing that relates to the civil government and the public security if any robbery is committed in the night the neighborhood is obliged to make it good and in every family the master is accountable for his children and his servants the streets are patrolled at night by the footguards and the horse go their rounds upon the walls  an immense number of barbers are perpetually walking the streets with a kind of little bell to give notice of their approach to such as want their service they carry on their shoulders a stool a basin a kettle and fire with a towel and combcase and will when called shave the head in an instant either in the street porch or the middle of a square these men shave set the eyebrows in order clean the ears with proper instruments stretch out the arms rub the shoulders and do all this for the value of three farthings english which they receive very gratefully and then ring their bell for other customers  in short there is scarce any invention to which the chinese have not recourse to find means of subsistence for as there is not a spot in the empire that lies untilled so there is not a person man or woman though never so old deaf or blind but what may gain a livelihood a great many families in peking gain a living by selling matches others have no other business but picking up in the streets little rags of silk woollen cotton or linen and the feathers of fowls bones of dogs and bits of paper which they wash and sell again  strict watch is kept in the daytime here and in every city to observe those who enter for this purpose a strong guard is placed at every gate the air the looks etc of all passengers are carefully examined and if their appearance is doubtful they are carried before a mandarin this is to prevent the entry of foreigners amongst them for being bigoted to their ancient usages they suppose that by the admission of foreigners an alteration of manners customs and ceremonies might in process of time result from such an intercourse and give birth to quarrels partydisputes and sedition and at last end in an overthrow of the constitution  none but military people are permitted to wear arms in public and these only in time of war guard or review of course little mischief is done by occasional quarrels if two men quarrelling have sticks in their hands they will lay them aside and fight the matter out with their fists but they oftener go before a mandarin and beg him to settle it he hears the case with great gravity and according to the merits of it orders the aggressor or both of them to receive a sound bastinadoing prostitutes are not suffered to remain within the walls of any city but they may reside in the suburbs provided they do not keep a house of their own certain persons are authorized to lodge them but those persons must watch their conduct and is responsible and punishable for any noise or quarrel in his house  every city of china and sometimes even an ordinary town enjoys the advantages of an establishment lately introduced into paris this is an office called tongpou where money may be borrowed upon pledges no preliminaries are necessary the transaction is an inviolable secret and the borrower may remain unknown those who belong to the office take only a description of the borrower or his person so as to be able to give an account of what they do to the police if he borrows a sum seemingly too large for his situation in life these officekeepers will set a person to follow him home but unless connivance is proved the office never sustains a loss the usual interest of money is  0 per cent and at this rate money may be borrowed of the tongpou  however industrious and temperate these people are the prodigious number of inhabitants in populous cities occasions a great deal of misery some of the cities are so poor that they cannot supply their inhabitants with the common necessaries of life for which reason they expose their children often in the streets especially when mothers fall sick or want milk to suckle them thus are these little innocents in some sense condemned to death as soon as they begin to live this is common in great cities such as canton and peking but in other places such instances are few and government so far winks at it as to employ as much vigilance in carrying them away in the morning as it bestows on their education which encourages the practice this has inclined the missionaries in populous places to educate several catechists who divide the whole city and walk out every morning to baptize a multitude of dying children and have prevailed on many of the infidelmidwives to permit christian women to follow them to the houses they are called to for it sometimes happens that a chinese not being in a condition to bring up a large family shall engage the midwife to stifle a female infant in a basin of water as soon as born on which occasions these christian midwives take care to baptize them first poor families will also when their infants die lay them in the roads and streets or throw them in the river to save the expense of burying them it is the same misery that produces a vast number of slaves or rather persons who sell themselves to their employers a man will sometimes sell his son and sometimes himself and wife at a very moderate price but if he can he is contented to sell his children only  the emperors palace stands in the middle of the tartar city is an oblong square two miles in length and one in breadth and an assemblage of vast buildings extensive courts and magnificent gardens shup up on all sides by a double wall the space between the two walls occupied by houses belonging to the officers of the court eunuchs and different tribunals some of whom have the care of providing necessaries for the emperors use and some for determining disputes and punishing faults committed by the domestics of the palace  within the inner wall are nine vast courts and the arched ways through which one enters them are erected with marble and have each a large square gothic building over them the offices on each side the courts are but mean the emperors apartment which is at the end of the furthest court is built on a square platform raised with earth and cased with marble and consists like all other chinese houses of one story the roof of which is supported by large marble columns and covered with glazed yellow tiles that glitter in the sun like gold the white marble steps by which these staterooms are ascended the carvedwork varnish painting and gilding with which they are adorned give them a very magnificent appearance and suitable to the grandeur of that monarch to whom they belong but still as le comte observes there is not that contrivance and uniformity in which the beauty of our buildings consists and of course the irregularity of the whole must offend the eye of any one skilled in architecture  the inner palacecourt at the end of which this platform is raised is   0 feet in length and  0 broad an immense gallery runs round it in which are magazines containing rich effects the emperors private property for the public treasury is entrusted to a sovereign tribunal one of these magazines is filled with plate another with rich furs a third with dresses lined with valuable furs which the emperor sometimes gives in presents to his officers a fourth is a depository of jewels pieces of curious marble and pearls fished up in tartary a fifth is full of wardrobes and trunks of silk stuffs used by the emperor and his family and the rest are filled with bows and arrows and other armor taken from the enemy or presented by princes  the platform on which the emperors apartments are built is    feet high with a balustrade ound it of white marble and the apartments being in the center leave a broad terrace paved with marble round them  the hall of audience is in the middle front of these apartments   0 feet square the cieling is carvedwork japanned green and charged with gilded dragons the pillars within that support the roof are seven feet in circumference at bottom encrusted with a kind of paste and japanned with red the pavementfloor is covered with an ordinary carpet imitating the turkey and the walls are whited but destitute of ornament  the throne stands in the middle of this hall and consists of a lofty alcove very neat but not magnificent with the word ching painted over it which implies holy in latin eximius or in english wisest or most perfect on the terrace before the hall are placed great and massy vessels of brass in which perfumes are burnt during the time of audience and candlesticks made in the shape of birds large enough to hold wax flambeaus which at this time are lighted the private apartments i can give no account of strangers not being permitted to see them nor any of the natives but women and eunuchs in the gardens of the palace are two great sheets of water with a marble bridge thrown over them  the palaces of the royal family are very neat within extremely capacious and built at great expense but in a similar form with the emperors a row of courts adorned with buildings on the sides and in front at the end of the inner court a hall japanned and raised on a platform three or four feet high railed round cased with great blocks of hewn stone and paved with large square tiles the tribunals of the sovereign juridictions are also of vast extent but ill built and worse repaired and no ways adequate to the greatness of the empire  the seraglio in the court of peking contains a collection of the most beautiful virgins in the empire these the viceroys and governors of the several provinces make the emperor presents of who indeed uses them no better than slaves for they are so numerous that many of them are scarcely known to him  the houses of peking and even the palaces of the principal mandarins are built on the surface of the ground supported with wooden pillars without any foundation they are but one story high except in merchants houses where they have a second as a warehouse and of course take up a great extent of ground having several open courts within their walls the people have such a regard to privacy that no windows are made toward the street or to look toward their neighbors and just within their great gate or portal stands a wall or screen to prevent strangers looking in when the gate is opened when you have passed this screen there are little allies right and left by which you pass into the several courts with buildings round them  their rooms are very plain nothing being studied but usefulness those that are opulent add ornaments of japanwork sculpture and gilding the greatest part of the houses in cities are covered with tiles all the roofs of the rooms are supported by pillars  0 feet high on stone bases and beams from one to another and the magnificence of them consists in the thickness of the beams and pillars the excellency of the timber and the carving on the gates they have no other stairs than what are before the door which are a few steps from the ground but along the side of the house is a close gallery six or seven feet wide and cased with beautiful freestone  common houses are built with unburnt brick in some places they are made with tempered earth and in others the walls are made with hurdles covered with lime and earth but those of the gentry are made of polished bricks very curiously carved in countrytowns the houses are chiefly of earth very low and the roofs almost flat composed of reeds covered with earth  their entertainments are made in a sort of hall or banqueting house at the entrance of their houses and have no other ornament than a single order of columns painted and varnished to support the roof and the roofs are often open to the tiles without a cieling round this hall are several places partitioned off with a table and benches to hold four persons in each like our coffeehouses in london for let the company be ever so numerous not more than four at any time dine at one table and often but one person the furniture of this hall is merely benches and tables and some large lanthorns made of painted silk suspended from the roof their rooms have no lookingglasses hangings or fine chairs and their beds which are one of their principal ornaments are scarce ever seen by strangers those of the rich in winter have curtains of double satin and in summer of white taffety painted with flowers birds and trees the posts gilt painted and carved with worked satin coverlids the beds of the common people are made of plain linen and plain mattrasses stuffed with cotton and in the northern provinces the poor sleep on benches built up with bricks and kept warm by stoves on the outside like our hotwalls on these they sleep some on the bare bricks some on mattrasses and in the daytime here they sit and work and dress their food having little or no furniture  they always sleep bareheaded and though their heads are shaven they have but little covering their apartments are damp being on the groundfloor and generally between courtyard and garden they are subject to many disorders arising from obstructions a kind of deafness is so common that a chinese in his  0th or  0th year is seldom free from it and perhaps it is in consequence of this impediment to sound that their music pleases them infinitely beyond ours and they had rather hear a drum a ring of bells or the jingling of a few brass basins than any concert of european instruments with those who can afford furniture it consists of tables cabinets screens chairs and abundance of porcelain vases the whole is covered with that beautiful varnish which we cannot imitate and prettily ornamented with painted figures the hall is the only place where visitors are received they being admitted into no other part of the house  the city of nanking is the capital of the province of kiangnan and situated in latitude    n was formerly the residence of the emperor and by far the largest and most populous city of all china a french missionary lately arrived from that country speaks of it as follows we arrived at nanking on the  d of june i was very desirous of seeing that city which is reckoned to be the largest in the world the suburbs through which we passed are very long but not populous the houses stand at some distance from each other having reeds pools of water or plantations of bamboo between them we took a view of it from the fifth story of the porcelain tower which commands an extensive prospect but it did not appear to us to be above two thirds as large as paris we could not reconcile this wih the accounts generally given of its immense extent but next morning explained the matter we had traveled a full league from nanking when we perceived on a sudden the walls of a city rising amidst mountains and appearing as if cemented to the rocks these were the walls of nanking which leaving the city where it now stands have as it were retired thither to enclose a space of    or    leagues    or    of which are not inhabited  nanking has lost much of its ancient splendour it had formerly a magnificent palace but no remains of it are left a third part of the city is deserted but the rest is well inhabited some parts of it are extremely populous and full of business the streets are not so broad as those of peking but are very beautiful well paved in the middle with large marble slabs and on the sides with variety of pebble and other stones curiously inlaid and bordered with shops the breadth and dept of the river on which the city stands render its port very commodious being here two leagues wide but it is now grown into disuse here resides a mandarin or governor and the tartars have a numerous garrison commanded by a general of their own nation the city has still some beautiful gates some few temples and that famous octagon porcelain tower of which i said there is an exact model in kewgardens it is  00 feet high and  0 wide at bottom is in good condition and has stood near  00 years it consists of nine similar stories lessening in size as the column rises so as to form a pyramid between each story is a penthouse all round covered with green varnished tiles growing less and less like the tower itself and decreasing in breadth as it increases in height on the top is a cupola thirty feet higher than the eighth story with a large golden ball above and the whole is cased with chinaware glazed and painted and so joined as to seem one piece of china there is also a bell in nanking    feet high and seven in diameter that weighs  0000lb  of the city and environs of canton i shall say a little more as being the place to which the english go and of course could receive better information respecting it  canton lies in n latitude    degrees   minutes and of course is very hot being very nearly under the tropic of cancer it is situated on the east side of the large river ta about  0 miles from its mouth and is said to be the best harbor in china indeed it is that to which all european nations resort on the landside it is defended by three forts and two high walls about five miles in circuit with very pleasant walks round it it has also two strong watercastles in the middle of the river ta from the tops of some adjacent hills on which forts are built we have a fine prospect of the country beautifully scattered with mountains little hills and valleys all green and these diversified with small towns villages high towers temples the seats of mandarins and other great men which are delightfully watered with lakes and canals covered with numberless boats and wampoo junks sailing too and fro through the most fertile places of the country  one begins says premare to have an idea of china on entering the river canton both sides of it present large fields of rice which resemble green meadows and extend beyond the reach of sight they are intersected by an infinite number of small canals in such manner that the barks which pass and repass in them seem at a distance to sail along the grass the water that carries them being concealed from the eye farther in land the country appears covered with trees and cultivated along the valleys and the whole scene is interspersed with villages rural seats and such a variety of delightful prospects that one is never tired of viewing them and regrets to be obliged to pass them so quickly  from the english factory at canton to wampo where the ships lie it is about six miles by water on the river ta and in the way there the eye is delighted not only with green and fruitful fields and boats passing and repassing but with a number of villages and lofty pagodas and steeples one of these pagodas is situated close to the river and is called the halfwayhouse see the plate of wampo  the city is entered by seven iron gates within each of which is a guardhouse no european is allowed to enter there if known the soldiers that keep guard are armed with spears darts swords and matchlock guns but most of them with bows and arrows which they esteem more than any other military weapon  canton is composed as it were of three different cities so united that the same gates serve to go out from one and enter another these three cities form a regular square the streets are long and narrow and paved with broad stone and ornamented from space to space with triumphal arches some of them are covered these contain the richest shops the houses are like those of peking some of which are hung with paper or pieces of white taffety on which are written in chinese characters religious and moral sentences they have no chimnies but in their stead place a shallow iron pot filled with charcoal in the middle of the room in winter which is suffocating to people unaccustomed to it in their kitchens they have a copper built in brickwork much about the height of our english stoves the windows are made of cane or rattan in winter they cut oystershells into diamondshape and set them in wooden frames but these afford only a dull light  the shops of those that deal in silk are very neat make a fine show and are all in one place for tradesmen or dealers in any kind of goods herd together in the same street on this account you may hear the english sailors talking of the streets of canton as if they were speaking of london or some other english city the street where the chinashops are they call chinarow that where clothes are sold monmouthstreet and that narrow street where mens caps shoes etc are exposed to sale mandarincapalley and a narrow passage close to the citywall where lapidary and glasswork is sold is called stonecuttersalley and so of many others the shops have counters drawers and divisions much like our own and there are few of the merchants but who have a person that can speak broken english or portuguese so that french dutch and danes are obliged to speak either the one or the other when they traffic with them  there are a great number of marketplaces for fish flesh poultry vegetables and all kinds of provisions every thing is sold cheap fishmongers keep their fish alive in cisterns dogs cats frogs and rats are here sold as provisions indeed the chinese have good appetites for they will eat any sort of meat that which dies in a ditch equally as hearty as that killed by a butcher dogs and cats are commonly brought to market alive in baskets are generally young and fat and kept very clean rats some of which are of a monstrous size are very fat and generally hung up with the skins on by nails on the posts of the marketplace frogs which are the greatest dainty here are sold at a great price they are black and loathsome to a european eye but the chinese say they have a very fine taste the rats they say eat well and snakebroth was in reputation here long before it was known to us frogs are strung upon a rod in the same manner as we string fish in england  in passing through the streets one is almost suffocated by the stench of the houses on each side and particularly a street about a mile above the english factory where there is nothing but cookshops they have large hogs roasted whole and numbers of dogs cats and rats upon the spits and the cooks themselves with their utensils have such a dirty appearance that the sight or smell may almost satisfy the keenest european appetite they send about their victuals for sale by cowlies or porters  the common people says lockyer eat four times a day and are such gluttons that if they are in the middle of their business will leave it and run to their victuals at the usual hour rice is their usual diet which they cram into their mouths so greedily with their chopsticks which are a substitute for fork and spoon that it would probably choke them if they did not wash it down every now and then with a cup of samshue standing by them some of them will eat six pintbasons of rice at one meal  people of condition are here carried about in chairs the streets are continually crowded especially with porters who are all loaded and have for the most part their heads legs and feet bare there is no convenience in this city for conveying goods from one part to another but on mens shoulders  in the streets of canton we often meet with blind beggars a disease which some imagine is the consequence of their living so much upon rice or it may be owing to the hot winds which blow here at certain seasons they are indeed miserable objects and commonly go naked excepting a trowser or cloth round their waist their skins are as black as malays and sometimes so parched spotted and full of running sores and ulcers that they truly stink alive they go sometimes in companies and are sure to follow and plague europeans because they get from one foreigner more sometimes than from a dozen of their own countrymen they hold out a coarse china basin and will not leave you until you put something into it nay if you are not upon your guard they will run against you with their dirty hands and diseased bodies the common sailors give them usually a bit of tin in order to save their money and avoid coming in contact with these most wretched of creatures the chinese themselves are very uncharitable they never give money to a beggar but put them off with a small handful of rice  there are a great many private walks about the skirts of the town where those of the better sort have their houses and which are little frequented by europeans whose business is chiefly in the trading part of the city where there are only shops and warehouses few of the chinese keep their families in the houses where they do business but either in the city in the more remote suburbs or further up the country  as the women in china are kept so very private that many have made voyages there and never seen a woman but of the lowest rank it is natural for them to pry into the most retired and unfrequented places where there is a probability of the womens being least upon their guard and in such rambles a europeans curiosity is seldom entirely disappointed sometimes they pop in on a parcel of young boys and girls attended by their nurses but when this happens they are all so frighted at the sight of a fanquy as they call foreigners that they will scream out and run into their houses and by their noise alarm the whole street their houses having no windows to the street and having a screen of split cane before the door it is impossible to see them though they can easily see any person without through the latticework of the screen  now and then on turning a corner or on entering a private street suddenly we find ourselves in a company of young ladies conversing or playing together but they no sooner see us than they set up a scream and run for shelter into their apartments as if the devil himself was chasing them  however says an englishman who has been often at canton these accidental interviews made us very happy for we frequently saw some charming creatures surpassing all description and whose beauty most europeans who have been there are entirely ignorant of indeed we could only be happy in the glance of one or two such in a street for the screaming of one caught out of doors immediately alarmed the rest of the ladies and baffled our curiosity  sometimes indeed we met them at a considerable distance from their houses and as their feet are so little that they cannot walk or run but rather trip or hobble along and are often obliged to assist themselves by laying hold of the wall as they move along it gave us an opportunity to gaze on them attentively on such occasions that they seemed so affrighted and walked so awkwardly that i was fain to retire lest i should have made them stumble and fall for which i should certainly have been bambood  the complexion of the ladies is exceeding fair and their hair of the finest black dressed up with gold and silver bodkins and adorned with flowers their shape is exquisitely fine and their dress the most becoming natural easy and splendid i ever saw  before we left canton they were so familiarized to our visits that the young boys would frequently come or were sent to salute us but if we offered to approach the houses where their mothers or nurses waited their return they presently ran from us and shut the door  it is reckoned that there are in the city and suburbs   00000 people and you will scarce find a day in the whole year but there are  000 trading vessels lying before the town  few days pass in canton but there are processions when a mandarin of note passes in the street or in the highway he moves in great state either on horseback or in a large chair carried by five men if he is a tartar or mandarin of war he is on horseback if a chinese and of the civil order he is carried in a chair several flags are borne before him and large lacquered peels painted black and red with large golden characters expressing his titles and dignities close to the mandarin are carried several umbrellas to keep off the heat of the sun in the front are a number of men with highcrowned hats with two large pheasantfeathers in each who make a hideous noise crying incessantly hoot to warn every one to go off the streets or stand aside till the mandarin passes by next to them are fellows with small chains in their hands ready to throw over any ones head and drag them by the neck that do not obey the call or stand aside to let the mandarin pass after these a number of executioners follow with ensigns of punishment in their hands such as a sword ax etc wearing caps like a sugar loaf several of them have the foreigners quarter at canton large pieces of lacquered wood painted black which they drag after them and with which they bamboo or bastinado a delinquent the criminal is thrown on his face and the bamboomen give him as many blows on the breech as his worship the mandarin is pleased to order  the english factory is situated in one of the best streets in the town where all foreigners reside it is very large has a number of courts halls and warehouses with convenient rooms to lodge a great number of people one large gate opens to the street and another to the water where our boats load and unload at each gate a sentinel is kept day and night there is also a petty officer appointed to see the sentinels duly relieved and the porters or cowlies do their duty to take an account of all goods that come in or go out of the factory to prepare rooms for the officers and people when they come to reside some little time in the factory to entertain the officers and men and in a word to see that every thing is kept in proper order for all the officers and men are allowed a certain time to reside and do business at canton according to their station which they do by turns and in the factory often sixty persons are entertained at once  the temples and places of public worship are the most magnificent buildings at canton they are well stocked with images to which the people pay profound adoration by falling down on their knees before them wringing their hands and beating their foreheads against the ground these temples or josshouses are generally one story high and are very numerous they are decorated with a great number of artificial flowers embroidered hangings curtains and fringes one of them situated in the skirt of the northeast side of the suburbs makes a splendid appearance it is four stories high has a fine cupola with many outhouses and galleries this was formerly a palace belonging to the wangtai or king of the province of canton before the tartars conquered china and who was then an independent prince before the principal gate of the temple are two large images one on each side about    feet high with spears and lances in their hands somewhat resembling those in guildhall london this gate leads into a fine large paved court and we enter the temple which fronts it by freestone steps the lower part of the temple is built with fine hewn stone but the upper part is timber in the lower hall there are a number of images of all sizes and of different dignities all finely gilt and kept exceedingly clean by the priests lesser images are placed in the corners of the hall and one of a larger size in the middle the center god sits in a lazy posture with his heels drawn up to his breech almost naked particularly his breast and belly and leaning on a large cushion he is ten times larger than an ordinary man very corpulent and of a merry countenance and gilt all over models of this in chinaware have often been brought to england upstairs there are also many images of men and women who have been deified for their brave and virtuous actions  the rooms of this cathedral or temple are large and spacious but very old and much out of repair it is surrounded with canals and gardens but for want of proper care the water is stagnated and overgrown with weeds and ruins  though canton is but    degrees from the equator and is scorching hot in summer yet about the months of december and january it is subject to high winds and very heavy rains the sudden alteration the climate and temperature of the air then undergoes is very surprising at this time the people of china take to their winterdress which is lined with furs or quilted cotton instead of wearing fans which are used by men women and children in hot weather they keep a live quail in their hands to keep them warm and have the long sleeves of their gowns down to cover their hands thus equipped they walk so stiff and shove up their shoulders so much that one would think they were freezing to death  the streets of canton in the time of those violent storms called the typhones are overflowed with water and it is often so deep that in many places it will float a small boat common people then pass from street to street by wading through the water but those of the better class are carried in chairs or on mens backs their umbrellas are now used to shade them from the sun which just before were used to keep off the rain  the river ta at canton is somewhat broader than the thames at london but the crowds of small vessels that ply the ta are vastly more numerous for the space of four or five miles opposite the city is an extensive wooden town of large vessels and boats stowed so close as scarce to leave room for a boat to pass they are generally drawn up in ranks with a narrow passage left for vessels to pass and repass some of them are large vessels of   or  00 tons burden called junks in which they perform their foreign voyages here are also an incredible number of small boats in which poor families live all their lifetime begetting and bringing up children without ever putting a foot on shore in these they keep hogs dogs cats geese and other domestic animals both for subsistence and sale we have nothing similar to this in europe but people in china are so exceedingly numerous that vast numbers of families are obliged to betake themselves to boats on the river for want of room or means of subsistence on the land where almost every habitable spot is occupied these boats are very conveniently built with arched covers and tilts made of solid wood or with bamboo or cajan leaves so high that people can walk upright under them they manage them very nimbly having a sculling oar at the stern with which they push them on very fast and pass each other with ease and safety  the large sampans for inland carriage are generally steered with sculls for were they to use oars there would not be room on the river for half their number they have all long bamboo poles for pushing up along shore these boats are employed in carrying goods and passengers up and down the rivers and canals  the smaller boats are employed in catching fish with nets which they barter for clothes flesh rice and other necessaries the owners of these boats are always at home as they carry their houses along with them but miserably poor their children are numerous and in summer go quite naked they are much tanned continually crawling about the boat and have all of them calabash shells tied on their backs to buoy them up and save them from drowning should they chance to fall overboard which often happens their beds are fixed below the deck on which they live and which being made of boards and jointed can be occasionally removed in the hinder part of the boat is a place where a stove is fixed to dress their food and another apartment for keeping their live animals which they have in great numbers and which when they want room they hang in baskets on the outside of the boat  these boats come crowding about the european ships at wampo especially at dinnertime begging victuals from the people on board in return for which they offer to wash their linen and do other menial offices  some of these boats have smart young girls on board of them which induces the sailors to employ them and it is among these miserable wretches that european sailors taking advantage of their necessities bargain with a father or mother for the favors of their daughter but this traffic must be carried on very secretly lest it should be observed by the petty mandarins who are appointed to visit often and keep order and discipline in this floating world these mandarins are continually going up and down the rivers searching such boats as they have any reason to suspect should any european be caught in them with a young woman he together with the people of the boat must undergo the chastisement of the bamboo or bribe the mandarin with a dollar or two to let them pass there are some of these boats called loblob boats well stocked with a number of beautiful young women of different ages to whom every body chinese or european may have access at any time though these boats are under the jurisdiction of the mandarins and equally liable to punishment with the others yet there is so good an understanding between the mandarins and the proprietors of these boats that they deal pretty extensively and with great safety only when they discern a european who has a large sum of money about him they lay their heads together to make the most of him it is said the mandarins themselves are no strangers to these boats particularly when there are any fresh goods embarked pimps are numerous if a european wants to see a lady of pleasure it is only speaking to these fellows who will immediately conduct you in a small sampan to a place where your wishes may be gratified these enterprises however are not always executed without danger  at the entrance of the bay of canton is the celebrated portugueze port called macao in latitude    degrees    minutes the town is built on the point of a small island which commands a good road and safe shelter for shipping the portuguese obtained this port as a reward for some assistance they gave against a celebrated pirate who had laid siege to the capital of this large province but they submit to the chinese pay their customs to the emperor and obey his mandarins they have however a governor of their own and pay the emperor annually a tribute of  00000 ducats for the liberty of choosing their own magistrates exercising their religion and living according to their own laws their houses are built after the european manner and the city is defended by three forts well planted with artillery  it is remarkable that the portuguese here hold their sunday on the same day the spaniards on the philippine islands do their saturday this difference of days which is general through the week arises from the different routes these nations take in going to their several settlements the portuguese in going to macao sail eastward whereas the spaniards in going to the philippine isles from america sail to the west  four leagues from canton is the famous village of fochan the largest and most populous in the world it is called a village not having a governor nor being enclosed with walls yet it contains more houses and inhabitants than even canton itself it is reckoned to be three leagues in circumference  northeast of canton in the province of fokien the port called emouy from the island that forms it it is so large that several thousand vessels may ride at anchor in it and the depth of water is so great that the largest ships may lie close to the shore without danger it used to be much frequented by european vessels but all the trade is now removed to canton there is however a garrison of   or  000 men commanded by a chinese general three leagues from it is a small island with a natural arch in the middle which can be seen through and it is hence called the perforated island the isle of emouy is particularly celebrated for the magnificence of its principal pagoda consecrated to the deity fo  the most easterly port on the continent of china is nimpo this is a city of the first magnitude very populous and beautified with many triumphal arches it is but two days sail from japan with which island they carry on a great trade  end of the fifth volume a description
