anna st ives a novel  anna st ives a novel  by thomas holcroft  volume ii  london printed for shepperson and reynolds no     oxfordstreet  m dcc xcii  anna st ives a novel letter xix coke clifton to guy fairfax at venice paris hotel de luniversite pres le pont royal i write fairfax according to promise to inform you that i have been a fortnight in france and four days in this city the tract of country over which i have passed within these three months is considerable from naples to rome from rome to florence from florence to venice where we spent our carnival from venice to modena parma and genoa from thence to turin from turin to geneva then turning to the left to lions and from lions to paris objects have passed before me in such a rapid succession that the time i have spent abroad though not more than a year and a half appears something like a life the sight of the proud alps which boldly look eternity in the face imparts a sensation of length of time wholly inadequate to the few hours that are employed in passing them the labor up is a kind of age and the swift descent is like falling from the clouds once more to become an inhabitant of earth  here at paris i half fancy myself at home and yet to timid people who have never beheld the ocean and who are informed that seas divide france and england paris appears to be at an unattainable distance every thing is relative in this world great or small near or distant only by comparison the traveller who should have passed the deserts and suffered all the perils all the emotions of a journey from bengal by land would think himself much nearer home at naples than i do coming from naples at paris and those who have sailed round the world seem satisfied that their labor is within a hairs breadth of being at an end when they arrive on their return at the cape of good hope  you fairfax have frequently asked me to give you accounts of this and that place of the things i have seen and of the observations i have made but i have more frequently put the same kind of questions to myself and never yet could return a satisfactory answer i have seen people whose manners are so different from those of my own country that i have seemed to act with them from a kind of conviction of their being of another species yet a moments consideration undeceives me i find them to be mere men men of different habits indeed but actuated by the same passions the same desire of selfgratification yes fairfax the sun moon and stars make their appearance in italy as regularly as in england nay much more so for there is not a tenth part of the intervening clouds  when molested by their dirt their vermin their beggars their priests and their prejudices how often have i looked at them with contempt the uncleanliness that results from heat and indolence the obsequious slavishness of the common people contrasted with their loquacious impertinence the sensuality of their hosts of monks nay the gluttony even of their begging friars their ignorant adoration of the rags and rotten wood which they themselves dress up the protection afforded to the most atrocious criminals if they can but escape to a mass of stone which they call sacred the little horror in which they hold murder the promptness with which they assassinate for affronts which they want the spirit to resent their gross buffooneries religious and theatrical the ridiculous tales told to the vulgar by their preachers and the improbable farces which are the delight of the gentle and the simple all these and many other things of a similar nature seem to degrade them below rational creatures  yet reverse the picture and they appear rather to be demigods than men listen to their music behold their paintings examine their palaces their basins of porphyry urns and vases of numidian marble catacombs and subterranean cities their sculptured heroes triumphal arches and amphitheatres in which a nation might assemble their corinthian columns hewn from he rocks of egypt and obelisks of granite transported by some strange but forgotten means from alexandria the simplicity the grandeur and beauty of their temples and churches the vast fruitfulness of their lands their rich vineyards teeming fields and early harvests the mingled sublime and beautiful over the face of nature in this country which is sheltered from invaders by mountains and seas so as by a small degree of art to render it impregnable their desolating earthquakes which yet seem but to renovate fertility their volcanos sending forth volumes of flame and rivers of fire and overwhelming cities which though they have buried they have not utterly destroyed these and a thousand other particulars which i can neither enumerate nor remember apparently speak them a race the most favored of heaven and announce italy to be a country for whose embellishment and renown earth and heaven men and gods have for ages contended  the recollection of these things appears to be more vivid and to give me greater pleasure than i believe the sight of them afforded perhaps it is my temper impatient of delay i had scarcely glanced at one object before i was eager to hunt for another the tediousness of the ciceroni was to me intolerable what cannot instantly be comprehended i can scarcely persuade myself to think worthy of the trouble of enquiry i love to enjoy and if enjoyment do not come to me i must fly to seek it and hasten from object to object till it be overtaken  intellectual pleasures delight me when they are quick certain and easily obtained i leave those which i am told arise from patient study length of time and severe application to the fools who think time given to be so wasted roses grow for me to gather rivers roll for me to lave in let the slave dig the mine but for me let the diamond sparkle let the lamb the dove and the lifeloving eel writhe and die it shall not disturb me while i enjoy the viands the five senses are my deities to them i pay worship and adoration and never yet have i been slack in the performance of my duty  what shall we exist but for a few years and of those shall there be but a few hours as it were of youth joy and pleasure and shall we let them slip shall we cast away a good that never can return and seek for pain which is itself in so much haste to seek for us away with such folly the opposite system be mine  the voluptuous italian as wise in this as in other arts knows better he lives for the moment and takes care not to let the moment slip his very beggars basking in the sun will not remove so long as hunger will suffer them to enjoy the happiness of being idle who so perfectly understand the luxury of indolence as the lazaroni of naples  the italian indeed seems to exert all the craft for which he is so famous to accomplish this sole purpose of enjoyment he marries a wife and the handsomest he can procure that when the ardour of desire is satiated she may fleece some gallant who shall pay for his pleasures elsewhere and as variety is the object of all gallant succeeds to gallant while he himself flies from mistress to mistress and thus an equal barter is maintained  this office of cicisbeo is however an intolerably expensive one especially to our countrymen the signora is so inventive in her faculties there are so many trinkets which she dies to possess and her wants real and artificial are so numerous that the purse is never quiet in the pocket and every englishman is supposed to be furnished with the purse of fortunatus  the worst because the most dangerous part of the business is the ugly and the old think themselves entitled to be as amorous as the young and beautiful and a tall fellow with a little fresh blood in his veins is sure to have no peace for them prithee fairfax tell me how the contessa behaved when she found i had escaped from her amorous pursuit she began to make me uneasy and i almost thought it was as necessary for me to have a taster as any tyrant in christendom poison and the stiletto disturbed my dreams for there were not only she but two or three more who seemed determined to take no denial i congratulated myself as i was rolling down mount cenis to think that i was at length actually safe and that the damned blacklooking hooknosed scowling fellow from bergamo whom i had so often remarked dogging me was no longer at my heels  but i have now bidden adieu to the cassini the carnivali and the done and soon shall see what provision this land of france affords for the short time that i have been here i have no occasion to complain of my reception i do not know why fairfax but we englishmen seem to be in tolerably good repute every where with the ladies well well pretty dears they shall find me very much at their service i should be sorry to bring disgrace upon my nation fairfax would not you  i expect to find you a punctual correspondent fail not to let me know when weary of being a cavaliere servente you shall leave the proud banks of the adriatic and the wanton venice for some other abode that our letters may never miss their aim i will relate every thing that happens to me when it can either afford you amusement to read or me satisfaction to write you have too much honor and honesty not to do the same or if not i will try what a threat can do therefore remember that unless you fulfill the terms of our agreement and give me an account of all your rogueries adventures successes and hairbreadth escapes i will choose some other more punctual and more entertaining correspondent  observe further and let that be a spur to your industry i have a tale in petto a whimsical adventure which happened to me yesterday evening but which i shall forbear to regale you with for three substantial reasons first because it is my good pleasure secondly because i like it and lastly such is my sovereign will nay if that be all i can give you three more first because i am almost at the end of my paper next because i may want a good subject when i write again and finally because the post is a sturdy unceremonious fellow and does not think proper to wait my leisure  so farewell and believe me to be very sincerely yours  coke clifton p s i have this moment received information that sir arthur st ives and his daughter arrived yesterday in the afternoon at paris i have heard that the daughter is the most beautiful woman in england and that her wit is even superior to her beauty i am very glad of the accident for i have a great desire to see her my mothers last was partly a letter of business but chiefly of recommendation particularly of the young lady and in it was enclosed one from my sister louisa which gives a very high character of her friend anna st ives they have become acquainted since i have been abroad the letter is loaded with advice to me at which as you may well think i laugh these girls tied to their mothers apronstrings pretend to advise a man who has seen the world but vanity and conceit are strange propensities that totally blind the eyes of their possessors i have lived but little at home but i always thought the young lady a forward imperious miss yet i never before knew her so much on the stilts i expect she will soon put on boots and buckskin and horsewhip her fellows herself for she improves apace  once more farewell    letter xx anna wenbourne st ives to louisa clifton paris hotel despagne rue guenegaude fauxbourg st germain after abundance of jolting in carriages seasickness and such like trifling accidents incidental to us travelers here we are at last dear louisa my very first demand has been for pen ink and paper to inform my kind friend of our safe arrival though i am so giddy after this post haste four days hurry that i scarcely can write a straight line neither do i know whether i have any thing to say though i seemed to myself to have acquired an additional stock of ideas at the very moment that i first beheld calais and the coast of france  what is there my dear in the human mind that induces us to think every thing which is unusual is little less than absurd is it prejudice is it vanity or is it a short and imperfect view a want of discrimination i could have laughed but that i had some latent sense of my own folly at the sight of a dozen french men and women and two or three loitering monks whom curiosity had drawn together upon the pierhead to see us come into port and what was my incitement to laughter  it was the different cut of a coat it was a silk bag in which the hair was tied an old sword and a dangling pair of ruffles which none of them suited with the poverty of the dress and meagre appearance of a person who seemed to strut and value himself upon such marks of distinction  stern was in my pocket and his gentle spirit was present to my mind perhaps the person who thus excited a transient emotion of risibility was a nobleman for the extremes of riches and of poverty are as i have been informed very frequent among the nobility of france he might happen to think himself a man highly unfortunate and aggrieved the supposition occasioned my smile to evaporate in a sigh  but the houses  they were differently built  could that be right they were not so clean that was certainly wrong in what strange land is the standard of propriety erected  then the blue and brown jackets of the women their undaunted manner of staring their want of hats and stays the slovenly look of slippers not drawn up at the heel the clumsy wooden shoes of some and the bare feet of others nay their readiness to laugh at the uncouth appearance of the people who were condemning them for being ridiculous what could all this be but how came i so unaccountably to forget that children and beggars sometimes go barefoot in england and that few people perhaps are more addicted to stare and laugh at strangers than ourselves oh but the french are so polite a nation that even the common people are all well bred and would enter a drawing room with more ease and grace than an english gentleman  have you never heard this nonsense louisa  the character of nations or rather of mind is apparent in trifles granted let us turn our eyes back to the shores we have so lately left let us examine the trifles we hang about ourselves how many of them which characterize and as it were stamp the nation with absurdity escape unobserved we see them every day we have adopted and made them our own and we should be strangely offended should any person take the liberty having discovered the folly of them to laugh at us  i wrote thus far last night but learning on enquiry that tuesdays and fridays are foreign post days i left off being rather indisposed after my journey it is only a swimming in the head which will soon leave me though i find it has returned upon me occasionally all the morning but to my pleasing task again let me prattle to my friend  the innkeepers of calais come themselves or send their waiters to watch for and invite passengers to their houses and will not be dismissed without difficulty the most daring endeavor to secure customers by seizing on some of their trunks or baggage but we had determined to go to desseins and the active frank soon made way for us  i was amused with the handbill stuck up against the walls of this inn or hotel as it is called announcing it to be the largest the completest the most magnificent with a thousand et caeteras in the universe and recounting not only its numerous accommodations but the multifarious trades which it contained within its own walls to all which was added a playhouse a playhouse it is true there was but no players and as for trades there were at least as many as we wanted sir arthur took over his own carriage otherwise this first of inns in the universe would not have furnished him with one but on condition of its being purchased  sir arthur observed it was strange that the french innkeepers should not yet have discovered it to be their interest to keep carriages for travelers as in england to which frank henley shrewdly answered that the book of post roads in his hand informed him government was in reality every where the innkeeper and reserved to itself the profits of posting and the deepest thinkers added frank inform us that every thing in which governments interfere is spoiled i remarked to him that this principle would lead us a great way yes said he but not too far and playing upon my words added it would lead us back to the right way from which we appear at present to have strayed into the very labyrinth of folly and blunders  frank is earnestly studious of the effects of governments and laws and reads the authors who have written best on such subjects with great attention and pleasure he and sir arthur by no means agree in politics and sir arthur has two or three times been half affronted that a man so young and so inferior to himself as he supposes frank to be should venture to be of a different opinion and dispute with him who was once in his life too a member of parliament i am obliged now and then slily to remind him of the highwayman and turnham green  and now louisa traveller like could i regale you with a melancholy narrative relating how the fields in this country have no hedges how the cows are as meagre as their keepers how wretched the huts and their owners appear how french postillions jump in and out of jackboots with their shoes on because they are too heavy to drag after them how they harness their horses with ropes how dexterously they crack the merciless whips with which they belabour the poor hacks they drive how we were obliged to pay for five of these hacks having only four in our carriage and two of them frequently blind lame or useless with many other items that might be grievous to hear could i but persuade myself thoroughly to pity or be angry at the whole french nation for not exactly resembling the english but do they themselves complain mercy on us complain  nothing is so grateful to their hearts as the praise of that dear country which english travelers are so prone to despise  frank as usual has been all attention all ardour all anxiety to render our journey as pleasant as possible his efforts have been chiefly directed to me my ease my satisfaction my enjoyment have been his continual care not that he has neglected or overlooked sir arthur he overlooks no living creature to whom he can give aid he loses no opportunity of gaining the esteem and affection of high and low rich and poor his delicacy never slumbers his thirst of doing good is never assuaged i am young it is true but i never before met a youth so deserving think of him myself i must not though i would give kingdoms if i had them to see him completely happy  and now dear louisa i am soon to meet your brother why do i seem to recollect this with a kind of agitation is there rebellion in my heart would it swerve from the severe dictates of duty no i will set too strict a watch over its emotions what does not louisa honor me with the title of friend and shall i prove unworthy of her friendship forbid it emulation truth and virtue  how happy should i be were your brother and frank henley to conceive an immediate partiality for each other how much too would it promote the project i wish to execute i have been taxing my invention to sorm some little plot for this purpose but i find it barren i can do nothing but determine to speak of frank as he deserves which surely will gain him the love of the whole world and for his part i know how ready he will be to give merit its due  i have more than once purposely mentioned your brothers name to sir arthur when frank was present in some manner to prepare and guard him against surprise but i could not but remark my hints had an effect upon him that betrayed how much his heart was alarmed he thinks too favorably and i fear too frequently of me what can be done the wisest of us are the slaves of circumstances and of the prejudices of others how many excellent qualities are met in him and for these to be rejected  alas  we must patiently submit to the awful laws of necessity  neither is sir arthur without his fears and suspicions his discourse betrays his alarms he cannot conceive that a love of the merits of frank can be distinct from all love of his person the crime of disobedience in children the ruin of families by foolish and unequal marriages and the wretchedness which is the result of such guilty conduct have been hinted at more than once lately and though not with many words yet with a degree of anxiety that gave me pain for it taught me being suspected half to suspect myself  but i must conclude my traveling vertigo i find is not immediately to be shaken off i imagine that a few hours calm sleep will be my best physician adieu i shall wait with some impatience for a letter from my dear louisa  a w st ives  letter xxi frank henley to oliver trenchard paris hotel despagne rue guenegaude fauxbourg st germain my emotions oliver are too strong to permit me to narrate common occurrences i can only tell thee our journey is ended that we arrived yesterday and that we are now at paris my feelings are more tumultuous than they ought to be and seek relief in the mild and listening patience of friendship  first however i must relate a singular adventure which happened yesterday evening  after i had seen our baggage properly disposed of curiosity led me though night was approaching to walk out and take a view of the famous facade of the louvre from thence i strayed through the gardens of the thuilleries to the place de louis xv being delighted with the beauties around me but which i have not now time to describe a little farther are the champs elysees where trees planted in quincunx afford a tolerably agreeable retreat to the parisians  it was now twilight the idlers had retired for i suppose from what followed that it is not very safe to walk after dark in these environs ignorant of this and not apprehensive of any danger i had strayed to a considerable distance among the trees against one of which i stood leaning and contemplating the banks of the seine the palais bourbon and other surrounding objects all was silent except the distant hum of the city and the rattling of carriages which could but just be heard  amid this calm i was suddenly alarmed by voices in anger and approaching they spoke in french and presently became more distinct and loud  draw sir said one  mort de ma vie come along answered the other  draw sir i say replied the first i neither know who you are nor what your intentions may be i will go no further draw  sacristi answered his antagonist we shall be interrupted the guard will be upon us in a moment  the first however was resolute and in an imperious voice again bade him draw their swords were instantly out and they began to assault each other thou may imagine oliver i would not cowardly stand and be a spectator of murder they were not twenty paces from me i flew when to my great surprise one of them called in english keep off sir who are you keep off and his enemy having dropped his guard he presented his point to me  it was no time to hesitate i rushed resolutely between them holding up my open hands above my head to show the englishman who seemed apprehensive of a conspiracy he had nothing to fear from me his anger almost overcame him he held up his sword as if to strike with it and with great haughtiness and passion again bade me begone have patience sir answered i men shall not assassinate each other if i can prevent it  let us retire said the frenchman i knew we should be interrupted  you shall not fight i will follow you added i will call for help  you are a damned impertinent fellow said the englishman  be it so but you shall not fight was my answer  the combatants finding me so determined put up their swords and mutually exchanged their address after which they separated so that it is probable oliver my interference has done no good but that i must leave to chance i could not act otherwise  this incident so immediately after my arrival in a place so strange to me and coming so suddenly made too great an impression upon me not to tell it thee though i have another topic much nearer my heart the true state of which has been shown me by an event of which i will now inform thee  we are lodged here in the first floor consisting of many chambers each of which is a thoroughfare to the most distant it is not ten minutes since i was seated and preparing to write to thee when anna came to pass through the room where i was and retire to her own apartment she was fatigued i imagine by the journey though i frequently fear the ardour of her mind will injure her constitution she walked with some difficulty was evidently giddy and staggered i was alarmed and was rising when she called to me faintly  help me frank  i sprung and caught her as she was falling i received her in my arms and my agitation was so violent that it was with difficulty i could preserve strength enough to support her and seat her in the chair i had quitted  the house to me was a kind of wilderness i knew not where to run yet run i did for water i called laura with a latent wish that nobody might help her but myself and as it happened nobody heard i returned she recovered thanked me with her usual heavenly kindness and i conducted her to her apartment she leaning on my arm  oh oliver is it wrong to feel what i feel at the remembrance if it be reprove me sternly teach me my duty and i will thank thee surely there is something supernatural hovers over her at least she resembles no other mortal then her kindness to me her looks her smiles her actions are all intentional benignancy she is now but three chambers distant from me enjoying as i hope refreshing slumbers angels guard her and inspire her dreams no matter for the nonsense of my words oliver thou know my meaning she desired me to bid laura not disturb her and here i sit watchful of my precious charge grateful heartsoothing office  and now oliver what am i to think my fears would tie my tongue but either i am deluded or hope brightens upon me and i want the selfdenying resolution of silence yes oliver i must repeat there is such sweetness in her countenance when she speaks to me such a smile so inviting so affirmative that i am incessantly flattering myself it cannot but have a meaning i have several times lately heard her sigh and once so emphatically that i think it impossible i should be deceived i and sir arthur were conversing i was endeavoring to show the pernicious tendency of the prejudices of mankind and inadvertently touched upon the absurdity of supposing there could be any superiority of man over man except that which genius and virtue gave sir arthur did not approve the doctrine and was pettish i perhaps was warmed by a latent sense of my own situation and exclaimed  oh how many noble hearts are groaning at this instant under the oppression of these prejudices hearts that groan not because they suffer but because they are denied the power effectually to aid their very oppressors who exert the despotism of numbers to enforce claims which they themselves feel to be unjust but which they think it dishonorable to relinquish  it was then the sigh burst forth of which i told thee i turned and found her eyes fixed upon me she blushed and looked down and then again bent them toward me i was heated and daring we exchanged looks and said  volumes could not repeat how much  but surely neither of us said any thing to the others disadvantage  oh the bliss to perceive myself understood and not reproved to meet such emanations of mind  ecstasy is a poor word once more she seemed to repeat  she would love me if i would let her  tell me then  have i not reason on my side and if i have will she not listen may she not be won shall i doubt of victory fighting under the banners of truth alas  well well   my own sensations oliver are so acute and i am so fearful lest they should lead me astray that i could not forbear this detail  let us change the theme  well here we are in france and wonderful to tell france is not england  i imagine it is impossible to travel through a foreign country without falling into certain reveries and that each man will fashion his dreams in part from accident and in part according to the manner in which he has been accustomed to ruminate thy most excellent father oliver early turned my mind to the consideration of forms of government and their effects upon the manners and morals of men the subject in his estimation is the most noble that comes under our cognizance and the more i think myself capable of examining and the more i actually do examine the more i am a convert to his opinion how often has it been said of france by various english philosophers and by many of its own sages what a happy country would this be were it well governed but with equal truth the same may be said of every country under heaven england itself oliver in spite of our partialities not excepted  how false how futile how absurd is the remark that a despotic government under a perfect monarch would be the state of highest felicity first an impossible thing is asked and next impossible consequences deduced one tyrant generates a nation of tyrants his own mistakes communicate themselves east west north and south and what appeared to be but a spark becomes a conflagration  how inconsistent are the demands and complaints of ignorance it wishes to tyrannize yet exclaims against tyranny it grasps at wealth and pants after power yet clamours aloud against the powerful and the wealthy it hourly starts out into all the insolence of pride yet hates and endeavors to spurn at the proud  among the many who have a vague kind of suspicion that things might be better are mingled a few who seem very desirous they should remain as they are these are the rich who having by extortion and rapine plundered the defenseless and heaped up choice of viands and the fat of the land some sufficient to feed ten some twenty some a hundred some a thousand and others whole armies and being themselves each only able to eat for one say to the hungry who have no food  come dance for my sport and i will give you bread lick the dust off my shoes and you shall be indulged with a morsel of meat flatter me and you shall wear my livery labor for me and i will return you a tenth of your gain shed your blood in my behalf and while you are young and robust i will allow you just as much as will keep life and soul together when you are old and worn out you may rob hang rot or starve  would not any one imagine oliver that this were poetry alas it is mere literal matter of fact  yet let us not complain men begin to reason and to think aloud and these things cannot always endure  i intended to have made some observations on the people the aspect of the country and other trifles i scarcely now know what but i have wandered into a subject so vast so interesting so sublime that all petty individual remarks sink before it nor will i for the present blur the majesty of the picture by illplaced mean and discordant objects therefore farewell  f henley p s examine all i have said and what i am going to add relative to myself with severity mine is a state of mind in which the jealous rigor of friendship appears to be essentially necessary i have been seized with i know not what apprehensions by some hints which she has two or three times lately repeated concerning the brother of her dear and worthy friend louisa who it seems is to give us the meeting at paris is it not ominous at least the manner in which she introduced the subject and spoke of him as well as the replies of sir arthur were all of evil augury yet why torment myself with imaginary terrors should the brother resemble the friend  well what if he should would it grieve me to find another man of virtue and genius because it is possible my personal interest might be affected by the discovery no my mind has still strength sufficient to reject nay to contemn so unworthy a thought but he may be something very different love her he must all who behold her love the few words she has occasionally dropped have led me to suspect more was meant than met the ear whenever this chord is touched my heart instantly becomes tremulous and with sensibility so painful as fully to lay open its weakness against which i must carefully and resolutely guard it is these incongruous these jarring tokens that engender doubt and suspense almost insupportable    letter xxii anna wenbourne st ives to louisa clifton paris hotel despagne rue guenegaude fauxbourg st germain the oddest and most unlucky accident imaginable louisa has happened your brother and frank have unfortunately half quarrelled without knowing each other i mentioned a giddiness with which i was seized the consequence as i suppose of traveling i was obliged to retire to my chamber nay should have fallen as i went but for frank i desired he would tell laura not to disturb me and he it seems planted himself sentinel with a determination that neither laura nor any other person should approach i am too often in his thoughts he is wrong to bestow so much of his time and attention on me sir arthur was gone to look about him having first sent a note unknown to me to inform your brother of our arrival and requesting to see him as soon as convenient  away hurried your brother at this mal apropos interval with sir arthurs note in his pocket to our hotel he enquired for my father  he was gone out  for me  laura answered she would call me  she was running with great haste for this purpose but was intercepted by frank who agreeably to my desire would not suffer her to proceed she returned and your brother referring again to sir arthurs note was much surprised and rather vexed  he asked by whose order she was sent back  she answered by the order of mr frank  who was mr frank  a young gentleman laura has repeated all that passed the son of mr aby henley  and who was mr aby henley  the steward and gardener of sir arthur his head man  steward and gardener the son of a gardener a gentleman  yes sir to be sure sir among thorough bred quality though perhaps he may be better than the best of them he is thought no better than a kind of a sort of a gentleman being not so high born  well said your brother show me to this son of mr aby this peremptory gentleman or as you call him kind of a sort of a gentleman  laura obeyed and she says they were quite surprised at the sight of each other but that i suppose to be one of the flourishes of her fancy your brother however as i understand desired with some haughtiness that frank would suffer the maid to pass and inform me he was come agreeably to sir arthurs request to pay his respects to me frank resolutely refused alleging i was not well not well said your brother is not this sir arthurs handwriting yes replied frank but i assure you she is not well and i am afraid that even our speaking may awaken her if she should chance to be asleep i must therefore request sir you would retire  the oddness of the circumstances and the positiveness of frank displeased your brother sir arthur happened to return and he went to him scarcely taking time for first compliments but asking whether it were true that i was not well sir arthur was surprised he knew nothing of it i had not thought a giddiness in the head worth a complaint laura was again sent to tell me and was again denied admittance sir arthur then with your brother came to question frank who continued firm in his refusal and when sir arthur and your brother had heard that i was so dizzy as to be in danger of falling had not he supported me they were satisfied but such a meeting between frank and your brother was quite vexatious when the very reverse too was wished however he is to visit us this morning and i will then endeavor to do justice to the worth of frank and remove false impressions which i have some reason to fear have been made  i will pause here but if i find an opportunity will write another short letter under the same cover by this post that is should i happen to have any thing more to say  this accident was exceedingly unlucky and i seem as if i felt myself to blame especially as i am quite in spirits this morning and relieved from my giddy sensations i am sorry very sorry but it cannot be helped  a w st ives  letter xxiii coke clifton to guy fairfax paris hotel de luniversite pres le pont royal it was well i did not tell my tale in my last fairfax it would have been spoiled i knew it only by halves it has ended in the most singular combination of circumstances one could well imagine  you remember i told you of the arrival of sir arthur st ives and his daughter i believe it was in the postscript and that i was immediately going to  pshaw i am beginning my story now at the wrong end it is throughout exceedingly whimsical listen and let amazement prop your open mouth  you must have observed the ease with which frenchmen though perfect strangers to each other fall into familiar conversation and become as intimate in a quarter of an hour as if they had been acquainted their whole lives this is a custom which i very much approve but like all other good things it is liable to abuse  the other day i happened to be taking a walk on the boulevards it being a church festival purposely to see the good parisians in all their gaiety and glory and a more cheerful at least a more noisy people do not i believe exist as i was standing to admire a waxwork exhibition of all the famous highwaymen and cutthroats whose histories are most renowned in france and listening to the fellow at the door bawling  aux voleurs aux grands voleurs  not a little amused with the murderous looks darkness dungeons chains and petty horror which they had micmicked a man uncommonly welldressed with an elegant person and pleasing manners came up and immediately fell into discourse with me i encouraged him because he pleased me we walked together and had not conversed five minutes before without seeming to seek an opportunity he had informed me that he was the marquis de passy and that he had left his carriage and attendants because he like me took much pleasure in observing the hilarity of the holiday citizens he had accosted me he said because he had a peculiar esteem for the english of which nation he knew me to be by my step and behavior  we talked some time and though he made no deep remarks he was very communicative of anecdotes which had come within his own knowledge that painted the manners of the nation among other things he told me it was not uncommon for valets to dress themselves in their masters clothes when they supposed them to be at a distance or otherwise engaged assume their titles and pass themselves upon the bourgeoisie and foreigners for counts dukes or princes it was but this day fortnight said he that the marechal de r  surprised one of his servants in a similar disguise and with some jocularity publicly ordered the fellow to walk at his heels then went to his carriage and commanded him full dressed as he was to get up behind  he had scarcely ended this account before another person came up and with an air of some authority asked him where his master was what he did there and other questions  to all this my quidam acquaintance with a degree of surprise that seemed to be tempered with the most pleasing and unaffected urbanity replied without being in the least disconcerted sir you mistake me but i am sure you are too much of a gentleman to mean any wilful affront  affront why whom do you pretend yourself to be sir  sir i am the marquis de passy  you the marquis de passy   yes sir i   insolent scoundrel   no gentleman sir can suffer such language and i insist upon satisfaction  and accordingly my champion drew his sword his antagonist looking on him with ineffable contempt answered he would take some proper opportunity to cane him as he deserved  i own i was amazed i reasoned a short time with myself and concluded the person was mistaken for that it was impossible for any man to counterfeit so much ease or behave with so much propriety who was not a gentleman i therefore thought proper to interfere and told the intruder that having given an insult he ought not to be afraid of giving satisfaction   and pray sir said he who are you  a gentleman sir answered i   yes as good a one as your companion i suppose   you know fairfax it is not customary with me to suffer insolence to triumph unchastised and i ordered him immediately to draw  what sir in this place said he follow me if you have any valor to spare  his spirit pleased me and i followed i know not what became of the fellow whose cause i had espoused for i saw him no more  my antagonist led me across the rue st honor to a place which i suppose you know called the elysian fields it began to be late and i am told there is danger in passing the precincts of the guard i apprehended a conspiracy and at last refused to proceed any farther finding me obstinate he drew but said we should be interrupted  he was no false prophet for we had not made half a dozen passes before a youth whom from his boots and appearance i supposed to be english came running and vociferating  forbear i was not quite certain that his appearance might not be artifice i therefore accosted him in english in which language he very readily replied he was quite a sturdy dauntless gentleman for though our swords were drawn and both of us sufficiently angry he resolutely placed himself between us declaring we should not fight and that if we went farther he would follow  nothing was to be done and i now began to suspect the person with whom i had this ridiculous quarrel to be really a gentleman i gave him my address and he readily returned his after which we parted he singing a french song and i cursing the insolence of the english youth who seemed to disregard my anger and to be happy that he had prevented the spilling of blood  remember that all this happened on the preceding evening after i had written the greatest part of my last long letter the next morning i finished it and received a note from sir arthur st ives as i mentioned  as soon as i could get dressed i hastened away and arriving at the hotel enquired for the knight  he was gone out  for his daughter   she had retired to her apartment  i sent in my name the maid went and returned with an answer that mr frank did not think it proper for her mistress to be disturbed now fairfax guess who mr frank was if you can by heaven it was the very individual youth who the night before had been so absolute in putting an end to our duel  i was planetstruck nor was his surprise less when he saw me and heard my errand and my name  i found my gentleman as positive in the morning as in the evening he was the dragon touch the fruit who dared jason himself could not have entrance there and he was no less cool than determined i was almost tempted to toss him out of the window  however i am glad i contained myself for on the entrance of sir arthur we came to an explanation and i find the young lady was really indisposed but considering his mongrel birth and breeding for he is the son of a gardener i really never saw a fellow give himself such high airs  sir arthur received me with great civility i have not yet seen the daughter but i expect to find her a beauty she is the toast of the county where her father resides i am to be with her in half an hour and as i suppose i shall be fully engaged with this and other affairs for some days i shall seal up my letter you must therefore wait for an account of her till inclination and the full tide of events shall induce me again to indite of great matters  i shall direct this agreeably to your last to your bankers in parma do not fail to tell me when you shall be at turin  yours very sincerely c clifton p s my opponent of the elysian fields has just paid me a visit he is a man of family seems to be of a flighty pleasant humor and acknowledged that what he had heard convinced him he had mistaken my character for which he was very ready either to cut my throat or ask my pardon his ease and good temper spoke much in his favor and i laughed and answered in mercy to my throat i would accept his apology in consideration of which we are to cultivate an acquaintance and be sworn friends    letter xxiv anna wenbourne st ives to louisa clifton paris hotel despagne rue guenegaude fauxbourg st germain i return eagerly to my louisa mr clifton my dear has this instant left us i give you joy yes he is the brother of my friend i do not say he is her equal though i am not quite sure that he is her inferior he is all animation all life his person is graceful his manners pleasing and his mind vigorous i can say but little from so short an acquaintance except that i am convinced his virtues or his errors if he have any and who is without are not of the feeble kind they are not characterised by dull mediocrity which of all qualities is the most hopeless and incapable he gave his earnest desire to see me when he was refused by frank the air of a handsome compliment politely accusing himself of improper impatience when he was in expectation of what he was pleased to call an uncommon pleasure though it was our first interview he felt no restraint but said many very civil things naturally and with an exceedingly good grace  i purposely turned the conversation on frank related some anecdotes of him and bestowed praise which was confirmed by sir arthur your brother whose imagination is warm and active called him a trusty cerberus and said he had a mouth to answer each of the three meaning laura himself and sir arthur various remarks which escaped him show that he has a fondness for pleasant satire and similes of humor  he praised frank after hearing our account of him but his praise was qualified with the word obstinacy there was an appearance of feeling that the gentleman ought not to have been so sternly repulsed by the son of a steward  and was this his kindred equality to my friend  forgive me louisa  it was unjust in me to say i was not quite sure he is your inferior  however i can very seriously assure you he is not one of your every day folks  frank came in and your brother addressed him with good humor but in a tone denoting it was the gentleman to the sort of a gentleman i own it pleased me to observe the ease with which frank by his answers obliged mr clifton to change his key but i soon had occasion to observe that the warmth of your brothers expressions his eagerness to be immediately intimate with us and the advances which he with so little sense of embarrassment made to me had an effect upon frank which i greatly fear was painful i must look to this it is a serious moment and i must seriously examine and quickly resolve in the mean time your brother has kindly insisted upon devoting himself wholly to our amusements to attend on us and show us the public buildings gardens paintings and theaters as well as to introduce us to all his friends  and what must we do in return for this wellmeant kindness must we not endeavor to weed out those few errors for few i hope they are which impoverish a mind in itself apparently fertile and of high rank  yes it instantly suggested itself to me as an indispensable act of duty  the attempt must be made  with what obstinate warfare do men encounter peril when money base money is their proposed reward and shall we do less for mind eternal omnipotent mind  he is returned adieu you shall soon hear again from your  a w st ives  letter xxv coke clifton to his sister louisa clifton paris hotel de luniversite pres le pont royal i write agreeably to your desire sister to thank you for all obligations not forgetting your advice not but i am excessively obliged to you i am upon my soul and seriously for having done me the favor to bring me acquainted with your charming friend i have seen many women and in many countries but i never beheld one so sweet so beautiful so captivating i had heard of her before i left england her fame had reached italy and your letters had raised my expectations but what were these the accomplishments and graces of her person the variety the pleasure inspiring heaven of her countenance the cupids that wanton in her dimples and the delights that swim and glisten in her eyes are each and all exquisite beyond imagination  whatever you may think of me louisa i do persuade myself i know something of women i have studied them at home and abroad and have often probed them to the soul but i never before met with any one in the least comparable to the divine anna she is so unreserved so open that her soul seems to dwell upon her lips yet her thoughts are so rapid and her mind so capacious that i am persuaded it will cost me much longer time to know her well than any other woman with whom i ever met  having thanked you very heartily and sincerely for this favor i shall just say a word or two in answer to yours  and so you really think you have some morality on hand a little stale or so but still sound which you can bestow with advantage upon me you imagine you can tell me something i never heard before now have you sincerely so much vanity louisa be frank you acknowledge i have crossed rivers seas and mountains but you are afraid i have shut my eyes all the time a loud tongue and a prodigious lack of wit antics and impertinences of young men of fashion really my dear you are choice in your phrases you could not love your brother for any recital of the delight which foreign ladies took in him and which he took in foreign ladies but you could be in ecstatics for a brother of your own invention  do not suppose i am angry no no my dear girl i am got far above all that though i cannot but laugh at this extraordinary brother which you are fashioning for yourself if when i come into your sublime presence i should by good luck happen to strike your fancy why so my fortune will then be made if not sister we must do as well as we can all in good time and a gods name is not that tolerable worcestershire morality  i am obliged to lay down my pen with laughing at the idea of miss louisas brother supposing him to be exactly of her modelling i think i see him appear before her she seated in state on a chair raised on four tressels and two old doors like a strolling actress mimicking a queen in a barn he dressed in black his hair smugly curled his face and his shoes shining his white handkerchief in his right hand a prayer book or the morals of epictetus in his left not interlarding his discourse with french or italian phrases but ready with a good rumbling mouthful of old greek which he had composed i mean compiled for the purpose then having advanced one leg wiped his mouth put his left hand in his breeches pocket clenched his right and raised his arm he begins his learned dissertation on well digested principles ardent desire of truth incessant struggles to shake off prejudices and forth are chanted in nasal twang and tragic recitative his emanations of soul bursts of thought and flashes of genius  but you would not be satirical gentle modest maiden and surely it becomes the tutored brother to imitate this kind forbearance my faculties were always lively and i must pardon you if you expect too much  upon my soul this is highly comic expect too much and there is danger then that i should not equal your expectations  prithee my good girl jingle the keys of your harpsichord and be quiet pore over your fine folio receipt book and appease your thirst after knowledge satisfy your longing desire to do good by making jellies conserves and caraway cakes pot pippins brew rasberry wine and candy orange chips study burns bruises and balsams distill surfeit colic and wormwood water concoct hiera picra rhubarb beer and oil of charity and sympathize over sprains whitloes and broken shins get a charm to cure the ague and render yourself renowned spin sew and knit collect your lamentable rabble around you dole out your charities listen to a full chorus of blessings and take your seat among the saints  you see child i can give advice as well as yourself aye and i will bestow it most plentifully if you happen to feel any desire after more i hate to be ungrateful you shall have no opportunity to utter your musty maxim upon me  that the sin of ingratitude is worse than the sin of witchcraft you shall have weight for weight measure for measure chicken aye my market woman and a lumping pennyworth brotherly for sisterly effusions  as for the right of eldership i recollect that a dozen years ago i envied you the prerogative but now you are welcome to it with all my heart if among your miraculous acquirements you have any secret to make time stand still by which you can teach me to remain at sweet fiveandtwenty and if you will disclose it to me i will not only pardon all your impertinences as you so pertinently call them but do any other thing in reason to satisfy you except turn philosopher and feed upon carrots nay i will allow you to grow as old as you please you shall have full enjoyment of the rights of eldership  in the mean time sister i once more thank you for bringing me acquainted with your friend you seem to have put powder in her drink and i freely tell you i wish she loved me half as well as she professes to love her immaculate louisa but these i suppose are the flashes of genius which you have taught her however she is an angel and in her every thing is graceful  as for your other prodigy i scarcely know what to make of him except that he seems to have quite conceit enough of himself every other sentence is a contradiction of what the last speaker advanced this is the first time he ever ventured to cross his fathers threshold and yet he talks as familiarly of kingdoms governments nations manners and other high sounding phrases as if he had been secretary of state to king minos had ridden upon the white elephant and studied under the dalai lama he is the great mogul of politicians and as for letters science and talents he holds them all by patent right he is such a monopolizer that no man else can get a morsel if he were not a plebeian i could most sincerely wish you were married to him for then whenever my soul should hunger and thirst after morality i should know where to come and get a full meal though perhaps his not being a gentleman would be no objection to you atleast your letter leads me to suspect as much  do not however mistake me i mean this jocularly for i will not degrade my sister so much as to suppose she has ever cast a thought on the son either of the gardener or the steward of any man though tied to her mothers apronstring and shut up on the confines of worcestershire she may think proper to lecture and give rules of conduct to a brother who has seen the world and studied both men and books of every kind that is but a harmless and pardonable piece of vanity it ought to be laughed at and for that reason i have laughed  for the rest i will be willing to think as well of my sister as this sister can be to think of her catechized and very patient humble younger brother  c clifton p s i have written in answer to my mother by the same post from the general tenor of her letter i cannot but imagine that just before she sat down to write she had been listening to one of your civil lectures against wild brothers fine gentlemen and vile rakes is not that the cant one thing let me whisper to you sister i am not obliged to any person who suspects or renders me suspected i claim the privilege of being seen before i am condemned and heard before i am executed if i should not prove to be quite the phoenix which might vie with so miraculous so unique a sister i must then be contented to take shame to myself but till then i should suppose the thoughts of a sister might as well be inclined to paint me white as black after all i cannot conclude without repeating that i believe the whole world cannot equal the lovely the divine anna st ives and whatever else you may say or think of me do not lead her to imagine i am unjust to her supreme beauty and charms an insinuation of that kind i would never forgive  never    letter xxvi sir arthur st ives to abimelech henley paris hotel despagne rue guenegaude fauxbourg st germain you cannot imagine honest aby the surprise i am in is this their famous france is this the finest country in the whole world why aby from boulogne to paris at least from montreuil i am certain i did not see a single hedge all one dead flat with an eternal row of trees without beginning middle or end i sincerely believe aby i shall never love a straight row of trees again and the wearisome right lined road that you never lose sight of not for a moment aby no lucky turning no intervening hill  oh that i were but the grand monarch what improvements would i make what a scope for invention aby a kingdom a revenue of four hundred millions of livres and a standing army of three hundred thousand men all which if the king were a wise man it is very evident abimelech he might employ in improvements and heaven knows there is a want of them what are their petty corvees by which these straight roads have been patched up and their everlasting elms planted i would assemble all my vassals  your son frank aby has given me much information concerning the present governments of europe and the origin of manors fiefs and lordships i can assure you he is a very deep young man though i could wish he were not quite so peremptory and positive and has informed me of some things which i never heard of before though i am twice his age but he seems to have them so fast at his fingers ends that i suppose they must be true i had often heard of entails and mortmain and lands held in fee or fief i dont know which and all that you know abimelech ones deeds and ones lawyers tell one something blindly of these matters but i never knew how it had all happened he told me that  fgad i forget what he told me but i know he made it all out very clear still i must say he is cursed positive  however aby as i was saying i would assemble all my vassals all my great lords and fief holders and they should assemble their vassals and all hands should be set to work some to plan others to plant some to grub some to dig some to hoe and some to sow the whole country should soon be a garden tell me aby is not the project a grand one the plan is in reality much grander than the good knight suspected if embraced at the will of a nation instead of at the will of an individual  what a dispatch of work what a change of nature i am ravished with the thought  as for any ideas of improvement to be picked up here abimelech they must not be expected i shall never forget the sameness of the scene so unlike the riches of wenbournehill sir alexander would have a country open enough here at least he would not complain of being shut in the wind may blow from what point it pleases and you have it on all sides except the roadside elms i mentioned and now and then a coppice which places they tell me are planted for the preservation of the game i should have supposed there had not been a tree in the country had i not been told that there were many large forests to the right and the left out of sight for my part i dont know where they have hidden them and so must take their word for the fact it is true indeed that we traveled a part of the way in the dark  i was mentioning the game aby the game laws here are excellently put in execution hares are as plenty as rabbits in a warren partridges as tame as our dovehouse pigeons and pheasants that seem as if they would come and feed out of your hand for no scoundrel poacher dare molest them if he did i am not certain whether the lord of the manor could not hang him up instantly without judge or jury  though frank tells me they have no juries here which by the bye is odd enough and as he says i suppose it is a great shame for as he put the case to me how should i like to have my estate seized on by some insolent prince or duke for you know i being a baronet in my own right aby no one less in rank would dare infringe upon me well how should i like to have this duke or this prince seize upon my estate and instead of having my right tried by a special jury of my peers to have the cause decided by him who can get the prettiest woman to plead for him and who will pay her and his judges the best for such frank assures me is the mode here now really all this is very bad very bad indeed and as he says wants reforming  but as for the game laws as i was saying aby they are excellently enforced and your poor rascals here are kept in very proper subjection they are held to the grindstone as i may say and so they ought to be aby for i have often heard you say what is a man but what he is worth which in certain respects is very true a gentleman of family and fortune why he is a gentleman and no insolent beggar ought to dare to look him in the face without his permission but you aby had always a very great sense of propriety in these respects and you have found your advantage in it as indeed you ought it is a pity considering what a learned young man you have made your son that you did not teach him a little of your good sense in this particular he is too full of contradiction too confident by half  let me have a long and full and whole account of what you are doing aby tell me precisely how forward your work is and the exact spot where you are when each letter comes away i know i need not caution you to keep those idle fellows the day laborers to it i never knew any man who worked them better and yet aby it is surprising the sums that they have cost me but you are a very careful honest fellow and they have done wonders under my planning and your inspection  i do not wish that the moment i receive a letter it should be known to every lacquey especially here where it seems to be one entire city of babblers the people appear to have nothing to do but to talk in the house in the street in the fields breakfast dinner and supper walking sitting or standing they are never silent nay egad i doubt whether they do not talk in their sleep so do you direct to me at the cafe conti  however i had better write the direction for you at full length for fear of a mistake and be sure you take care of your spelling aby or i dont know what may happen for i am told that many of these french people are devilish illiterate and i am sure they are devilish cunning snap they answer before they hear you and what is odd enough their answers are sometimes as pat as if they knew your meaning indeed i have often thought it strange that your low poor people should be so acute and have so much common sense but do you direct your letters thus  a monsieur monsieur le chevalier de st ives baronet anglois au cafe conti visavis le pont neuf quai conti a paris  and so abimelech i remain  a st ives  letter xxvii frank henley to oliver trenchard paris hotel despagne rue guenegaude fauxbourg st germain the black forebodings of my mind oliver are fulfilled i have been struck the phantom i dreaded has appeared has flashed upon me and all the evils of which i prophesied and more than all are collecting to overwhelm me are rushing to my ruin  this brother of louisa nothing surely was ever so unaccountable the very same whom i prevented from fighting in the champs elysees ay he this identical clifton for clifton it was has again appeared has been here is here is never hence his aspect was petrifying he came upon me this second time in the strangest the most insolent manner imaginable just as i had sent away my last letter to thee when i was sitting the guardian of a treasure which my fond false reveries were at that moment flattering me might one day be mine starting at the sight of me nothing kind nothing conciliating in his address it was all imperious demand who was i by what right did i deny admission to the young ladys woman to inform her he was come to pay her his respects he  having a letter from sir arthur inviting him thither  were such orders to be countermanded by me again and again who was i  oliver he is a haughty youth violent headstrong and arrogant believe me he will be found so  what do i mean why do i dread him how the slave of fear why is my heart so inclined to think ill of him do i seek to depreciate she has mentioned him several times has expected with a kind of eagerness he would resemble her louisa has hoped he and i should be friends did not i hope the same oliver she has tortured me all benevolence as she is she has put me on the rack  i must not yield thus to passion it is criminal i have too much indulged the flattering dreams of desire yet what to do  how to act  must i tamely quit the field the moment an adversary appears turn recreant to myself and cowardlike give up my claims without daring to say such and such they are no justice is due as much to myself as to any other if he be truly deserving of preference why let him be preferred i will rejoice  yes oliver will  he who is the slave of passion is unworthy a place in the noble mind of anna  but this man is not my superior i feel oliver he is not and it becomes me to assert my rights nay his pride acts as a provocative  oliver i perceive how wrong this is but i will not blot out the line let it remain as a memento he that would correct his failings must be willing to detect them  the anxiety of my mind is excessive and the pain which a conviction of the weakness and error that this anxiety occasions renders it still more insupportable i must take myself to task ay and severely i must enquire into the wrong and the right and reason must be absolute tell me thy thoughts plainly and honestly be sure thou do for i sometimes suspect thee of too much kindness of partiality to thy friend chastise the derelictions of my heart whenever thou perceivest them or i myself shall hereafter become thy accuser i am dissatisfied oliver what surer token can there be that i am wrong i weary thee  prithee forgive but do not forget to aid me  f henley p s he  i mean louisas brother for i think only of one he and one she at present he has not yet taken any notice of our strange first meeting and thou may imagine oliver if he think fit to be silent i shall not speak not that it can be supposed he holds duelling to be disgraceful i have enquired if any rencounter had taken place for i was very apprehensive that the champions would have their tiltingmatch another time however as i can hear of no such accident and as mr clifton is here continually i hope i have been instrumental in preventing such absurd guilt the follies of men are scarcely comprehensible and what am i dare i think myself wise oliver my passions are in arms the contest is violent i call on thee to examine and to aid the cause of truth    letter xxviii coke clifton to guy fairfax paris hotel de luniversite i have found it fairfax the pearl of pearls the inestimable jewel the unique the world contains but one  and what  a woman the woman of whom i told you  anna st ives  you have seen the venus de medicis  pshaw  stone inanimate marble but she  the very sight of her is the height of luxury the pure blood is seen to circulate transparent is the complexion which it illuminates  and for symmetry for motion for grace sculptor painter nor poet ever yet imagined such desire languishes to behold her the passions all are in arms and the mere enjoyment of her presence is superior to all that her sex beside can give  do not suppose me in my altitudes all i can say all you can imagine are far short of the reality  then how unlike is her candor to the petty arts the shallow cunning of her sex her heart is as open as her countenance her thoughts flow fearless to her lips original ideas expressed in words so select phrases so happy as to astonish and delight a brilliancy and a strength of fancy that disdain limitation and wit rapid and fatal as lightning to all opposition these and a thousand other undescribable excellencies are hers  i love her  love  i adore her ay  be not surprised  even to madness and marriage  no matter for what i have beforetime said or what i have thought my mind is changed i have discovered perfection which i did not imagine could exist i renounce my former opinions which applied to the sex in general were orthodox but to her were blasphemy  i would not be too sudden i have not yet made any direct proposal but could i exist and forbear giving intimations no and how were they received why with all that unaffected frankness which did not pretend to misunderstand but to meet them to cherish hope and to give a prospect of bliss which mortal man can never merit  she is all benevolence nay she is too much so there is that youngster here that upstart he who bolted upon us and mouthed his pindarics in the elysian fields the surly groom of the chamber this fellow has insinuated himself into her favor and the benignity of her soul induces her to treat him with as much respect as if he were a gentleman  the youth has some parts some ideas at least he has plenty of words but his arrogance is insufferable he does not seruple to interfere in the discourse either with me sir arthur or the angelic anna nay sets up for a reformer and pretends to an insolent superiority of understanding and wisdom yet he was never so long from home before in his life has seen nothing but has read a few books and has been permitted to converse with this all intelligent deity  i cannot deny but that the pedagogue sometimes surprises me with the novelty of his opinions but they are extravagant i have condescended oftener than became me to show how full of hyperbole and paradox they were still he as constantly maintained them with a kind of congruity that astonished me and even rendered many of them plausible  but exclusive of his obstinacy the rude pot companion loquacity of the fellow is highly offensive he has no sense of inferiority he stands as erect and speaks with as little embarrassment and as loudly as the best of us nay boldly asserts that neither riches rank nor birth have any claim i have offered to buy him a beard if he would but turn heathen philosopher i have several times indeed bestowed no small portion of ridicule upon him but in vain his retorts are always ready and his intrepidity in this kind of impertinence is unexampled  from some anecdotes which are told of him i find he does not want personal courage but he has no claim to chastisement from a gentleman petty insults he disregards and has several times put me almost beyond the power of forbearance by his cool and cutting replies his oratory is always ready cut dry and fit for use and damned insolent oratory it frequently is  the absurdity of his tenets can only be equalled by the effrontery with which they are maintained among the most ridiculous of what he calls first principles is that of the equality of mankind he is one of your levellers marry his superior who is he on what proud eminence can he be found on some welsh mountain or the pike of teneriffe certainly not in any of the nether regions what was not he the ass that brayed to balaam and is he not now mufti to the mules he will if he please and if he please he will let it alone dispute his prerogative who dare he derives from adam what time the world was all hail fellow well met the savage the wild man of the woods is his true liberty boy and the orang outang his first cousin a lord is a merry andrew a duke a jack pudding and a king a tom fool his name is man  then as to property it is a tragic farce it is his sovereign pleasure to eat nectarines grow them who will another alexander he the world is all his own ay and he will govern it as he best knows how he will legislate dictate dogmatize for who so infallible what cannot goliath crack a walnut  as for arguments it is but ask and have a peck at a bidding and a good double handful over i own i thought i knew something but no i must to my horn book then for a simile it is sacrilege and must be kicked out of the high court of logic sarcasm too is an ignoramus and cannot solve a problem wit a pert puppy who can only flash and bounce the heavy walls of wisdom are not to be battered down by such popguns and pellets he will waste you wind enough to set up twenty millers in proving an apple is not an egg shell and that homo is greek for a goose dun scotus was a school boy to him i confess he has more than once dumbfounded me by his subtleties  pshaw  it is a mortal murder of words and time to bestow them on him  my sister is in correspondence with my new divinity i thought proper to bestow a few gentle lashes on her for a letter which she wrote to me and which i mentioned in my first from paris insinuating her own superiority and giving me to understand how fortunate it would be for the world should i but prove as consummate a paragon as herself she richly deserved it and yet i now wish i had forborne for if she have her sexs love of vengeance in her she may injure me in the tenderest part never was woman so devoted to woman as anna st ives is to louisa i should suspect any other of her sex of extravagant affectation but her it is impossible to suspect her manner is so peculiarly her own and it comes with such unsought for energy that there is no resisting conviction  i have two or three times been inclined to write and ask louisas pardon but no that pride forbids she dare not openly profess herself my enemy she may insinuate and countermine but i have a tolerably strong dependence on my own power over anna she is not blind she is the first to feel and to acknowledge superior merit and i think i have no reason to fear repulse from any woman whose hand i can bring myself to ask  one of annas greatest perfections with me is the ready esteem which she entertained for me and her not being insensible to those qualities which i flatter myself i possess never yet did woman treat me with affected disdain who did not at last repent of her coquetry  it is true that anna has sometimes piqued me by appearing to value me more for my sisters sake even than for my own i have been ready to say dissimulation was inseparable from woman and yet her manner is as unlike hypocrisy as possible i never yet could brook scorn or neglect i know no sensation more delicious than that of inflicting punishment for insult or for injury it is in our nature  that youngster of whom i have prated so much his name is frank henley denies this and says that what the world calls nature is habit he added with some degree of sarcasm as i thought that it was as natural or in his sense as habitual for some men to pardon and to seek the good even of those by whom they were wronged as it was for others to resent and endeavor to revenge but as i have said he continually makes pretensions to an offensive superiority you may think i do not fail to humble the youth whenever opportunity offers but no humble him indeed show him boiling ice stew a whale in an oystershell make mount caucasus into a bag pudding but do not imagine he may be moved the legitimate son of catos eldest bastard he a petrified possidonius in high preservation  there is another thing which astonishes me more than all i have mentioned curse me fairfax if i do not believe that god confound the fellow he has the impudence to be in love with anna st ives nay that he braves me defies me and in the insufferable frothy fermentation of his vanity persuades himself that he looks down upon me  i must finish for i cannot think of his intolerable insolence with common patience and i know not what right i have to tease you concerning my paltry disputes with a plebeian pedant and my still more paltry jealousies but let him beware if he really have the arrogance to place himself in my way i will presently trample him into his original nonentity i only forbear because he has had the cunning to make himself so great a favorite  this must be horribly stupid stuff to you fairfax therefore pay me in my own coin be as dull as you sometimes know how and bid me complain if i dare  c clifton  letter xxix louisa clifton to coke clifton rosebank i write dear brother in answer to your last that i may not by any neglect of mine contribute to the mistake in which you are at present your letter shows that you suppose your sister to be vain presumptuous and rude and such being your feelings i am far from blaming you for having expressed them  still brother i must be sincere and i would by no means have it understood that i think you have chosen the best manner of expressing them for it is not the manner which if i have such faults would be most likely to produce reformation but your intention has been to humble me and desiring to be sarcastic you have not failed in producing your intended effect i am sincerely glad of it had you shown that desire without the power i should have been as sincerely sorry but where there is mind there is the material from which every thing is to be hoped  i suppose i shall again incur chastisement for rising thus as you call it to the sublime but i will write my thoughts without fear and i hope will patiently listen should they deserve reproach if i have sinned it is in most fervently wishing to find my brother one of the brightest and the best of men and i have received more pleasure from the powers he has displayed in reproving me than i could have done by any dull expression of kindness in which though there might have been words there would neither have been feeling sentiment nor soul  the concluding sentence of your letter warns me not to defame you with my friend i must speak without disguise brother you feel that had you received such a letter revenge would have been the first emotion of your mind i hope its duration would have been short i will most readily and warmly repeat all the good of my brother that i know but i will neither conceal what ought to be said nor say what i do not know i take it for granted that he would not have me guilty of duplicity  adieu dear brother and believe me to be most affectionately your  l clifton  letter xxx frank henley to oliver trenchard paris hotel despagne rue guenegaude fauxbourg st germain how severe oliver are the lessons of truth but to learn them from her lips and to be excited to the practice of them by her example are blessings which to enjoy and not to profit by would show a degenerate heart  i have just risen from a conversation which has made a deep impression on my mind it was during breakfast i know not whether reflecting on it will appease or increase the sensations which the behavior of this brother of louisa hourly exacerbates but i will calm that irritability which would dwell on him and nothing else that i may repeat what has just happened  the interesting part of what passed began by mr cliftons affirming with pope that men had and would have to the end of time each a ruling passion this i denied if by ruling passion were meant the indulgence of any irregular appetite or the fostering of any erroneous system i was asked with a sneer for my recipe to subdue the passions if it were not too long to be remembered i replied it was equally brief and efficacious it was the force of reason or if the word should please better of truth  and in what year of the world was the discovery of truth to be made  in that very year when instead of being persecuted for speaking their thoughts the free discussion of every opinion true or false should not only be permitted but receive encouragement and applause  as usual the appeal was made to anna and as usual her decision was in my favor nothing said she is more fatal to the progress of virtue than the supposition that error is invincible had i persuaded myself i never could have learned french italian or music why learn them i never could for how can that be finished which is never begun but though all the world were to laugh at me i should laugh at all the world were it to tell me it is more difficult to prevent the beginning growth and excess of any passion than it is to learn to play excellently on the piano forte  is that really your opinion madam said clifton  it is  do you include all the passions  all  what the passion of love  yes love is as certainly to be conquered as any of them and there is no mistake which has done more mischief than that of supposing it irresistible young people and we poor girls in particular having once been thoroughly persuaded of the truth of such an axiom think it in vain to struggle where there are no hopes of victory we are conquered not because we are weak but because we are cowards we seem to be convinced that we have fallen in love by enchantment and are under the absolute dominion of a necromancer it is truly the dwarf leading the giant captive is it not  oliver she fixed her eyes upon me as she spoke  is it not frank  i was confounded i paused for a moment a deep and heavy sigh involuntarily burst from me i endeavored to be firm but i stammered out  madam  it is  i am convinced he is jealous of me nay he fears me though he scorns me too much to think so meanly of himself yet he fears me and what is worse oliver i fear him i blush for my own debility but let me not endeavor to conceal my weakness no it must be encountered and cured his quick and audacious eye was searching me while i struggled to think and rid myself of confusion and he discovered more than gave him pleasure  she continued  i know of no prejudice more pernicious to the moral conduct of youth than that of this unconquerable passion of love any and all of our passions are unconquerable whenever we shall be weak enough to think them so does not the gamester plead the unconquerableness of his passion the drunkard the man of anger the revengeful the envious the covetous the jealous have they not all the same plea with the selfish and the feeble passion succeeds to passion as different habits give birth to each and the last passion proves more unconquerable than its predecessor how frequently do we see people in the very fever of this unconquerable passion of love which disappears for the rest of their lives after a few weeks possession of the object whom they had so passionately loved how often do they as passionately hate while the violence of their hatred and of their love is perhaps equally guilty  sir arthur i observed was happy to join in this new doctrine which however is true oliver i am not certain that he too had not his apprehensions concerning me at least his approbation of the principle was ardent  this was not all after a short silence she added and again fixed her eyes on me  next to the task of subduing our own passions i know none more noble than that of aiding to subdue the passions of others to restore a languishing body is held to be a precious art but to give health to the mind to restore declining genius to its true rank is an art infinitely more inestimable  she rose and i withdrew her words vibrating in my ear where they vibrate still perceivest thou not their import  oliver she has formed a project fatal to my hopes nay i could almost fear fatal to herself yet what who can harm her does the savage the monster exist that could look upon her and do her injury no she is safe she is immaculate beaming in beauty supreme in virtue the resplendent aegis of truth shields her from attaint  yes oliver her answers were to him but the intent the soul of them was directed to me it was a warning spirit that cried beware of indulging an unjustifiable passion awake at the call of virtue and obey behold here a sickly mind and aid me in its recovery  to me her language was pointed clear and incapable of other interpretation  but is there not peril in her plan recover a mind so perverted strong i own nay uncommon in its powers for such the mind of clifton is but its strength is its disease  and is it so certain that for me to love her is error is weakness is vice no or if it be i have not yet discovered why oliver she shall hear me let her show me my mistake if mistaken i be and i will desist but justice demands it and she shall hear me  we are going to remove at his repeated instances to the hotel where he resides he leads sir arthur as he pleases but it grieved me to see her yield so readily now that i have discovered her intentions i no longer wonder omnipotent as the power of truth and virtue is i yet cannot approve the design the enterprises of virtue itself may have their romance  i know not  this to me at least is fatal  could i  i must conclude  lose her  for ever  for ever  i must conclude   f henley  letter xxxi anna wenbourne st ives to louisa clifton paris hotel de luniversite the assiduity of clifton my dear louisa is so great that we already seem to be acquaintance of seven years standing this is evidently his intention his temper is eager impatient of delay quick in resolving and if i do not mistake sometimes precipitate but his intellectual powers are of a very high order his wit is keen his invention strong his language flowing and elegant and his ideas and figures remarkable sometimes for their humor and at others for their splendor his prejudices are many of them deep nor are they few but he speaks them frankly defends them boldly and courts rather than shuns discussion what then may not be hoped from a mind like his ought such a mind to be neglected no  no  eternally no  i have already given a strong hint of this to frank  i am persuaded that since you saw him he is greatly improved in person the regularity of his features his florid complexion tall stature and the facility and grace of all his motions are with him no common advantages  he has attached himself exceedingly to us and has induced sir arthur to take apartments in the hotel de luniversite where he resides himself and where the accommodations are much better the situation more agreeable and the rooms more spacious  a little incident happened when we removed which was characteristic of the manners of the people and drew forth a pleasing trait of the acuteness of clifton and of his turn of thinking  one of the men who helped us with our luggage after being paid according to agreement asked as is very customary with these people for quelque chose a boire which sir arthur not being very expert in the french idiom understood literally he accordingly ordered a bottle of the light common wine and being thirsty poured some into a tumbler and drank himself first then poured out some more and offered the proter  the man took the glass as sir arthur held it out to him and with some surprise and evident sense of insult in his countenance said to sir arthur  a moi monsieur to which sir arthur perfectly at a loss to comprehend his meaning made no answer and the man without tasting the liquor set the glass down on a bench in the yard  clifton well acquainted with the manners of the people and knowing the man imagined sir arthur meant to insult him by giving him the same glass out of which he had drunken with great alacrity took it up the moment the man had set it down and said  non mon ami cest a moi  and drank off the wine he then called for another tumbler and filling it gave it to the man  the french are a people of active and lively feelings and the poor fellow after receiving the glass from clifton took up the other empty tumbler poured the wine back into it said in his own language forgive me sir i see i am in the wrong and immediately drank out of the tumbler which he had before refused  each country you perceive louisa has its own ideas of delicacy the french think it very strange to see two people drink out of the same vessel not however that i suppose every porter in paris would refuse wine if offered for the same reason neither would they all with the same sensibility be so ready to retract  the good humor as well as the good sense of cliftons reproof pleased me highly and we must all acknowledge him our superior in the art of easily conforming to the customs of foreigners and in readily pardoning even their absurdities for foreigners louisa have their absurdities as well as ourselves  but i have not yet done i have another anecdote to relate of clifton from which i augur still more  i had observed our thomas in conversation with a man who from his dress and talking to thomas i knew must be an englishman and the care which it becomes me to take that such wellmeaning but simple people should not be deceived led me to inquire who he was thomas began to stammer not with guilt but with a desire of telling a story which he knew not how to tell so well as he wished at last we understood from him it was a young english lad who had neither money meat nor work and who was in danger of starving because he could find no means of returning to his own country poor thomas finding himself among a kind of heathens as he calls the french pitied his case very sincerely and had supplied him with food for some days promising that he would soon take an opportunity of speaking to me whom he is pleased to call the best young lady in the world and i assure you louisa i am proud of his good word  your brother heard this account and immediately said  for indeed i wished to know what his feelings were and therefore did not offer to interrupt him desire him to come up let me question him if he be really what he says he ought to be relieved but he is very likely some idle fellow who being english makes a trade of watching for english families and living upon this tale so far said i to myself clifton all is right i therefore let him proceed the lad came up for he was not twenty and your brother began his interrogations  you are an english lad you say  yes sir  where do you come from  wolverhampton  what is your trade  a buckle plater  and did you serve out your apprenticeship  no  how so  my master and i quarrelled he struck me i beat him and was obliged to run away  where did you run to  i went to london i have an aunt there a poor woman who chairs for gentlefolks and i went to her  how came you here  she got me a place with a young gentleman who was going on his travels i had been among horses before i was bound prentice and he hired me as his groom  but how came you to leave him  he is a very passionate gentleman he has got a french footman who stands and shrugs and lets him give him thumps and kicks and one morning because one boot was brighter than the other he was going to horsewhip me so i told him to keep his hands off or i would knock him down  why you are quite a fighting fellow  no sir i never fought with any body in my life if they did not first meddle with me  so you quarrelled with your master beat him ran away from your apprenticeship got a place came into a foreign country and then because your master did not happen to please you threatened to knock him down  the poor fellow was quite confounded and i was half out of breath from an apprehension that clifton had taken the wrong side of the question but i was soon relieved  this tale is too artless to be false said he turning to me  you cannot conceive louisa the infinite pleasure which these few words gave me  i still continued silent and watching not the lad but your brother  so you never meddle with any body who does not meddle with you  no sir i would scorn it  but you will not be horsewhipped  no sir i will not starve or not starve  i need not ask you if you are honest sober and industrious for i know you will say you are  why should i not sir  you have nobody to give you a character have you  my master is still in paris but to be sure he will give me a bad one  can you tell me his address  where he lives  i cannot tell it in french but here it is  can you write and read  yes sir  and how long have you been out of place  above seven weeks  why did not you return to england when you received your wages  i had no money i owed a fellow servant a guinea and a half which i had borrowed to buy shirts and stockings  and those you have made away with  not all i was obliged to take some of them to mount pity  mont piete you mean the general receptacle for pledges among other monopolies and trades government in france used to be the common pawnbroker   belike yes sir  well here is something for you for the present and come to me tomorrow morning  the lad went away with more in his countenance than he knew how to put into speech and i asked clifton what he meant by desiring him to come again i intend madam said he to make some inquiries of his master and if they please me to hire him for i want a servant and if i am not deceived he will make a good one  think louisa whether i were not pleased with this proof of discernment by this accident i learned more of cliftons character in ten minutes than perhaps i might have done in ten months he saw for i wished him to see that he had acted exactly as i could have desired  he appears indeed to be a favorite with servants which certainly is no bad omen he is lauras delight he is a free gentleman a generous gentleman i suppose he gives her money a merry gentleman and has the handsomest person the finest eye and the best manner of dressing his hair she ever beheld  she quite overflows in his praise  in a few days we are to go to the country seat of the marquis of villebrun where we intend to stay about a fortnight your brother has introduced us to all his friends among whom is the marquis and as we are intimate with our ambassador we have more invitations than we can accept and acquaintance than we can cultivate frank is to go with us  and now louisa with anxiety i own my mind is far from satisfied i have not thought sufficiently to convince myself yet act as though i had it is little less than open war between your brother and frank the supposition of a duty too serious to be trifled with has induced me to favor rather than repulse the too eager advances of clifton though this supposed duty has been but half examined  the desire to retrieve mind cannot but be right yet the mode may be wrong  at this moment my heart bitterly reproaches me for not proceeding on more certain principles the merit of frank is great almost beyond the power of expression i need not tell my louisa which way affection were it encouraged would incline but i will not be its slave nor can i reproach myself for erring on that side but for acting in resistance to inclination with too little reserve no arguments i believe can show me that i have a right to sport with the feelings of my father and my friends though those feelings are founded in prejudice but my inquiries shall be more minute and my resolves will then be more permanent and selfcomplacent  adieu my best and dearest friend write often reprove me for all that i do amiss  would my mind were more accordant with itself but i will take it roundly to task  a w st ives  letter xxxii coke clifton to guy fairfax paris hotel de luniversite this brief memorandum of my actual existence dear fairfax will be delivered to you by the chevalier de villeroi a worthy gentleman to whom i have given letters to my friends and who will meet you at turin  i have not a moment to waste therefore can only say that i am laying close siege that my lines of circumvallation do not proceed quite so rapidly as my desires but that i have just blown up the main bastion or in other words have prevailed on sir arthur to send this hornet this frank henley back to england the fellows aspiring insolence is not to be endured his merit is said to be uncommon it is certain he strains after the sublime and in fact is too deep a thinker nay i suspect too deep a plotter not to be dangerous adieu  c clifton i am in a rage curse the fellow he has countermined me blown up my works i might easily have foreseen it had i not been a stupid boody i could beat my thick scull against the wall i have neither time nor patience to tell you what i mean except that here he is and here he will remain in my despite    letter xxxiii frank henley to oliver trenchard paris hotel de luniversite it is as i told thee oliver he fears me he treats me as he thinks with the neglect and contempt due to an unqualified intruder but he mistakes his own motives and acts with insidious jealousy nay descends to artifice his alarmed spirit never rests he is ever on the watch lest at entering a room descending a staircase stepping into her carriage or on any other occasion i should touch her hand he has endeavored to exclude me from all their parties and though often successfully has several times been foiled  but his greatest disappointment was this very morning sir arthur sent for me last night to inform me i must return to wenbournehill with some necessary orders which he did not choose to trust to the usual mode of conveyance i immediately suspected and i think i did not do him injustice that my rival was the contriver of this sudden necessity of my return  i received sir arthurs orders but was determined immediately to acquaint anna  clifton was present she was surprised and i doubt not had the same suspicions as myself for after telling me i must not think of going she obliged clifton himself to be the intercessor with sir arthur that i should stay his reluctance feigned assent and chagrin were visible  her words and manner to me were kind nay i could almost think they were somewhat more she seemed to feel the injustice aimed at me and to feel it with as much resentment as a spirit so benignant could know  what  can he not be satisfied with half excluding me from her society with endeavoring to sink me as low in her estimation as in his own and with exercising all that arrogance which he supposes becoming the character of a gentleman  oliver i am determined in my plan my appeal shall be to her justice if it prove to be illfounded why then i must acquiesce i am angry at my own delay at my own want of courage but i shall find a time and that quickly at least if condemned i must be i will be heard but equity i think is on my side  yes  i will be heard  f henley  letter xxxiv frank henley to oliver trenchard paris hotel de luniversite aid me if thou can oliver to think or rather to unravel my own entangled thoughts do not suffer me to continue in a state of delusion if thou perceivest it to be such be explicit tell me if thou do but so much as forebode for at moments i myself despond though at others i am wafted to the heaven of heavens to certainty and bliss unutterable if i deceive myself  well  and if i do what is to follow  rashness  cowardice  what basely abandon duty virtue and energy  no  looks words appearances daily events are all so contradictory that the warfare of hope and fear increases and becomes violent almost to distraction clifton is openly countenanced by sir arthur treated kindly by her and is incessant in every kind of assiduity his qualities are neither mean insignificant nor common no they are brilliant and rare with a person as near perfection as his mind will permit it to be a knowledge of languages a taste for the fine arts much bravery high notions of honor a more than common share of wit keen and ungovernable feelings an impatience of contradiction and an obstinacy in error he is a compound of jarring elements that augur tempests and peril vain haughty and selfwilled his family his fortune his accomplishments and himself are the pictures that fascinate his eye it is attracted for a moment by the superior powers of another but all his passions and propensities forebode that he is not to be held even by that link of adamant  and is she to be dazzled then by this glare can her attention be caught by person attracted by wit and does she not shrink from that haughty pride which so continually turns to contemplate itself from those passions which are so eager to be gratified and from those mistakes which it will be so almost impossible to eradicate even were i to lose her must i see her thus devoted  the thought is  i cannot tell what too painful for any word short of extravagance  impressed by feelings like these the other day i sat down and threw a few ideas into verse the mind surcharged with passion is eager by every means to disburthen itself it is always prompt to hope that the expression of it is feelings if any way adequate cannot but produce the effect it wishes and i wrote the following song or loveelegy or what thou will  rash hope avaunt be still my fluttering heart nor breathe a sorrow nor a sigh impart appease each bursting throb each pang reprove to suffer dare  but do not dare to love down down these swelling thoughts nor dream that worth can pass the haughty bounds of wealth and birth yes kindred feelings truth and virtue prove yes dare deserve  but do not dare to love to noble tasks and dangerous heights aspire bid all the great and good thy wishes fire the mighty dead thy rival efforts move and dare to die  but do not dare to love thou know her supreme excellence in music the taste feeling and expression with which she plays and the enchanting sweetness and energy with which she sings having written my verses i took them when she was busie elsewhere to the pianoforte and made some unsuccessful attempts to please myself with an air to them sir arthur came in and i left my stanzas on the desk of the instrument very inadvertently i assure thee though i was afterward far from sorry that they had been forgotten  i have frequently indulged myself in sitting in an antichamber to listen to her playing and singing i have thought that she is most impassioned when alone and perhaps all musicians are so the next day happening to listen in the manner i have mentioned i heard her singing an air which was new to me and remarked that she once or twice stopped to consider and make alterations  i listened again and found she had been setting my verses  by my soul oliver i have no conception of rapture superior to what i experienced at that moment she had collected all her feelings all her invention had composed a most beautiful air and sung it with an effect that must have been heard to be supposed possible the force with which she uttered every thought to the climax of daring and the compassion which she infused into the conclusion  but do not dare to love  produced the most affecting contrast i ever heard  this indeed was heaven oliver bu a heaven that ominously vanished at the entrance of clifton i followed him and saw her shut the book and wipe the tear from her eye her flow of spirits is unfailing but the tone of her mind was raised too high suddenly to sink into trifling she looked at me two or three times i know not for my part what aspect i wore but i could observe that the haughty clifton felt the gaiety of his heart in some sort disturbed and was not pleased to catch me listening with such mute attention to the ravishing music she had made  once again prithee tell me oliver what am i to think it was impossible she should have sung as she did had not the ideas affected her more than i could have hoped nay as much as they did myself she knew the writing why did she sigh why feel indignant why express every sentiment that had passed through my mind with increasing force  what could she think  did she not approve  she sung as if she admired  the world shall not persuade me that her looks were not the true expressions of her heart and she looked  recollect her and the temper of mind she was in and imagine how  remember  she could love me if i would let her  i was displeased with the verses when i had written them they were very inadequate to what i wished i discovered in some of the lines a barren repetition of the preceding thought and meant to have corrected them but i would not now alter a word for worlds she has deigned to set and sing them and what was before but of little worth is now inestimable  yet am i far from satisfied with myself my present state of mind is disgraceful for it cannot but be disgraceful to be kept in doubt by my own cowardice and if i am deceiving myself  can it be possible oliver  but if i am my present error is indeed alarming the difficulty of retreating momentarily increases and every step in advance will be miles in return  clifton will suffer no impediment from the cowardice of which i complain for i much mistake if he has been accustomed to refusal or if he can scarcely think when he deigns to sue denial possible  i find myself every day determining to put an end to this suspense and every day delaying the impulse however is too great to be long resisted and my excuse to myself continually is that i have not yet found the proper moment  if oliver this history of my heart be troublesome to thee it is thy duty to tell me so but indeed thou tellest me the contrary and i know not why at this instant i should do thee the injustice to doubt thy sincerity forgive me it is a friendly fear and not intended to do thee wrong but i wish thee to judge of me and my actions and even to let thy father judge if thou should at any time hesitate and fear i am committing error do this and continue thy usual kindness in communicating thy thoughts  f henley p s the day after tomorrow we are to set off for the chateau de villebrun on a party of pleasure as it is called thus men run from place to place without knowing of what they are in search they feel vacuity a want of something to make them happy but what that something is they have not yet discovered    letter xxxv anna wenbourne st ives to louisa clifton paris hotel de luniversite ifear my dear louisa i am at i resent hurried forward a little too fast to act with all the caution which i could wish my mind is not coherent not at peace with itself ideas rush in multitudes and more than half obscure my understanding  i find that since we left wenbournehill frank has grown upon my thoughts very strangely indeed till then i was but partially acquainted with his true character the energy of which is very uncommon but though his virtues are become more conspicuous the impediments that forbid any thought of union are not lessened  my chief difficulty is i do not yet know how to give full effect to my arguments so as to produce such conviction as he shall be unable to resist let me do but this and i have no doubt of his perfect acquiescence and resignation but should i fail the warfare of the passions will be prolonged and for a time a youth whose worth is above my praise rendered unhappy a sense of injustice committed by the person of whom perhaps he thought too highly to suppose it possible that either error or passion should render her so culpable may prey upon his peace and destroy the felicity of one to whom reason and recollection tell me i cannot wish too much good  i am convinced i have been guilty of another mistake i have on various occasions been desirous of expressing approbation mingled with esteem and friendship he has extorted it from me he has obliged me to feel thus and why have i constantly asked myself should i repress or conceal sensations that are the dues of merit no they ought not to have been repressed or concealed but they ought to have been rendered intelligible incapable of misconstruction and not liable to a meaning which they were never intended to convey for if ever they were more than i suppose i have indeed been guilty  yes my louisa let me discharge my conscience let no accusation of deceit rest with me i can endure any thing but selfreproach i avow therefore frank henley is in my estimation the most deserving man i have ever known a man that i could love infinitely a man whose virtues i do and must ever love a man in whose company my heart assures me i could have enjoyed years of happiness if the casuists in such cases should tell me this is what they mean by love why then i am in love  but if the being able without a murmur nay cheerfully to marry another or see him properly married if the possession of the power and the resolution to do what is right and if an unshaken will to exert this power prove the contrary why then i am not in love  when i may without trespassing on any duty and with the full approbation of my own heart yield up its entire affections the man to whom they shall be devoted shall then find how much i can love  my passions must be ought to be and therefore shall be under my control and being conscious of the purity of my own intentions i have never thought that the emanations of mind ought to be shackled by the dread of their being misinterpreted it is not only cowardly but in my opinion pernicious  yet with respect to frank i fear this principle has led me into an error among other escapes of this kind there is one which has lately befallen me and for which i doubt i am reprehensible  frank has written a song in which his feelings and situation are very strongly expressed he left it on my music desk by accident for his character is too open too determined to submit to artifice the words pleased me i may say affected me so very much that i was tempted to endeavor to adapt an air to them which when it was written i several times repeated and accompanied myself on the pianoforte your brother came in just as i had ended and from a hint which he purposely gave i suspect that frank had been listening in the antichamber  the behavior of frank afterward confirmed the supposition he followed your brother and sat down while we conversed his whole soul seemed absorbed but not as i have sometimes seen it in melancholy satisfaction pleasure i know not whether rapture would be too strong a word for the expressions which were discoverable in his countenance  my own mind had the moment before been impassioned and the same sensations thrilling as it were through my veins might mislead me and induce me to suppose things that had no existence still i do not think i was mistaken and if not what have i done have i not thoughtlessly betrayed him into a belief that i mean to favor a passion which i should think it criminal to encourage  i know not why i delay so long to explain my sentiments it is the weak fear of not doing justice to my cause of not convincing and of making him unhappy for whom i would sacrifice my life every thing but principle to make him the very reverse  however this must and shall soon be ended i do not pretend to fix a day but it shall not be a very distant one i will arrange my thoughts collect my whole force and make an essay which i am convinced cannot fail unless by my fault the task is perhaps the most severe i have ever yet undertaken i will remember this and i hope my exertions will be adequate  adieu my dear louisa and when you come to this place imagine me for a moment in your arms  a w st ives  letter xxxvi coke clifton to guy fairfax chateau de villebrun never was fellow so pestered with malverse accidents as i am and all of my own contriving i am the prince of numskulls the journey to the chateau was a project of my own and whom should i meet here but the count de beaunoir the very same with whom i was prevented from fighting by this insolent son of a steward they knew each other instantly and the whole story was told in the presence of anna my foolish pride would never before let me mention to her that a fellow like him could oblige me to put up the sword i had drawn in anger nor can i now tell why i did not run him through the instant he dared to interfere  i cut a cursed ridiculous figure but the youth is running up a long score which i foresee he will shortly be obliged to discharge damn him i cannot think of him with common patience i know not why i ever mention his name  i have raised another nest of wasps about my ears the french fops here all buzz and swarm around her each making love to her with all the shrugs grimaces and ready made raptures of which he is master and to which i am obliged patiently to listen or show myself an ass these fellows submit to every kind of monopoly except of woman and to pretend an exclusive right to her is in their opinion only worthy of a barbarian but the most forward and tormenting of them all is my quondam friend the count who is half a lunatic but of so diverting a kind that ere a man has time to be angry he either cuts a caper utters an absurdity or acts some mad antic or other that sets gravity at defiance  not that any man who had the smallest pretensions to common sense could be jealous either of him or any one of these apes and yet jealous i am my dotage fairfax is come very suddenly upon me and neither you nor any one of the spirited fellows whose company i used to delight in can despise me half so much as i despise myself  a plebeian  a  i could drink gall eat my elbows renounce all my gods and turn turk  ay laugh if you will what care i   i have taken a turn into the park in search of a little cool air and common sense  all the world is met here on purpose to be merry and merry they are determined to be the occasion is a marriage in the true french style between my very good friend the marquis de villebrun an old fellow upwards of sixty and a young creature of fifteen a child a chit just taken out of a convent in which but for this or some such preposterous match she might have remained till time should have bestowed wrinkles and ugliness as bountifully upon her as it has done upon her narcissus the bridegroom the women flock busily round her in their very goodnatured way purposely to form her the men too are very willing to lend their aid and under such tuition she cannot but improve apace why are not you here fairfax i have had twenty temptations to take her under my pupillage but that i dare not risk the loss of this divinity  the purpose of our meeting however is as i said to be joyous it is teeming time therefore with every brain that has either wit folly or fancy enough to contribute to the general festivity and various are their inventions and stratagems to excite surprise attract visitors and keep up the holiday farce of the scene musicians painters artists jugglers sages all whose fame no matter of what motley kind has reached the public ear and whom praise or pay can bring together are assembled poets are invited to read their productions and as reading well is no mean art and writing well still much more difficult you may think what kind of an exhibition your every day poetasters make yet like a modern play they are certain of unbounded applause  last night we had a fete champetre which it must be granted was a most accurate picture of nature and the manners of rustics the simplicity of the shepherd life could not but be excellently represented by the ribbands jewels gauze tiffany and fringe with which we were bedaubed and the ragouts fricassees spices sauces wines and liqueurs with which we were regaled not to mention being served upon plate by an army of footmen but then it was in the open air and that was prodigiously pastoral  when we were sufficiently tired of eating and drinking we all got up to dance and the mild splendor of the moon was utterly eclipsed by the glittering dazzle of some hundreds of lamps red green yellow and blue the rainbow burlesqued all mingled in fantastic wreaths and forms and suspended among the foliage that the trees might be as fine as ourselves the invention disposition and effect however were highly applauded and since the evil was small and the mirth great what could a man do but shake his ears kick his heels cut capers laugh sing shout squall and be as mad as the best  tomorrow night we are to have fireworks which will be no less rural i was in a splenetic humor and indulged myself in an exclamation against such an abominable waste of gunpowder for which i got reproved by my angelic monitress who told me that of all its uses and abuses this was the most innocent  i suppose our stay here will not be less than a fortnight but i have left orders for all letters to be sent after me so that your heroic epistles will come safe and soon to hand  which is all at this present writing from your very humble servant to command c clifton  letter xxxvii anna wenbourne st ives to louisa clifton chateau de villebrun in compliance with the very warm entreaties of our kind french friends we have been hurried away from the metropolis sooner than was intended we are at present in the country at the chateau de villebrun where if we are not merry it is not for the want of laughing our feet and our tongues are never still we dance talk sing ride sail or rather paddle about in a small but romantic lake in short we are never out of exercise  clifton is as active as the best and is very expert in all feats of agility with the french he seems to dance for the honor of his nation and with me from a desire to prove that the man who makes pretensions to me which he now does openly enough is capable of every excellence  you know louisa how much i despise the affectation of reserve but he is so enterprising a youth that i am sometimes obliged though very unwillingly to exert a little mild authority  the french old or young ugly or handsome all are lovers and are as liberal of their amorous sighs and addresses as if each were an adonis clifton is well acquainted with foreign manners or i can perceive their gallantry to me would make him half mad as it is he has been little less than rude to one or two of the most forward of my pretended admirers  i speak in the plural as if we were rather in town than at a country seat and so we appear to be the french nobility do not seem to have any taste for solitude their love of variety induces them to change the scene but the same tumult of guests and visitors coming and going is every where their delight whatever can attract company they seek with avidity i am dear to them because i am an english beauty as they tell me and all the world is desirous of paying its court to me  clifton has equal or perhaps greater merits of the same kind and i assure you louisa the women here can pay their court more artfully and almost as openly as the men  frank is idolized by them because he reads shakespeare you would wonder to hear the praises they bestow upon him and which indeed he richly deserves though not one in ten of them understands a word he says cest beau cest magnifique cest superbe cest sublime such is their continual round of goodnatured superlatives which they apply on all occasions with a sincere desire to make others as happy as they endeavor to persuade themselves to be frank treats their gallantry with a kind of silent contempt otherwise he would be a much greater favorite  perhaps you will be surprised to find me still guilty of procrastination and to hear me describing french manners instead of the mode in which i addressed a youth whom i have accused myself of having in a certain sense misled and kept in suspense i can only answer that my intentions have been frustrated chiefly indeed by this country excursion though in part by other accidents my mind has not indulged itself in indolence it could not it is too deeply interested but the more i have thought the more have i been confirmed in my former opinion this is the hour of trial this is the time to prove i have some real claims to that superiority which i have been so ready to flatter myself i possess were there nothing to regret nay were there not something to suffer where would be the merit of victory  but on the other hand how much is there to gain  a mind of the first order to be retrieved  a clifton  a brother of louisa  this appears to be a serious crisis again i must repeat how much i am afraid of being hurried forward too fast an error at this moment might be fatal clifton is so much alarmed by the particular respect which the count de beaunoir a pleasant kind of madman who is a visitant here pays me that he has this instant been with me confessed a passion for me in all the strong and perhaps extravagant language which custom has seemed t authorize and has entreated with a degree of warmth and earnestness that could scarcely be resisted my permission to mention the matter immediately to sir arthur  it became me to speak without disguise i told him i was far from insensible of his merits that a union with the brother of my louisa if propriety duty and affection should happen to combine would be the first wish of my heart that i should consider any affectation and coyness as criminal but that i was not entirely free from doubt and before i could agree to the proposal being made to sir arthur i thought it necessary we should mutually compare our thoughts and scrutinize as it were each other to the very soul that we might not act rashly in the most serious of all the private events of life  you know my heart louisa at least as well as i myself know it and i am fearful of being precipitate  he seemed rather disappointed and was impatient to begin the conversation i wished for immediately  i told him i was unprepared my thoughts were not sufficiently collected and that the hurry in which we at present exist would scarcely allow me time to perform so necessary a duty but that i might avoid the least suspicion of coquetry if it were his desire i would shut myself up for a day from company and examine whether there were any real impediments that i would ask myself what my hopes and expectations were and that i requested or indeed expected that he should do the same i added however that if he pleased it would be much more agreeable to me to defer this serious task at least till we should return to paris  he repeated my words if it would be much more agreeable to me impatient and uneasy though he owned he was he must submit  i answered i required no submission except to reason to which i hoped both he and i should always be subject  love he replied was so disdainful of restraint that it would not acknowledge the control of reason itself however by representing to him how particular our mutual absence from the company would seem unless we could condescend to tell some falsehood which i would not i said suppose possible to either of us i prevailed on him to subscribe to this short delay  his passions and feelings are strong one minute he seemed affected by the approbation which as far as i could with truth i did not scruple to bestow on his many superior gifts and the next to conceive some chagrin that i should for a moment hesitate the noblest natures louisa are the most subject to pride can the least endure neglect and are aptest to construe whatever is not directly affirmative in their favor into injustice  with respect to the count de beaunoir he has been more passionate in expressing how much he admires me than my reserve to him can have authorized except so far as he follows the manners of his country and the impulse of his peculiar character i suppose he means little though he has said much not that i am certain he may be more in earnest than i desire but i hope he is not because if i am to be your sister as well as your friend i should be sorry that any thing should excite a shadow of doubt in the mind of clifton  the count is one of the provencal nobility a whimsical creature with an imagination amazingly rapid but extravagant your brother calls him count shatterbrain and i tell him that he forgets he has some claim to the title himself the count has read the old provencal poets and romance writers till he has made himself a kind of don quixote except that he has none of the dons delightful systematic gravity the count on the contrary amuses by his want of system and his quick changeable incongruity he is in raptures one moment with what he laughs at the next were it not for the mad follies of jealousy against which we cannot be too guarded the manner in which he addresses or in his own language adores me would be pleasant if i wished to pass my life in laughing i would certainly marry the count  i am called to dinner adieu  ever and ever yours a w st ives  letter xxxviii anna wenbourne st ives to louisa clifton chateau de villebrus my alarms louisa increase and with them my anxious wishes for an eclaircissement with frank clifton has too strongly imbibed high but false notions of honor and revenge his quick apt and versatile talents are indubitable he wants nothing but the power to curb and regulate his passions to render him all that his generous and excellent sister could desire but at present his sensibility is too great he scarcely can brook the slightest tokens of disapprobation he is rather too firmly persuaded that he deserves applause and admiration and that reproof he scarcely can deserve or if he did to submit to it he imagines would be dishonorable  frank and he behave more than usually cool to each other i know not why unless it has been occasioned by an incident which happened yesterday clifton has bought an english hunter from one of his countrymen at paris which he was exhibiting to his french friends whose horsemanship is very different from ours and who were surprised to see him ride so fearlesly over gates and other impediments they continued their airing in the park of villebrun and turned round to a kind of haha which was both deep and wide and about half full of water by the side of which they saw a party of ladies standing and me among the rest frank was with us  one of the gentlemen asked whether the horse could leap over the haha to which clifton made no answer but immediately clapped spurs to his hunter and over he flew the whole company gentlemen and ladies broke out into exclamations of surprise and clifton turned his horses head round and regained his former place  while they were wondering frank henley happened to make it a matter of doubt whether a man or a horse could leap the farthest and clifton continually in the habit of contending with frank said it was ridiculous to start such an argument unless he would first show that he himself could make the same leap frank piqued in his turn retired a few yards and without pulling off his coat or deigning to leap he made a short run and a hop and sprung over  you may imagine that the kind and good folks who love to be astonished and still more to tell the greatness of their astonishment were manifold in their interjections frank in order to rejoin the company was obliged a second time to cross the haha which he did with the same safety and truly amazing agility as he had done before  clifton indulging his wrong habits though i have no doubt admiring frank as much as the rest told him in a kind of sarcastic banter that though he could not prove the equality of mankind he had at least proved himself equal to a horse to which frank replied he was mistaken for that he had shown himself equal to the horse and his rider  this answer i fear dwells upon the mind of clifton and i scarcely myself can tell whether it were or were not worthy of frank how can clifton be wilfully blind to such courage rectitude of heart understanding and genius  the stern unrelenting fortitude of frank in the cause of justice and some fymptoms of violence in the impetuous clifton have inspired me with apprehensions and have induced me to behave with more reserve and coldness to frank than i ever before assumed  yet louisa my heart is wrung to see the effect it produces he has a mind of such discriminating power such magnanimity that an injury to it is a deep a double sin and every look every action testify that he thinks himself injured by the distance with which i behave oh that he himself might be impelled to begin the subject with which my mind is laboring  this is wrong i am ashamed of my own cowardice yet would there not be something terrifying in a formal appointment to tell him what it seems must be told  yes louisa must  and is there not danger he should think me severe nay unjust  would it were over  i hope he will not think so of me  it must be done  must  must   indeed louisa i could be a very woman  but i will not  no no  it is passed  i have put my handkerchief to my eyes and it is gone  i have repressed an obstinate heaving of the heart   let her blame me if i deserve it but my louisa must see me as i am  yet i will conquer  be sure i will  but i must not sing his song any more  a w st ives  letter xxxix frank henley to oliver trenchard chateau de villebrun oh my friend my heart is torn i am on the rack my thoughts are all tumult my passions rebel i seem to have yielded up the best prerogative of man reason and to have admitted revolt anarchy and desolation  her manner is changed wholly  she is become cold reserved has marked me out for neglect smiles on me no more not a sigh escapes her and why what have i done i am unconscious have i been too presuming perhaps so but why did her looks never till now speak her meaning as intelligibly as they do at present i could not then have mistaken them why till now has she seemed to regard me with that sweet amenity which was so flattering to hope  perhaps in the distraction of my thoughts i am unjust to her and shall i pretending as i do to love so pure shall i become her accuser what if she meant no more than that commerce of grateful kindness which knits together human society and renders it delightful  yet this sudden change so evidently intentional the smiles too which she bestows on the brother of louisa and the haughty airs of triumph which he assumes what can these be confident in himself ardent in his desires unchecked by those fears which are the offspring of true delicacy his passions violent and his pride almost insufferable he thinks he loves but he is ignorant of the alarms the tremors the fitful fevers of love  i cannot endure my present torture i must seek a desperate end to it by explanation why do i delay coward that i am what worse can happen than despair and is not despair itself preferable to that worst of fiends suspense what do i mean by despair would i being rejected desert my duty sink into self and poorly linger in wretchedness or basely put an end to existence violently end that which ought to be devoted to the good of others  how did so infernal a thought enter my mind  can i be so very lost a thing  no  despair is something confused something horrid i know not what it may intrude upon me at black and dismal intervals but it shall not overwhelm me i will shake it off i will meet my destiny  the clouds are gathering the strom approaches i hear the distant thunder rolling this way it drives it points at me it must suddenly burst be it so grant me but the spirit of a man and i yet shall brave its fury if i am a poor braggart a half believer in virtue or virtuous only in words the feeble victim then must justly perish  i cannot endure my torments cannot because there is a way to end them it shall be done  i blush to read blush to recollect the rhapsodies of my own perturbed mind madman it is continually thus day after day i proceed reasoning reproving doubting wishing believing and despairing alternately  once again where is this strange impossibility  in what does it consist  are we not both human beings  what law of nature has place her beyond my hopes  what is rank does it imply superiority of mind or is there any other superiority  am i not a man  and who is more have the titled earned their dignities by any proofs of exalted virtue were not these dignities things of accident in which the owners had no share and of which they are generally unworthy and shall hope be thus cowed and killed without my daring to exert the first and most unalienable of the rights of man freedom of thought shall i not examine what these high distinctions truly are of which the bearers are so vain  this clifton  thou know not how he treats me and can she approve can she second his injustice  surely not  yet does she not dedicate her smiles to him her conversation her time does she not shun me discountenance me and reprove me by her silence and her averted eyes  once again it must and shall have an end  i have repeated this too often but my next shall show thee i am at length determined  f henley  letter xl anna wenbourne st ives to louisa clifton chateau de villebrun an affair has just happened in this country which is the universal topic of conversation the daughter of a noble and wealthy family has fallen in love with a man of uncommon learning science and genius but a musician in consequence of his great skill and reputation he was employed to teach her music and she it appears was too sensible at least for the decorum of our present manners of his worth  the ability to discover his merit implies merit in herself and the musician and lady were equally enamoured of each other a plan for elopement consequently was laid and put in execution but not effectually for before the lovers had passed the confines of the kingdom they were pursued and overtaken  the musician knew his own personal danger and by a stratagem fortunately escaped from his bonds and attained a place of safety the lady was brought back and from the severity of the french laws and the supposed atrocity of the crime it is generally affirmed that the musician notwithstanding his talents and fame had he been secured would have been executed  i have mentioned this adventure my dear louisa not so much for it is own sake as for what relates to myself it was natural that i should feel compassion for mistakes if mistakes they be which have so great an affinity to virtue and that i should plead for the lovers and against the barbarity of laws so unjust and inhuman for it is certain that had not the musician been put to death his least punishment would have been perpetual imprisonment  in a former letter i mentioned the increasing alarms of sir arthur and this was a fit opportunity for him to show how very serious and great those alarms are he opposed me while i argued in behalf of the lovers with what might in him be called violence affirmed it was a crime for which no merit or genius could compensate highly applauded those wholesome laws that prevented such crimes and preserved the honor of noble families from attaint lamented the want of similar laws in england and spoke of the conduct of the young lady with a degree of bitterness which from him was unusual in fine the spirit of his whole discourse was evidently to warm me and explicitly to declare what his opinions on this subject are  had i before wanted conviction he fully convinced me on this occasion of the impossibility of any union between me and frank henley at least without sacrificing the felicity of my father and my family and from being generally and sincerely beloved by them rendering myself the object of eternal reproach and almost of hatred  previous to this conversation i was uneasy at the state of my own mind and particularly at what i suppose to be the state of mr henleys and this uneasiness is at present very much increased  once again louisa it must immediately have an end i can support it no longer i must be firm my halfstaggering resolution is now fixed i cannot must not doubt my father and family must not be sacrificed to speculative probabilities frank is the most deserving of mankind and that it should be a duty to reject the most deserving of mankind as the friend of my life my better self my husband is strange but i am nevertheless convinced that a duty it is yes the conflicts of doubt are over i must and will persevere  poor frank to be guilty of injustice to a nature so noble to wring a heart so generous and to neglect desert so unequalled is indeed a killing thought but the stern the unrelenting dictates of necessity must be obeyed the neglect the injustice and the cruelty are the worlds not mine my heart disavows them revolts at them detests them  heaven bless my louisa and give her superior prudence to guard and preserve her from these too strong susceptibilities may the angel of fortitude never forsake her as she seems half inclined to do her poor  a w st ives  end of volume ii erratum vol    page     line    for quelque chose a bire read quelque chose pour bire
