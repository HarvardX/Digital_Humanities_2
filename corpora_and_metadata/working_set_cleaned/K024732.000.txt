westminster and j almon in piccadilly mdcclxiii  the ghost book iv coxcombs who vainly make pretense to something of exalted sense bove other men and gravely wise affect those pleasures to despise which merely to the eye confined bring no improvement to the mind rail at all pomp they would not go for millions to a puppetshow nor can forgive the mighty crime of countenancing pantomime no not at covent garden where without a head for play or playr or could a head be found most fit without one playr to second it they must obeying follys call thrive by mere show or not at all with these grave fops who bless their brains most cruel to themselves take pains for wretchedness and would be thought much wiser than a wise man ought for his own happiness to be who what they hear and what they see and what they smell and taste and feel distrust till reason sets her seal and by long trains of consequences ensurd gives sanction to the senses who would not heaven forbid it waste one hour in what the world calls taste nor fondly deign to laugh or cry unless they know some reason why with these grave fops whose system seems to give up certainty for dreams the eye of man is understood as for no other purpose good than as a door through which of course their passage crouding objects force a downright usher to admit newcomers to the court of wit good gravity forbear thy spleen when i say wit i wisdom mean where such the practice of the court which legal precedents support not one idea is allowed to pass unquestioned in the crowd but ere it can obtain the grace of holding in the brain a place before the chief in congregation must stand a strict examination not such as those who physic twirl full fraught with death from every curl who prove with all becoming state their voice to be the voice of fate prepared with essence drop and pill to be another ward or hill before they can obtain their ends to sign deathwarrants for their friends and talents vast as theirs employ secundum artem to destroy must pass or laws their rage restrain before the chiefs of warwick lane thrice happy lane where uncontrolled in power and lethargy grown old most fit to take in this blessed land the reins which fell from wyndhams hand her lawful throne great dullness rears still more herself as more in years where she and who shall dare deny her right when reeves and chauncys by calling to mind in ancient time one garth who erred in wit and rhyme ordains from henceforth to admit none of the rebel sons of wit and makes it her peculiar care that schomberg never shall be there not such as those whom folly trains to letters though unblessed with brains who destitute of power and will to learn are kept to learning still whose heads when other methods fail receive instruction from the tail because their sires a common case which brings the children to disgrace imagine it a certain rule they never could beget a fool must pass or must compound for ere the chaplain full of beef and prayer will give his reverend permit announcing them for orders fit so that the prelate what is a name all prelates now are much the same may with a conscience safe and quiet with holy hands lay on that fiat which does all faculties dispense all sanctity all faith all sense makes madan quite a saint appear and makes an oracle of cheer not such as in that solemn seat where the nine ladies hold retreat the ladies nine who as we are told scorning those haunts they loved of old the banks of isis now prefer nor will one hour from oxford stir are held for form which balaams ass as well as balaams self might pass and with his master take degrees could he contrive to pay the fees men of sound parts who deeply read oerload the storehouse of the head with furniture they never can use cannot forgive our rambling muse this wild excursion cannot see why physic and divinity to the surprise of all beholders are luggd in by the head and shoulders or how in any point of view oxford has any thing to do but men of nice and subtle learning remarkable for quick discerning through spectacles of critic mould without instruction will behold that we a method here have got to show what is by what is not and that our drift parenthesis for once apart is briefly this within the brains most secret cells a certain lord chief justice dwells of sovereign power whom one and all with common voice we reason call though for the purposes of satire a name in truth is no great matter jefferies or mansfield which you will it means a lord chief justice still here so our great projectors say the senses all must homage pay hither they all must tribute bring and prostrate fall before their king whatever unto them is brought is carried on the wings of thought before his throne where in full state he on their merits holds debate examines crossexamines weighs their right to censure or to praise nor does his equal voice depend on narrow views of foe and friend nor can or flattery or force divert him from his steady course the channel of enquirys clear no sham examinations here he upright justicer no doubt ad libitum puts in and out adjusts and settles in a trice what virtue is and what is vice what is perfection what defect what we must choose and what reject he takes upon him to explain what pleasure is and what is pain whilst we obedient to the whim and resting all our faith on him true members of the stoic weal must learn to think and cease to feel this glorious system formed for man to practice when and how he can if the five senses in alliance to reason hurl a proud defiance and though often conquered yet unbroke endeavor to throw off that yoke which they a greater slavery hold than jewish bondage was of old or if they something touched with shame allow him to retain the name of royalty and as in sport to hold a mimic formal court permitted no uncommon thing to be a kind of puppet king and suffered by the way of toy to hold a globe but not employ our systemmongers struck with fear prognosticate destruction near all things to anarchy must run the little world of mans undone nay should the eye that nicest sense neglect to send intelligence unto the brain distinct and clear of all that passes in her sphere should she presumptuous joy receive without the understandings leave they deem it rank and daring treason against the monarchy of reason not thinking though they are wondrous wise that few have reason most have eyes so that the pleasures of the mind to a small circle are confined whilst those which to the senses fall become the property of all besides and this is sure a case not much at present out of place where nature reason does deny no art can that defect supply but if for it is our intent fairly to state the argument a man should want an eye or two the remedy is sure though new the cures at hand  no need of fear  for proof  behold the chevalier  as well prepared beyond all doubt to put eyes in as put them out but argument apart which tends to embitter foes and separate friends nor turned apostate for the nine would i though bred up a divine and foe of course to reasons weal widen that breach i cannot heal by his own sense and feelings taught in speech as liberal as in thought let every man enjoy his whim what is he to me or i to him might i though never robbed in ermine a matter of this weight determine no penalties should settled be to force men to hypocrisy to make them ape an awkward zeal and feeling not pretend to feel i would not have might sentence rest finally fixed within my breast even annet censured and confined because we are of a different mind nature who in her act most free herself delights in liberty profuse in love and without bound pours joy on every creature round whom yet was every bounty shed in double portions on our head we could not truly bounteous call if freedom did not crown them all by providence forbid to stray brutes never can mistake their way determined still they plod along by instinct neither right nor wrong but man had he the heart to use his freedom has a right to choose whether he acts or well or ill depends entirely on his will to her last work her favorite man is given on natures better plan a privilege in power to err nor let this phrase resentment stir amongst the grave ones since indeed the little merit man can plead in doing well depends still upon his power of doing ill opinions should be free as air no man whatever his rank whatever his qualities a claim can found that my opinion must be bound and square with his such slavish chains from foes the liberal soul disdains nor can though true to friendship bend to wear them even from a friend let those who rigid judgment own submissive bow at judgments throne and if they of no value hold pleasure till pleasure is grown cold palled and insipid forced to wait for judgments regular debate to give it warrant let them find dull subjects suited to their mind theirs be slow wisdom be my plan to live as merry as i can regardless as the fashions go whether there is reason for it or no be my employment here on earth to give a liberal scope to mirth lifes barren vale with flowers to adorn and pluck a rose from every thorn but if by error led astray i chance to wander from my way let no blind guide observe in spite i am wrong who cannot set me right that doctor could i never endure who found disease and not a cure nor can i hold that man a friend whose zeal a helping hand shall lend to open happy follys eyes and making wretched make me wise for next a truth which cannot admit reproof from wisdom or from wit to being happy here below is to believe that we are so some few in knowledge find relief i place my comfort in belief some for reality may call fancy to me is all in all imagination through the trick of doctors often makes us sick and why let any sophist tell may it not likewise make us well this am i sure whatever our view whatever shadows we pursue for our pursuits be what they will are little more than shadows still too swift they fly too swift and strong for man to catch or hold them long but joys which in the fancy live each moment to each man may give true to himself and true to ease he softens fates severe decrees and can a mortal wish for more creates and makes himself new over mocks boasted vain reality and is whatever he wants to be hail fancy  to thy power i owe deliverance from the gripe of woe to thee i owe a mighty debt which gratitude shall never forget whilst memory can her force employ a large increase of every joy when at my doors too strongly barred authority had placed a guard a knavish guard ordained by law to keep poor honesty in awe authority severe and stern to intercept my wished return when foes grew proud and friends grew cool and laughter seized each sober fool when candor started in amaze and meaning censure hinted praise when prudence lifting up her eyes and hands thanked heaven that she was wise when all around me with an air of hopeless sorrow looked despair when they or said or seemed to say there is but one one only way better and be advised by us not be at all than to be thus when virtue shunned the shock and pride disabled lay by virtues side too weak my ruffled soul to cheer which could not hope yet would not fear health in her motion the wild grace of pleasure speaking in her face dull regularity thrown by and comfort beaming from her eye fancy in richest robes arrayed came smiling forth and brought me aid came smiling over that dreadful time and more to bless me came in rhyme nor is her power to me confined it spreads it comprehends mankind when to the spiritstirring sound of trumpets breathing courage round and fifes well mingled to restrain and bring that courage down again or to the melancholy knell of the dull deep and doleful bell such as of late the good saint bride muffled to mortify the pride of those who england quite forgot paid their vile homage to the scot where asgill held the foremost place whilst my lord figured at a race processions it is not worth debate whether they are of stage or state move on so very very slow it is doubtful if they move or no when the performers all the while mechanically frown or smile or with a dull and stupid stare a vacancy of sense declare or with downbending eye seem wrought into a labyrinth of thought where reason wanders still in doubt and once got in cannot get out what cause sufficient can we find to satisfy a thinking mind why dupd by such vain farces man descends to act on such a plan why they who hold themselves divine can in such wretched follies join strutting like peacocks or like crows themselves and nature to expose what cause but that you will understand we have our remedy at hand that if perchance we start a doubt ere it is fixed we wipe it out as surgeons when they lop a limb whether for profit fame or whim or mere experiment to try must always have a styptic by fancy steps in and stamps that real which ipso facto is ideal can none remember yes i know all must remember that rare show when to the country sense went down and fools came flocking up to town when knights a work which all admit to be for knighthood much unfit built booths for hire when parsons played in robes canonical arrayed and fiddling joined the smithfield dance the price of tickets to advance or unto tapsters turned dealt out running from booth to booth about to every scoundrel by retail true pennyworths of beef and ale then first prepared by bringing beer in for present grand electioneering when heralds running all about to bring in order turned it out when by the prudent marshals care lest the rude populace should stare and with unhallowed eyes profane gay puppets of patrician strain the whole procession as in spite unheard unseen stole off by night when our loved monarch nothing loath solemnly took that sacred oath whence mutual firm agreements spring betwixt the subject and the king by which in usual manner crowned his head his heart his hands he bound against himself should passion stir the least propensity to err against all slaves who might prepare or open force or hidden snare that glorious charter to maintain by which we serve and he must reign then fancy with unbounded sway revelld sole mistress of the day and wrought such wonders as might make egyptian sorcerers forsake their baffled mockeries and own the palm of magic here is alone a knight who in the silken lap of lazy peace had lived on pap who never yet had dared to roam bove ten or twenty miles from home nor even that unless a guide was placed to amble by his side and troops of slaves were spread around to keep his honor safe and sound who could not suffer for his life a point to sword or edge to knife and always fainted at the sight of blood though twas not shed in fight who disinherited one son for firing off an elder gun and whipped another six years old because the boy presumptuous bold to madness likely to become a very swiss had beat a drum though it appeared an instrument most peaceable and innocent having from first been in the hands and service of the city bands graced with those ensigns which were meant to further honors dread intent the minds of warriors to inflame and spur them on to deeds of fame with little sword large spurs high feather fearless of every thing but weather and all must own who pay regard to charity it had been hard that in his very first campaign his honors should be soiled with rain a hero all at once became and seeing others much the same in point of valor as himself who leave their courage on a shelf from year to year till some such rout in proper season calls it out strutted looked big and swaggerd more than ever hero did before looked up looked down looked all around like mavors grimly smiled and frowned seemed heaven and earth and hell to call to fight that he might rout them all and personated valors style so long spectators to beguile that passing strange and wondrous true himself at last believed it too nor for a time could he discern till truth and darkness took their turn so well did fancy play her part that coward still was at the heart whiffle who knows not whiffles name by the impartial voice of fame recorded first through all this land in vanitys illustrious band who by all bounteous nature meant for offices of hardiment a modern hercules at least to rid the world of each wild beast of each wild beast which came in view whether on four legs or on two degenerate delights to prove his force on the parade of love disclaims the joys which camps afford and for the distaff quits the sword who fond of women would appear to public eye and public ear but when in private let us them know how little they can trust to show who sports a woman as of course just as a jockey shows a horse and then returns her to the stable or vainly plants her at his table where he would rather venus find so palled and so depraved his mind than by some great occasion led to seize her panting in her bed burning with more than mortal fires and melting in her own desires who ripe in years is yet a child through fashion not through feeling wild whatever in others who proceed as sense and nature have decreed from real passion flows in him is mere effect of mode and whim who laughs a very common way because he nothing has to say as your choice spirits oaths dispense to fill up vacancies of sense who having some small sense defies it or using always misapplies it who now and then brings something forth which seems indeed of sterling worth something by sudden start and fit which at a distance looks like wit but on examination near to his confusion will appear by truths fair glass to be at best a threadbare jesters threadbare jest who frisks and dances through the street sings without voice rides without seat plays over his tricks like aesops ass a gratis fool to all who pass who riots though he loves not waste whores without lust drinks without taste acts without sense talks without thought does every thing but what he ought who led by forms without the power of vice is vicious who one hour proud without pride the next will be humble without humility whose vanity we all discern the spring on which his actions turn whose aim in erring is to err so that he may be singular and all his utmost wishes mean is though he is laughed at to be seen such for when flattrys soothing strain had robbed the muse of her disdain and found a method to persuade her art to soften every shade justice enraged the pencil snatched from her degenerate hand and scratched out every trace then quick as thought from life this striking likeness caught in mind in manners and in mien such whiffle came and such was seen in the worlds eye but strange to tell misled by fancys magic spell deceived not dreaming of deceit cheated but happy in the cheat was more than human in his own o bow bow all at fancys throne whose power could make so vile an elf with patience bear that thing himself but mistress of each art to please creative fancy what are these these pageants of a triflers pen to what thy power effected then familiar with the human mind as swift and subtle as the wind which we all feel yet no one knows or whence it comes or where it goes fancy at once in every part possessed the eye the head the heart and in a thousand forms arrayed a thousand various gambols played here in a face which well might ask the privilege to wear a mask in spite of law and justice teach for public good texcuse the breach within the furrow of a wrinkle twixt eyes which could not shine but twinkle like sentinels in the starry way who wait for the return of day almost burnt out and seem to keep their watch like soldiers in their sleep or like those lamps which by the power of law must burn from hour to hour else they without redemption fall under the terrors of that hall which once notorious for a hop is now become a justiceshop which are so managed to go out just when the time comes round about which yet through emulation strive to keep their dying light alive and not uncommon as we find amongst the children of mankind as they grow weaker would seem stronger and burn a little little longer fancy betwixt such eyes enshrined no brush to daub no mill to grind thrice waved her wand around whose force changed in an instant natures course and hardly credible in rhyme not only stopped but called back time the face of every wrinkle cleared smooth as the floating stream appeared down the neck ringlets spread their flame the neck admiring whence they came on the arched brow the graces played on the full bosom cupid laid suns from their proper orbits sent became for eyes a supplement teeth white as ever teeth were seen delivered from the hand of green started in regular array like trainbands on a grand fieldday into the gums which would have fled but wondering turned from white to red quite altered was the whole machine and lady     was fifteen here she made lordly temples rise before the pious dashwoods eyes temples which built aloft in air may serve for show if not for prayer in solemn form herself before arrayed like faith the bible bore there over melcombs feathered head who quite a man of gingerbread savored in talk in dress and phyz more of another world than this to a dwarf muse a giant page the last grave fop of the last age in a superb and feathered hearse bescutcheond and betaggd with verse which to beholders from afar appeared like a triumphal car she rode in a cast rainbow clad there throwing off the hallowed played naked as when in those drear cells where selfblessd selfcursd madness dwells pleasure on whom in laughters shape frenzy had perfected a rape first brought her forth before her time wild witness of her shame and crime driving before an idol band of drivling stuarts hand in hand some who to curse mankind had wore a crown they never must think of more others whose baby brows were graced with paper crowns and toys of paste she jiggd and playing on the flute spread raptures over the soul of bute big with vast hopes some mighty plan which wrought the busy soul of man to her full bent the civil law fit code to keep a world in awe bound over his brows fair to behold as jewish frontlets were of old the famous charter of our land defaced and mangled in his hand as one whom deepest thoughts employ but deepest thoughts of truest joy serious and slow he strode he stalked before him troops of heroes walked whom best he loved of heroes crowned by tories guarded all around dull solemn pleasure in his face he saw the honors of his race he saw their lineal glories rise and touched or seemed to touch the skies not the most distant mark of fear no sign of axe or scaffold near not one cursed thought to cross his will of such a place as tower hill curse on this muse a flippant jade a shrew like every other maid who turns the corner of nineteen devoured with peevishness and spleen her tongue for as when bound for life the husband suffers for the wife so if in any works of rhyme perchance there blunders out a crime poor culprit bards must always rue it although it is plain the muses do it sooner or later cannot fail to send me headlong to a jail whatever my theme our themes we choose in modern days without a muse just as a father will provide to join a bridegroom and a bride as if though they must be the playrs the game was wholly his not theirs whatever my theme the muse who still owns no direction but her will flies off and ere i could expect by ways oblique and indirect at once quite over head and ears in fatal politics appears time was and if i ought discern of fate that time shall soon return when decent and demure at least as grave and dull as any priest i could see vice in robes arrayed could see the game of folly played successfully in fortunes school without exclaiming rogue or fool time was when nothing loath or proud i lacquied with the fawning crowd scoundrels in office and would bow to ciphers great in place but now upright i stand as if wise fate to compliment a shattered state had me like atlas hither sent to shoulder up the firmament and if i stooped with general crack the heavens would tumble from my back time was when rank and situation secured the great ones of the nation from all control satire and law kept only little knaves in awe but now decorum lost i stand bemusd a pencil in my hand and dead to every sense of shame careless of safety and of fame the names of scoundrels minute down and libel more than half the town how can a statesman be secure in all his villainies if poor and dirty authors thus shall dare to lay his rotten bosom bare muses should pass away their time in dressing out the poets rhyme with bills and ribbands and array each line in harmless taste though gay when the hot burning fit is on they should regale their restless son with something to allay his rage some cool castalian beverage or some such draught though they it is plain taking the muses name in vain know nothing of their real court and only fable from report as makes a whiteheads ode go down or slakes the feverette of brown but who would in his senses think of muses giving gall to drink or that their folly should afford to raving poets gun or sword poets were never designed by fate to meddle with affairs of state nor should if we may speak our thought truly as men of honor ought sound policy their rage admit to launch the thunderbolts of wit about those heads which when they are shot cantt tell if twas by wit or not these things well known what devil in spite can have seduced me thus to write out of that road which must have led to riches without heart or head into that road which had i more than ever poet had before of wit and virtue in disgrace would keep me still and out of place which if some judge you will understand one famous famous through the land for making law should stand my friend at last may in a pillry end and all this i myself admit without one cause to lead to it   for instance now  this book  the ghost  methinks i hear some critic post remark most gravely  the first word which we about the ghost have heard peace my good sir  not quite so fast  what is the first may be the last which is a point all must agree cannot depend on you or me fanny no ghost of common mould is not by forms to be controlled to keep her state and show her skill she never comes but when she will i wrote and wrote perhaps you doubt and shrewdly what i wrote about believe me much to my disgrace i too am in the selfsame case but still i wrote till fanny came impatient nor could any shame on me with equal justice fall if she had never come at all an underling i could not stir without the cue thrown out by her nor from the subject aid receive until she came and gave me leave so that ye sons of erudition mark this is but a supposition nor would i to so wise a nation suggest it as a revelation if henceforth dully turning over page after page ye read no more of fanny who in sea or air may be departed god knows where rail at jilt fortune but agree no censure can be laid on me for sure the cause let mansfield try fanny is in the fault not i but to return  and this i hold a secret worth its weight in gold to those who write as i write now not to mind where they go or how through ditch through bog over hedge and style make it but worth the readers while and keep a passage fair and plain always to bring him back again through dirt who scruples to approach at pleasures call to take a coach but we should think the man a clown who in the dirt should set us down but to return  if wit who never the shackles of restrain could bear in wayward humor should refuse her timely succor to the muse and to no rules and orders tied roughly deny to be her guide she must renounce decorums plan and get back when and how she can as parsons who without pretext as soon as mentioned quit their text and to promote sleeps genial power grope in the dark for half an hour give no more reason for we know reason is vulgar mean and low why they come back should it befall that ever they come back at all into the road to end their rout than they can give why they went out but to return  this book  the ghost  a mere amusement at the most a trifle fit to wear away the horrors of a rainy day a slight shot silk for summer wear just as our modern statesmen are if rigid honesty permit that i for once purloin the wit of him who were we all to steal is much too rich the theft to feel yet in this book where ease should join with mirth to sugar every line where it should all be mere chit chat lively goodhumored and all that where honest satire in disgrace should not so much as show her face the shrew oerleaping all due bounds breaks into laughters sacred grounds and in contempt plays over her tricks in science trade and politics but why should the distempered scold attempt to blacken men enrolled in powrs dread book whose mighty skill can twist an empire to their will whose voice is fate and on their tongue law liberty and life are hung whom on enquiry truth shall find with stuarts linked time out of mind superior to their countrys laws defenders of a tyrants cause men who the same damned maxims hold darkly which they avowed of old who though by different means pursue the end which they had first in view and force found vain now play their part with much less honor much more art why at the corners of the streets to every patriot drudge she meets known or unknown with furious cry should she wild clamours vent or why the minds of groundlings to inflame a dashwood bute and wyndham name why having not to our surprise the fear of death before her eyes bearing and that but now and then no other weapon but her pen should she an argument afford for blood to men who wear a sword men who can nicely trim and pare a point of honor to a hair honor  a word of nice import a pretty trinket in a court which my lord quite in rapture feels dangling and rattling with his seals  honor  a word which all the nine would be much puzzled to define  honor  a word which torture mocks and might confound a thousand locks  which for i leave to wiser heads who fields of death prefer to beds of down to find out if they can what honor is on their wild plan is not to take it in their way and this we sure may dare to say without incurring an offense courage law honesty or sense men who all spirit life and soul neat butchers of a buttonhole having more skill believe it true that they must have more courage too men who without a place or name their fortunes speechless as their fame would by the sword new fortunes carve and rather die in fight than starve at coronations a vast field which food of every kind might yield of good sound food at once most fit for purposes of health and wit could not ambitious satire rest content with what she might digest could she not feast on things of course a champion or a champions horse a champions horse  no better say though better figured on that day  a horse which might appear to us who deal in rhyme a pegasus a rider who when once got on might pass for a bellerophon dropped on a sudden from the skies to catch and fix our wondering eyes to witch with wand instead of whip the world with noble horsemanship to twist and twine both horse and man on such a wellconcerted plan that centaurlike when all was done we scarce could think they were not one could she not to our itching ears bring the new names of newcoind peers who walked nobility forgot with shoulders fitter for a knot than robes of honor for whose sake heralds in form were forced to make to make because they could not find great predecessors to their mind could she not though it is doubtful since whether he plumber is or prince tell of a simple knights advance to be a doughty peer of france tell how he did a dukedom gain and robinson was aquitain tell how our citychiefs disgraced were at an empty table placed a gross neglect which whilst they live they cannot forget and will not forgive a gross neglect of all those rights which march with city appetites of all those canons which we find by gluttony time out of mind established which they ever hold dearer than any thing but gold thanks to my stars  i now see shore  of courtiers and of courts no more  thus stumbling on my city friends blind chance my guide my purpose bends in line direct and shall pursue the point which i had first in view nor more shall with the reader sport

dullness rendred fit sleep and his empire to admit through the whole passage not a word not one faint weak half sound was heard sleep had prevailed to overwhelm the steersman nodding over the helm the

other out till the grave master had decreed the more haste ever the worst speed miss with her little eyes halfclosd over a smuggled toilet dosd the waitingmaid whom story notes a very scrub in petticoats hired for one work but doing all in slumbers leaned against the wall milliners summoned from afar arrived in shoals at temple bar strictly commanded to import cartloads of foppery from court with labored visible design art strove to be superbly fine nature more pleasing though more wild taught otherwise her darling child and cried with spirited disdain be h   elegant and plain lo from the chambers of the east a welcome prelude to the feast in saffroncolourd robe arrayed high in a car by vulcan made who worked for jove himself each steed highmettled of celestial breed pawing and pacing all the way aurora brought the wished for day and held her empire till outrun by that brave jolly groom the sun the trumpet  hark it speaks  it swells the loud full harmony it tells the time at hand when dullman led by form his citizens must head and march those troops which at his call were now assembled to guild hall on matters of importance great to court and city church and state from end to end the sound makes way all hear the signal and obey but dullman who his charge forgot by morpheus fettered heard it not nor could so sound he slept and fast hear any trumpet but the last crape ever true and trusty known stole from the maids bed to his own then in the spirituals of pride planted himself at dullmans side thrice did the everfaithful slave with voice which might have reached the grave and broke deaths adamantine chain on dullman call but called in vain thrice with an arm which might have made the theban boxer curse his trade the drone he shook who reared the head and thrice fell backward on his bed what could be done where force has failed policy often has prevailed and what an inference most plain had been crape thought might be again under his pillow still in mind the proverb kept fast bind fast find each blessed night the keys were laid which crape to draw away assayed what not the power of voice or arm could do this did and broke the charm quick started he with stupid stare for all his little soul was there behold him taken up rubbed down in elbowchair and morninggown behold him in his latter bloom stripped washed and sprinkled with perfume behold him bending with the weight of robes and trumpery of state behold him for the maxims true whatever we by another do we do ourselves and chaplain paid like slaves in every other trade had muttered over god knows what something which he by heart had got having as usual said his prayers go titter totter to the stairs behold him for descent prepare with one foot trembling in the air he starts he pauses on the brink and hard to credit seems to think through his whole train the chaplain gave the proper cue to every slave at once as with infection caught each started paused and aimed at thought he turns and they turn big with care he waddles to his elbowchair squats down and silent for a season at last with crape begins to reason but first of all he made a sign that every soul but the divine should quit the room in him he knows he may all confidence repose crape  though i am yet not quite awake  before this awful step i take on which my future all depends i ought to know my foes and friends by foes and friends observe me still i mean not those who well or ill perhaps may wish me but those who havet in their power to do it too now if attentive to the state in too much hurry to be great or through much zeal a motive crape deserving praise into a scrape i like a fool am got no doubt i like a wise man should get out not that remark without replies i say that to get out is wise or by the very selfsame rule that to get in was like a fool the marrow of this argument must wholly rest on the event and therefore which is really hard against events too i must guard should things continue as they stand and bute prevail through all the land without a rival by his aid my fortunes in a trice are made nay honors on my zeal may smile and stamp me earl of some great isle but if a matter of much doubt the present minister goes out fain would i know on what pretext i can stand fairly with the next for as my aim at every hour is to be well with those in power and my material point of view whoevers in to be in too i should not like a blockhead choose to gain these so as those to lose it is good in every case you know to have two strings unto our bow as one in wonder lost crape viewed his lord who thus his speech pursued this my good crape is my grand point and as the times are out of joint the greater caution is required to bring about the point desired what i would wish to bring about cannot admit a moments doubt the matter in dispute you know is what we call the quomodo that be thy task  the reverend slave becoming in a moment grave fixed to the ground and rooted stood just like a man cut out of wood such as we see without the least reflection glancing on the priest one or more planted up and down almost in every church in town he stood some minutes then like one who wished the matter might be done but could not do it shook his head and thus the man of sorrow said hard is this task too hard i swear by much too hard for me to bear beyond expression hard my part could mighty dullman see my heart when he alas makes known a will which crapes not able to fulfill was ever my obedience barred by any trifling nice regard to sense and honor could i reach thy meaning without help of speech at the first motion of thy eye did not thy faithful creature fly have i not said not what i ought but what my earthly master taught did i ever weigh through duty strong in thy great biddings right and wrong did ever interest to whom thou can not with more devotion bow warp my sound faith or will of mine in contradiction run to thine have i not at thy table placed when business called aloud for haste torn myself thence yet never heard to utter one complaining word and had till thy great work was done all appetites as having none hard is it this great plan pursued of voluntary servitude pursued without or shame or fear through the great circle of the year now to receive in this grand hour commands which lie beyond my power commands which baffle all my skill and leave me nothing but my will be that accepted let my lord indulgence to his slave afford this task for my poor strength unfit will yield to none but dullmans wit with such gross incense gratified and turning up the lip of pride poor crape  and shook his empty head  poor puzzled crape wise dullman said of judgment weak of sense confined for things of lower note designed for things within the vulgar reach to run of errands and to preach well have thou judged that heads like mine cannot want help from heads like thine well have thou judged thyself unmeet of such high argument to treat twas but to try thee that i spoke and all i said was but a joke nor think a joke crape a disgrace or to my person or my place the wisest of the sons of men have deigned to use them now and then the only caution do you see demanded by our dignity from common use and men exempt is that they may not breed contempt great use they have when in the hands of one like me who understands who understands the time and place the persons manner and the grace which fools neglect so that we find if all the requisites are joined from whence a perfect joke must spring a jokes a very serious thing but to our business  my design which gave so rough a shock to thine to my capacity is made as ready as a fraud in trade which like broadcloth i can with ease cut out in any shape i please some in my circumstance some few ay and those men of genius too good men who without love or hate whether they early rise or late with names uncrackd and credit sound rise worth a hundred thousand pound by threadbare ways and means would try to bear their point  so will not i new methods shall my wisdom find to suit these matters to my mind so that the infidels at court who make our city wits their sport shall hail the honors of my reign and own that dullman bears a brain some in my place to gain their ends would give relations up and friends would lend a wife who they might swear safely was none the worse for wear would see a daughter yet a maid into a statesmans arms betrayed nay should the girl prove coy nor know what daughters to a father owe sooner than schemes so nobly planned should fail themselves would lend a hand would vote on one side whilst a brother properly taught would vote on the other would every petty band forget to public eye be with one set in private with a second herd and be by proxy with a third would like a queen of whom i read the other day  her name is fled  in a book where together bound whttington and his cat i found a tale most true and free from art which all lordmayors should have by heart a queen o might those days begin afresh when queens would learn to spin who wrought and wrought but for some plot the cause of which i have now forgot during the absence of the sun undid what she by day had done whilst they a double visage wear what is sworn by day by night unswear such be their arts and such perchance may happily their ends advance from a new system mine shall spring a locumtenens is the thing that is your true plan  to obligate the present ministers of state my shadow shall our court approach and bear my power and have my coach my fine statecoach superb to view a fine statecoach and paid for too to curry favor and the grace obtain of those who are out of place in the mean time i  that is to say  i proper i myself  here stay but hold  perhaps unto the nation who hate the scots administration to lend my coach may seem to be declaring for the ministry for where the citycoach is there is the true essence of the mayor therefore for wise men are intent evils at distance to prevent whilst fools the evils first endure and then are plagued to seek a cure no coach  a horse  and free from fear to make our deputy appear fast on his back shall he be tied with two grooms marching by his side then for a horse  through all the land to head our solemn cityband can any one so fit be found as he who in artillryground without a rider noble sight led on our bravest troops to fight but first crape for my honors sake a tender point enquiry make about that horse if the dispute is ended or is still in suit for whilst a cause observe this plan of justice whether horse or man the parties be remains in doubt till it is determined out and out that power must tyranny appear which should prejudging interfere and weak faint judges overawe to biass the free course of law you have my will  now quickly run and take care that my will be done in public crape you must appear whilst i in privacy sit here here shall great dullman sit alone making this elbowchair my throne and you performing what i bid do all as if i nothing did crape heard and speeded on his way with him to hear was to obey not without trouble be assured a proper proxy was procured to serve such infamous intent and such a lord to represent nor could one have been found at all on the other side of londonwall the trumpet sounds  solemn and slow behold the grand procession go all moving on cat after kind as if for motion never designed constables whom the laws admit to keep the peace by breaking it beadles who hold the second place by virtue of a silver mace which every saturday is drawn for use of sunday out of pawn treasurers who with empty key secure an empty treasury churchwardens who their course pursue in the same state as to their pew churchwardens of saint margret go since peirson taught them pride and show who in short transient pomp appear like almanacks changed every year behind whom with unbroken locks charity carries the poors box not knowing that with private keys they open and shut it when they please overseers who by frauds ensure the heavy curses of the poor unclean came flocking bulls and bears like beasts into the ark by pairs portentous flaming in the van stalked the professor sheridan a man of wire a mere pantine a downright animal machine he knows alone in proper mode how to take vengeance on an ode and how to butcher ammons son and poor jack dryden both in one on all occasions next the chair he stands for service of the mayor and to instruct him how to use his as and bs and ps and qs over letters into tatters worn over syllables defaced and torn over words disjointed and over sense left destitute of all defense he strides and all the way he goes wades deep in blood over crisscrossrows before him every consonant in agonies is seen to pant behind in forms not to be known the ghosts of tortured vowels groan next heart and duke well worthy grace and city favor came in place no children can their toils engage their toils are turned to reverend age when a courtdame to grace his brows resolved is wed to city spouse their aid with madams aid must join the awkward dotard to refine and teach whence truest glory flows grave sixty to turn out his toes each bore in hand a kit and each to show how fit he was to teach a cit an alderman a mayor led in a string a dancing bear since the revival of fingal custom and customs all in all commands that we should have regard on all high seasons to the bard great acts like these by vulgar tongue profaned should not be said but sung this place to fill renowned in fame the high and mighty lockman came and never forgot in dullmans reign with proper order to maintain the uniformity of pride brought brother whitehead by his side on horse who proudly pawd the ground and cast his fiery eyeballs round snorting and champing the rude bit as if for warlike purpose fit his high and generous blood disdained to be for sports and pastimes reind great dymock in his glorious station paraded at the coronation not so our city dymock came heavy dispirited and tame no mark of sense his eyes halfclosd he on a mighty drayhorse dozd fate never could a horse provide so fit for such a man to ride nor find a man with strictest care so fit for such a horse to bear hung round with instruments of death the sight of him would stop the breath of braggart cowardice and make the very courtdrawcansir quake with durks which in the hands of spite do their damned business in the night from scotland sent but here displayed only to fill up the parade with swords unfleshd of maiden hue which rage or valor never drew with blunderbusses taught to ride like pocketpistols by his side in girdle stuck he seemed to be a little moving armory one thing much wanting to complete the sight and make a perfect treat was that the horse a courtesy in horses found of high degree instead of going forward on all the way backward should have gone horses unless they breeding lack some scruple make to turn their back though riders which plain truth declares no scruple make of turning theirs far far apart from all the rest fit only for a standing jest the independent can you get a better suited epithet the independent amyand came all burning with the sacred flame of liberty which well he knows on the great stock of slavery grows like sparrow who deprived of mate snatched by the cruel hand of fate from spray to spray no more will hop but sits alone on the housetop or like himself when all alone at croydon he was heard to groan lifting both hands in the defense of interest and commonsense both hands for as no other man adopted and pursued his plan the left hand had been lonesome quite if he had not held up the right apart he came and fixed his eyes with rapture on a distant prize on which in letters worthy note there twenty thousand pounds was wrote false trap for credit sappd is found by getting twenty thousand pound nay look not thus on me and stare doubting the certainty  to swear in such a case i should be loath  but perry cust may take his oath in plain and decent garb arrayed with the prim quaker fraud came trade connivance to improve the plan habited like a juryman judging as interest prevails came next with measures weights and scales extortion next of hellish race a cub most damned to show his face forbid by fear but not by shame turned to a jew like  came corruption midaslike behold turning whatever she touched to gold impotence led by lust and pride strutting with ponton by her side hypocrisy demure and sad in garments of the priesthood clad so well disguised that you might swear deceived a very priest was there bankruptcy full of ease and health and wallowing in wellsavd wealth came sneering through a ruined band and bringing b   in her hand victory hanging down her head was by a highland stallion led peace clothed in sables with a face which witnessed sense of huge disgrace which spoke a deep and rooted shame both of herself and of her name mourning creeps on and blushing feels war grim war treading on her heels pale credit shaken by the arts of men with bad heads and worse hearts taking no notice of a band which near her were ordained to stand well nigh destroyed by sickly fit looked wistful all around for pit freedom  at that most hallowed name my spirits mount into a flame each pulse beats high and each nerve strains even to the cracking through my veins the tides of life more rapid run and tell me i am freedoms son  freedom came next but scarce was seen when the sky which appeared serene and gay before was overcast horror bestrode a foreign blast and from the prison of the north to freedom deadly storms burst forth a car like those in which we are told our wild forefathers warred of old loaded with death six horses bear through the blank region of the air too fierce for time or art to tame they poured forth mingled smoke and flame from their wide nostrils every steed was of that ancient savage breed which fell geryon nursed their food the flesh of man their drink his blood on the first horses illmatchd pair this fat and sleek that lean and bare came illmatchd riders side by side and poverty was yoked with pride union most strange it must appear till other unions make it clear next in the gall of bitterness with rage which words can ill express with unforgiving rage which springs from a false zeal for holy things wearing such robes as prophets wear false prophets placed in peters chair on which in characters of fire shapes antic horrible and dire inwoven flamed where to the view in groups appeared a rabble crew of sainted devils where all round vile relics of vile men were found who worse than devils from the birth performed the work of hell on earth jugglers inquisitors and popes pointing at axes wheels and ropes and engines framed on horrid plan which none but the destroyer man could to promote his selfish views have heads to make or hearts to use bearing to consecrate her tricks in her left hand a crucifix remembrance of our dying lord and in her right a twoedged sword having her brows in impious sport adorned with words of high import on earth peace amongst men good will love bearing and forbearing still all wrote in the heartsblood of those who rather death than falsehood chose on her breast where in days of yore when god loved jews the high priest wore those oracles which were decreed tinstruct and guide the chosen seed having with glory clad and strength the virgin pictured at full length whilst at her feet in small portrayed as scarce worth notice christ was laid came superstition fierce and fell an imp detested even in hell her eye inflamed her face all over foully besmeared with human gore over heaps of mangled saints she rode fast at her heels death proudly strode and grimly smiled wellpleased to see such havoc of mortality close by her side on mischief bent and urging on each bad intent to its full bearing savage wild the mother fit of such a child striving the empire to advance of sin and death came ignorance with looks where dread command was placed and sovereign power by pride disgraced where loudly witnessing a mind of savage more than human kind not choosing to be loved but feared mocking at right misrule appeared with eyeballs glaring fiery red enough to strike beholders dead gnashing his teeth and in a flood pouring corruption forth and blood from his chafed jaws without remorse whipping and spurring on his horse whose sides in their own blood embayd even to the bone were open laid came tyranny disdaining awe and trampling over sense and law one thing and only one he knew one object only would pursue though less so low does passion bring than man he would be more than king with every argument and art which might corrupt the head and heart soothing the frenzy of his mind companion meet was flattery joined winning his carriage every look employed whilst it concealed a hook when simple most most to be feared most crafty when no craft appeared his tales no man like him could tell his words which melted as they fell might even a hypocrite deceive and make an infidel believe wantonly cheating over and over those who had cheated been before such flattery came in evil hour poisning the royal ear of power and grown by prostitution great would be first minister of state within the chariot all alone high seated on a kind of throne with pebbles graced a figure came whom justice would but dare not name hard times when justice without fear dare not bring forth to public ear the names of those who dare offend against justice and pervert her end but if the muse afford me grace description shall supply the place in foreign garments he was clad sage ermine over the glossy played cast reverend honor on his heart wrought by the curious hand of art in silver wrought and brighter far than heavenly or than earthly star shone a white rose the emblem dear of him he ever must revere of that dread lord who with his host of faithful native rebels lost like those black spirits doomed to hell at once from power and virtue fell around his clouded brows was placed a bonnet most superbly graced with mighty thistles nor forgot the sacred motto touch me not in the right hand a sword he bore harder than adamant and more fatal than winds which from the mouth of the rough north invade the south the reeking blade to view presents the blood of helpless innocents and on the hilt as meek become as lambs before the shearers dumb with downcast eye and solemn show of deep unutterable woe mourning the time when freedom reigned fast to a rock was justice chained in his left hand in wax impressed with bells and gewgaws idly dressed an image cast in baby mould he held and seemed oerjoyd to hold on this he fixed his eyes to this bowing he gave the loyal kiss and for rebellion fully ripe seemed to desire the antitype what if to that pretenders foes his greatness nay his life he owes shall common obligations bind and shake his constancy of mind scorning such weak and petty chains faithful to james he still remains though he the friend of george appear dissimulations virtue here jealous and mean he with a frown would awe and keep all merit down nor would to truth and justice bend unless outbullied by his friend brave with the coward with the brave he is himself a coward slave awed by his fears he has no heart to take a great and open part mines in a subtle train he springs and secret saps the ears of kings but not even there continues firm against the resistance of a worm born in a country where the will of one is law to all he still retained the infection with full aim to spread it wheresoeer he came freedom he hated law defied the prostitute of power and pride law he with ease explains away and leads bewildered sense astray much to the credit of his brain puzzles the cause he cannot maintain proceeds on most familiar grounds and where he cannot convince confounds talents of rarest stamp and size to nature false he misapplies and turns to poison what was sent for purposes of nourishment paleness not such as on his wings the messenger of sickness brings but such as takes its coward rise from conscious baseness conscious vice overspread his cheeks disdain and pride to upstart fortunes ever tied scowld on his brow within his eye insidious lurking like a spy to caution principled by fear not daring open to appear lodged covert mischief passion hung on his lip quivering on his tongue fraud dwelt at large within his breast all that makes villain found a nest all that on hells completest plan ere joined to damn the heart of man soon as the car reached land he rose and with a look which might have froze the hearts best blood which was enough had hearts been made of sterner stuff in cities than elsewhere to make the very stoutest quail and quake he cast his baleful eyes around fixed without motion to the ground fear waiting on surprise all stood and horror chilled their curdled blood no more they thought of pomp no more for they had seen his face before of law they thought the cause forgot whether it was or ghost or plot which drew them there they all stood more like statues than they were before what could be done could art could force or both direct a proper course to make this savage monster tame or send him back the way he came what neither art nor force nor both could do a lord of foreign growth a lord to that base wretch allied in country not in vice and pride effected from the selfsame land bad news for our blaspheming band of scribblers but deserving note the poison came and antidote abashed the monster hung his head and like an empty vision fled his train like virgin snows which run kissed by the burning bawdy sun to lovesick streams dissolved in air joy who from absence seemed more fair came smiling freed from slavish awe loyalty liberty and law impatient of the galling chain and yoke of power resumed their reign and burning with the glorious flame of public virtue mansfield came finis
