now to overreach him and get it again   slen that indeed cousin shallow to be sure would be quite right tit for tat as we say in the country but then he is such a bloodyminded caitiff you know he broke my head once for nothing at all and if he should get an inkling that you are going to law with him o lord o lord i shall never sleep in quiet again   shall poh you chit if he breaks the peace i shall know what to do with him i warrant ye   slen ay there indeed cousin ecod i did not think of that if i am in fear of my life i can answer taking him up with a warrant and binding him over to his good behavior suppose therefore coz we swear the peace against him first and lay him fast by the heels before we enter the action  and yet i dont know if i might advise ye i would wash my hands of him   shall talk not to me i tell thee i will spend half my estate ere the rascally knight shall carry it off so i had rather the inns of court should share the money among them than that the gorbellied

thou have it it would little conduce to raise the kings wisdom in the general estimation of the world to have it thought in the power of such unworthy men as falstaff and his fellows to lead him implicitly into all those extravagances under which the character of his youth suffered and yet so it would go near to be suspected if his highness should now act toward them with an illtimed severity my lordchiefjustice has therefore retracted his hasty orders for their imprisonment   fri son well observed and i commend his lordships prudence in treating their vices as infirmities and will readily undertake to commune with them on the grievous enormity of their dissolute lives   offic his lordship would have you apply first to sir john falstaff the ringleader of this vicious troop if you can dispose him to good the rest may follow   fri i will attend these reprobates and use the means   offic his lordship requires that you would bring falstaff over to retire to a monastery if possible that being concealed from the eyes of the world he may not daily remind it of what is past farewell good father i will see thee again at the priory  exit officer scene iii street continued friar solus i will go but i fear my mission will prove as fruitless as that of many other apostles sent among infidels as there is no danger of martyrdom however i am content  persuade sir john falstaff to turn monk could i work miracles indeed and like st thomas turn an ethiop white something might be said for it bur as it is i despair of converting an old deboshee from two such prevailing heresies as the whore and the bottle  exit scene iv tavern in eastcheap enter falstaff and bardolph fall two found naps of eight hours apiece have something recruited me bardolph my mornings whet is it prepared   bar

world goes bardolph up and down but is it not hard now i that have  but that is nothing i hate boasting it is however well known what pains i have taken to make a man of that hal nay you yourself are privy to many the good offices i have done him before the younker knew me he could not drink sack made conscience of going to church on holidays and blushed like a scarlet cloak at entering a bawdy house i nstructed him in all the manly exercises i was content to win his money to teach him gaming to get drunk myself o try to make him so nay setting rotten limbs and dignity aside have i not even pimpd for the bashful rogue such a prince of wales by my troth i was ashamed of him had it not been for me the milksop might have been crowned before he had lost his maidenhead   bar and that would have been a pity sir john to be sure   fall it was i first taught him to waylay the trueman for i knew him when he durst not cry stand to a turkeycock nay a gander of the ordinary size of a greengoose had it met him on a common would have made him run for it i went farther yet and not only emboldened his actions but taught him the manly arts of conversation in the style military for instance or swearing    bar sir john i believe there you forget yourself the prince wanted no assistance of you in that for when he was a little crack he would swear ye as well as a man six foot high   fall right bardolph you are right i remember me swearing indeed he knew for though but a kings son he would as thou say rap out an oath like an emperor but then for the quintessence of all elocution the use of the hyperbole vulgarly called lying there i am a master yet what a deal of pains it has cost me to teach hal to lie and all thrown away upon him he would never do it roundly he had no genius that way   bar you know sir john the prince never could away with lying he used to say twas beneath a gentleman and a soldier   fall well well he will never shine in the recital of his own exploits as xenophon caesar and i have done   bar why sir john to be sure you have done something   fall something the services i have done him and his father are out of number methinks my behavior in the ever memorable action at shrewsbury should make him blush at his ingratitude who killed hotspur did not i give him his deaths wound in the thigh was i not i who took prisoner that fiery dragon coleville and that even alive and am i thus requited is this the guerdon of my great achievements hang valor i will hack my sword no more thus has it ever been the fate of merit to be rewarded alcibiades and bellisarius

true knight to give him a thousand pound again and besides that the comingsin of a better thing in his majestys court at london   law ah master slender these knights have just honor enough to swear by but for any thing further i am apprehensive we shall find him one of those honorable knights whose word is as good as their oath but see if i mistake not yonder he comes this encounter may perhaps save us the trouble of attending him at home let us speak him fair and persuade him if possible to sign an obligation for the money if we can do that we may trounce him let me alone with him   slen o

mortify the desires of the flesh   fall hold thee there good father let me understand thee what would his lordship make a monk of me i must there beg his pardon a monk and to mortify the flesh for heavens sake good father consider what a mortification indeed that must be to me who have fix times the quantity of any other man if i must be included within the pale of the church why not make a canon of me not indeed a minor canon but a prebendary or a bishop now something might be said for either of these but for a monk i know not any thing i am less fit for unless indeed his lordship had meant to make a running footman of me   fr nay sir john his lordship will not use compulsion in this he will not so far lay a restraint on your inclinations   fall o if i ever find myself that way inclined his lordship may depend on it i shall be as ready as ever to follow my inclinations but the lesson of lean and sallow abstinence is very long and hard good father i am not gotten halfway

the kings sentence of banishment will be strictly put into execution against you   fall as to the matter of knighthood once a knight and always a knight you know the king may make as many knights as he pleases but he will not so easily unmake them again my title will not depend on the kings courtesy but on that of my followers i am notwithstanding very desirous to give his lordship satisfaction and do assure thee on the honor of a soldier of the sincerity of my repentance   fr and yet this may be only a transitory fit of penitence owing to your late disappointment what reason can thou give me to hope this state of mind will continue   fall why father what i am shortly going to do is an act that has confined many a man to a state of repentance which has continued to the last hour of his life   fr this sir john is saying something pray what are you going to do   fall i have taken a resolution father to  what do thou think now it is i have resolved upon   fr some commendable act of penance no doubt   fall nay it may well be called so i believe i am determined good father to marry   fr call you that an act of penance sir john is marriage a state of mortification   fall i wish i may not find it so   fr well sir john marriage is a holy state and in some degree i approve your resolution but in the estimation of the church it is also an holy act and ought not to be entered into unadvisedly your repentance should precede your receiving the benefit of that sacrament   fall o doubt not but i shall repent me sufficiently afterward   fr ah sir john sir john i fear me you are no true penitent but however it may be lawful to salve what cannot be effectually cured i did not expect to make a convert at the first interview if thou take any measures that tend toward reformation
