marina a play of three acts as it is acted at the theater royal in conventgarden taken from pericles prince of tire  by mr lillo  london printed for john gray at the crosskeys in the poultry near cheapside mdccxxxviii price one shilling  to the right honorable the countess of hertford madam permit me to hope that you will pardon the honest ambition which has encouraged me to seek a proper patroness for marina in your ladyship whose real character gives countenance to the imaginary one and whose constant practice is a living example of that steady virtue and exalted piety which the author of the old play from whence this is taken has happily described in his princess of tire  conscious of no mean views and secured by the universal acknowledgment of your merit from the imputation of flattery i approach your ladyship though a stranger and without any previous application with the less diffidence if this play should appear on perusal to be designed to promote something better than mere amusement that will effectually recommend it to the favor of the countess of hertford  to place merit in the gifts of fortune and happiness in what an hour may and a few years certainly will bring to an end is the folly and misery of too many who are reputed wise and great to be truly so is with your ladyship to regard the finest understanding the most fruitful invention the happiest elocution talents far superior to wealth and dignity but as they subserve the interest of truth and virtue and render the possessors of them in the midst of affluence moderate even in the use of lawful pleasures humble in the most exalted stations and capable of living above the world even in the possession of all it can bestow i am afraid and unwilling to offend but as universal benevolence is the perfection of virtue your ladyship must suffer your own to be spoken of however painful it may be to you that others may not want a pattern for their encouragement or reprehension as they shall improve or neglect it a truly great mind discovers it self by nothing more than by a benign and well placed condescension of which your ladyships known esteem for the late excellent mrs row is a noble instance and an undoubted proof amongst many others which you daily give of the goodness of your heart and understanding and cannot be mentioned but to your honor  i can affirm and i hope i shall be thought sincere that what i have said does not proceed from custom as a dedicator but from a mind fully convinced of its truth in every circumstance and a heart touched with a character so very amiable  that you may long live an ornament and a support of those excellent principles which you profess and practice and that your influence and example may do all the good that you your self can wish is the earnest desire of  your ladyship s most obedient humble servant geo lillo  prologue hard is the task in this discerning age to find new subjects that will bear the stage and bold our bards

prince of tire is here in tharsus this city now the seat of wealth and plenty whose towers invade the clouds which never stranger beheld but wondered at as all acknowledge had but for pericles been desolate forsaken or the grave of its inhabitants a den for bats to build and wolves to howl in how many thousands living now remember when famishing with hunger prince and people sat down and wept for bread when tender mothers fed on their new born babes and man and wife drew lots who first should die and furnish food to lengthen out the life of the survivor this our distress brought pericles from tire who bravely scorning to improve the advantage and make a conquest of a prostrate land did with a liberal hand supply our  wants and turn our dying groans to songs of joy for this the
