have who fill his little canvass with such credit to themselves and their profession to single out any one of these celebrated performers when all so kindly combined to produce what is deemed a striking representation in the comic style would be a task unpleasing as ungenerous and therefore as they have been equally zealous in their endeavors as happy in the execution of their several characters he wishes them jointly to accept the returns of a grateful heart  dramatis personae byron mr vernon sir harry muff mr dodd general worry mr parsons spy mr weston first gardener mr bannister
