observer no i when a man breaks in upon a company of strangers to which he is not invited the intrusion does or does not demand an apology according to the nature of the business which brings him thither if it imports the company only and he has no interest in the errand the less time he spends in ceremony the better and he must be a very silly fellow indeed who stands shuffling and apologizing when he ought either to warn people of their danger or inform them of their good fortune but where this is not the case and the man so intruding has nothing more to say for himself than that he is come to sit down in their company to prattle and tell stories and club his share to the general festivity of the table it will behove him to recommend himself very speedily to the good graces of his new acquaintance and if his conversation furnishes neither instruction nor amusement if he starts no new topics or does not talk agreeably upon old ones it is well if he does not make his exit as abruptly as he entered  in like manner every author finds a material difference in his first approaches to the public whether his subject recommends him or he is to recommend his subject if he has any thing new in art or science to produce any thing important to communicate for the benefit of mankind he need be under no difficulty in demanding their attention to a business which it is so much their interest to hear and understand on the contrary if he has nothing to tell his readers but what they knew before he told it there must be some candor on their part and great address on his to secure to such an author a good reception in the world  i am at this instant under all the embarrassments incident to a man in the lastmentioned predicament i am exceedingly desirous to make my best bow to the good company i am intruding myself upon and yet equally anxious that in so doing i may neither make my first advances with the stiff grimace of a dancing master nor with the too familiar air of a selfimportant as i pretend to nothing more in these pages than to tell my readers what i have observed of men and books in the most amusing manner i am able i know not what to say to them more than humbly to request a hearing and as i am in perfect charity and good humor with them sincerely to hope that they on their parts will be in like good humor and charity with me  my first wish was to have followed the steps of those essayists who have so successfully set the fashion of publishing their lucubrations from day to day in separate papers this mode of marching into the world by detachments has been happily taken up by men of great generalship in literature of whom some are yet amongst us though mr addison in his spectator no     has asserted that a man who publishes his works in a volume has an infinite advantage over one who communicates his writings to the world in loose sheets and single pieces it does not appear that he is serious in his assertion or if he is it is plain that his argument draws one way and his example another i must confess says he i am amazed that the press should be only made use of in this way by newswriters and the zealots of parties as if it were not more advantageous to mankind to be instructed in wisdom and virtue than in polities and to be made good fathers husbands and sons than counselors and statesmen this will suffice to convince us that mr addison saw the advantages of this mode of publication in such a light as led him to make choice of it himself and to recommend it to others for it is not to be supposed that he would have prefixed a motto to this very paper purporting that a great book is a great evil and then argued seriously in recommendation of that evil  some of the most pleasing volumes now in our hands are collections of essays published in this manner and the plan is still capable of a variety that is in no danger of being exhausted add to this that many years have now elapsed since any papers of this sort have been published the present time therefore on this account as well as from other circumstances peculiar to it may seem favorable to the undertaking but there are good reasons why writers have desisted from pursuing any further these attempts of working through a channel which others are in possession of who might chance to levy such a toll upon their merchandise as would effectually spoil their market  the miscellaneous matter i propose to give in these sheets naturally coincides with the method i have taken of disposing them into distinct papers and i shall proceed to publish in like manner till my plan is completed or till any unforeseen event cuts short the prosecution of it for me to conceive in an age so enlightened as the present that i can offer any thing to the public which many of my readers will not be as well informed of as myself would be a very silly presumption indeed simply to say that i have written nothing but with a moral design would be saying very little for it is not the vice of the time to countenance publications of an opposite tendency to administer moral precepts through a pleasing vehicle seems now the general study of our essayists dramatists and novelists the preacher may enforce his doctrines in the style of authority for it is his profession to summon mankind to their duty but an uncommissioned instructor will study to conciliate whilst he attempts to correct even the satirist who declares war against vice and solly seldom commits himself to the attack without keeping some retiringplace open in the quarter of panegyric if he cuts deep it is with the hand of a surgeon not of an assassin few authors now undertake to mend the world by severity many make it their study by some new and ingenious device to soften the rigor of philosophy and to bind the rod of the moralist with the roses of the muse  i have endeavored to relieve and chequer these familiar essays in a manner that i hope will be approved of i allude to those papers in which i treat of the literature of the greeks carrying down my history in a chain of anecdotes from the earliest poets to the death of menander to this part of my work i have addressed my greatest pains and attention i believe the plan is so far my own that nobody has yet given the account in so compressed and unmixt a state as i shall do and none i think will envy me the labor of turning over such a mass of heavy materials for the sake of selecting what i hoped would be acceptable in the relation though i cannot suppose i am free from error i can safely say i have asserted nothing without authority but it did not suit the purpose of the work to make a display of those authorities as it was my wish to level it to readers of all descriptions the translations i shall occasionally give will be of such authors or rather fragments of authors as come under few peoples review and have never been seen in an english version these passages therefore will have the merit of novelty at least with most readers and if i succeed in naturalizing to any degree authors whose names only float amongst us i shall not think that what has been the heaviest part of my undertaking has been the most unprofitable as i mean this to be a kind of liber circumcurrens i have thought it not amiss to entitle it the observer  no ii there is a pretty numerous sect of philosophers in this kingdom whom i cannot describe by any apter denomination than that of dampers they are to be known in society by a sudden damp which they are sure to cast upon all companies where they enter the human heart that comes within their atmosphere never fails to be chilled and the quickest sense of feeling is as effectually benumbed as the touch is with the torpedo as this sect is of very ancient standing in the world and has been taken notice of by several heathen writers i have sometimes thought that it might originate in the school of thales who held water to be the first principle of all things if i were certain that this ancient philosopher always administered his water cold to his disciples i should incline to think the present sect of dampers was really a branch from the thalesian root for it is certain they make great use of his first principle in the philosophy they practice  the business of these philosophers in society is to check the flights and sallies of those volatile beings who are subject to be carried away by imagination and fancy or in other words to act as a counterpoise against genius of the vices of mankind they take little notice but they are at great pains to correct their vanity they have various receipts for curing this evil the ordinary method is by keeping stern silence and an unmoved visage in companies which are disposed to be cheerful this taciturnity if well kept up never fails in the end to work a cure upon festivity according to the first principle of thales if the damper looks morose every body wonders what the moody gentleman is displeased with and each in his turn suspects himself in the fault if he only looks wise all are expecting when the dumb oracle will utter and in the mean time his silence infects the whole circle if the damper seasons his taciturnity with a shrug of the shoulders or a shake of the head judiciously thrown in when any talkative fellow raises a laugh it is ten to one if the mortified wit ever opens his mouth again for that evening if a story is told in his company and the teller makes a slip in a date or a name a true damper may open provided it is done agreably to the rules of his order by setting the storyteller right with much gravity and adjusting the mistake so deliberately that the spirit of the story shall be sure to evaporate before the commentator has properly settled his correction of the text if any lucky wit chances to say what is called a good thing and the table applauds it is a dampers duty to ask an explanation of the joke or whether that was all and what the other gentleman said who was the butt of the jest and other proper questions of the like sort if one of the company risques a sally for the sake of goodfellowship which is a little on the wrong side of truth or not strictly reducible to proof a damper may with great propriety set him right in the matter of fact and demonstrate as clear as two and two make four that what he has said may be mathematically confuted and that the merry gentleman is mistaken a damper is to keep strict watch over the morals of the company and not to suffer the least indiscretion to escape in the warmth of conviviality on this occasion he must be ready to call to order and to answer for his friend to the company that he has better principles than he affects to have that he should be sorry such and such an opinion went out against him and that he is certain he forgot himself when he said so and so if any glance is made at private characters however notorious a damper steps in with a recommendation of candor and inveighs most pathetically against the sin of evilspeaking he is never merry in company except when any one in it is apparently out of spirits and with such an one he is always exceedingly pleasant  a damper is so professed an enemy to flattery that he never applies it in ever so small a degree even to the most diffident he never chears a young author for fear of marring his modesty never sinks truths because they are disagreable and if any one is rashly enjoying the transports of public fame on account of some successful production in art or science the damper kindly tells him what such and such a critic has scoffingly said on the occasion and if nothing better offers lowers his triumphs with a paragraph from a newspaper which his thoughtless friend might else have overlooked he is remarkably careful not to spoil young people by making allowances for spirits or inexperience or by indulging them in an opinion of their persons or accomplishments he has many excellent apothegms in his mouth ready to recommend to those who want them such as to be merry and wise  a grain of truth is better than an ounce of wit  a fools bolt is soon shot but a wise man keeps his within the quiver  he that was only taught by himself had a fool to his master  and many more of the like sort  the following letter will serve to show in what sort of estimation this sect of dampers was held by a roman author who was one of the finest gentlemen of his time  pliny to restitutus melmoths translation  i cannot forbear pouring out my indignation before you in a letter since i have no opportunity of doing so in person against a certain behavior which gave me some offense in an assembly where i was lately present the company was entertained with the recital of a very finished performance but there were two or three persons among the audience men of great genius in their own and a few of their friends estimation who sat like so many mutes without so much as moving a lip or a hand or once rising from their seats even to shift their posture but to what purpose in the name of good sense all this wondrous air of wisdom and solemnity or rather indeed to give it its true appellation of this proud indolence is it not downright folly or even madness thus to be at the expense of a whole day merely to commit a piece of rudeness and leave him an enemy whom you visited as a friend is a man conscious that he possesses a superior degree of eloquence than the person whom he attends upon on such an occasion so much the rather ought he to guard against every appearance of envy as a passion that always implies inferiority wherever it resides but whatever a mans talent may be whether greater or equal or less than his friends still it is his interest to give him the approbation he deserves if greater or equal because the higher his glory rises whom you equal or excel the more considerable yours must necessarily be if less because if one of more exalted abilities does not meet with applause neither possibly can you for my own part i honor and revere all who discover any degree of merit in the painful and laborious art of oratory for eloquence is a high and haughty dame who scorns to reside with those that despise her but perhaps you are not of this opinion yet who has a greater regard for this glorious science or is a more candid judge of it than yourself in confidence of which i chose to vent my indignation particularly to you as not doubting you would be the first to share with me in the same sentiments  farewell  the romans were much in the habit of reading their unpublished performances to select parties and sometimes no doubt put the patience and politeness of their hearers to a severe trial i conceive that this practice does not obtain to any great degree amongst us at present neither is it a thing to be recommended to young authors except under peculiar circumstances for they certainly expose themselves and their hearers to a situation very delicate at best and which sometimes leads to unpleasant consequences i am aware how much is to be expected from the judicious remarks of a critic who will correct with all the malice of a friend yet a man so qualified and disposed is not easily found and does not often fall within the list of an authors acquaintance men who read their works in circles or to any but the most select friends read for no other purpose but for admiration and applause they cannot possibly expect criticism and it is accordingly agreed upon by all but the sect of the dampers either to keep out of such circles or to pay their quota when the reckoning is cast up few but men of quick and lively parts are forward to recite in such societies and these are the very men who are most pained by neglect for i think it is a remark with as few exceptions to it as most general remarks have that brilliant talents are attended with extreme sensibility and the effects of sensibility bear such resemblance to the effects of vanity that the undiscerning multitude are too apt to confound them these are the men who in their progress through life are most frequently misunderstood and generally less pitied than they ought to be  now a damper will tell you that he is consulting such a mans good and lowering his vanity when he is sporting with his feelings and will take merit to himself for the discipline he gives him but humanity will reflect that the same spirits which are prone to exult upon success are proportionably agonized by the failure of it and will therefore prompt us to a gentler treatment of such persons  the sums which are expended in this nation upon those refined enjoyments which are produced by the expertness of the hands and the ingenuity of the head are certainly very great and men are therefore apt to exclaim see what encouragement this country gives to arts and sciences if money were the standard measure of encouragement there could be no dispute in the case but so long as men have a feeling for their pride as well as for their pocket money alone will not encourage and promote the genius of a nation it is the grace of doing a favor which constitutes its merit it is from the manners of the great that the man of rising talents is to draw that inspiriting consideration of himself that stimulating pride of nature which are to push his efforts toward perfection  a limner will take a canvass and chalk out a mans face he has never seen before and hang on his robes or his garter if he has one or will put a horse in his hand if he likes it better or make a battle in the back ground if he was ever within hearing of one and when the job is finished will be paid the price of his labor like any other mechanic the money he may spend or put to use and if customers come in he may raise his price upon them and the world may call those profits an encouragement but the painter is still a tradesman and his fitter not a patron but a customer the mercer whose damask clothes the walls of the noblemans saloon and the artist whose pictures hang round it are in the same predicament as to encouragement whilst neither of them are admitted into the house they contribute to adorn  as i have made this remark with a reference to the dampers in high life i am aware that there are many eminent encouragers of the arts and sciences amongst the rich and liberal nay so general is their protection that it comprehends a numerous importation of exotic toothdrawers dancers and milliners who find that england is the nursery of genius even the magnifying philosopher of piccadilly unless he multiplies as well as magnifies has shown his wonders so frequently and to such prodigious numbers that it is to be doubted if they shall continue to be wonders much longer  there were men in ancient greece no doubt who talked though zeno chose to hold his tongue when certain ambassadors had invited him to supper that they might report his sayings to their sovereign what shall we say of you to our master the foreigners demanded say that i had the wisdom to hold my tongue replied the stoic though i am clearly of opinion that this great master of silence was an intolerable damper and made a very poor return to these same hospitable ambassadors for their good entertainment of him yet i am not quite so ready with my answer to a certain female correspondent who in consequence of some discourse upon dampers the other day in a company where she was present favored me with the following short but curious epistle  sir i have the misfortune to be married to an elderly gentleman who has taken strange things in his head of late and is for ever snubbing me before folks especially when the captain is in company twas but the other night he broke up a party of hotcockles in the back parlour and would not let the captain take a civil salute though i assured him it was only a forfeit at questions and commands  i dont know what he means by saying he will put a spoke in my wheel but i suspect it is some jealousy matter  pray sir is not my husband what you call a damper  yours lucy loveit   no iii the desire of praise is natural but when that appetite becomes canine it is no longer in nature a taste of it is pleasant to most men temperance itself will take a little but the stomach sickens with a surfeit of it and the palate nauseates the debauch  let the passion for flattery be ever so inordinate the supply can keep pace with the demand and in the worlds great market in which wit and folly drive their bargains with each other there are traders of all sorts some keep a stall of offals some a storehouse of delicacies a squeamish palate must be forced by alluring provocatives a foul feeder will swallow any trash that he can get hold of  in a recent publication of the history of the emperor charles the fifth written by sepulveda of cordova a contemporary and favorite of that famous monarch the academy of history at madrid in their dedication to his present catholic majesty address him in the following words  nam quem tu carole rex ut nomine refers ita etiam bellica laud jampridem aemularis when these courtly academicians have thus mounted their peaceable sovereign on the warhorse of the victorious charles they seriously proceed to tell him that being fully equal to his predecessor in his martial character he is out of all distance superior to him in every other kingly quality more wise more politic more magnanimous and as the present work can testify a greater friend to learning than all that ever went before him and if they may risque a prediction there will probably be none to come in competition with him hereafter  if his catholic majesty shall ever come to an understanding of this paragraph and strike a fair comparison between himself and his illustrious namesake i should not be surprised if the next work his academicians shall be employed in proves the fortifications of ceuta  when i compare the state of flattery in a free country with that which obtains in arbitrary states it is a consolation to find that this mean principle is not natural to mankind for it certainly abates in proportion as independency advances this will be very evident to any one who compares the flattery of elizabeths and jamess days with the present ben johnson for instance was a surly poet yet how fulsome are his masks in his news from the new world he says of james  read him as you would do the book of all perfections and but look what his proportions be no measure that is thence contrived or any motion thence derived but is pure harmony   this poet though he was rather a clumsy flatterer of his prince was ingenious enough in the mode he took for flattering himself by introducing a kind of chorus wherein he takes occasion to tell his hearers that careless of all vulgar censure as not depending on common approbation he is confident his plays shall superplease judicious spectators and to them he leaves it to work with the rest by example or otherwise it is remarkable that this passage should be found in his magnetic lady and that he should speak with such confidence of one of his worst productions as if he was determined to force a bad comedy upon the hearers by the authority of his own recommendation this is an evident imitation of aristophanes who in his comedy of the clouds holds the same language to his audience fairly telling them he shall estimate their judgment according to the degree of applause they shall bestow upon his performance then before them in conclusion he inveighs against certain of his contemporaries eupolis phrynichus and hermippus with whose comedies if any of his audience is well pleased that person he hopes will depart from his dissatisfied but if they condemn his rivals and applaud him he shall think better of their judgment for the future act   sc    the caution authors now proceed with shows the refinement of the times still they can contrive in a modest way to say civil things of themselves and it would be hard indeed to disappoint them of so slight a gratification  for what praise is so little to be envied as that which a man bestows on himself several of our diurnal essayists have contrived under the veil of fiction to hook in something recommendatory of themselves which they mean should pass for truth such is the intelligent taciturnity of the spectator and the solemn integrity of the guardian  the latter in one of his papers notices the ambition of some authors to prefix engravings of their portraits to their title pages his ridicule has not quite laughed this fashion out of countenance for i perceive it is still in existence and i frequently meet the face of an old acquaintance looking through the windows of a booksellers shop one very ingenious gentleman whose beauty is amongst the least of his recommendations has very prudently stamped his age upon his print in the same shop window with this gentleman i observed with great pleasure an elegant author standing by him as erect as a dart firm and collected in the awful moment of beginning a minuet i own i regret that the honest butler who has regaled the age with a treatise on ale and strong beer has not hung out his own head in the front of his book as a sign of the good entertainment within  but of all the instances of faceflattery i have lately met with that of a worthy citizen surprised me most whose comptinghouse i entered the other day and found an enormous portrait of my friend in a flaming drapery of blue and gold mounted upon the back of a warhorse which the limner has made to rear so furiously that i was quite astonished to see my friend who is no great jockey keep his seat so steadily he confessed to me that he had consented to be drawn on horseback to please his wife and daughters who chose the attitude for his own part it made him quite giddy to look at himself and he frequently desired the painter not to let the horse prance so but to no purpose  too great avidity of praise will sometimes betray an author into a studied attempt at fine writing where the thought will not carry the style writers of this sort are like those tasteless dabblers in architecture who turn the gableends of barns and cottages into castles and temples and spend a world of plaistering and pains to decorate a pigstye they bring to my mind a ridiculous scene at which i was present the other day i found a lady of my acquaintance busily employed in the domestic education of her only son the preceptor was in the room and was standing in an attitude very much resembling the erect gentleman i had seen that morning in the booksellers window the boy kept his eyes fixed and seemed to govern his motions by certain signals of the feet and arms which he repeated from the preceptor in the course of my conversation with his mother i chanced to drop my glove upon the floor upon which he approached to pick it up but in a step so measured and methodical that i had done the office for myself before he had performed his advances as i was about to resume the conversation the mother interrupted me by desiring i would favor her so far as to drop my glove again that bobby might have the honor of presenting it to me in proper form all this while the boy stood as upright as an arrow perfectly motionless but no sooner had i thrown down my gauntlet than he began to put one foot slowly in advance before the other upon which the preceptor of politeness cried out one  first position  the boy then made another movement of his feet upon which the master repeated  two  second position  this was followed by another and the echo again cried out  three very well  third position bend your body slowly  at the word of command the automaton bent its body very deliberately its arms hanging down in parallel perpendiculars to the floor like the forelegs of a quadruped the glove being now taken up by the right hand was placed with great decorum upon the back of the left hand the trunk of the animal was slowly restored to its erect position and the glove presented with all due solemnity as i was in hopes the ceremony was now over upon hearing the teacher cry bravo i thought it time to make my compliment of thank you pretty master but i was again in a mistake for the mother begged me not to hurry her dear bobby but allow him time to make his bow and still hold the glove in my hand this was an operation of no slight consequence for in the time it took him up a nimble artist might have made the glove at last however it was over and the boy was putting himself in order of retreat when the master observing that i had omitted the necessary bend of my wrist upon receiving the glove for want of which the whole had been imperfect proposed a repetition of the maneuver in which bobby should be the dropper and himself the picker up of the glove this proposal struck me with such horror that taking a hasty leave of the lady in which first second and third position were probably huddled all together i departed repeating to myself in the words of foigard all this may be very fine but upon my soul it is very ridiculous  no iv lady thimble is one of those female pedants who with quick animal spirits a pert imagination great selfconceit and a homely person sets herself up for a woman of talents she has as much of the learned languages as a boardingschool girl carries home of french upon her first holidays when miss assures you she can call for what she wants and though she wont utter a word in the parlour from pretended modesty insults the ignorance of the chambermaid with an eternal jargon of bad grammar worse pronounced this learned lady is the only child of a wealthy trader of the city of london who having never advanced in his own education beyond the erudition of the comptinghouse took care his daughter should be instructed in every thing he did not understand himself and as the girl grew exceedingly vain of the applause of the pedagogue who read to her the merchant grew as vain of the scholarship of his child and would listen to the sound of latin or greek with as much superstitious respect as a gentoo does to the shanscrite language of the brahmins  miss in the mean time became an insufferable slattern in her clothes and person her handkerchiefs and aprons were full of ironmoulds from the drippings of the inkhorn and her stockings full of holes from her neglect of the needle these were in fact badges of affectation rather than of oversight and you could not pay your court to her better than by rallying her about them she wore a head of false hair not because her own was thin but because a wig was thrown on in an instant this was sometimes done with a negligence that seemed studied and when the learned ventosus vouchsafed to visit her she was sure to wear her wig awry as alexanders courtiers did their heads in honor of her guest there was indeed an unseemly humor settled in her nose but this she got by studying lock upon the human understanding after dinner before she could develope the whole doctrine of innate ideas the humor deepened many shades which however on the whole may be allowed to be getting off pretty well for a student in metaphysics no face could bear the addition of a red nose better than lady thimbles but a more alarming accident had befallen her in her astronomical studies for as she was following a comet in its perihelion through the solutions of sir isaac newton her cap caught fire and she was forced to break off in the midst of a proposition by which means she dropped a stitch in the demonstration and never was able to take it up again her skin being cruelly scorched by this system of the comets she wears a crimson scar upon her cheek not indeed as an ornament to her beauty but as a trophy of her science  her works are pretty voluminous especially in manuscript but censorious people affect to whisper that she performed one work in concert with the pedant her master and that though this composition was brought secretly into the world it is the only one of her producing that bids fair for posterity this story and the remark upon it i had from a lady who is one of her intimate friends but she assured me she gave no credit to it herself and considered all such scandalous insinuations as the effects of malice and envy  at the age of seven and twenty by the persuasion of her father she was joined in the bands of wedlock to sir theodore thimble this gentleman had been lately dubbed a knight for his services to the crown in bringing up a county address his father mr david thimble had been an eminent tailor in the precincts of st clements in which business he had by his industry and other methods raised a very respectable fortune in money bookdebts and remnants in his latter years mr thimble purchased a considerable estate in essex with a fine old mansion upon it the last remaining property of an ancient family this venerable seat during the life of mr thimble remained uncontaminated by the presence of its possessor but upon his death it fell into the occupation of young theodore who disdaining the crossleggd art by which his father had worked himself into opulence set out upon a new establishment and figured off as the first gentleman of his family he served as sheriff of the county and acquired great reputation in that high office by the elegant and well cut liveries which he exhibited at the assizes a lucky address from the county gave him a title and the recommendation of a good settlement procured him his present lady whom we have been describing  as i have been in long habits of friendship with the worthy citizen her father i could not resist the many pressing invitations he gave me to pay a visit to his daughter and sir theodore at their country seat especially as he prefaced it by assuring me i should see the happiest couple in england and that although i had frequently opposed his system of education i should now be convinced that arabella made as good a housewife and understood the conduct of her family as well as if she had studied nothing else and this he was sure i would confess if he could prevail with me to accompany him to her house  on the day following this conversation we set out together and in a few hours found ourselves at the promised spot as i remembered this fine old mansion in the days of its primitive simplicity when i was ushered to its gate through a solemn avenue of branching elms that arched over head in lofty foliage and formed an approach in perfect unison with the ancient fashion of the place i must own i was much revolted to find that sir theodore had begun his improvements with a specimen of his fathers art by cutting an old coat into a new fashion my favorite avenue no longer existed the venerable tenants of the soil were rooted up and a parcel of dotted clumps composed of trumpery shrubs substituted in their places i was the more disgusted when i perceived that by the nonsensical zigzaggery of the road through which we meandered i was to keep company with these newfashioned upstarts through as many parallels as would serve for the regular approaches to a citadel at one of these turnings however i caught the glimpse of a welldressed gentleman standing in a very becoming attitude who i concluded must be the master of the mansion waiting our approach and as i perceived he had his hat under his arm expecting us with great politeness and civility i instantly took mine from my head and called to our driver to stop the carriage for that i perceived sir theodore was come out to meet us my companion was at this time exceedingly busy in directing my attention to the beauties of his soninlaws improvements so that i had stopped the chaise before he observed what i was looking at but how was i surprised to find in place of sir theodore a leaden statue on a pair of scates painted in a blue and gold coat with a red waistcoat whose person upon closer examination i recollected to have been acquainted with some years ago amongst the elegant group which a certain celebrated artist exhibits to the amusement of stagecoaches and country wagons upon their entrance into town at hydepark corner i was happy to find that this ridiculous mistake instead of embarrassing my friend occasioned infinite merriment and was considered as so good a joke by all the family upon our arrival that i am persuaded it was in the mind of the improver when he placed him there for the jest was followed up by several other partycolored personages cast to the life gentlemen and ladies who were airing themselves upon pedestals to the no small delight of my companion and though most of these witticisms in lead were of the comic cast one group of a mountebank in the act of drawing an old womans tooth was calculated to move the contrary passion and this i observed was the last in the company standing in view from the windows of the house as the moral of the fable we now entered a chinese fence through a gate of the same fashion to the side of which was affixed a board on which i observed at some distance a writing in fair characters this i suspected to be some classical text which my lady had set up to impress her visiters with a due respect for her learning but upon a near approach i found it contained a warning to all interlopers that mentraps and springguns were concealed in those walks  in this dangerous defile we were encountered by a servant in livery who was dispatched in great haste to stop our driver and desire us to alight as the gravel was newly laid down and a late shower had made it very soft my friend readily obeyed the arrest but i confess the denunciation of traps and guns was so formidable to my mind that i took no step but with great circumspection and forecast for fear i was treading on a mine or touching a spring with my foot and was heartily glad when i found myself on the steps though even these i examined with some suspicion before i trusted myself upon them  as we entered the house my friend the merchant whispered me that we were now in my ladys regions all without doors was sir theodores taste all within was here is  but as here a new scene was opened i shall reserve my account to another paper  no v our visit to sir theodore and lady thimble being unexpected we were shown into the common parlour where this happy couple were sitting over a good fire with a middleaged man of athletic size who was reposing in an elbow chair in great state with his mull in his hand and with an air so selfimportant as plainly indicated him to be the dictator of this domestic circle  when the first salutations were over lady thimble gave her orders to the servant in the style of lucullus to prepare the apollo declaring herself ashamed to receive a gentleman of talents in any other apartment i beseeched her to let us remain where we were dreading a removal from a comfortable fireside to a cold stately apartment for the season was severe i was so earnest in my request that sir theodore ventured in the most humble manner to second my suit the consequence of which was a smart reprimand accompanied with one of those expressive looks which ladies of high prerogative in their own houses occasionally bestow to husbands under proper subjection and i saw with pity the poor gentleman dispatched for his officiousness upon a freezing errand through a great hall to see that things were set in order and make report when they were ready i could not help giving my friend the merchant a significant look upon this occasion but he prudently kept silence waiting with great respect the dreadful order of march  my lady now introduced me to the athletic philosopher in the elbowchair who condescended to relax one half of his features into a smile and with a gracious waving of his hand or rather fist dismissed me back again to my seat without uttering a syllable she then informed me that she had a treat to give me which she flattered herself would be a feast entirely to my palate i assured her ladyship i was always happiest to take the familydinner of my friends adding that in truth the sharp air had sufficiently whetted my appetite to recommend much humbler fare than i was likely to find at her table she smiled at this and told me it was the food of the mind that she was about to provide for me she undertook for nothing else culinary concerns were not her province if i was hungry she hoped there would be something to eat but for her part she left the care of her kitchen to those who lived in it whilst she was saying this methought the philosopher gave her a look that seemed to say he was of my way of thinking upon which she rung the bell and ordered dinner to be held back for an hour saying to the philosopher she thought we might have a canto in that time  she now paused for some time fixing her eyes upon him in expectation of an answer but none being given nor any signal of assent she rose and observing that it was surprising to think what sir theodore could be about all this while for she was sure the apollo must be ready without more delay bade us follow her come sir says she to me as i passed the great hall with an aching heart and chattering teeth you shall now have a treat in your own taste and meeting one of the domestics by the way bade him tell calliope to come into the apollo  when i set my foot into the room i was immediately saluted by something like one of those ungenial breezes which travelers inform us have the faculty of putting an end to life and all its cares at a stroke a fire indeed had been lighted which poor sir theodore was soliciting into a blaze working the bellows with might and main to little purpose for the billets were so wet that apollo himself with all his beams would have been foiled to set them in a flame the honest gentleman had taken the precaution of opening all the windows in spite of which no atom of smoke passed up the chimney but came curling into the room in columns as thick as if a hecatomb had been offering to the shrine of delphi indeed this was not much to be wondered at for i soon discovered that a board had been fixed across the flue of the chimney which sir theodore in his attention to the bellows had neglected to observe i was again the unhappy cause of that poor gentlemans unmerited rebuke and in terms much severer than before it was to no purpose he attempted to bring susan the housemaid in for some share of the blame his plea was disallowed and though i must own it was not the most manly defense in the world yet considering the unhappy culprit as the son of a tailor i thought it not entirely inadmissible  when the smoke cleared up i discovered a cast of the belvidere apollo on a pedestal in a niche at the upper end of the room but if we were to judge by the climate this chamber must have derived its name from apollo by the rule of lucus a non lucendo as soon as we were seated and lady thimble had in some degree composed her spirits she began to tell me that the treat she had to give me was the rehearsal of part of an epic poem written by a young lady of seventeen who was a miracle of genius and whose talents for composition were so extraordinary that she had written a treatise on female education whilst she was at the boardingschool which all the world allowed to be a wonderful work for one of such an early age there was no escape for calliope herself now entered the room and dinner was put back a full hour for the luxury of hearing a canto of a boardingschool girls epic poem read by herself in the presence of apollo the scottish philosopher had prudently kept his post by the parlour fire and i alone was singled out as the victim sir theodore and his fatherinlaw being considered only as expletives to fill up the audience calliope was enthroned in a chair at the pedestal of apollo whilst lady thimble and i took our seats opposite to the reader  i was now to undergo an explanation of the subject matter of this poem this was undertaken and performed by lady thimble whilst the young poetess was adjusting her manuscript the subject was allegorical the title was the triumph of reason who was the hero of the piece the inferior characters were the human passions personified each passion occupied a canto and the lady had already dispatched a long list if i rightly remember we were to hear the fourteenth canto in thirteen actions the hero reason had been victorious but it was exceedingly doubtful how he would come off in this for the antagonist he had to deal with was no less a personage than almighty love himself the meter was heroic and many of the thoughts displayed a juvenile fancy and wild originality the action was not altogether uninteresting nor illmanaged and victory for a while was held in suspense by a wound the hero received from an arrow somewhere in the region of the heart for this wound he could obtain no cure till an ancient physician after many experiments for his relief cut out the part affected with his scythe upon the whole the poem was such that had it not been allegorical and had not i been cold and hungry i could have found much to commend and some things to admire even though the poetess had been twice as old and not half so handsome for calliope was extremely pretty and i could plainly discover that nature meant her to be most amiable and modest if flattery and false education would have suffered her good designs to have taken place i therefore looked upon her with pity as i do on all spoilt children and when her reading was concluded did not bestow all that praise which if i had consulted my own gratification more than her good i certainly should have bestowed the only occasion on which i think it a point of conscience to practice the philosophy of the dampers  at length dinner was announced and being a part of lady thimbles domestic economy which she had put out of her own hands as she informed us and in which i suspect the athletic philosopher had something to say it was plentifully served sir theodore and my friend the merchant plied him pretty briskly with the bottle but as a stately firstrate ship does not condescend to open her ports to the petty cruisers that presume to hail her in like manner this gigantic genius kept the oracle within him muzzled nor condescended once to draw the tompion of his lips till it happened in the course of many topics that lady thimble speaking of the talents of calliope observed that miracles were not ceased how should that thing be said to cease replied the oracle which never had existence the spring was now touched that put this vast machine in motion and taking infidelity in miracles for his text he carried us in the course of a long uninterrupted harangue through a series of learned deductions to what appeared his grand desideratum viz an absolute refutation of the miracles of christ by proofs logical and historical whilst this discourse was going on i was curious to observe the different effects it had on the company lady thimble received it with evident marks of triumph so that i could plainly see all was gospel with her and the only gospel she had faith in sir theodore wisely fell asleep the merchant was in his comptinghouse  his mind was tossing on the ocean there where his argosies with portly sail like seigniors and rich burghers on the flood or as it were the pageants of the sea did overpeer the petty traffickers  but all this while the young unsettled thoughts of calliope were visibly wavering sometimes borne away by the ipse dixit of the philosopher and the echo of lady thimbles plaudits sometimes catching hold of hope and hanging to the anchor of her salvation faith at other times without resistance carried down the tide of declamation which rolled rapidly along in provincial dialect like a torrent from his native highland craggs rough and noisy i saw her struggles with infinite concern the savage saw them also but with triumph and turning his discourse upon the breach he had made in her belief pressed the advantage he had gained with devilish address in short a new antagonist had started up more formidable to reason than all the fourteen from whose attack she had brought her hero off with victory and that champion which had resisted the arrows of allpowerful love was likely now to fall a victim to the pestilential breath of infidelity in this dilemma i was doubtful how to act i did not decline the combat because i dreaded the strength of this goliath of the philistines for i knew the weapons might be confided in which the great captain of salvation had put into my hands but i disdained to plead before a prejudiced tribunal in which the mistress of the mansion sat as judge and as sleep had secured one of the company out of harms way and another was upon an excursion from which i did not wish to bring him home there remained only calliope and i determined within myself to take occasion of discoursing with her apart before i lest the house next morning  no vi i had resolved to have some conversation with calliope after the athletic philosophers harangue against the evidences of the christian religion i was at the pains of putting my thoughts together in writing before i went to bed for i judged it best to give them to calliope in such a form as she might hereafter at any time refer to and examine  i had the satisfaction of an hours conversation with that young lady next morning before the family had assembled for breakfast i could observe that something dwelt upon her mind and demanding of her if i was not right in my conjecture she answered me at once to the point without hesitation  i confess to you says she that the discourse which dr macinfidel yesterday held has made me thoroughly unhappy things which are above reason i can readily suppose are mysteries which i ought to admit as matter of faith in religion but things contrary to reason and facts which history confutes how am i to believe what am i to do in this case have you any thing to oppose to his argument if you have i should be happy to hear it if you have not i pray you let us talk no more upon the subject  i then gave the paper into her hand which i had prepared and explaining to her the reasons i had for not taking up the dispute before our company yesterday desired her to give my paper a serious reading if there was any thing in it that laid out of the course of her studies i would gladly do my best to expound it and would show her the authorities to which it referred she received my paper with the best grace in the world and promised me that she would consider it with all the attention she was mistress of  in our further discourse it chanced that i let drop some expressions in commendation of her understanding and talents upon which i observed she gave me a very expressive look and when i would have spoken of her poem she shook her head and hastily interrupting me desired i would spare her on that subject she did not wish to be any more flattered in a folly she had too much cause to repent of she had burnt the odious poem i was speaking of and bursting suddenly into a flood of tears protested she would never be guilty of writing another line of poetry while she lived  no words of mine can paint the look and action which accompanied these expressions much less can i describe the stroke of pity and surprise which her emotion gave me it was evident she alluded to something that had occurred since the reading of the poem i recollected she was absent all the latter part of the evening and i felt an irresistible propensity to enquire into the cause of her affliction though the shortness of our acquaintance gave me no right to be inquisitive she saw my difficulty for her intuition is very great after a short recollection which i did not attempt to interrupt  i know not how it is says she but something tells me i am speaking to a friend  here she paused as doubting whether she ought to proceed or not and fixed her eyes upon the floor in evident embarrassment it will readily be supposed i seized the opportunity to induce her to confide in me if there was any service i could render toward alleviating the distress she was evidently suffering  i have no right to trouble you says she but that fatal argument i heard last night has so weakened the resource to which my mind in all afflictions would else have naturally applied that i really know not how to support myself nor where to look for comfort but by throwing myself upon your friendship for advice as the most unhappy of all beings you must know i have the honor to be the daughter of that gallant sea officer captain  here she named an officer who will be ever dear to his country ever deplored by it and whose friendship is at once the joy and the affliction of my life i started from my seat the stroke i felt when she pronounced a name so rooted in my heart was like the shock of electricity i clasped her hands in mine and pressing them exclaimed  you have a father  here i stopped  the recollection checked me from proceeding  for it was false  no no my child i said you have no father nor had he a friend who can replace your loss however pray proceed  implicitly replied calliope for by that name i still must beg to call her though that and poetry are both renounced for ever as you are the friend of my father you must know that he lost my mother when i was an infant two years are now passed since he perished a miserable period it has been to me i am now under the protection of a distant relation who is an intimate of the lady of this house and one whose ruinous flattery jointly with lady thimbles has conspired to turn my wretched head and blast the only hope of happiness i had in life these learned ladies as they would be thought put me upon studies i was never fitted to gave me this silly name calliope and never ceased inflaming my vanity till they persuaded me i had a talent for poetry in this they were assisted by macinfidel who lives in great intimacy with lady thimble the adulation of a learned man for that he surely is intoxicated me with selfopinion and the gravity of his character completed the folly and destruction of mine what do i hear said i interrupting her the destruction of your character  have patience she replied when i disclose the sorrows of my heart you will own that my destruction is complete  melancholy as these words were the deduction notwithstanding that i drew from them was a relief compared to what at first i apprehended  alas sir resumed calliope i have lost the affections of the most amiable the most beloved of men he was my fathers darling and from a boy was educated by him in the profession of the sea he shared every service with my father except the last fatal one in which your friend unhappily was lost providence that ordained the death of the one has in the same period enriched the other he is lately returned from the west indies and by his duty has been confined to the port he arrived in so that we have not met since his return to england here is the first letter he wrote to me from plymouth read it i beseech you and then compare it with the fatal one i received last night calliope put a letter into my hands and i read as follows   my dearest nancy i have this instant brought my frigate to an anchor and seize the first moment that my duty permits to tell the loveliest of her sex that i have luckily come across a prize that makes a man of me for life a man did i say yes and the happiest of men if my dear girl is still true and will consent to share the fortune of her faithful henry  i cannot leave plymouth this fortnight therefore pray write to me under cover to my friend the admiral  yours ever henry constant   when i had returned this letter to calliope she resumed her narrative in the following words the joy this letter gave me set my spirits in such a flow that in the habit i was of writing verses i could not bring my thoughts to run in humble prose but giving the reins to my fancy filled at least six sides with rhapsodies in verse and not content with this and foolishly conceiving that my poem would appear at least as charming to henry as the flattery of my own sex had persuaded me it was to them i enclosed a fair copy and sent it to him in a packet by the stagecoach the next return of the post brought me this fatal letter i received last night  madam though there cannot be in this world a task so painful to me as what i am now about to perform yet i think it an indispensible point of honor to inform my late most lovely and beloved nancy that if i am to suppose her the author of that enormous bundle of verses i have received from her hand it is the last favor that hand must bestow upon her unhappy henry  my education you know for it was formed under your most excellent father i served with him from a child and he taught me not indeed the knack of making verses but what i hope has been as useful to my country the duties of an officer being his daughter i had flattered myself you would not like me the less for following his profession or for being trained to it under his instruction but alas nancy all these hopes are gone my ignorance would only disgrace you and your wit would make me contemptible since you are turned poetess how can my society be agreeable if those verses you have sent me are all of your own making you must have done little else since we parted and if such are to be your studies and occupations what is to become of all the comforts of a husband how are you to fulfill the duties of a mother or manage the concerns of a family no no may heaven defend me from a learned wife i am too proud to be the butt of my own table too accustomed to command to be easily induced to obey let me ever live a single man or let the wife i choose be modest unpretending simple natural in her manners plain in her understanding let her be true as the compass i sail by and pardon the coarseness of the allusion obedient to the helm as the ship i steer then nancy i will stand by my wife as i will by my ship to the latest moment i have to breathe for gods sake what have women to do with learning but if they will step out of their own profession and write verses do not let them step into ours to choose husbands we shall prove coarse messmates to the muses  i understand so much of your poetical epistle as to perceive that you are in the family of sir theodore and lady thimble three days of such society would make me forswear matrimony for ever to the daughter of my friend i must for ever speak and act as a friend suffer me then to ask if any man in his senses will choose a wife from such a school oh grief to think that one so natural so sincere and unaffected as was my nancy could be the companion of such an ugly petticoated pedant as lady thimble such a tame henpecked son of a tailor as sir theodore  as for the volume of verses you have sent me i dare say it is all very fine but i really do not comprehend three lines of it the battles you describe are what i never saw by sea or land and the people who fight them such as i have never been accustomed to serve with one gentleman i perceive there is who combats stoutly against love it is a good moral and i thank you for it cost what it may i will do my best to imitate your hero  farewell i must be only your most faithful friend henry constant   no vii magnum iter ad doctas proficisci cogor athenas propert i was agreeably surprised the other day with an unexpected visit from a country friend who once made a considerable figure in the fashionable world and with an elegant taste for the fine arts is possessed of many valuable paintings and sculptures of his own collecting in italy he told me that after six years absence from town he had made a journey purposely to regale his curiosity for a few days with the spectacles of this great capital and desired i would accompany him on his mornings tour to some of the eminent artists and afterward conduct him to the theater where he had secured himself a seat for the representation of mr southerns tragedy of the fatal marriage though i had just been honored with a card from vanessa purporting that she should hold the feast of reason that evening at her house where my company was expected i did not hesitate to accept the invitation of my country friend and excuse myself from that of vanessa though i must confess my curiosity was somewhat roused by the novelty of the entertainment to which i was bidden our day passed so entirely to the satisfaction of my candid companion that when we parted at night he shook me by the hand and with a smile of complacency declared that a day so spent would not disgrace the diary of pericles  when i had returned to my apartment this allusion of my friend to the age of pericles with the recollection of what had passed in the day threw me into a reverie in the course of which i fell asleep whilst my mind with more distinctness than is usual in dreaming pursued its waking train of thought after the following manner  i found myself in a stately portico which being on an eminence gave me the prospect of a city enclosing a prodigious circuit with groves gardens and fields seemingly set apart for martial exercises and sports the houses were not clustered into streets and alleys like our great trading towns but were placed apart and separated without any regular order as if each man had therein consulted his own particular taste and enjoyments i thought i never saw so delightful a place nor a people who lived so much at their ease i felt a freshness and salubrity in the climate that seemed to clear the brain and give a spring to the spirits and whole animal frame the sun was bright and glowing but the lightness of the atmosphere and a refreshing breeze qualified the heat in the most delicious manner as i looked about me with wonder and delight i observed a great many edifices of the purest architecture that seemed calculated for public purposes and wherever my eye went it was encountered by a variety of statues in brass or marble immediately at the foot of the steps leading to the portico in which i stood i observed a figure in brass of exquisite workmanship which by its attributes i believed designed to represent the heathen deity mercurius in the center of the city there was an edifice enclosed within walls which i took to be the citadel a rapid stream of clear water meandered about the place and was trained through groves and gardens in the most picturesque and pleasing manner while the prospect at distance was bounded by the sea  as i stood wrapped in contemplation of this new and brilliant scenery methought i was accosted by a middleaged man in a loose garment of fine purple who wore his hair after the manner of our ladies braided and coiled round upon the crown of his head with great care and delicacy to a considerable height and which i thought remarkable he had fastened the braids in several places with golden pins on which were several figures of small grasshoppers of the same metal behind him walked a servantyouth or slave carrying a light wicker chair for his master to repose in a custom that seemed to me to argue great effeminacy and looking about me i found it was pretty universal many of the bettermost sort of citizens being seated in the streets conversing at their ease though there was certainly nothing in the climate that made such an indulgence necessary  as i was eyeing this gentleman with a surprise that i must own had some small tincture of contempt in it he turned himself to me and in the most complaisant manner imaginable accosted me in my own language telling me he perceived i was a stranger in athens and if i was curious to see what was remarkable in the place he was ready to dedicate the day to my service to this courteous address i returned the best answer i was able adding that every thing was new to me and many things appeared admirable you will say so replied he before the day is past and yet i cannot show you in the space of a day the hundredth part of what this city contains worth a strangers observation of a certain arts and sciences are now carried to their utmost pitch and no future age i think will succeed in which the glory of the athenian commonwealth and the genius of its citizens shall be found superior to their present luster  the portico in which you stand continued the athenian is what we call pcile or the painted portico the brazen statue at the foot of the steps was raised by the nine archons in honor of mercurius agoraeus or the forensal and dedicated by them to the tribes that by its side is the statue of solon the other at some distance is the lawgiver lycurgus the gate before you on which you see those warlike trophies was so adorned in memory of the defeat of plistarchus who was brother of the famous cassander and commanded his cavalry and auxiliary troops in the action recorded these paintings behind you with which the portico is furnished and from which it has its name are all upon public subjects in commemoration of wise or valiant citizens the pictures on your right hand are by the celebrated polygnotus these on your left by micon equal to his rival in art but not in munificence for polygnotus would accept no other reward for his works than the fame inseparable from such eminent performances micon on the contrary was paid by the state there are several others by the hands of our great masters particularly that incomparable piece which represents the field of marathon a composition by the great panaenus brother of the statuary phidias but this as well as the others will demand a more particular description  examine this composition on your right it is the work of polygnotus you see two armies drawn up front to front and on the point of engaging these are the athenians the adverse troops are the lacedaemonians the scene is oenoe such is the contrivance of the artist that you are sure victory is to declare for the athenians though the battle is not yet commenced  in the opposite piece you see the battle of theseus with the amazons a capital composition by micon these warlike ladies are fighting on horseback with what wonderful art has the master expressed the character of athletic beauty without deviating into vulgarity and grossness if you recollect the lysistrata of aristophanes you will meet an elogium on this picture it is thus the sister arts encourage and support each other  now turn to polygnotuss side and look at that magnificent piece of art the painter has chosen for the subject of his composition the council of the grecian chiefs upon the violence done to cassandra by ajax after the capture of troy you see the brutal character of the man strongly expressed in the hero of the piece amongst that group of trojan captives cassandra is conspicuous that figure which represents laodice is worth your notice as being a portrait of elpinice a celebrated courtesan scrupulous people have taken offense at it but great painters will indulge themselves in these liberties and are fond of painting after beautiful nature of which i could give you innumerable examples  now let us in the last place regale our eyes with this inestimable battle of marathon by panaenus what think you of it was it not a reward worthy of the heroes who preserved their country on that glorious day which party is most honored by the work the master who wrought it or the valiant personages who are recorded by it it is a question difficult to decide you will observe three different groups in this superb composition describing three different periods of the action here you see the athenians and their allies the plataeans just commencing the action  there further removed in perspective the barbarians are defeated the slaughter is raging and the medes are plunging desperately into the marshy lake to avoid their pursuers examine the back ground and you see the phoenician galleys the barbarians are making a bold attack and the sea is covered with wrecks all mouths are open in applause of this picture and it was but the other day that the great orator demosthenes referred to it in a solemn harangue upon neaera as did eschines in his pleading against ctesiphon all our captains are taken from the life that general who is encouraging his troops is miltiades he is the hero of the piece and i can assure you the resemblance is in all points exact this is the portrait of callimachus the polemarck there you see the hero echetlus and this is the brave epizelus that athenian who is valiantly fighting is cynaegirus himself who lost both his hands in the action there goes an extraordinary story with that dog which is by his side and has seized the dying barbarian by the throat the faithful creature would not forsake his master he was killed in the action and is now deservedly immortalized in company with the illustrious heroes who are the subject of the piece those splendid warriors in the army of the medes who are standing in their chariots and calling to their troops are the generals datis and artaphanes they are drawn in a proud and swelling style and seem of a larger size and proportion than our athenian champions and the fact is that this group was inserted by another master they are by the hand of micon and perhaps do not exactly harmonize with the rest the silly athenians were piqued at their appearance and in a fit of jealousy punished micon by a fine for having painted them too flatteringly the painter suffered in his pocket but the people in my opinion were disgraced by the sentence this circumstance has given occasion for many on the part of micon to contest the honor of the painting with panaenus who in justice must be considered as principal author of the work and in course of time it may happen that posterity will be puzzled which master to ascribe it to  there are many more pictures well deserving your attentive notice particularly that by pamphilus which represents alomena with the heraclidae asking aid of the athenians against eurystheus and this inspired old figure by polygnotus with a lyre in his hand which is the portrait of no less a person than the great sophocles  but come let us be gone for we have much besides to see and i perceive zeno coming this way with his scholars to hold his lectures in this portico and i for one must confess i am no friend to the stoics or as we call them the zenonians  no viii ad vetustissimam et sapientissimam et diis carissimam et communem amasiam hominumque ac deorum terram athenas mittebaris  libanius in oratione from the painted portico in which my last was dated my athenian conductor took me to the ptolemaic gymnasium in which i observed several statues of mercury in marble and others of brass which he explained to me to be of ptolemy the founder juba and chrysippus the philosopher there was one of berosus the astrologer with a tongue of pure gold in commemoration of his divine predictions on one hand of me stood the doric temple of theseus enriched with some inestimable paintings of micon particularly one upon the subject of the fight of the lapithae and centaurs on the other hand was the ancient temple of the dioscuri in which i was shown many capital pictures by polygnotus it is here says my conductor we administer to the athenian youth that solemn oath which binds them not to desert their ranks in action but to perish when necessity so requires in defense of their country the form is rather long says he but this is the substance of the oath the prytaneum or courthouse was now in view where the magistracy of the city assemble for the dispatch of public business here i saw the venerable laws of solon in a chest of stone the statues of pax and vesta and which were more interesting to me the figures of miltiades and themistocles of exquisite workmanship in pure marble in this place all those citizens and the posterity of those who have deserved well of the state receive their public doles or allowance of bread in cakes composed of meal oil and water here also i saw the perpetual fire upon the altar of vesta and the celebrated image of the bona fortuna of the athenians in the adjoining temple of lucina i was shown the famous statues of that deity clothed in drapery to the feet my guide now carried me to the great temple of olympian jupiter founded by the tyrant pisistratus and perfected by his sons and successors i observed to my conductor that i had seen no temple in athens except this with interior columns he informed me that the great span of the roof made it necessary in this instance but that it was contrary to their rule of architecture and obtained in no other he further told me that the city had expended ten thousand talents in this edifice the image of the god was cut in ivory and gold to every column was affixed a brazen statue representing the colonial cities of the athenian empire the display of statuary exceeded all description or belief nor was the painters art wanting in its share of the decoration for wherever pictures could be disposed and particularly about the pedestal of the statue of jupiter the most capital paintings were to be seen  my sight was now so dazzled with the display of brilliant images and my mind so overpowered with the miracles of art which had passed in review that i beseeched my guide to carry me either to some of those groves which were in my eye where i could meditate on what i had seen or to spectacles of any other sort according to his choice and discretion for otherwise i should apprehend from the variety of objects i should retain the memory of none he told me in reply that this was his intention observing that the proportion i had seen was very small indeed to what the city contained there was however one more statue which he could not dispense with himself from showing me being a model of beauty and perfection and having so said methought he took me into a neighboring garden and in a grove of cypress and myrtle presented to my view the most exquisite piece of sculpture i had ever beheld  this says he is the venus called celestial the workmanship of the immortal alcamen  after i had contemplated this divine original with astonishment and rapture i was satisfied within myself that we are mistaken in supposing it has descended to us and i now acknowledge that our celestial venus is a copy far inferior to its inimitable prototype having examined this statue for some time i turned to my conductor and said  let us gratify our senses in some other way i have seen enough of art  it is impossible to avoid it replies he in this city and so saying led me into the lyceum this gymnasium says he has been lately instituted by pericles and these plantations of planetrees are of his making so are these aqueducts the lyceum was originally dedicated to pastoral apollo and owes its foundation and beauty in the first instance to the elegant pisistratus who from the surprising resemblance of their persons we now call the elder pericles the place is delightful and before you leave it take notice of this statue of apollo the artist has described him in the attitude of resting after his daily course you see he leans against a column his right arm bent over his head and in his left he holds his bow it is a firstrate piece of sculpture leaving the lyceum my conductor took me by the way of the tripods here he showed me the inimitable satyr in brass the boasted masterpiece of praxiteles and the cupid and bacchus of thymilus we were now close by the theater in the portico of which i was shown the statue of eschylus and two pedestals for the statues of sophocles and euripides then under the artists hands although both those poets were now living the doors of the theater were not yet opened and the temple of venus being near at hand methought we entered and i beheld the beautiful cupid crowned with roses painted by zeuxis from hence i could see the works that pericles had been carrying on upon the citadel but this we did not enter  methought i was now carried into the theater amidst a prodigious crowd of people the comedy of the night was entitled the clouds and the famous aristophanes was announced to be the author of it it was expected that socrates would be personally attacked and a great party of that philosophers enemies were assembled to support the poet i was much surprised when my companion pointed out to me that great philosopher in person who had actually taken his seat in the theater and was sitting between alcibiades and antipho the son of pericles by the side of alcibiades sat euripides and at antiphos left hand sat thucydides i never beheld two more venerable old men than the poet and historian nor such comely persons as alcibiades and antipho socrates was exceedingly like the busts we have of him his head was bald his beard bushy and his stature low there was something very deterring in his countenance his person was mean and his habit squalid his vest was of loose drapery thrown over his left shoulder after the fashion of a spanish capa and seemed to be of coarse cloth made of black wool undyed he had a short staff in his hand of knotted wood with a round head which he was continually rubbing in the palm of his hand as he talked with alcibiades to whom he principally addressed his discourse thucydides had lately returned from exile upon a general amnesty and i observed a melancholy in his countenance mixed with indignation euripides seemed employed in examining the countenances of the spectators whilst antipho with great modesty paid a most respectful attention to the venerable philosopher on his right hand whilst i was engaged in observing this respectable group my conductor whispered the following words in my ear  this is the second attack from the same hand upon socrates that of last year was defeated by alcibiades but if this nights comedy succeeds i predict that our philosopher is undone and in truth his school is much out of credit for some of the worst characters of the age have come out of his hands of late  when the players first came on the stage there was so great a murmur in the theater that i could scarce hear them after a short time however the silence became pretty general and the plot of the play such as it was began to open i perceived that the poet had devised the character of an old clownish father who being plunged in debt by the extravagancies of a flanting wife and a spendthrift son who wasted his fortune upon racehorses was for ever puzzling his brains to strike upon some expedient for cheating his creditors with this view he goes to the house of socrates to take counsel of that philosopher who gives him a great many ridiculous instructions seemingly not at all to the purpose and amongst other extravagancies assures him that jupiter has no concern in the government of the world but that all the functions of providence are performed by the clouds which upon his invocation appear and perform the part of a chorus throughout the play the philosopher is continually foiled by the rustic wit of the old father who after being put in socratess truckle bed and miserably stung with vermin has a meeting with his creditors and endeavors to parry their demands with a parcel of pedantic quibbles which he has learnt of the philosopher and which give occasion to scenes of admirable comic humor my conductor informed me this incident was pointed at eschines a favorite disciple of socrates a man says he plunged in debts and a most notorious defrauder of his creditors in the end the father brings his son to be instructed by socrates the son after a short lecture comes forth a perfect atheist and gives his father a severe cudgelling on the stage which irreverend act he undertakes to defend upon the principles of the new philosophy he had been learning this was the substance of the play in the course of which there were many gross allusions to the unnatural vice of which socrates was accused and many personal strokes against clisthenes pericles euripides and others which told strongly and were much applauded by the theater  it is not to be supposed that all this passed without some occasional disgust on the part of the spectators but it was evident there was a party in the theater which carried it through notwithstanding the presence of socrates and the respectable junto that attended him for my part i scarce ever took my eyes from him during the representation and i observed two or three little actions which seemed to give me some insight into the temper of his mind during the severest libel that was ever exhibited against any mans person and principles  before socrates appears on the stage the old man raps violently at his door and is reproved by one of his disciples who comes out and complains of the disturbance upon his being questioned what the philosopher may be then employed upon he answers that he is engaged in measuring the leap of a flea to decide how many of its own lengths it springs at one hop the disciple also informs him with great solemnity that socrates has discovered that the hum of a gnat is not made by the mouth of the animal but from behind this raised a laugh at the expense of the naturalists and minute philosophers and i observed that socrates himself smiled at the conceit  when the school was opened to the stage and all his scholars were discovered with their heads upon the floor and their posteriors mounted in the air and turned toward the audience though the poet pretends to account for it as if they were searching for natural curiosities on the surface of the ground the action was evidently intended to convey the grossest allusion and was so received by the audience when this scene was produced i remarked that socrates shook his head and turned his eyes off the stage whilst euripides with some indignation threw the sleeve of his mantle over his face this was observed by the spectators and produced a considerable tumult in which the theater seemed pretty fairly divided so that the actors stood upright and quitted the posture they were discovered in  when socrates was first produced standing on a basket mounted into the clouds the person of the actor and the mask he wore as well as the garment he was dressed in was the most direct counterpart of the philosopher himself that could be devised but when the actor speaking in his character in direct terms proceeded to deny the divinity of jupiter socrates laid his hand upon his heart and cast his eyes up with astonishment in the same moment alcibiades started from his seat and in a loud voice cried out  athenians is this fitting upon this a great tumult arose and very many of the spectators called upon socrates to speak for himself and answer to the charge when the play could not proceed for the noise and clamor of the people all demanding socrates to speak for himself the philosopher unwillingly stepped forward and said  you require of me o athenians to answer to the charge there is no charge neither is this a place to discourse in about the gods let the actor proceed  silence immediately took place and socratess invocation to the clouds soon ensued the passage was so beautiful the machinery of the clouds so finely introduced and the chorus of voices in the air so exquisitely conceived that the whole theater was in raptures and the poet from that moment had entire possession of their minds so that the piece was carried triumphantly to its period in the heat of the applause my athenian friend whispered me in the ear and said  depend upon it socrates will hear of this in another place he is a lost man and remember i tell you that if all our philosophers and sophists were driven out of attica it would be happy for athens  at these words i started and awaked from my dream  no ix calliope has favored me with the following letter it is dated from the house of a worthy clergyman a friend of her fathers who with an exemplary wife lives upon a small country vicarage in primitive simplicity where that afflicted young lady took shelter  sir after you left me at lady thimbles i seized the first moment that the anguish of my mind permitted me to make use of to put myself in readiness for taking my final leave of that family and according to the plan we had concerted came without delay to this place where if any thing could have given absolute peace to my mind the consolation of these excellent people and the serenity of the scene must have done it as it was i felt my afflictions lighten my selfreproach became less bitter and whilst the vanity which flattery had inspired me with has been cured by their admonitions the doubts that infidelity had raised have been totally removed and truth made clear to my eternal comfort and conviction had it not been for this i should have been given up to despair for as i heard no more from captain constant i was convinced he had renounced me for ever in the mean time i wrote many letters but sent none to him some of these letters were written in a high tone most of them in an humble one and in one i gave a loose to passion and despair in expressions little short of phrensy all these i constantly destroyed for as i had not the heart to write angrily to him so i dreaded to appear mean in his eyes if i was too plaintive nay i was not sure since his fortune had become so superior to mine but i might lay myself open to a charge of the most despicable nature  thus my time passed till yesterday morning upon observing the house in one of those bustles which the expectation of a visiter creates in small families i found my good hostess deeply engaged with her pastry and havng myself become a considerable adopt in the art under her tuition i was putting myself in order to assist her in her preparations when turning to me with a smile which seemed to spring from joy as well as benevolence  come my dear child says she i have been at work this hour and if you had known it was to entertain a friend of your fathers i am persuaded you would not have let me been so long beforehand with you  i asked her who it was she expected  no matter she replied fall to your work and do your best like a good girl for your mistresss credit as well as your own  the significant look with which she accompanied these words set my heart into such a flutter that my hands no longer obeyed me in the task i undertook till having spilt the milk overthrown the eggs and put every thing into the same confusion with myself i burst into a flood of tears which ended in a strong hysteric fit my screams brought the good man of the house and every body in it to my assistance but judge of my condition betwixt joy astonishment and terror when the figure of my beloved constant presented itself to my eyes my god he exclaimed and started back aghast then sprung to my assistance and clasping me in his arms lifted me at once from the floor and ran with me into the parlour where there was a couch  my life my soul  was all he could say for he was like a man beside himself with fright and agony till i recovered this was at last effected by a plentiful relief of tears and then i found myself alone with my beloved henry my head reclined upon his neck and him supporting my whole weight in his arms whilst he knelt on one knee at my feet no sooner had i recollected myself than the blood that had been driven from my cheeks during my fit rushed back again with violence and covered me with blushes henrys transports now became as vehement as his terrors had been and loosing his hold of me for a moment whilst he fixed his eyes upon me with an ardour that confounded me so as almost to deprive me of speech or motion he again caught me in his arms and pressing me eagerly to his breast almost smothered me with caresses he then quitted me altogether and throwing himself on his knees at my feet entreated me to forgive him if he had offended me he had been distracted between joy and terror and scarce knew what he had done he proceeded to account for the motives of his conduct toward me both when he wrote the letter to me from plymouth and for every moment of his time since that he had set off for london the very day he wrote had sought you out and conversed fully with you upon the effects his letter had produced that hearing i was come to this place he would have followed me with an immediate explanation if you had not prevailed with him to the contrary for which advice i cannot now find in my heart to condemn you that however he had placed himself within two miles of me in a neighboring village where he had daily intercourse with the worthy vicar who gave him punctual intelligence of the state of my mind and the total revolution effected in it that what he suffered during this state of trial and suspense no words of his could paint but the accounts he received of me from this good man and the benefits he knew i was gaining by his counsel and conversation kept him from discovering himself till he had permission for so doing that he threw himself upon my candor and good sense for justification in the honest artifice he had made use of and now that i added to my good qualities those religious and domestic virtues which the society of unbelieving pedants had obscured but not extinguished he hoped there was no further bar in the way of our mutual happiness but that i would condescend to accept a man whose heart and soul were devoted to me and who had one recommendation at least to offer in his own behalf which he flattered himself no other person could produce and which he was sure would have some weight with me so saying he put a letter into my hands which i had no sooner glanced my eye upon than perceiving it was the wellknown handwriting of my ever honored and lamented father i sunk back upon the couch and dissolved again into tears even the manly heart of my henry now gave way and the sad remembrance of his departed friend melted his brave bosom into all the softness of a womans  then sir oh then indeed i loved him then he triumphed in my heart how dear how noble how almost divine did he then appear his eyes whose ardent raptures had affrighted me now when i saw them bathed in tears inspired me with the purest passion and contemplating him with the affection of a sister not regarding him as a lover i cast off all reserve and following the impulse of the soul dearest and best of men i cried  and sunk into his arms  thus sir you have the full and unreserved account to which your friendship is entitled still there remains one act of kindness in your power to show me and which my henry jointly with myself solicits which is that you would stand in the place of your deceased friend upon our marriage and complete the kind part you have taken in my welfare by joining my hand with that of the most deserving man on earth  i had almost forgot to mention to you a circumstance that passed as we were sitting at table after dinner and by which our good friend the vicar undesignedly threw me into a confusion that was exceedingly distressing by repeating some verses from popes essay on man in which he applied to me to help him out in his quotation i certainly remembered the passage and could have supplied his memory with the words but henry being present and the recollection of what had passed on the subject of poetry rushing on my mind at the same time that i thought i saw him glance a significant look at me threw me into such embarrassment on the sudden that in vain endeavoring to evade the subject and being pressed a little unseasonably by the vicar my spirits also being greatly fluttered by the events of the morning i could no longer command myself but burst into tears and very narrowly escaped falling into a second hysteric nothing ever equalled the tenderness of henry on this occasion nay i thought i could discover that he was secretly pleased with the event as it betrayed a consciousness of former vanities and seemed to prove that i repented of them whatever interpretation he might put upon it still i could not bring myself to repeat the verses and believe i shall never utter another couplet whilst i live i am certain i shall never make one  i enclose you a copy of my fathers letter to henry  and am sir your sincere friend and most obliged servant anne    though the letter of which my amiable correspondent has enclosed a copy is hastily written in the bustle and hurry of service yet as it breathes the sentiments of the friend the father and the hero and as every relick of so venerable a character is in my opinion at least too precious not to be preserved i shall take permission of the reader to subjoin it  dear harry this perverse wind has at last taken shame at confining so many brave fellows in port and come about to the cast so that we are all in high spirits getting under weigh the commissioners yacht is alongside and i drop these few lines by way of farewell to assure my brave lad that whether we meet again or not you shall not hear a bad account of your old shipmate nor with gods blessing of his crew i think we shall soon come into action and that being the case do you see few words and fairdealing are best between friends you tell me if you get a prize you mean to marry nancy that is honest for the girl is cruelly in love with you and i like her the better for it a seamans daughter should be a seamans friend and without flattery i dont believe a braver lad ever trod a plank in the kings service than yourself  so enough of that you have my consent and with it all the fortune i have to bestow which is little more than my blessing  there is one thing however i must warn you of which is that the girl though of a good nature in the main has got a romantic turn in her head and is terribly given to reading and making verses and such landlubbers trash as women and sailors have nothing to do with now i would not have you make a fool of yourself harry and marry a learned wife though she was of my own begetting if therefore nancy and you come to an understanding together when my old carcass shall be feeding the fishes remember it is on this express condition only which i charge you on your honor to observe that you burn her books as i will do if ever i get at them and never yoke with her till she has renounced these vagaries of poetry which if you cure her of you have my free leave to make her as good a husband as you can and god bless you with her and this you will observe and obey as the last will and testament of him who is  yours till death       p s remember i tell you harry this old ship is damned crank and leewardly but our wiseacres would not take her down so they must stand by the consequences she is a fine man of war at the worst and if she comes alongside of the monsieurs will give their firstrates a warming hurrah we are under sail     no x upon revising what i wrote for calliope in answer to dr macinfidels discourse against christs miracles i find the argument so connected with certain passages in the life of the great heathen philosopher pythagoras which the adversaries of christianity have set up against the scriptural records of the messiah that i have been tempted to enlarge upon what i gave to that young lady by prefacing it with an account of what i find curious in the relations of the sophists and biographers touching that extraordinary man  the variety of fictions which the writers who treat of pythagoras have interspersed in their accounts makes it difficult to trace out any consistent story of his life his biographers agree scarcely in any one fact or date porphyry says he was born at tire jamblichus will have it to be at sidon probably as being the more ancient city josephus says it is as hard to fix the place of his nativity as homers or to ascertain the year of his birth jamblichus glancing at the gospel account of the birth of christ says that when the mother of pythagoras was with child of him her husband being ignorant of her pregnancy brought her to the oracle at delphi and there the prophetess told him the first news of his wifes having conceived and also that the child she then went with should prove the greatest blessing to mankind that her husband thereupon changed her name from parthenis to pythais and when the child was born named him pythagoras as being foretold by apollo pythius for so says he the name signifies and adds that there can be no doubt but that the soul of the child was one of apollos companions in heaven and came down by commission from him when this and many other fables are cast out of the account it is most probable that pythagoras was born at samos in the  d year of olymp xlviii     years before christ being the son of mnesarchus an engraver of seals which mnesarchus was descended from hippasus of phlius and his mother pythais from ancaeus one of the planters of samos  nature bestowed upon pythagoras a form and person more than ordinarily comely he gave early indications of a mind capable of great exertions and ambitious of excelling in knowledge the greeks had now begun to open schools for the public instruction of youth the rudiments of science were taught in these seminaries to a degree sufficient for the common purposes of liberal education but the last finishing for such as aspired to be adepts in the superior learning of the times was only to be obtained amongst the egyptian and chaldean sages to them was the great resort of literary travelers from their source greece had derived her systems of theology and natural philosophy the egyptians were in possession of many ancient traditions of mosaical origin though disguised by emblems and hieroglyphics which greece in adopting was never able to develope and of which it is probable the egyptians themselves had lost the clue the greeks ever since the time of cecrops had been progressively erecting a fabulous and idolatrous system of theology upon this foundation the egyptians in very early time under certain types and symbols had shadowed out the attributes of the deity the great events of the deluge and repeopling of the earth and these being received by the greeks in a literal sense generated in the end a multitudinous race of deities with a thousand chimerical rites and ceremonies which altogether formed so puzzling a compound of absurdity that no two thinking heathens agreed in the same creed still they went on accumulating error upon error every philosopher who returned from egypt imported some addition to the stock till olympus was crowded with divinities if the heathens had ever defined their religion and established it upon system they would have destroyed it but whilst every man might think for himself and every man who thought at all got rid of his difficulties by supposing there was some mystery in the case which he either did not trouble himself to interpret or interpreted as he saw fit the imposing fabric stood and magnified through the mists of error appeared to have a dignity and substance which upon examination and scrutiny would have vanished  the parents of pythagoras put him first under the tuition of pherecydes of syrus pherecydes did not die till olymp lxvi so that diogenes laertius must be flagrantly mistaken in saying that pythagoras studied under this philosopher till his death he was very young when he went into syria for this purpose for he returned to samos to his parents and after studying some time under hermodamas there set out upon his travels into egypt at the age of eighteen at this early age he had acquired all the erudition the philosophers of greece could give him he had already visited many cities of syria and performed his initiations it is said he had consulted thales in person and been advised by that sage to prosecute his studies amongst the learned egyptians but this is doubtful it is altogether improbable that he should depart from samos at the age of eighteen upon the patriotic motive ascribed to him by laertius of avoiding the growing tyranny of his countryman polycrates especially when the same biographer informs us that he took letters of recommendation from polycrates to king amasis desiring him to give order for pythagorass being instructed by the egyptian priests  with this letter pythagoras repaired to amasis and obtained an order to the priests agreeable to the request of polycrates with this he went first to the priests of heliopolis they declined the execution of it by referring him to their brethren at memphis as being their seniors in the sacerdotal rank these again evaded the order and dispatched him to the diospolites he found these sages as little disposed to compliance as the priests of heliopolis or memphis however as the kings command was urgent they did not think fit absolutely to disobey it but took a method which they thought would answer the same purpose and began by deterring and alarming the inquisitive youth by their preparatory austerities but they had no common spirit to deal with pythagoras had a constitution that could endure hardships and an ambition that nothing could daunt he submitted to the ceremony of circumcision and was initiated into their sacred rites unintimidated by all the horrors with which they contrived to set them forth they began then to regard him with more benignity and respect and when they found him learning their language with surprising rapidity and conforming to their discipline with the most rigid exactness they looked upon him with surprise and admiration they now resolved to hold nothing back from talents so extraordinary and temper so conformable he learnt their three sorts of letters they admitted him to their sacrifices and disclosed the most secret rites of their religion mysteries never before imparted to any foreigner he resided in egypt a long time during which he read the books of the ancient priests and in them he discovered the sources of the grecian theology and how erroneous the system was which they had derived from these sources he is supposed henceforth to have held the gods of the heathen in contempt and to have entertained suitable ideas of the one supreme being  having perfected himself in the geometry and astronomy of the egyptians and acquired the observations of infinite ages as valerius maximus expresses it he determined upon exploring new and more distant scenes in search of knowledge and from egypt went to babylon his recommendations from egypt secured him a reception by the chaldees and magi here he was a disciple of nazaratus the assyrian and we are told by porphyry that he was purified by zabratus from all defilements of his former life by what particular modes of discipline this purification was effected porphyry does not explain from babylon he pushed his travels into persia and was instructed by the magi in their religion and way of living from them he received those rules of diet which he afterward prescribed to his disciples with various opinions of things clean and unclean which were amongst his maxims these conform to the present practice of the brahmins which may well be supposed to have been inviolably preserved through that separated and sacred cast from times of high antiquity for what invention can be devised to secure the longevity of any system better than that upon which the sacerdotal order of brahmins is established by the persian magi he was instructed in many particulars of jewish knowledge chiefly their interpretations of dreams we have ciceros authority for this part of his travels  de fin lib v and valerius maximus says the persian magi taught him a most complete system of ethics that they likewise instructed him in the motions and courses of the heavenly bodies their properties and effects and the influence every star respectively is supposed to have  in the course of these travels he passed more than twenty years he then turned his face homewards taking the isle of crete in his way here and at lacedemon he perused their famous codes of laws and having now completed the great tour of science and stored his mind with all the hidden treasures of oriental knowledge he presented himself for the first time to the admiring eyes of greece assembled at the olympic games  a spectacle no doubt it was for universal admiration and respect an understanding so enriched and full in its meridian vigor was an object that the wisest of his contemporaries might look up to with veneration little short of idolatry pythagoras in this attitude surrounded by the grecian sages on the field of the olympic games whilst every eye was fixed with rapture and delight upon one of the most perfect forms in nature began to pour forth the wonders of his doctrine astonishment seized the hearers and almost doubting if it was a mortal that had been discoursing they with one voice applauded his wisdom and demanded by what title he would in future be addressed pythagoras answered that their seven sages had taken the name of wise men or sophists for his part he left them in possession of a distinction they so well merited he wished to be no otherwise remembered or described than as a lover of wisdom his pretensions did not go to the possession of it and if they would call him a philosopher he should be contented with the appellation from this time the name of philosopher became a title of honor amongst the learned whilst that of sophist sunk into universal contempt  no xi i have observed that pythagoras on his return from the east took the island of crete in his way here he visited the famous philosopher epimenides porphyry and jamblichus must be greatly out in their chronology when they make epimenides one of pythagorass scholars laertiuss account is more probable who says he was one of pythagorass masters which naturally accounts for that philosophers seeking an interview with him in crete as he did afterward with pherecydes on his deathbed in syria in this interview pythagoras no doubt gave an account to epimenides of the many mavelous things he had learnt in his travels and so far the disciple may be said to have instructed his master epimenides himself was no small adept in the mavelous and propagated a story through greece of his having slept fiftyseven years in a cave and that upon waking after his long repose he resumed his search for some sheep which his father had sent him upon more than half a century before the story does not say that he found these sheep which probably were now become more difficult to recover than upon his first search he returned however to his fathers house and was rather surprised upon discovering a new generation in possession who thought no more of epimenides than they did of his sheep this sleeping philosopher however filled up the gap in his life pretty well for xenophanes says he lived to one hundred and fiftyseven years of age and the cretans who are liars upon record stretch their account to two hundred and ninetynine years modestly stopping short of three centuries deducting therefore fiftyseven years of sleep during which he probably made no great advances in science he might have occasion to go to school when he waked and though an old man might be a young scholar under pythagoras if the credibility of the above story can once be admitted  from the olympic games pythagoras repaired to samos and opened school in a place called in the time of antipho who is quoted by laertius pythagorae hemicyclus here he began a practice he continued in italy of retiring to a cave without the town for the purpose of study but in fact the idea was like most others of his oriental hermits have it to this day and if mortification is used to recommend religion solitude may be chosen to set off wisdom pythagoras in a cave visited in the dead of night with awful reverence and credulity might pass stories upon his hearers which he could not risque in the face of the sun and the streets of the city  he was not however so far sequestered from the concerns of the world as to enjoy himself in his cave under the tyranny of polycrates now more oppressive than at his departure for egypt he thereupon resolved to go into italy and took delos in his way here he wrote the verses on the sepulcher of apollo which porphyry records from delos he passed to phlius the ancient country of his family and at phlius cicero informs us he expounded several points of his new philosophy to the tyrant leo who being struck with his doctrine demanded of him what branch of science he principally professed pythagoras replied that he professed none but was a philosopher the name was new to leo and he desired to be informed of its signification and wherein philosophers differed from other professors of the learned sciences pythagoras answered that it appeared to him men were drawn to different objects and pursuits in life as the greeks were to their olympic games some for glory some for gain at the same time says he you must have observed that others attend without any view to either for curiosity and amusement only so we who are travelers and adventurers as it were from another life and another nature come amongst mankind indifferent to the ordinary allurements of avarice or ambition and studious of nothing but of the truth and essence of things such may be called lovers of wisdom or in one word philosophers and like the unconcerned spectators above described have no other interests to pursue but the acquisition of knowledge and the rational enjoyments of a contemplative mind  in this reply he glances at his doctrine of the metempsycosis  in his progress toward italy pythagoras went to delphi that he might give the more authority to his precepts upon the pretense of his having received them from the priestess theoclea  in italy he established himself for the remainder of his life and taught there forty years wanting one in his colleges at metapontum heraclea and croton he staid twenty years at croton before he went to metapontum milo the famous olympic victor was one of his scholars at the former of these places the fame of his doctrines drew a prodigious resort to his college no less than six hundred disciples at one time attended his lectures nightly he imposed rules of preparation and a system of discipline for his students admirably contrived to inspire them with veneration for his person and to train their minds to the exercises of patience and respect he prescribed a probationary silence of five years during which initiation they were not once admitted to the sight of their master who in the mean time like an invisible and superior spirit governed them after the most absolute manner by mandates which they never heard but through the channel of his subordinate agents at length they were ushered with much ceremony into the awful presence such a course of discipline could not fail to prepare every mind capable of undergoing it for the mavelous stories which at certain times he introduced into his lectures touching the doctrine of the metempsycosis and the revelation of his own divinity he scrupled not to tell them that he was the apollo of the hyperboreans and he corroborated his assertion by exposing to view his thigh composed of solid gold his food which was of the simplest sort was conveyed to him in his recess in a manner so secret that he was not discovered to be subject to the common appetites and necessities of human nature his person was most comely and commanding and his dress of studied cleanliness and simplicity he was always clad in milkwhite garments of the purest wool he told them his soul had passed through several antecedent forms and that it had originally received from mercury when it inhabited the body of aethalides son of that god the privilege of migrating after the death of one body into that of another with the faculty of remembering all the actions of its praeterient states that these transmigrations were not immediate but after intervals in which his soul visited the regions of the other world and was admitted to the society of departed spirits that in virtue of this prerogative it passed after some time from the body of aethalides into that of euphorbus who was wounded by menelaus at the siege of troy and in his person was conscious of what had occurred in that of its predecessor that it next appeared on earth in the person of hermotimus who gave proofs of his reminiscence by appealing to the shield suspended in the temple of apollo by the hands of menelaus from hermotimus it passed into one pyrrhus a fisherman retaining the like consciousness and lastly it had lodged itself where it now was possessing all the accumulated recollection of its past transmigrations  daring as these fictions were still they were credited for the powers of his mind were wonderful and the authority he had established over his hearers by superior wisdom and ingenious device was unbounded the curious researches of his study in the east and the passion he had there contracted for the mavelous and supernatural inspired him with the ambition of passing himself upon the world for something above human he had trained on the credulity of his disciples with such art that he found it would bear whatever he thought proper to impose he was sensible he transcended all men living in wisdom and he resolved to assume a superiority of nature also the idea of transmigration was not started by pythagoras it was of eastern origin but too far out of sight for any then alive to trace it to its source he told his scholars he should revisit the earth in two hundred and six years after his death  doctrines like these were hard to be received but he so well balanced fiction with truth that they could not be separated at the time the strong fortified the weak so effectually that both took place together in mathematics astronomy and moral philosophy he was an unrivalled master his golden verses deserved the name his principles were temperate moral humane and above all things pacifying and conciliatory when he admitted a disciple into his presence he took him ever after into his most cordial friendship and confidence and men esteemed it the highest honor of their lives to have passed their probation in the school of pythagoras and to be allowed access to his person  after he had staid twenty years at croton he removed to metapontum where he had a magnificent house which was afterward converted into a temple to ceres and a school which was called the museum here he was visited by the famous abaris priest of the hyperborean apollo and his fabulous historians give out that having taken abariss arrow he rode upon it through the air to taurominium in one day though distant from metapontum some days sailing hearing that his aged master pherecydes was dying of a loathsome disease in delos he went thither and exerted all his art to recover him and when he was dead having buried him with all the ceremonies due to a father he returned to italy this instance of friendship is the last public action i find recorded in his life the manner of his death is variously reported as well as the age at which he died the most probable account fixes it at eighty years as to the catastrophe of his death the relation most to be credited informs us that one cylon of croton a rich ambitious and disorderly man having offered himself to the college and been rejected by pythagoras was so enraged thereby that having collected a hired mob he assaulted the house of milo when pythagoras and his disciples were there assembled and burnt the house with every body in it two or three excepted who narrowly escaped pythagoras to whom his disciples even in the last extremity paid a filial reverence and attention was solicited to make his escape but not being willing to expose himself to the people as a fugitive anxious to preserve life when his friends were on the point of perishing he resisted their entreaties and was burnt to death to this account i incline but others contend that he escaped from the flames and was killed in pursuit some relate that he took refuge in the muses temple at metapontum where being kept from victuals forty days he was starved and other historians with as little probability on their side say that being pursued into a beanplot he there stopped because he would not pass over prohibited ground and yielded his throat to the pursuers after his death his surviving disciples were dispersed into greece and the neighboring countries  thus perished pythagoras the samian philosopher founder of the italian school and the great luminary of the heathen world  no xii having in my two preceding papers been at some pains in collecting an account of the life of pythagoras from the many various unconnected particulars scattered up and down in the works of the sophists and biographers touching that extraordinary man i now come to my main object in which i desire the readers attention whilst i attempt to show in what manner the heathen writers have applied these particulars in opposition to the life and actions of christ this will be the subject of the present paper in my next i purpose to conclude by answering those arguments on which modern cavillers have grounded their reasonings against the gospel miracles a subject to which i have been led by dr macinfidels discourse of which some notice has been taken in former papers  it has been unfortunate for pythagoras that the writers of julians time to pay court to the emperor should have corrupted their account of him with so many fictions and absurdities for he was truly a very wonderful man but when they undertook to depreciate the character of christ his doctrines and miracles by ascribing actions to pythagoras equal or as they conceived superior to what christ had done upon earth they were driven to strange resources in deifying their philosopher for in fact the time was rather past for those delusions deification after death was the most that could be attempted and even the julium sidus held its place in the heavens by a precarious tenure at the same time an apotheosis would not serve their purpose it was necessary to make pythagoras a god or the son of a god and to give him a supernatural birth from the womb of a virgin their next business was to invest him with the power of working miracles but here some stubborn facts laid in their way he had visited epimenides in his last sickness without being able to prolong his life they were driven to ridiculous resources and taking abariss arrow in aid sent their philosopher upon it through the air from metapontum to taurominium because christ had walked on the sea pythagoras rode through the skies because christ had been forty days fasting in the wilderness pythagoras was to be forty days without food in the temple of the muses at metapontum because christ descended into hades and rose again from the dead and appeared upon earth pythagoras descended to the shades below remained there a complete year saw homer hesiod and other departed spirits returned upon earth wan and emaciated and reported what he had seen in full assembly of his disciples whilst his mother by his special direction before his descent registered upon tablets all that passed and noted the times of his temporary death and resurrection to carry on the competition he was made to allay winds tempests and earthquakes to cure diseases whether of mind or body and to foretell to certain fishermen whom he found at work how many fish they should enclose in their net the reader who has consulted porphyry and jamblichus will call to mind other coincidencies  with what superior what incontestible strength of evidence does the disciple of christ meet the disciple of pythagoras in this comparison between their masters the heathen teacher was almost a miracle of erudition he traversed the east in pursuit of science and collected knowledge wherever it was to be found with unremitting industry christ lived in privacy and obscurity educated only in the humble trade and occupation of his parents to whom he was obedient and devoted till he set out upon the functions of his mission the person of the first was captivating and comely not to be approached but with awe and adoration with preparatory penances and rigid initiations with every artifice to set him off that human wit could devise the other was despised and rejected of men the simplest and the meekest being that ever walked the earth conversing freely with all men presenting himself to the poor and lowly to women and to little children in him was no form of comeliness that men should desire no artifice or trick to catch applause or to excite surprise if he exercised his miraculous power in healing the infirm or reviving the dead he did it in silence and under injunction of secrecy directing men to pay their thanks to god alone and forbidding them even to call him good no magic numbers nor mystic symbols obscured his doctrines but he delivered the simple system of his pure morality in little easy anecdotes levelled to the capacity and fitted to the memory of the poorest and most illiterate from such he chose his disciples that the wisdom of this world might have no share in his ministry and he rested upon the weakest agents the task of preaching and propagating the sublimest religion gloomy enthusiasts have buried themselves in deserts and caverns of the earth to brood in solitude and spend their days in penances and prayers ambitious innovators have been carried to the highest pitch of human greatness by becoming founders of a new religion but christ taught his disciples neither to shun society nor to disturb authorities he told them indeed that they should die for the faith they professed but it was not the death of soldiers but of martyrs they should suffer and these precepts he confirmed by his own example being led like a lamb to the slaughter if they who profess his religion were to practice it universal love and benevolence would obtain upon earth  but of the internal evidences of christs religion i am not now to speak so long as the distinctions between good and evil exist these can need no defense if men agree in the one they cannot differ or dispute about the other with regard to the gospel account of christs miracles i may be allowed in general to observe that these forgeries of porphyry and jamblichus in imitation of them warrant a fair presumption that if these writers could have disproved the authorities of the evangelists and controverted the matter of fact they would not have resorted to so indecisive and circuitous a mode of opposing them as this which we are now examining men of such learning as these writers would not have risqued extravagant fictions merely to keep way with a history which they had more immediate means of refuting on the other hand if their absurdity should lead any man to suppose that they forged these accounts by way of parody and in ridicule of the gospels the accounts themselves give the strongest evidence to the contrary and it is clear beyond a doubt that both porphyry and jamblichus mean to be credited in their histories of pythagoras as seriously as philostratus does in his of apollonius tyaneus  this will more fully appear by referring to the circumstances that occasioned these histories to be written  christ having performed his miracles openly and before so many witnesses it is not found that the matter of fact was ever questioned by any who lived in that age on the contrary we see it was acknowledged by his most vigilant enemies the pharisees they did not deny the miracle but they ascribed it to the aid of the prince of the devils so weak a subterfuge against the evidence of their own senses probably satisfied neither themselves nor others if it had this accusation of sorcery being capital by their law and also by that of the romans would have been heard of when they were so much to seek for crimes wherewith to charge him on his trial if any man shall object that this is arguing out of the gospels in favor of the gospels i contend that this matter of fact does not rest solely on the gospel evidence but also upon collateral historic proof for this very argument of the pharisees and this only is made use of by those jews whom celsus brings in arguing against the christian religion and those jews on this very account rank christ with pythagoras and i challenge the cavillers against christs miracles either to controvert what is thus asserted or to produce any other argument of jewish origin except this ascribed to the pharisees by the gospel either from celsus as above mentioned or any other writer  celsus it is well known was a very learned man and wrote in the time of adrian or something later this was not above fifty years after the date of christs miracles celsus did not controvert the accounts of them who were witnesses of the miracles nor attempt to show any inconsistence or chicanery in the facts themselves he takes up at second hand the old pharisaical argument of ascribing them to the power of the devil in short they were performed he cannot deny it there was no trick or artifice in the performance he cannot discover any the accounts of them are no forgeries he cannot confute them they are recent histories and their authenticity too notorious to be called into question he knows not how the miracles were performed and therefore they were done by the invocation of the devil he cannot patiently look on and see that learning so long the glory of all civilized nations and which he himself was to an eminent degree possessed of now brought into disgrace by a new religion professing to be a divine revelation and originating from amongst the meanest and most odious of all the provincial nations and propagated by disciples who were as much despised and hated by the jews in general as the jews were by all other people unable to disprove the account and at a loss how to parry it from hearsay or from what he finds in former writers he has no other resource but to bring forward again those cavilling pharisees and roundly to assert in general terms which he does more than once that these miracles are all the tricks of a sorcerer and for this he expects the world should take his authority  i have said that celsus adduces neither oral nor written authority against christs miracles but i am well aware it may be said and modern cavillers will affect to say it with triumph that authorities are silent on the subject there are none which make mention of these miracles at least none have come down to our times  if this silence implies a want of collateral evidence which in the opinion of our modern disbelievers vitiates the authenticity of the gospel how much stronger would the argument have been in celsuss time than in ours why does he not avail himself of it and why does he take such pains to controvert accounts of which no man had ever spoken either in proof or disproof may it not be fairly presumed that he forbears to urge it from plain conviction that it would operate the contrary way to what he wished and that the reason why contemporary writers were silent was not because they were ignorant of the facts but because they could not confute them here then we will leave the case for the present the heathen writers contemporary with christ make no mention of his miracles they are interested to disprove them and they do not disprove them modern unbelievers think this a reason that these miracles were never performed celsus writes fifty years after the time never urges this silence as an argument for their nonexistence but virtually nay expressly admits christs miracles by setting up pythagorass in competition with them  neither is it pythagoras alone he compares to christ he states the performances of aristeas proconnesius and abaris also of aristeas the first account we have is in herodotus and he gives it only upon hearsay he relates that it was reported of him that he died at proconnesus and appeared there seven years after and having written some verses disappeared but that two or three hundred years after he had appeared again at metapontum where by special direction of apollo he was worshipped as a god of abaris celsus relates that he rode through the air on an arrow passing over mountains and seas in his passage out of scythia into greece and back again into scythia  hence it came to pass that other heathen writers after the example of celsus published their accounts of pythagoras and apollonius tyaneus not so much for the purpose of giving the histories of those persons as to set them up in opposition to christ and his disciples porphyry composed the history of pythagoras after he had written fifteen books professedly against the christian religion these were suppressed by the christian emperors who succeeded galienus in whose time porphyry wrote his history of pythagoras in the island of sicily whither he retired in disgust with the emperor for his favor to the christians and would have put himself to death with his own hand if plotinus had not prevented him galienus soon died and the succeeding emperors being disposed to persecute the christians porphyry published his history jamblichus published his account of pythagoras in the reign of the emperor julian with whom he was in high favor as the letters of that emperor sufficiently testify hierocles also in the time of dioclesian published two books against the christian religion under the title of philalethes and for these was promoted by galerius from being chief judge at nicomedia to the government of alexandria these books are now lost but we are informed by eusebius they were mostly copied from celsus and set up aristeas pythagoras and apollonius tyaneus against christ whom he says the christians on account of his doing a few teratyai call a god and concludes with these words viz that it is worth considering that those things of jesus are boasted of peter and paul and some others of the like sort liars and illiterate and impostors but for these things of apollonius we have maximus and damis a philosopher who lived with him and philostratus men eminent for their learning and lovers of truth  as for these witnesses to philostratuss legend of apollonius maximuss minutes go no farther than to two or three years of apolloniuss life passed at aegae when he was about twenty years old and what he had from damis was a tablebook of minutes which a nameless man pretending to be a relation of damis brought to julia the mother and wife of caracalla and were by her given to the sophist philostratus to dress up in handsomer language  such are the authorities for the legend of philostratus written above a hundred years after the death of apollonius who died a few weeks after the emperor domitian in the year of christ    this apollonius was of the sect of pythagoras and the patroness of philostratuss history was the monster julia mother and wife to the detestable caracalla  no xiii it seems natural to suppose that any great and signal revelation of the divine will should be authenticated to mankind by evidences proportioned to the importance of the communication christians contend that in the purity and perfection of their religion as it was taught by christ and in the miracles which he performed on earth whilst he was teaching full and sufficient evidencies are found of a divine revelation  as for the religion of christ it speaks for itself the book is open which contains it and however it may have degenerated in practice through the corruption of them who profess it there seems no difference of opinion in the world as to the purity and perfection of its principles of these evidencies therefore which are generally called internal i have no need to speak  it is not possible to make the same direct appeal to the miracles as to the religion of christ many centuries have revolved since they have ceased nature has long since resumed her course and retains no traces of them their evidencies therefore are not like those of christs religion internal but historical it must however be acknowledged that they are historical evidencies of the strongest sort for the historians were eyewitnesses of what they relate and their relations agree  it is easy therefore to see that if the system of christianity is to be attacked it is in this part only the attack is to be expected this has accordingly taken place in three different periods and in three different modes  the unbelieving jews contemporary with christ before whose eyes the miracles were performed could not dispute their being done but they attempted to criminate the doer by accusing him of a guilty communication with evil spirits ascribing his supernatural deeds to the power of the devil the heathens who had not ocular demonstration but could not contest facts so well established made their attack upon his miracles by instancing others who had done things altogether as wonderful viz pythagoras abaris apollonius and others  thus the matter rested for many ages till modern cavillers within the pale of the christian church struck upon a new argument for an attack upon christs miracles and this argument having been woven into a late publication whose historical merit puts it into general circulation many retailers of infidelity and dr macinfidel amongst the rest have caught at it as a discovery of importance and as they have contrived to connect it with topics of more erudition than the generality of people are furnished with on whom they practice it has been propagated with some success where it has had the advantage of not being understood  the strength of this argument lies in the discovery that contemporary authorities are silent on the subject of christs miracles naturalists and the authors who record all curious and extraordinary events of their own or of preceding times make no mention of the wonderful things which christ is said to have done in the land of judaea in short the evangelists are left alone in the account and yet some things are related by them too general in their extent and too wonderful in their nature to have been passed over in silence by these authors or in other words not to have had a place in their collections the elder pliny and seneca they tell us were living at the time of christs passion the evangelists relate that there was darkness over the face of the earth when christ gave up the ghost and this darkness was miraculous being out of the course of nature and incidental to the divinity of the person who was then offering up his life for the redemption of mankind against the veracity of the gospel account relative to this particular prodigy the attack is pointed and they argue that if it extended over the whole earth elder pliny and seneca with all others who were then living must have noticed it if it was local to the province of judaea men of their information must have heard of it each of these philosophers has recorded all the great phoenomena of nature which his curiosity and care could get together and pliny in particular has devoted an entire chapter to eclipses of an extraordinary nature yet does not mention this at the passion the defection of light which followed caesars murder was not to be compared with what the gospel relates of the praeternatural darkness at the passion and yet most of the writers of that age have recorded the former event whilst all are silent as to the latter  therefore it did not happen  this i believe is a fair state of the argument and if there be any merit in the discovery it certainly rests with the moderns for neither celsus porphyry nor his disciple jamblichus have struck upon it though the firstmentioned wrote against christianity in the time of adrian who succeeded to the empire eighty years after christs passion as for seneca he died about thirty years and elder pliny three and forty years after christ  the fathers of the church it seems are divided in opinion as to the darkness at christs passion being general to the whole earth or local only to judaea as the decision of this point does not affect the general question the abettors of the argument are willing to admit with origin beza and others that the prodigy should be understood as local to that part of the world to which his other miracles were confined and to whose conviction if it really happened it is natural to suppose it should be specially addressed  allowing this these reasoners contend that it must of necessity have been reported to rome and that report must have been known to seneca and elder pliny and being known must have been recorded by one or both these positions merit examination  the first point to be taken for granted is that the miracle of the three hours darkness upon the passion of christ must necessarily have been reported to rome this report was either to come in the state dispatches of the procurator pilate to the court of tiberius or from private communications of the probability of the first case the reader must judge for himself from circumstances it is merely matter of speculation it involves a doubt at least whether the procurator would not see reasons personal as well as political against reporting to the court an event which at best tended to his own crimination and which if he had delivered it for truth might have alarmed the jealousy or roused the resentment of his sovereign the idea entertained by the jews of deliverance from the roman yoke by their expected messiah was too general to have escaped the knowledge of their watchful tyrants and it does not seem likely any roman governor of that province would be forward to report any miracle or miracles that had reference to a person who having set up a new religion declared himself that very messiah which the jewish prophecies foretold should appear to extirpate the gentile idolatry if this be a reason for the roman procurator in judaea to be silent on the subject it is no less so for the people of rome to reject the reports of the christians themselves if they ventured any and as for the unbelieving jews it is not to be expected they would contribute to spread the evidencies of christs divinity  the next point to be taken for granted in the argument under examination is that this report if actually made must have been known to the philosopher seneca and the naturalist pliny and i think it may fairly be allowed that an event of this sort could not well fail of coming to the knowledge of seneca and even of pliny though he died fortythree years after the time if the government in tiberiuss reign had been made acquainted with it by authority and had taken no measures for suppressing it or any accounts published at the time respecting it for after all it must be observed that this event not being found in plinys natural history nor in senecas enquiries does not by any means decide the question against any accounts being published but leaves it still open to conjecture and with some reason that such accounts might have been suppressed by the heathen emperors  but waving any further discussion of this point we will pass to the third and last position in which it is presumed that if this praeternatural eclipse at christs passion was known to seneca and pliny one or both must have recorded it in their works  this i think is begging a question very hardly to be granted for these writers must have stated the event either as a thing credible or doubtful or incredible they must either have grounded it upon authority or reported it upon hearsay they must have admitted it with its date and circumstances at the very crisis when it happened and in that case what would have been the consequence of such a publication the christians would naturally have made the application to the passion of christ and how dangerous was it for a heathen to admit a fact open to such an interpretation a roman philosopher giving a serious history of extraordinary and prodigious events would make his court but ill to a heathen persecuting emperor by admitting this into the account unless it was to confute it now this does not appear to have been in contemplation of seneca or pliny in any part of their writings each of these authors tells us what he credits and wishes to be credited not what he disbelieves and wishes to confute the defection of light at the time of caesars death was the creed of the court the historians naturalists and even the poets celebrated that phoenomenon and it did not lose in their relations but in the case of the darkness at christs death a believer in him and his miracles draws a stronger argument for his belief from the silence of seneca and pliny than any caviller can urge against it from the same circumstance if we admit they knew it and yet did not record it are we not better founded in supposing they were silent because they could not controvert the fact than our opponents are in saying it did not pass because they do not mention it it is too much to require of witnesses that they should depose to a fact which is to convict themselves i must therefore appeal to the candid reader whether a philosopher writing in the court of nero who had charged the christians with the burning of rome and was devising terrible and unheard of modes of torturing them upon this charge who had beheaded paul and crucified peter for preaching christ and the redemption of mankind earned by his passion whether a heathen philosopher i say writing at this very time an account of extraordinary but what he delivers as true events in nature would venture upon putting into his account a miracle tending to confirm the divine nature and mission of that person whose immediate followers were then suffering under the most determined persecution no heathen writer in his senses would have ventured to give such an account peter and paul declared for the miracle and were martyred for their doctrine the gospel account declared for the miracle and no one roman writer controverted the assertion this was the time for seneca for pliny and other heathen writers to cry out against the glaring fiction do the christians say there was a general darkness when their master expired we appeal to the fact against them it reached not us at rome the light of that day was like the light of other days do they say it was partial to judaea only be it so we meet them on their own ground we appeal to the procurator pilate to the noble romans resident in judaea to the soldiers to the very centurion who attended his execution to witness against this impudent attack upon mens senses let them pretend that he healed the sick cured the lame turned water into wine or performed a thousand other juggling tricks but darkness over a whole province can be confuted by the testimony of a whole province and to this we appeal  was this said was this appeal made strange perversion of reason to turn that into an argument against a thing which seems conclusive for it at least no negative can come nearer to conclusion than contemporary silence in a case so open to confutation had it not been true  but seneca and elder pliny did not see the gospel  let it pass let us grant all that the argument supposes why are we told of no confutation of this miracle by any heathen writer contemporary with or posterior to the gospel account of the passion the assertion of a praeternatural event so generally notorious must have been open to proof would celsus have overlooked it would not lucian have taken it up should not we hear of its having been urged by porphyry who was so voluminous a controversialist should not we meet it in julian or philostratus should we hear nothing that could lead us to believe it was controverted by jamblichus or hierocles in his books entitled philalethes if the silence of the heathen writers is to be appealed to for the purpose of impeaching christs miracles let the appeal be made whilst we confine ourselves to the defense of those miracles only which are recorded in the gospels and acts of the apostles neither the silence of ancient nor the eloquence of modern opponents can shake the records on which we ground our faith  no xiv that period of the athenian history which is included within the era of pisistratus and the death of menander the comic poet may be justly styled the literary age of greece i propose to dedicate some of these papers to a review of that period but as the earlier ages of poetry though in general obscure yet afford much interesting matter of enquiry it will be proper to take up the athenian history from its origin because it is so connected with the account i mean to give that i cannot otherwise preserve that order and continuation in point of time which perspicuity requires  this account may properly be called a history of the human understanding within a period peculiarly favorable to the production of genius and though i cannot expect that my labor will in the end furnish any thing more than what every literary man has stored in his memory or can resort to in his books still it will have the merit of being a selection uninterrupted and unmixed with other events that crowd and obscure it in the original relations to which he must otherwise refer the wars both foreign and domestic which the small communities of greece were perpetually engaged in occupy much the greater part of the historians attention and the reader whose enquiries are directed to the subject i am about to treat of must make his way through many things not very interesting to an elegant and inquisitive mind before he can discover quid sophocles et thespis et aeschylus utile ferrent such will not envy me the labor of having turned over a heavy mass of scholiasts and grammarians or hesitate to prefer accepting the result of my enquiries to the task of following the like track in pursuit of his own  the athenians were a most extraordinary people eminent in arms and in arts of their military achievements i do not profess to treat and if the reader takes less delight in hearing of the ravages of war than of the progress of literature he may in the contemplation of these placid scenes undisturbed by tumult and unstained with blood experience some degree of that calm recreation of mind which deludes life of its solicitude and forms the temperate enjoyment of a contemplative man  ogyges is generally supposed to have been the founder of the athenian monarchy but in what era of the world we shall place this illustrious person whether he was noah or one of the titans grandson to jupiter or contemporary with moses is an enquiry which the learned have agitated with much zeal and very little success it is however agreed that there was a grievous flood in his time which deluged the province afterward called attica but that happily for king ogyges being a person of gigantic stature he survived the general calamity a period of one hundred and eightynine years succeeded to this flood in which this province remained so depopulated that it is generally supposed no king reigned over it till the time of cecrops the founder of athens from him at first named cecropia  cecrops made many prudent institutes for the benefit of his rising state during a long reign of fifty years and by establishing the rites of matrimony abolished the promiscuous commerce of the sexes in which they lived before his time by these and other regulations upon a general numbering of all his subjects he found the male adults in his dominions to amount to twenty thousand every person of the above description being directed to bring a stone in his hand and cast it down in a stated place this prince being an egyptian introduced the mythology of his native country upon which so many grecian fables were formed and from which a learned modern has with great sagacity traced a very curious analogy with the mosaic accounts of the early ages the greeks adopted the fables without comprehending their allusions and thereupon formed the constitution of a religion which kept possession of great part of the world till revelation dispelled its errors and enlightened the gentile nations till cecrops erected altars to jupiter made libations and established his worship he was not known in greece as a god he set up the image of mercury sacrificed to saturn ops rhea juno and minerva and was in fact the institutor of the pagan theology the gods of cecrops were soon made useful instruments in the hand of the founder of a monarchy for before he could induce his people to cultivate the dry and barren country of attica he was forced to play off his new machinery by raising a contest in heaven between neptune and minerva for the patronage of cecropia the capital of his new empire he found interest enough with the deities to turn their decision in minervas favor and by this contrivance he diverted his subjects from their maritime attachments to agriculture and particularly to the cultivation of the olive to strengthen still further the tutelary title of minerva he enforced the dedication of the city by changing its name from cecropia to athenae a sacrifice few founders would have made and a strong proof of his good sense and talents for government if the reader recollects the story ovid relates of minervas treatment of erichthonius cecropss son he will not conceive highly of the gratitude or even purity of that virgin deitys character though as we are setting out upon the athenian ground it may be not very prudent to talk scandal of minerva at virgo est  negat aglaurus negat anguis apertus dar phryg lib    cecrops enjoyed his new government for the space of fifty years but his attachment to his native soil of egypt drew him into an unlucky expedition with king pharaoh in whose company he was drowned in the red sea whilst in pursuit of the israelites notwithstanding which we are informed upon the authority of the poet euripides that he was translated into the starry sphere and became a constellation of some dignity after his death and if we consider what obligations this prince had conferred on the gods as well as men we shall not think him too highly rewarded on the contrary we must own he was rather hardly dealt with both by minerva as well as mercury the former of which shut his son in a chest in company with a dragon and the latter betrayed his daughter into a false step an attachment which though it does not convict her of vulgarity of taste certainly does no credit to the chastity of her morals or the gratitude of her seducer  cranaus succeeded on the death of cecrops and after a reign of nine years was deposed by amphictyon who seized the throne of athens and rendered his name memorable to posterity by establishing the great council or lawcourts of the amphictyons who held their meetings at thermopylae this prince introduced the practice of diluting and mixing wines a practice that obtained through all greece for many ages in memory of which sober institution amphictyon erected an altar to bacchus the upright and placed it in the temple of the hours he also consecrated an altar to the nymphs near at hand in the same temple that mankind might thereby be kept in mind of the gracefulness of temperance and it is not easy to find any instance in the pagan worship where superstition has been applied to more elegant or moral purposes in small communities such regulations may be carried into effect where all the people are under the eye of the sovereign and in the same spirit of reformation amphictyon published an edict that none of his subjects should indulge themselves in the use of undiluted wine except in one small glass after their meals to give them a taste of the potency of the god under this restriction he permitted the free use of diluted wines provided they observed in their meetings to address their libations to jupiter the preserver of mans health  this virtuous usurper after an administration of ten years was in his turn expelled from the throne of athens by that erechthonius the son of cecrops whom minerva shut up in a chest with his companion the dragon and committed to the keeping of his sisters this is the person whom homer mentions in his second book of the iliad by the name of erechtheus he is celebrated for having first yoked horses to a chariot and also for introducing the use of silver coin in attica primus erechthonius currus et quatuor ausus jungere equos rapidisque rotis insistere victor   but the institutions which have rendered the name of erechthonius famous to all posterity are those of the eleusynian mysteries and the feasts of the panathenaea the first of these he established in honor of ceres on account of a seasonable supply of corn from the granaries of egypt when the city and territory of athens were in imminent danger of starving by an extraordinary drought these sacred mysteries were of egyptian origin and as they consisted of forms and rites unintelligible to the vulgar and probably very little comprehended even by the initiated the secret was well kept  as for the panathenaea they were instituted as their name indicates in honor of minerva and were the great festival of the athenians the celebration was originally comprised in one day but afterward it was extended to several and the various athletic games and races with the recitation of poems that accompanied it attracted an immense resort of spectators every species of contention both on foot and horseback drew the bold and adventrous to the field of fame whilst the prizes for music and the rival display of the drama in aftertimes recreated the aged the elegant and the learned the conquerors in the several games gave entertainments to their friends in which they presided crowned with olive in honor of the guardian deity these were scenes of the greatest festivity till when athens had submitted to the roman yoke those sanguinary conquerors introduced the combats of gladiators into these favorite solemnities every age had its share in contributing to the spectacle the old men walked in procession with branches of olive in their hands the young in armor with shield and spear the laboring peasants with spades and their wives with waterbuckets the boys crowned with garlands and dressed in frocks or surplices of white chaunted hymns to minerva and the girls followed with baskets in which the sacrificing utensils were contained  a superstition supported by splendour and enlivened with festivity was well calculated to keep a lasting hold upon the human mind  no xv the eleusynian mysteries instituted by erechthonius were celebrated in the time of autumn every fifth year at eleusis where a great concourse of people met upon the occasion the ceremonies of initiation were preceded by sacrifices prayers and ablutions the candidates were exercised in trials of secrecy and prepared by vows of continence every circumstance was contrived to render the act as awful and striking as possible the initiation was performed at midnight and the candidate was taken into an interior sacristy of the temple with a myrtle garland on his head here he was examined if he had duly performed his stated ablutions clean hands a pure heart and a native proficiency in the greek tongue were indispensible requisites having passed this examination he was admitted into the temple which was an edifice of immense magnitude after proclamation made that the strictest silence should be observed the officiating priest took out the sacred volumes containing the mysteries these books were written in a strange character interspersed with the figures of animals and various emblems and hieroglyphics they were preserved in a cavity between two large blocks of stone closely fitted to each other and they were carefully replaced by the priest with much solemnity after he had explained what was necessary to the initiated out of them the initiated were enjoined to honor their parents to reverence the immortal gods and abstain from particular sorts of diet particularly tame fowls fish beans and certain sorts of apples  when this was finished the priests began to play off the whole machinery of the temple in all its terror doleful groans and lamentations broke out from the fane thick and sudden darkness involved the temple momentary gleams of light flashed forth every now and then with tremblings as if an earthquake had shaken the edifice sometimes these coruscations continued long enough to discover all the splendour of the shrines and images accompanied with voices in concert dancings and music at other times during the darkness severities were exercised upon the initiated by persons unseen they were dragged to the ground by the hair of their heads and there beaten and lashed without knowing from whom the blows proceeded or why they were inflicted lightnings and thunderings and dreadful apparitions were occasionally played off with every invention to terrify and astonish at length upon a voice crying out conx ompax the ceremony was concluded and the initiated dismissed the garment worn upon this occasion was not to be laid aside whilst it would hang together and the shreds were then to be dedicated at some shrine as a tattered trophy of the due performance of the mysteries of ceres  these initiations were conceived to lead to the enjoyment of a happier lot in this life and to fit a man for a more dignified place amongst the blessed hereafter and they were in such general respect that it afforded great cause of reproach against socrates for having neglected his initiation the vows of secrecy and the penalties to be inflicted on violation were as binding as could possibly be devised  hitherto the rising state of athens had not been engaged in war but no sooner was it involved in disputes with the eleusynians on account of some praedatory incursions than the idea took its rise of devoting human victims to appease the hostile divinities and to purchase conquest by the oblation of what was dearest and most valuable in life  as we are now approaching toward the time of homer who records instances of this sort it may be curious to mark when that savage superstition had its origin no example occurs to me in grecian story antecedent to erechthonius who in obedience to an oracle sacrificed one of his daughters and some say all to purchase thereby success against the eleusynians it is however a matter of less wonder than regret how this idea should obtain so generally when a people are in the habit of making animal sacrifices a part of their worship and whose religion it is to believe that intercession can be made to the gods and favors obtained by the blood of victims taken from the brute creation the thought of ascending a step higher in the dignity of the oblation naturally leads to the hope of purchasing a greater reward with these ideas enthusiastic spirits like decius and curtius amongst the romans rushed upon selfdestruction and erechthonius king of athens devoted his daughter codrus himself  if the blood of bulls and goats and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling the unclean sanctifies to the purifying of the flesh how much more shall the blood etc etc etc there is a wild magnanimity in the idea highly captivating cicero more than once alludes to this action of erechthonius and in his oration for sextus exclaims  shall i after so many illustrious deeds shrink from death which even the daughters of erechthonius with all the weakness of their sex about them resigned themselves to without regret let the mind be possessed with the persuasion of immortal happiness annexed to the act and there will be no want of candidates to struggle for the glorious prerogative erechthonius and his daughters were associated to the deities after their death altars were dedicated and a temple erected to them in the citadel of athens where divine honors were paid to their memories the eleusynians were defeated and despoiled of all they possessed except the mysteries of ceres abovementioned of these they were left in undisturbed enjoyment their king eumolpus was slain in battle but neptune whose son he was revenged his loss by striking his conqueror dead with his trident  thus perished erechthonius by immortal hands if we take the authority of euripides the tragic poet after he had reigned fifty years in athens in his time the people of attica heretofore called cecropians took the name of athenians ovid whose metamorphoses mix much ancient truth with fable says that this prince at his death left it doubtful with posterity whether he excelled most in justice as a king or in military glory as a general  aegeus the reputed father of theseus was the eighth king of athens reckoning from cecrops and son of pandion ii grandson of erechthonius the crown having descended regularly from father to son through several generations after remaining childless for several years he consulted the oracle at delphi upon the mode of obtaining an heir to a very plain question he obtained a very obscure answer and not being able to solve the aenigma himself consulted several persons upon the interpretation of it and amongst others his friend pittheus king of troezene from whose sagacity he promised himself a solution of the difficulty this wise prince had a daughter named aethra and she having admitted aegeus to a secret consultation by night in the fane of minerva proved a more able interpreter of the delphic oracle than her father and put aegeus in possession of his wishes by bearing him a son this son was the hero theseus but it cannot be disguised that a doubt was started whether neptune had not a better claim to the child than aegeus for the princess aethra is charged with admitting both visiters in the same evening and when the controversy lies between a mortal and an immortal lover the most that can be said for aegeus is that it leaves the case doubtful the king of athens put in his claim by leaving his sword and sandals in custody of aethra when he understood she was pregnant enjoining her to let the child if he proved a son remain at troezene until he became adult and had strength enough to remove a block of stone under which he deposited his pledges on the hilt of the sword which was ivory he caused to be engraved his name and titles and aegeus declared he would acknowledge the bearer of those pledges and adopt him as his heir this being done he returned to athens and celebrated the panathenaea with uncommon splendour  this monarch filled the throne of athens for the space of fortyeight years and terminated his life by casting himself into the sea thence called aegean in despair upon discovering the vessel that brought his son theseus from his cretan expedition against the minotaur approach the shores of attica with black sails when the signal of life and victory was to be the contrary display of white ones which theseus by a fatal neglect had failed to put out upon his coming in sight of the coast  the impatient and despairing parent precipitated himself into the ocean and the son succeeded to his throne there is no hero in antiquity who for his magnanimity his adventures or the exquisite beauty and perfection of his person has been more celebrated than theseus in some of the actions of his life he performed real and distinguished services to his country in others he appears to have been governed merely by an extravagant and wild passion for adventure no hero has furnished more themes to the poets and few princes have at times deserved better of their subjects by his valor in action and the terror of his name he cleared many regions of those lawless clans of robbers and plunderers with which they were infested to the disgrace and danger of society ambitious to emulate the fame of his contemporary hercules he seems sometimes to have forgotten that he had subjects under his care and command and roved about in quest of adventures the general champion of distress and the sworn exterminator of monsters and tyrants wherever they were to be found preceded by his axebearers in commemoration of his destruction of the robbers and carrying on his shoulder the ponderous club of corynaetes whom he vanquished he marched in triumph to delphi like another hercules after his labors the bulls of crete and marathon and the cremmyonian boar were trophies that might vie with the hydra and corcyon whom he slew was as formidable a champion as antaeus and fixed the triumph of agility over strength he killed procrustes whose couch was as fatal as the den of cacus  theseus upon his accession to the government of attica reformed the state of justice and amended the condition of his subjects by many kingly regulations before his time the people were dispersed about the country in small and separated clans more like the settlements of savages than a regular community the police of course was very imperfect the laws were merely local and arbitrary nor did they generally agree in the same definition or distribution of justice to remedy these evils he enlarged his capital assembled the people from all parts fixed them to a residence in athens and established general courts of law and justice where all his subjects might resort to decide their properties or compose their wrongs by stated rules and institutes expounded and administered by judges competent to their vocation  these are services beneficial to mankind the actions of a patriot king and legislator infinitely superior to the extermination of boars or bulls the unravelling a labyrinth or conflicting with a wrestler one should have thought that the rambling spirit of theseus might henceforward have subsided and if hercules had not been upon earth this would probably have been the case and he would have descended to posterity one of the greatest characters in ancient history but the expedition against the amazons drew him out upon fresh and foolish adventures and though his friendship and his amors may have furnished pleasing tales and fables to hesiod and others the historian will do well to pass over this period of his life in silence and regret  it suffices to relate that menestheus took advantage of his absence and established himself so firmly in power that theseus on his return finding it impossible to dispossess him of his usurped authority retired to scyros and there either put a voluntary end to his life or was destroyed by lycomedes  in the reign of menestheus the famous siege of troy memorable to all ages was undertaken by the joint forces of all the grecian principalities the combined fleets assembled at athens and took their final departure from that port agamemnon conducted a hundred ships from mycenae menelaus sixty from sparta and menestheus joined with fifty the latter excelled all the generals of greece nestor only excepted in military science for arranging and disposing troops in order of battle homer has left this testimony in his favor and the authority is as indisputable as the record is immortal the town was taken in the last year of menestheuss life and reign he died in the island of melos and being one of the chiefs enclosed in the trojan horse had a leading share in the capture and destruction of that celebrated city no chief like thee menestheus greece could yield to marshal armies in the dusty field the extended wings of battle to display or close the embodied host in firm array nestor alone improved by length of days for martial conduct bore an equal praise pope  no xvi the expedition of the greeks against troy has supplied a subject to an heroic poem which remains the wonder of all time and the unrivalled standard of the epic art it must be owned no poet ever made a happier choice for what could be more interesting to a grecian reader than the recital of an action founded in justice and terminated in success the event itself was magnificent a coalition of the grecian states in vindication of an injured prince who was one of their number had it recorded the expedition of one great monarch against another it is easy to comprehend how much that brilliant variety of character which now gives such dramatic luster to the composition would have lost by the nature of such a subject whereas the emulation of the rival leaders constitutes that compound action that striking contrast and discrimination of character which render the iliad so peculiarly enchanting the justice of the undertaking fortifies the poet with a moral which secures the good opinion of his readers and interests them cordially in his cause it is so permanent a pledge for their good wishes that it enables him to throw into the scale of the trojans every episode of pity every ornament of magnanimity and valor which can beautify his poem without the danger of creating false prejudices in behalf of the offenders in short we can mourn for hector and not regret the victory of achilles  if homer found these incidents ready to his hands their combination was supremely happy if he created them his invention was almost miraculous the period at which he wrote was no less fortunate being neither too remote to impair the interest of his subject nor so near the time of the action as to confine his fancy to the limits of strict historical truth so wonderful an assemblage of parts meet in this great work that there is not a passion in the human breast but will find its ruling interest gratified by the perusal and it is so happily contrived that the combination of those parts multitudinous as they are never violates the uniformity of design the subject remains simple and entire our ideas never stray from the main object of the poem though they are continually carried out upon excursions through the regions of earth and heaven upon the strongest pinions of fancy the manner in which homer employs his deities with the machinery that accompanies them gives an amazing brilliancy to the picturesque and descriptive powers of the poem the virtues vices prejudices passions of those imaginary beings set them on a level with human nature so far as to give us an interest in their situations which a juster representation of superior essences could not impart while their immortality and power are engines in the poets hand whose influence is unlimited by the laws of nature these extraordinary personages at the same time that they take a part very essential to the action of the drama bring about the incidents by those sudden and supernatural means which mortal heroes of the most romantic sort could not so readily effect this is an advantage on the part of a heathen poet for which the christian writer has no substitute for those moderns who in order to create surprise have invented capricious beings to produce extravagant events above the reach of human powers and below the dignity of divine violate our reason whilst they struggle to amuse our fancy but the pagan theorist can find a deity for every purpose without giving scandal to the believer or revolting the philosopher  amongst the numberless excellencies of the iliad there is none more to be admired than the correct precision with which homer draws his characters and preserves them uniformly through the poem an excellence in which virgil and the roman poets in general are greatly his inferiors with homers heroes we have more than historical acquaintance we are made intimate with their habits and manners and whenever he withdraws them for a time we are certain upon the next meeting to recognize and acknowledge the same characteristic traces that separate each individual so decidedly from all others  but it is time to return to our history  after the death of menestheus the crown of athens returned into the family of theseus and demophon his son who also was present at the siege of troy succeeded to his inheritance oxyntes aphidas and thymaetes reigned in succession after demophon and the line of the erechthidae expired in the person of thymaetes this was a remarkable revolution for that family had possessed the throne of athens for a period of four hundred and twentynine years the monarchy properly so called was now drawing to its conclusion melanthus who succeeded to thymaetes was a messenian and a descendant from neleus he had been expelled from messene by the heraclidae and had taken refuge in the athenian state he obtained the crown by very honorable means thymaetes being challenged to single combat by xanthus king of boeotia declined the challenge melanthus accepted it in his stead slew xanthus and obtained the crown of athens in reward for his success at his death it devolved to his son codrus the manner in which this prince devoted himself to death for his country scarce needs a recital but it is not generally known that codrus was in a very advanced age when this event took place and moreover that the athenians urged him to the deed upon the report of cleomantis a citizen of delphi who made them acquainted with the answer of the oracle touching the conditions on which victory was to be obtained the athenians having prevailed with codrus to embrace the fatal conditions of their deliverance sacrificed their aged monarch and impressed with the persuasion that apollo would verify his prediction fought and overcame their enemy  codrus being dead the government of athens underwent a material revolution for the popular party pretending a respect to his memory put forward a decree prohibiting any other person to reign in athens by the title of king the change however for the present was more nominal than essential for they did not alter the succession nor materially reduce the power of the monarchy the prince or perpetual archon for each title is used occasionally held the government for life subject notwithstanding to account to the state for his administration of public affairs  medon son of codrus succeeded to his father by this new title thirteen princes reigned under this description from medon to alcmaeon inclusive comprehending a period of three hundred and seven years  some authorities maintain that homer came to athens in the time of medon and was hospitably received by that prince but it is generally thought the age of homer does not answer to this date and that he was born about two hundred years after the siege of troy this falls within the time of archippus grandson of medon and third perpetual archon in the beginning of whose reign hesiod was born homer some few years after at the close of it archippus reigned nineteen years and this era seems established by the best chronologists  archippus at the conclusion of whose administration we have placed the birth of homer was succeeded by thersippus who held the government of athens for a long incumbency of fortyone years and he was succeeded by phorbas who was thirty years archon in the period of these seventyone years we have the athenian era of the life of homer  this however must in some degree be left to opinion for before the institution of the olympiads the grecian chronicles are so vague and obscure that the precise age of homer will for ever remain a subject of conjecture the above period has at least the merit of holding a middle place between their opinions who suppose he was born soon after the siege of troy and such as contend he was contemporary with lycurgus the late mr robert wood in his essay on the original genius and writings of homer inclines to think the iliad and odyssey were finished about half a century after the capture of troy he has offered internal evidence in support of this opinion in homers account of the family of aeneas and his argument is acute and critical they who make him contemporary with lycurgus have internal evidence against them which though perhaps it does not serve to establish mr woods position certainly confutes the latter chronologists aristotle places homer in the same epoch with iphitus and the first olympiad but he rests his conjecture upon the weakest of all arguments whilst the best authorities as well as the majority in number point to the period which i have suggested and here for the present i will leave it  the last but one of the perpetual archons was aeschylus and in the second year of his government the olympiads were first instituted by iphitus at elis from this period we shall proceed with greater chronological precision  the successor of aeschylus and the last of the perpetual archons was alcmaeon the people of athens had newmodelled their government upon the death of codrus by abolishing the title of king and reducing their chief magistrate to be in fact rather the first subject of the state than the monarch this regulation appears to have been effected without any struggle on the part of the reigning family thirteen archons in succession had now been permitted to hold the government for life when upon the expiration of alcmaeons administration the people thought fit by a fresh reform to limit the duration of the chief magistracy to the term of ten years charops brother of alcmaeon and son of aeschylus was the first decennial archon and this revolution took place in the first year of the seventh olympiad whilst the athenian state was by these steps enlarging its liberties romulus and remus were forming the embryo of a mighty empire fated in the course of time to become mistress of the world these adventurers collected a body of latin shepherds amongst whom they had been educated and settling themselves on the palatine mount became the founders of rome this event is supposed to fall within the period of the seventh olympiad when charops was decennial archon it is generally supposed that this mighty empire was set in motion from one spark which greece had scattered from the conflagration of troy and which lighted on the shores of italy where it was kept alive for more than four centuries till rome was founded but aeneass italian colonization is a very questionable point and i am inclined to agree with mr wood in his treatise abovementioned that the posterity of aeneas did not migrate into italy but established themselves in the troade and reigned over the scattered remains of the trojans after the destruction of ilium  a revolution of eighteen olympiads produced a third change in the constitution of the athenian government in favor of popular freedom by limiting the archons to one year making the magistracy annual neither was this all for the command was no longer lodged in the hands of one person only but of nine the first of which was styled by preeminence archon and from him the year had its name the second entitled basileus took charge of religious ceremonies and the polemarc or third in office had the conduct of military affairs whilst all civil and judicial business was referred to the council of the remaining six called thesmothetae none but pure athenians of three descents could be chosen by lot into this council an oath of office was administered to them publicly in the portico of the palace purporting that they would execute the laws with justice and fidelity and take no gifts either from their clients or the people at large when they had performed their annual functions and acquitted themselves without impeachment they were in course aggregated to the areopagites and held that dignity for life every thing relating to the care of orphans and widows or the estates of minors was vested in the principal magistrate properly styled archon he had the charge of divorces and the superintendance of the parents and children of soldiers who fell in battle and of all such citizens who were maintained at the public charge  of these annual archons creon was the first and was elected about the twentyfourth olympiad  no xvii the athenian state continued to be governed by annual archons according to the alteration made in its constitution in the twentyfourth olympiad without any thing occurring of importance to merit a recital from the time of creon to the administration of draco in the thirtyninth olympiad the athenians having reduced the monarchical power to the most diminutive of all kingly representatives an annual archon had to all appearance effectually established their liberties but it has been the fate of freedom to be turned into abuse in all ages and the licentiousness of the people now seemed in more want of reform than the prerogative of the king had been in the most arbitrary times the moral purity of dracos manners and the stern inflexibility of his temper fitted him for an office that required both rigorous virtue and resolute dispatch for his time was short and his task laborious and full of danger had his power been permanent it is probable he would have qualified the severity of those famous laws which from their sanguinary nature were figuratively said to be written in blood and it is certain they breathe a spirit calculated rather for the extinction of society than for its reformation we must however admit the difficulty of devising any code of penal statutes by which degrees of punishment shall be equitably proportioned to degrees of offense we have no experience or history of any such code now existing or that ever did exist a citizen of the world will not estimate crimes and offenses by the same rule and standard as a citizen of any one particular community will local circumstances will give fainter or deeper colorings to crimes according to the peculiar constitution of the state against which they are committed the athenians in the time of draco were governed by annual magistrates the administration of these magistrates was made subject to popular enquiry upon its termination they had expunged from their constitution the wholesome though highsounding principle that a king cannot do wrong it was now become scarce possible that his substitute could do right the people sat in judgment on their governors and many of the most virtuous citizens in the state suffered under their sentence fear restrained the timid from exertion and the allurements of power debauched the interested and ambitious from their duty whilst the magistrate aimed at popularity the people became intolerably licentious the rigor of draco impresses us with a high idea of his purity of principle his abhorrence of the abuses of his predecessors in office and his indignation against the depravity of his fellowcitizens embittered his mind and made him rather a misanthrope than a statesman  draco seems to have considered the commission of crimes not in proportion to their offense against society but according to the principle of the criminal holding a transgressor equally guilty whether he broke the law in the least tittle or in its greatest extent for he punished indiscriminately with death in both cases in this there is as little wisdom as mercy and it is to the honor of solon that he revoked such undistinguishing and bloody laws justly to ascertain and define the various degrees of human depravity is impracticable for those who cannot search the human heart nor in the nature of things is it possible for any man or council of men to form a system of punishments to meet the several degrees and definitions of crimes with proportioned retribution sentence of death is at once the highest exertion of authority one fellow creature can exercise over another and the heaviest atonement any offender can make to the laws of that society in which he is inlisted draco excused himself from the charge of indiscriminate rigor by pleading that he could devise no punishment greater than death the nature of the plea gives an insight into the character of the man that needs no comment it is plain however that he had no idea of aggravating death by tortures he did not know or would not practice those detestable arts and refinements which now prevail in too many parts of the christian world of extorting criminations and confessions by heightening the agonies of death the short duration of his authority as i before observed precipitated him upon this system of severity which time and reflection would probably have corrected a hasty reformer is equally to be dreaded with a deliberate tyrant legal cruelty is of all most terrible a law once made is made to be executed the will of the judge cannot mitigate it and the power of the sovereign can only release from punishment but not apportion or modify it herein consists the irreparable defect of all established rules of fixed punishment to include different degrees of criminality under one and the same degree of penalty is not strict equity but to live without laws at the arbitrary disposal of any human tribunal is slavery of the most insupportable sort  by dracos laws an athenian was equally guilty of death whether he pilfered a cabbage or murdered a citizen horrible decree if the principle of punishment does not consist in revenging what is past but in preventing the culprit from repeating and the community from suffering the like or any other offense from the same person it may well be doubted if death need be inflicted in any case the terror of example not the spirit of revenge must constitute the necessity of such a mode of punishment if any necessity exists but if punishments may be devised by which guilty persons shall be made to atone to society without cutting them from it and if these punishments may be such as shall deter and terrify the evilminded equally with death itself policy independent of religion will be interested to adopt them  it was not to be expected that the athenians would be remedied by such sanguinary laws as these of draco and they had been in operation nearly half a century when solon in the third year of the fortysixth olympiad found the people in as much need of reformation as draco did in the beginning of the thirtyfifth olympiad  solon was of noble birth and of an elevated soul he was a friend to liberty but a lover of order descended from codrus he was a patriot by inheritance though he was a great adept in the philosophy of the times it neither soured his manners nor left him without attention to the public when he withdrew himself from the world for the purposes of study and contemplation it was to render himself a more useful citizen on his return to society with a fortune rather below mediocrity he had such a spirit of beneficence and generosity that he was obliged in his youth to apply himself to commerce to support his independence solons philosophy did not boast any unnatural contempt of pain or pleasure he affected no apathy on the contrary when he was reproached for weeping at the death of his son as if it was unbecoming of a wise man to bewail an evil he could not remedy he answered with a modest sensibility of his weakness that it was on that very account he did bewail it  the anecdote plutarch gives us of solons interview with his contemporary thales and the silly method that philosopher took for convincing solon of the advantages of celibacy by employing a fellow to make a false report to him of his sons death heightens our affection for the man without lowering our respect for the sage thales in the true spirit of sophism triumphed in the superiority of his wisdom by avoiding those connections which soften the human heart and vainly supposed he sunk the dignity of solons character by exposing to ridicule the tender feelings of the father  the athenians were exhausted by a tedious and unprosperous war with the people of megara the important island of salamis was lost and such was their despair of ever recovering it that they passed a law for making it a capital offense in any citizen to propose the retaking it solon who regarded this degrading edict with honest indignation feigned himself insane and rushing into the forum harangued the populace abrogated the edict and declared war against the megarensians on this occasion he addressed the people in elegiac verses of his own composing one hundred in number the power of his muse prevailed for it was great the people gave him the command of an expedition against salamis in which he had the good fortune to reduce that island and reannex it to his country which had made such public avowal of its despair  solon is so highly celebrated as a poet that some ancient authorities have equalled him to hesiod and even to homer we have few and small remains but many testimonies of his writings in particular we are informed that he composed five thousand verses on the commonwealth of athens recording the transactions of his own time not as a history in praise but in defense of himself and with the view to encourage his countrymen to persist in a course of public virtue and private morality he wrote iambics also and odes and composed even his laws in verse of which plutarch has quoted the exordium  he employed stratagem in the reduction of the island of salamis but as the celebrated pisistratus was joined with him in this enterprise it must not be disguised that some authorities give the success of the expedition to pisistratus both were men of consummate address and resource and each no doubt had his share of merit in the service the reputation solon gained by this event was still increased by his conduct in the defense of the famous temple of delphi against the sacrilegious cirrhaeans though he was only assessor to the general clisthenes the sicyonian in this campaign the successful termination of the war by the capture of cirrha was universally attributed to solon  athens was now rent by popular feuds and dissensions the commonwealth was in imminent peril every thing tending to civil tumult and confusion and the people in a state little short of absolute anarchy in this extremity every eye was turned toward solon and he was elected archon by the general voice of his fellowcitizens it was now not only in his power to make himself absolute master of the state and to establish that tyranny in his own person which he lived to see pisistratus aspire to and obtain but that step was also pressed upon him by the unanimous solicitation of his friends and the public at large religion had its share in the temptation for the temple of delphi uttered its oracular decree for his assuming the supreme power in athens and when he withstood the dazzling offer he had to combat the reproaches and invectives of all parties for refusing it a magnanimity that was proof against temptation was not to be shaken by calumny supported by conscious integrity he opposed the torrent and contenting himself with the limited authority of an annual magistracy framed and published those mild and salutary ordinances which have endeared his name to all posterity amongst the pacifying measures of his government he found it expedient to relieve the people by an ordinance for the remission of debts of a certain description this act raised a storm of opposition and abuse from all the rich and usurious against his administration and some who had been his intimates took part in the faction and began to persecute him in the bitterest manner charging him with the meanness of exempting himself as a creditor from the conditions of the act he soon turned the odium of the charge upon the contrivers of it by giving public proof to the city that he himself had been the first who obeyed his own law and remitted a considerable sum to his debtors this proof of his disinterestedness as a creditor convinced his countrymen of his uprightness as a legislator and he rose the higher in their esteem for the malevolent attack he had so fully repulsed reason and public gratitude at length prevailed and the voice of faction being put to silence the whole care of the commonwealth was surrendered into his hands to be regulated and reformed according to his wisdom and discretion  solon though too magnanimous to accept the title of king was too good a citizen to decline the trust and now it was that he abrogated all dracos sanguinary laws except those that affected murderers this as i before observed occurred in the course of the fortysixth olympiad he arranged the people into four classes according to the different proportions of their property he erected the principal council of the areopagites with inferior courts for the administration of law and justice and published his famous manifesto for rendering infamous all persons who in civil seditions should remain spectators of their countrys danger by a criminal neutrality he enacted many wholesome regulations respecting marriages tending to the increase of population he suppressed libels and made idleness punishable by law he put under certain disabilities parents who were convicted of having grossly neglected the education of their families and restrained by sumptuary laws every species of public excess many more of his laws might be enumerated if it were necessary to enlarge upon facts so generally known but it will suffice to mention that when he had completed his code he bound the senators to the observance of what it contained by the solemnest oath he could devise and causing his laws to be engraven on tables of wood hung them up in the public courts that no man might plead ignorance  the nature of this oath is curious the senator was led up to a ponderous stone preserved in the forum there the oath was publicly administered and the obligation of it was that he should dedicate a piece of gold to the temple of delphi of equal weight with the stone if he was proved guilty of having violated his oath not content with thus swearing the judges and senators to the faithful administration of his laws he also bound the people by oath to their due observance and having done all this with a temper and prudence particularly expressive of his character solon took his leave of athens and sat out upon his travels into egypt  no xviii although the wisdom and magnanimity of solon are conspicuous in every action of his life which history has transmitted to us nothing is more worthy of our admiration and praise than the circumstance last recorded of his secession from athens  it is not necessary to follow him in his travels in which after some time spent in visiting egypt cyprus and lydia he obeyed the summons of his fellowcitizens and returned to athens that city during his absence had been distracted by furious and contending factions lycurgus headed one party megacles son of alcmaeon another and pisistratus was leader of a third in which was included nearly the whole inferior order of the people all these parties nevertheless preserved a respect for their ancient benefactor and lawgiver and he spared no pains in return to assuage and compose the disorders of the state but in vain age indeed had not yet deprived him of his mental faculties but his corporeal ones were debilitated and the crisis called for more activity than he was now capable of exerting he could no longer speak in public nor address the people in the forum as he was accustomed to do he tried his influence separately and in private with the leaders of the several factions pisistratus whose manners were of the gentlest kind affected to receive the advice and counsels of solon with great external respect but ambition had taken too firm hold of his heart and he had laid his plans too deep to be diverted from them by the patriotic discourses of this venerable citizen the sagacity of solon penetrated his designs and when he was convinced of his dissimulation and saw the liberties of his country on the point of being overthrown by this artful daemagogue he came into open court in military array and presented himself to the assembly ready to head the friends of their country and expel pisistratus by force of arms the noble effort was too late for the spirit of the people was lost and all men seemed disposed to surrender themselves without resistance to the usurper solon finding that he could not rouse them to a consideration of their ancient dignity nor inspire them with a becoming sense of the value of liberty laid aside his arms and suspending them at the door of the courthouse took a short but pathetic leave of athens and once again retired into voluntary banishment whither is not distinctly ascertained many pressing invitations were addressed to him from different parts and i am inclined to think he accepted that of croesus king of lydia and that he closed an illustrious life in extreme old age in the island of cyprus his ashes by his express direction were transported to his native island of salamis and there deposited the athenians erected his statue in brass but pisistratus revoked his laws the laws of draco notwithstanding their severity were in execution for a longer period than the mild and prudent ordinances of solon the people it is true never wholly forfeited their respect for this excellent person but they were unworthy of him even pisistratus amidst the struggles of ambition offered no insult to his person and every country which his fame had reached presented an asylum to the venerable exile  as an orator solon stands high in point of merit and first in order of time as a poet his genius was sublime various and fluent in subjects of fiction and fancy he never dealt but though he chose his topics with the gravity of a statesman and handled them with the fidelity of an historian he composed with ardour and never failed to fire his hearers with the recitation of his poems he is supposed to have reprobated the drama but if this be a fact we may well conclude that it was the old corrupt masque of bacchus and the satyrs of which he signified his dislike and in this he is warranted in two expeditions where he had a military command he was eminently successful and gained a high degree of glory no statesman ever stood in times more perilous no citizen ever resisted more alluring offers of ambition and no legislator ever regulated a more disorderly community though devoted to the study of philosophy and a great master in the early science of the times he mixed with cheerfulness in society was friendly and convivial and did not hold back from those tender ties and attachments which connect a man to the world and which by some have been considered incompatible with a life devoted to wisdom and sublime philosophy strict in his morals as draco he was not like him disposed to put criminals to death whilst there was any hope of conducting them by gentle measures to repentance his modesty was natural and unaffected and though he was generally silent in company his silence threw no damp upon festivity for it did not savor of sullenness and he was known to be a friend to the use of wine with freedom but without excess at the meeting of the seven celebrated sages his contemporaries and colleagues in wisdom when they were entertained by periander at corinth the golden salver which the milesian fishermen had dragged out of the sea in their net and which the delphic oracle upon reference of the controversy had decreed to the wisest man of the age was by general suffrage given to solon each person with becoming deference to the others had severally declined the prize but solon was at length constrained to receive it by concurrent vote of the whole assembly  historians are not agreed upon the exact time of solons departure from athens and some maintain that he continued there till his death this is not probable but the result of the accounts puts it out of doubt that he remained there whilst there was any hope of composing the disturbances of the state and of restoring its tranquillity and freedom under the prudent regulations he had established when he was archon  but no sooner had this excellent citizen turned his back upon athens than all these hopes perished and universal despair took place the degeneracy of the people became incurable and no one was found with authority or zeal to oppose the approaching revolution though solon was far in the decline of life yet if there had been any public virtue subsisting the liberty of athens had not been lost without a struggle but although neutrality in civil commotions had been declared infamous and criminal by the laws of solon the populace through despair or indolence declined the contest and held themselves in readiness to receive a master in either of the contending partisans who should prevail over his competitors  fortune and superior address at length decided the prize of ambition to pisistratus and his party for he possessed every qualification that could recommend him to the public of insinuating manners with a beautiful and commanding person he was gallant eloquent and munificent no man acquitted himself more gracefully as a public speaker and when pericles in aftertimes alarmed the jealousy of the athenians the resemblance he bore to pisistratus in eloquence as well as in features was so striking that he was universally called the second pisistratus and the comic poets in their satirical allusions exhibited him on the stage by that name and character  whilst these party struggles were in suspense pisistratus used an artifice for recommending himself to the people which was decisive in his favor one day on a sudden he rushed into the forum where the citizens were assembled as if he had been flying from assassins who were in pursuit of him and presented himself to public view defaced with wounds and covered with blood he was mounted in his chariot and the mules that drew him were streaming with blood as well as himself the crowd flocked around him and in this situation without wiping his wounds or dismounting from his chariot he harangued the forum he told them he had that instant escaped from the assassinating swords of the nobles who had cruelly attempted to destroy the man of the people for his activity in opposing the exactions of sordid creditors and usurious tyrants his tears his sufferings the beauty of his person now streaming with blood which he had spilt in their cause his military services at megara and his protestations of affection to the people in whose defense he solemnly protested a determination to persist or perish all together formed such an address to the passions and presented such a picture to the eye that were irresistibly affecting  though it soon appeared in proof that the whole was artifice and that all these wounds about himself and his mules were of his own giving for the impression of the moment still the moment served his purpose and in the heat of popular tumult he obtained a decree for granting him a bodyguard not armed as soldiers but with sticks and clubs at the head of this desperate rabble he lost no time in forcing his way into the citadel and took possession of it and the commonwealth in the same moment he next proceeded to exile the most powerful and obnoxious of his opponents megacles and lycurgus with their immediate adherents either fled from the city or were forcibly driven out of it the revolution was complete  the tumult having subsided pisistratus began to look around him and to take his measures for securing himself in the authority he had seized for this purpose he augmented his bodyguard which as they were first voted to him consisted only of fifty these he endeavored to attach to his person by liberal payments and whilst he equipt them at all points like soldiers he put a cunning stratagem in practice by which he contrived to seize all the private arms of the citizens and totally dismantled athens he used less ceremony with the nobles for he stripped them of all weapons of offense openly and by force and now he found himself as he believed in safe possession of the sovereign power and throne of athens  this passed in the fiftyfirst olympiad when comias was archon  it rarely happens that dominion rapidly obtained proves firmly established the factions of megacles and lycurgus were broken by this revolution but not extinguished and pisistratus either could not prevent their reuniting or perhaps oversecurity made him inattentive to their movements he enjoyed his power for a short time and was in his turn driven out of athens by those he had exiled and his effects were put up to public sale as the property of an outlaw  megacles and lycurgus now divided the government between them this was a system that soon wrought its own overthrow and megacles finding his party the weaker invited pisistratus to return to athens vainly imagining he could lull his ambition and secure him to his interest by giving him his daughter caesyra in marriage pisistratus accepted the terms and obeyed the welcome recall but it was in such a manner as might have put the weakest man upon his guard for his return and entrance into athens were accompanied by one of the most barefaced attacks upon public credulity and superstition that is to be found in the history of man  he had already succeeded in several hardy stratagems and all had been discovered after they had served his purposes his pretended assassination his contrivances for arming his bodyguard and for disarming the citizens at large were all well known to the people so that he must have taken a very nice measure of their folly and blindness when upon his entering the city he undertook to bring in his train a woman named phaea whom he dressed in the habit of the goddess minerva and imposed her on the vulgar for their tutelar deity in person he had instructed her how to address the people in his behalf commanding them to reinstate him in his power and open the gates of the citadel at his approach the lady was sufficiently personable for the character she assumed and as a proof of her divinity was of colossal stature extravagant as the experiment may seem it succeeded in all points the human deity was obeyed and the ingenious demagogue carried all before him this grecian joan of arc received the adoration of the superstitious vulgar in public and the grateful caresses of the exulting tyrant in private the lady was not of very distinguished birth and fortune for before she took upon her the character of a goddess she condescended to the mortal occupation of a flowergirl and made garlands after the custom of the greeks for feasts and merrymakings pisistratus rewarded her liberally by giving her in marriage to his son hipparchus a commodious resource for disposing of a castoff goddess as for himself he was engaged to caesyra phaeas marriage with hipparchus soon convinced the world that she was a mortal but pisistratus gave himself no concern to prevent the discovery in process of time it came to pass upon pisistratuss second expulsion that phaea was publicly impeached and condemned upon the charge of laesae majestatis  no xix pisistratus had been five years in exile when megacles brought about his recall and vainly thought to fix him in his interest by giving him his daughter caesyra in marriage such alliances rarely answer the political ends for which they are made pisistratus had several sons by his first wife and having reestablished himself in the tyranny after the manner we have been describing and bestowed his favorite phaea upon his son hipparchus he took the daughter of megacles as the condition of his contract with her father but with a fixed determination against a second family whose pretensions might come in competition with those of his children by his first marriage in whose favor he wished to secure the succession and who both by age and capacity were fit for government whenever it should devolve upon them  caesyra put up with her husbands neglect for some time but at length she imparted her disgust to her mother and she of course communicated it to megacles justly offended by the indignity of such treatment megacles immediately took his measures with the enemies of his soninlaw for his second expulsion prudently disguising his resentment till he was in a condition to put it in force it did not long escape the penetration of pisistratus but when he came to the knowledge of the conspiracy that had been formed against his power he found himself and party too weak to oppose it and seizing the hour of safety made a voluntary abdication by retiring into eretria without a struggle and in the utmost precipitation  megacles and his friends seem to have considered this secession of pisistratus as decisive or else the time did not allow them to follow it by any active measures for preventing his return eleven years however passed and still he remained an exile from athens old as he was his ambition does not seem to have cooled nor was he idle in the interim he had an interview with his sons in eretria and concerted measures with them for his restoration he formed alliances with several of the grecian cities particularly thebes and argos and obtained a seasonable supply of money with which he enlisted and took into his pay a considerable army of mercenaries and began hostilities in the athenian state by seizing upon marathon this successful measure drew out many of his secret partisans from athens to join him in this place where the promising aspect of his affairs and the popularity of his character had induced great numbers to resort to his standard thus reinforced he put his army in motion and directed his march toward the city the ruling party at athens hastily collected troops to oppose his approach and put them under the command of leogaras who no sooner took the field against pisistratus than he suffered himself and army to be surprised by that experienced general and fled in disorder over the country the politic conqueror stopped the pursuit and dispatched his sons after the fugitives to assure them of pardon and protection if they would go back to their homes and resume their occupations in peace like good citizens pisistratus was far advanced in age and having carried this decisive action by stratagem took every prudent precaution for establishing his advantage by seizing the sons of the leading partisans in opposition to his government and detaining them in close custody as hostages for the peaceable behavior of their parents he conducted himself on the occasion with so much temper and judgment the splendour of his talents and the elegance of his manners reflected so much luster on his court and country that his usurpation was either no longer remembered or remembered without aversion and regret in short his genius for government was such that no man questioned his right even solon with all his zeal for liberty pronounced of pisistratus that athens would not have contained a more virtuous citizen had his ambition been directed to a more justifiable pursuit he was mild and merciful in the extreme winning in address an eloquent orator a just judge and a munificent sovereign in a word he had either the merit of possessing or the art of dissembling every good quality and every brilliant accomplishment  having now brought down this brief recapitulation of the athenian history to the last period of the reign of pisistratus we are arrived at the point of time in which that remarkable era commences which i call the literary age of greece it was now that pisistratus conceived the enlarged and liberal idea of instituting the first public library in greece and of laying it open to the inspection and resort of the learned and curious throughout the kingdoms and provinces of that part of the world  libros athenis disciplinarum liberalium public ad legendum praebendos primus posuisse dicitur pisistratus tyrannus aul gell cap xvii lib vi  through a long though interrupted reign of three and thirty years he had approved himself a great encourager of literature and a very diligent collector of the works of learned men the compiler of the scattered rhapsodies of homer and the familiar friend of the great epic poet orpheus of croton author of the argonautics he was himself accomplished in the learning of the age he lived in and whilst his court became a place of resort for contemporary genius he pushed his researches after the remains of the ancient poets and philosophers through every spot where the liberal sciences had been known to flourish collecting books in ionia sicily and throughout all the provinces of greece with much cost and diligence and having at length completed his purpose and endowed a library with the treasures of the time he laid it open to all readers for the edification of mankind  who of those times surpassed him in learning says cicero or what orator was more eloquent or accomplished than pisistratus who first disposed the works of homer in that order of compilation we have them at this very time  de orat iii     the institution of this library forms a signal epoch in the annals of literature for from this period attica took the lead of all the provinces of greece in arts and sciences and athens henceforward became the school of philosophers the theater of poets and the capital of taste and elegance acknowledged to a proverb throughout the world from this period to the death of menander the comic poet an illustrious scene presents itself to our observation greece with unbounded fertility of genius sent a flood of compositions into light of which although few entire specimens have descended to posterity yet these with some fragments and what may be further collected on the subject from the records of the scholiasts and grammarians afford abundant matter for literary disquisition  it is painful in the extreme to reflect upon the ravages of time and to call to mind the host of authors of this illuminated age who have perished by the irruptions of the barbarous nations when we meditate on the magnificence of the ancient buildings of greece and rome the mind is struck with awe and veneration but those impressions are of a very melancholy cast when we consider that it is from their present ruins we are now measuring their past splendour in like manner from a few relics of ancient genius we take a mournful estimate of those prodigious collections which till the fatal conflagrations at alexandria remained entire and were without comparison the most valuable treasure upon earth  pisistratus as we have observed established the first public library in greece xerxes plundered athens of this collection much augmented by the literary munificence of hipparchus and the succeeding archons xerxes was not like the barbarians of the lower ages insensible to the treasure he had possessed himself of on the contrary he regarded these volumes as the most solid fruits of his expedition and imported them into persia as splendid trophies of his triumph on his return seleucus surnamed nicanor afterward restored this library to athens with a princely magnanimity the kings of pergamus also became great collectors and the pergamaean library grew into much reputation and resort but of all the libraries of antiquity that collected at alexandria by the ptolemies of egypt was much the most respectable athenaeus says p   that ptolemy philadelphus purchased the pergamaean library and in particular the books collected by nileus principally consisting of the greek dramatists which with what he got at athens and rhodes furnished the great library at alexandria with forty thousand volumes this library was unhappily set on fire when julius caesar found it necessary to burn his ships in the docks at alexandria so plutarch states the case but aulus gellius says they were set on fire accidentally by the auxiliary troops  non sponte neque opera consulta sed a militibus forte auxiliariis incensa sunt  this misfortune was in a great measure repaired by the library which marc antony presented to cleopatra and by subsequent additions was increased to such an amount that when it was at last irretrievably destroyed by the caliph omar it consisted of seven hundred thousand volumes  this amazing repository of ancient science was buried in ashes by the wellknown quibbling edict of that barbarous fanatic  if said the caliph these volumes contain doctrines conformable to the koran then is the koran alone sufficient without these volumes but if what they teach be repugnant to gods book then is it fitting they were destroyed  thus with false reason for their judge and false religion for their executioner perished an innumerable company of poets philosophers and historians with almost every thing elegant in art and edifying in science which the most illuminated people on earth had in the luxuriancy of their genius produced in vain did the philosopher john of alexandria intercede to save them universal condemnation to the flames was the sentence ignorance denounced against these literary martyrs the flow of wit the flights of fancy and the labors of learning alike contributed to feed the fires of those baths in which the savage conquerors recreated themselves after the toils of the siege need we enquire when art and science were extinct if darkness overspread the nations it is a period too melancholy to reflect upon and too vacant to record history passes over it as over the chart of an ocean without a shore with this cutting recollection accompanying it that in this ocean are buried many of the brightest monuments of ancient genius  it appears that at the time terence was writing rome was in possession of two thousand greek comedies of all which vae barbaris not one has descended to us except what are found in our scanty volume of aristophanes and these are partly of the old personal class the gleanings of a few fragments from the grammarians and scholiasts with the translations of the roman stage are now the only samples of the greek comedy in its last purity and perfection it is true that writers of the lower ages and even the fathers of the christian church have quoted liberally from the new comedy of the greeks these fragments are as respectable for their moral cast as for their elegant turn of expression but what a poignancy do they give to our regret when we compute the loss posterity has suffered by the scale of these remains  on the part of tragedy although very many noble works have perished yet as some specimens of the great masters have come down to us entire we have more to console us in this than in the comic department happily for the epic muse the rage of ignorance could not reach the immortal poems of homer what other compositions of that great bard may have been lost to the world is but a dark enquiry at the best many poems of an antecedent and some of a contemporary date have undoubtedly been destroyed but i am inclined to think that from the time when those wonderful productions of the iliad and odyssey were collected and made public at athens till the augustan era little was attempted in the epic branch  no xx at the same time that it is fair to suppose there must be more than ordinary merit in men who rise to great opulence and condition in life from low beginnings all the world must be sensible of the danger attending sudden elevation and how very apt a mans head is to turn who climbs an eminence to which his habits have not familiarized him a mountaineer can tread firm upon a precipice and walk erect without tottering along the path that winds itself about the craggy cliff on which he has his dwelling whilst the inhabitant of the valley travels with affright and danger over the giddy pass and oftentimes is precipitated from the height to perish in the gulf beneath his feet such is the fate of many who by the revolutions of fortune are raised to lofty situations it is generally the lot of such people to make few friends in their danger there are none to give them warning in their fall there are few to afford them pity  this is not the case with them who are born to the dignities they enjoy the sovereign whose throne is his inheritance meets with pity and indulgence pity for the cares inseparable from his condition indulgence for the failings and excesses incidental to hereditary greatness but the man who is the maker of his own fortune acts on a stage where every step he takes will be observed with jealousy amongst the many thousands who are set to watch him let him reflect how many hearts there are rankling with disappointed pride and envying him the lot which in their own conceit at least their merit had a better title to when such a man appears it is the common cry  i cannot bear that upstart  at the same time therefore that it must be allowed more natural to excuse the proud looks of the high than the proud looks of the low still it is no bad caution to beware of giving easy faith to reports against those whom so many unsuccessful people are interested to decry for though fortune can do mighty things amongst us and make great men in this world she cannot make friends  if caution be necessary for such as are only lookers on upon these sudden changes in the scene of life how much more wary should he be who by fortunes favor is the actor in it time past and present so abounds in examples to put him on his guard that if he will not profit by example what hope is there that precept will avail that any man should grow arrogant who has once been dependant is as unaccountable for the folly of the thing as it is for the baseness of it it is as if a pedagogue should turn tyrant because he remembers to have smarted under the lash of the master when a schoolboy and yet there seems a principle in some natures that inclines them to this despicable species of revenge by which they sacrifice all claim to reason reputation or religion dionysius though the cruellest of all tyrants had moderation in a private station and made a good and patient schoolmaster he handled the scepter like a rod and the rod as he should have done a scepter are we to conclude from this and other instances that humanity may be learnt by those who descend from power but that men become tyrants by ascending to it  is there in nature any thing so ridiculous as pride so selfdestructive so absurd the man who rises out of humble life must have seen it felt it and remarked its folly he must have been convinced that pride deprives itself of its own proper object for every proud man who assumes a superiority on the score of rank or wealth or titles forfeits that better interest with mankind which would have credited him for superiorities of a far nobler quality than those on which he grounds his silly arrogance how strange is it therefore when the man who has seen through the weakness of this passion in others whilst below them in condition should fall into the same folly when he rises to be their equal and yet it happens every day what is so hateful to a poor man as the purseproud arrogance of a rich one let fortune shift the scene and make the poor man rich he runs at once into the vice that he declaimed against so feelingly these are strange contradictions in the human character one should have thought that pope sixtus v might have recollected himself enough to be humble though pasquin had never reminded him of it but neither he nor becket nor wolsey had any moderation in their spirit though professing a religion whose very essence is humility  in modern times the philosophers stone seems to have been found by our adventurers in the east where beggars have become princes and princes have become beggars if ben johnson was now living could he have painted these upstart voluptuaries more to the life than by the following animated description  i will have all my beds blown up not stuffed down is too hard and then my oval room filled with such pictures as tiberius took from elephantis and dull aretine but coldly imitated  my mists i will have of perfume vapourd bout the room to lose ourselves in and my baths like pits to fall into from whence we will come forth and roll us dry in gossamour and roses  my meat shall all come in in indian shells dishes of agate set in gold and studded with emeralds saphirs hyacinths and rubies the tongues of carp dormise and camels heels boiled in the spirit of sol and dissolved pearl apicius diet against the epilepsie and i will eat these broths with spoons of amber headed with diamond and carbuncle my footboy shall eat pheasants i myself will have the beards of barbels served instead of sallads oild mushrooms and the swelling unctuous paps of a fat pregnant sow newly cut off dressed with an exquisite and poignant sauce for which i will say unto my cook there is gold go forth and be a knight  my shirts i will have of taffata sarsnet soft and light as cobwebs and for all my other raiment it shall be such as might provoke the persian were he to teach the world riot anew my gloves of fishs and birds skins perfumed with gums of paradise and eastern air  q and do you think to have the the stone with this  a no i do think to have all this with the stone alchymist these are strong colors and though he has dipped his pencil pretty liberally into the pallet of the ancients he has finely mixed the composition with tints of his own to speak in the same figure we may say of this sketch that it is in the very best style of the master  as i should be loath however to offer none but instances of the abuse of prosperity i am happy in recollecting one very singular example of the contrary sort though i go back to times far distant from our own to fetch it  pisistratus to solon i am neither without example in seizing the tyranny nor without claim forasmuch as i derive from codrus and take no more by force than i should have inherited by right if the athenians had never violated those oaths of allegiance which in times past confirmed the prerogative of my ancestors i live here without offense toward men or gods neither transgressing your laws myself nor permitting others to transgress them judge therefore if the constitution you have given to athens is not safer under my administration than if entrusted to the discretion of the people no man suffers wrong under my government nor do i exact any new contributions from my people contenting myself with the tenths of their produce as by ancient usage established and these i apply not to my own coffers but to those of the state for defraying civil and religious expenses and as a provision for the future exigencies of war against you solon i harbor no ill will convinced that in your opposition to my measures you acted upon public not personal motives you could not foresee what use i was to make of power and if you could have foreseen it i will persuade myself you would neither have traversed my interests nor withdrawn yourself from your country return therefore i conjure you return to athens and believe me on the word of a king you have nothing to fear from pisistratus who has not the heart as you well know to annoy even his enemies much less so excellent a citizen as solon come then if you are so disposed and be received into the number of my dearest friends but if you are resolved against returning remember it is your own choice and if solon is lost to his country pisistratus is acquitted of being the cause of it  farewell  solon to pisistratus i can readily believe that you are incapable of doing me any injury if i was to return to athens before you was a tyrant i was your friend and am now no otherwise your enemy than every athenian must be who is adverse to your usurpation whether it is better to be governed by the will of one man or by the laws of the commonwealth let every individual judge for himself if i could prefer a tyrant certainly of all tyrants i should prefer pisistratus as to my returning to athens i do not think it for my honor after having founded the constitution of my country upon principles of freedom to come home upon motives of conenience and give a scandal to mankind by appearing to acquiesce under that tyranny which you have forcibly assumed but which i when voluntarily offered thought proper to reject  farewell  the above letters are to be found in diogenes laertius but the learned reader knows they are generally supposed interpolations of the sophists it must be owned however they are characteristic of the writers and though they ought not to be received as facts in history may be read as a speech in livy or guicciardini the following anecdotes will throw a stronger light upon the character of pisistratus and as there is no reason to question their authenticity they will be unanswerable witnesses to the point in question  at an entertainment given by pisistratus to some of his intimates thrasippus a man of violent passions and enflamed with wine took some occasion not recorded to break out into the most virulent abuse and insult pisistratus who had made no reply to his invectives fearing that the festivity of his guests should be interrupted by the misconduct of thrasippus who was now got up and leaving the room rose from his seat and entreated him to stay assuring him that nothing he had said should be remembered to his disadvantage instead of being pacified by an act so gracious and condescending the brutal drunkard became more furious and after venting all the soulest words a heated imagination could suggest with a violence shocking to decency and loathsome to relate suddenly turned upon pisistratus as he was soliciting him to take his seat at the table and spate in his face upon an insult so intolerable the whole company rose as one man and in particular hippias and hipparchus sons of the tyrant were with difficulty prevented from killing him on the spot the interposition of pisistratus saved thrasippus and he was suffered to go home without any violence to his person the next morning brought him to his senses and he appeared in the presence of pisistratus with all proper humility expecting to receive the punishment he merited what must have been his selfconviction and reproach when he was again received with the utmost complacency penetrated to the heart with the recollection of his behavior and the unmerited pardon he had met with he was proceeding to execute that vengeance on himself which he was conscious he deserved by rushing on his sword when pisistratus again interposed and seizing his hand stopped the stroke not content with this he consoled him with the most soothing expressions assured him of his most entire forgiveness and having put him at peace with himself reinstated him in his favor and received him again into the number of his intimates though it is scarce possible to find an instance of goodnature in any mans character superior to the above i am tempted to add the following anecdote not only as a corroborating evidence but from the pleasure one naturally takes in hearing or relating facts that make so much to the honor of human nature and which inspire the heart with a love for mankind  thrasimedes a young athenian had the audacity to force a kiss upon the daughter of pisistratus as she was walking in public procession at a religious solemnity transported by the violence of his passion and considering that he had already committed an unpardonable offense he seized her person and forcibly conveying her on board a ship put to sea with her on his passage to aegina the sons of pisistratus pursued and overtook him bringing him in person before their father thrasimedes without betraying any marks of fear immediately declared himself perfectly prepared to meet any punishment pisistratus should think fit to decree for having miscarried in his attempt and lost the object for which alone he wished to live all consequences became indifferent disappointment not death was his punishment and when the greater evil had been suffered he had little apprehension for the lesser  having said this he waited his sentence when pisistratus after long silence breaking out into admiration at the resolution of thrasimedes instead of punishing his audacity rewarded his passion by bestowing his daughter upon him in marriage no xxi non jam illud quaero contra ut me diligat illa aut quod non potis est esse pudica velit ipse valere opto et tetrum hunc deponere morbum catullus it is become a very gainful trade with our smallware venders of literature to expose certain pamphlets in shop windows and upon stalls in alleys and thoroughfares which if any police was kept up in this great capital would be put down by the civil magistrate as a public nuisance i mean trials for adultery the publishers of which are not content with setting down every thing verbatim from their shorthand records which the scrutinizing necessity of law draws out by pointed interrogatory but they are also made to allure the curiosity of the passenger by tawdry engravings in which the heroine of the tale

slander and prostitute her honor without risqueing her reputation a husband must be a brute indeed who can object to this society and a wife must be a fool indeed who does not profit by it when a newmarried woman receives these privileged ladies in her house she sees at once the folly of being virtuous for they are the merriest the loudest the best followed and the most admired of all their sex they never disgrace their characters by a pusillanimous repentance they never baulk their pleasures by a stupid reformation but keep it up with spirit like felons that die hard at the gallows to the last moment of their lives most of them marry again and are so much better than their neighbors as they are made honest women of twice over and that reputation must be more than commonly tender which two coats of plaster will not keep together  as a further temptation to our young wives not to wait the tedious course of nature but to make themselves widows of living husbands as soon as they can they will recollect that they ensure advantages to themselves thereby which natural widows do not enjoy for in the first place they avoid a years mourning which is a consideration not to be despised in the next place they have precedents for marrying in the first week of their widowhood and as it is the general practice to choose their gallants they certainly run no risque of taking a step in the dark which widows sometimes have been suspected to repent of thirdly they escape all bickerings and jealousies which disturb the peace of families by the common practice of ladies putting their second husband in mind of what their first husband would have done or would have said on this or that occasion had he been alive  things were not so in my first husbands time  oh that my first husband were living he would not suffer this or that thing to pass this or that man to use me after such a manner  are familiar expressions in the family dialogues of second wives in the regular order whereas the irregulars never cast these taunts in the teeth of their spouses because they know the answer is ready at hand if they did  the irregulars have also frequent opportunities of showing their affability and sweetness of temper upon meeting their first husbands in public places and mixed companies the graceful acknowledgement of a respectful curtesy a downcast look of modest sensibility or the pretty flutter of embarrassment are incidents upon an unexpected rencontre which a wellbred woman knows how to make the most of and are sure to draw the eyes of the company upon her  if on the other hand a lady on her divorce chooses to revive her maiden title and take post in her former rank the law will probably give her back as good a title to her virgin name as it found her with she also has her advantages for at the same time that she is free from the encumbrances of matrimony she escapes the odious appellation of old maid such a lady has the privilege of public places without being pinned to the skirts of an old dowager like other misses she can also indulge a natural passion for gaming to a greater length than spinsters dare to go she can make a repartee or smile at a double entendre when a spinster only bites her lips or is put to the troublesome resource of her fan when she ought to blush but cannot  before i turned my mind to reflect upon these and other advantages so preponderating in favor of divorces i used to wonder why our legislature was so partial to suitors and gave such notorious encouragement and facility to acts of parliament for their relief and accommodation i now see the good policy of the measure and how much the ease of his majestys good subjects is thereby consulted it is confessed there is a short monition in the decalogue against this practice but nobody insists upon it there are also some texts scattered up and down in holy writ to the same purport but no wellbred preacher ever handles such topics in his pulpit and if a fine lady should ever read a chapter in the bible or hear it read to her it is very easy to skip over those passages and every polite person knows it is better to make a breach in any thing than in good manners to a lady  our english ladies by the frequency of their incontinence and the divorces thence ensuing have not only furnished out a most amusing library to young students of both sexes but they have effectually retrieved the characters of our wives from sinking into contempt with foreigners on account of their domestic insipidity and attachment to the dull duties of a family this was once the general opinion which other nations entertained of our matrons but upon a late tour through a great part of the continent of europe i found it was entirely reversed and ideas more expressive of their spirit universally adopted  it may well be expected that the influx of foreigners and the outflow of natives which the present peace will occasion will not suffer the pretensions of our ladies to lose ground in this particular our french neighbors are certainly good critics in gallantry and they need not now stand in dread of a repulse from the women of england whatever they may apprehend from the men  much more occurs to me on this subject but these premises will serve to introduce an idea which if the several ladies who have stood trial would club their wits to assist me in might be rendered practicable and that is of reducing infamy to a system by rules and regulations of manners tending to the propagation and increase of divorces in great britain a few loose hints occur to me on this subject but i offer them with the utmost submission to better judges simply as rudiments in the art the refinements must be left to those who are professors  as early impressions are strongest and most lasting i would advise all mothers who wish to train their daughters after the above system to put them in their infancy under the care of those commodious ladies whom we vulgarly call mademoiselles as the best forcers of early plants under whose tuition young ladies have been known to get so forward as to have pretty notions of flirtation at the tender age of six years at eight years they can answer questions in the catechism of gallantry before they reach their tenth summer they can leer ogle talk french write sonnets play with the footmen and go through their exercises to admiration i would then put them to their studies of which the annals abovementioned will be a principal part the circulating libraries will furnish out a considerable catalogue and mademoiselle will supply them with french memoirs novels etc etc at the age of twelve it will be proper to send them to the boardingschool and there they will have the opportunity of making female friendships with their seniors in age by which they will greatly edify in the holiday vacations they will correspond with their boardingschool associates and these letters should be sacred and inviolable by which means they may carry on an intercourse of thoughts without reserve and greatly improve their style  when two years have been thus employed they must be brought to london to be finished under the best masters most of which should be recommended by mademoiselle and in their intervals from study they will be allowed to relax their minds in the company of their mother by looking on at the cardtables reposing themselves after their fatigue upon sophas informing themselves of the intrigues of the town qualifying themselves in a proper familiarity of manners by calling young men by their sirnames romping occasionally with the gallants of their mother when she is out of sight and above all things cultivating intimacies with their late schoolfellows who are come out into the world  when their hair is off their foreheads it will be necessary they should lay out professedly for admirers amongst the young rakes of fashion and for this purpose i particularly recommend to them the tearoom at the operahouse where i would have them stay out all the company and then commit themselves to their gallants to find out their coaches who will be sure to lead them through all the blind alleys and never carry them to the right door till the last by which time the carriages of these gallants will be drove off and then common charity will compel them to bring the obliging creatures home in theirs  all this while i would have them put entire considence in mademoiselle whose goodnature will accommodate them in any little notes or messages they may have to manage and whose opinion in dress will be so indispensable that it will be proper to take her out with them to all milliners shops artificialflower makers and masquerade warehouses for advice if the young fellows will come to these places at the same time who can help it mademoiselle will go down to call the servants and ten to one if they are not gone to the alehouse and the coach is out of the way in spite of all her pains to find it  when they have made a strong attachment and consequences are to be apprehended it will be time for them to think of marriage but on no account with the man of their heart for that would interrupt friendship any body who can make a settlement can make a husband and that husband can make his wife her own mistress and every bodys else that she pleases mademoiselle becomes femme de chamber and when her lady is disposed for divorce chief witness upon her trial a picturesque scene is chosen for the frontispiece the heroine figures in the printshops her fame is sounded in the brothels and her career of infamy is completed  no xxii if any of my learned readers skilled in the oriental languages shall choose to turn over the thirty and three volumes of abulfagi the arabian historian they may find the following story near one hundred leaves of the papyrus have been expended in the relation but i have been at the pains of compressing it into one paper  in the beginning of the eleventh century abderama the last descendant of the samanian family who reigned over the territory of bucharia was besieged in his capital of bochara by mamood the great who afterward reduced all india to his command this mighty conqueror who may be styled the alexander of the arabian historians made twelve irruptions into india and in each expedition swept away as much wealth and made as great a devastation of the human species as nadir shah in his mamood was the son of the usurper subuctagi who expelled the father of abderama from samarcand and reduced his empire to the possession of bochara only and its dependencies  such was the formidable general who sat down with his forces before bochara and such the hereditary enmity of these inveterate opponents abderama therefore had no resource but to defend his citadel to the last extremity disabled by his age from active service he put the garrison under command of a valiant captain named abdullah this young prince was of the house of katiba the general of the caliph osman who conquered great bucharia for that victorious mahommedan abdullah was the most accomplished personage of his time of admirable qualities and matchless intrepidity in vain he challenged mamood to decide the fate of bochara by single combat he was also beloved by zarima daughter of abderama and sole heiress of his crown the beauty of this princess was celebrated through all the east more rhapsodies have been composed and chaunted in the praises of zarima than even helen gave a subject to our language cannot reach the descriptions of these florid writers the whole creation has been culled for objects to set in some comparison with zarima but as the fire of their imaginations would seem like phrensy to ours i shall not risque a fall by following them in their flights  in a furious sally made upon the army of the besiegers abdullah at the head of the bocharians had singled out the person of mamood and pushed his horse up to the breast of that on which mamood was fighting the shock was furious on both sides abdullah received the point of his opponents lance in his side and mamood was struck from his saddle to the ground by the battleaxe of abdullah the combatants rushed in to cover their fallen general and victory was snatched out of the grasp of the brave bocharian who fell back wounded amongst his companions and retreated unpursued into the town after a furious slaughter of the foe  whether mamood was discouraged by the obstinacy of the bocharians or as some historians insinuate was daunted by this attack which he had so narrowly escaped from so it was that he let the command of the siege devolve upon his general kamhi and at the head of a scouring party made incursions into the country to lay it waste with fire and sword and break up the supplies of bochara  kamhi had seen the beautiful zarima he had been in abderamas court before mamoods invasion and to see the princess was to be enamoured no sacrifice could be too great for kamhi to obtain a prize so much above all computation in the heated fancy of a lover he secretly imparted to abderama the conditions on which he would betray his trust and expose the army he commanded to inevitable destruction  if these conditions staggered the aged monarch on the score of honor so did they on the side of interest to save his crown and city was a tempting offer and the divided heart of abderama was not more agitated as a monarch for the impending danger of his throne than it was agonized as a man for the daily sufferings of his faithful people he submitted to receive kamhi into the town and to treat with him in person on the subject of his proposal abdullah from whom this was to be concealed was now recovering from his wound but incapable of service for a time it was proposed by kamhi to exchange hostage against hostage and abdullah was instructed to meet him in the depth of night with one companion on each side each general was to exchange armor on the spot and so to pass their respective sentinels and mutual secrecy was pledged between the parties  there was no difficulty in persuading the generous abdullah to this enterprise abderama giving him to understand that the meeting was to adjust the payment of a sum of money which kamhi was to receive for betraying the army he commanded before bochara the transaction was to be kept a profound secret even from zarima the unsuspecting abdullah repaired to his rendezvous at the appointed hour without taking leave of the princess and kamhi with his associate passed the city guard unquestioned in the habit of his rival he hasted without a moments loss to the palace of the old king and expounding to him the plan he had devised for securing the performance of his part of the contract nothing now remained for abderama but to engage his daughter to make a sacrifice which severe and difficult as it was he thought he might depend upon her piety and public spirit for complying with in this hope he immediately repaired to her chamber where lie found her reposing on her couch he threw himself at her feet in an agony of tears and in the most supplicating posture adjured her to arise and save her father country and herself from impending destruction roused from her sleep the beauteous zarima immediately demanded the reason of that solemn adjuration and what it was that she could do to gain those glorious ends  emulate the magnanimity of abdullah replied the father resign abdullah as that heroic youth to save this sinking city from extinction has now resigned his zarima  astonishment had now deprived her of the power of utterance and abderama proceeded without interruption to expose to her the whole purport of his treaty with kamhi and the conditions on which alone bochara might be saved and mamoods army betrayed into his hands he protested to her that abdullah had been a party to this treaty that he had left the city for ever and to convince her of it he was ready to produce kamhi in the very habit which her lover had exchanged with him for the purpose of bringing him to an interview with her and concluding the agreement  not to dwell any longer on abderamas arguments in which was i to follow my arabian author i should swell this recital to an unreasonable length it will suffice to say that the father prevailed in the original it appears as if some share in the success was owing to female pique but as the arabian authors are very subtle and refined in finding motives and in scrutinizing the human passions i should hope this suggestion may be imputed to the historian rather than to the heroine  as i choose to pass over many pages of my original in this place the reader will now suppose that the traitorous kamhi is in possession of his beautiful but reluctant victim and that abderama has already made a sacrifice more painful than that of eurystheus or agamemnon when they immolated their daughters with the first dawn of the morning kamhi repaired to the army and began to set on foot the project he had concerted with abderama when he had given out his orders for dividing and disposing the troops in such a manner as was best adapted to his design he gave the signal agreed upon with the king for the sally the whole garrison was put in motion on this occasion and abderama determined once more to show himself to his army and command in person every thing had been so prepared on the part of kamhi that the impression which the bocharians made upon the besiegers was immediate and the slaughter became universal nothing could have saved them from complete destruction but the unexpected appearance of mamood and his army in this seasonable moment for their relief as mamoods troops were entirely composed of cavalry he flew into action with amazing rapidity the fainting spirits of the soldiers revived at the sight of their victorious chief his wellknown voice rallied their broken ranks and they turned upon their pursuers with redoubled fury even the guard that had been planted upon abdullah now ran to their arms and joined the action the army of abderama no longer supported by the valor and conduct of their favorite general began to give way and retreat in disorder to the city in this instant abdullah rushed from his tent and presented himself to the eyes of the dispirited bocharians the army sent up a shout of joy the aged abderama sunk into his arms covered with blood and expiring with his wounds life just served him to exclaim  my son my son and then forsook him his attendants bore him off to his litter in the rear whilst abdullah turned the faces of his soldiers on the foe and pressed into the action where it was hottest  the conflict became terrible every inch of ground was obstinately disputed and the combatants on either side fell by whole ranks as if resolved upon maintaining the contest to the last man night at length put an end to the undecided fight and abdullah led off his surviving followers into the city without any attempt on the part of mamood to pursue him his wound in the side which was not yet healed burst open by the violence of his exertions in the action and he had received others under which he found himself sinking and which he had reason to believe were mortal in this extremity he lost not a moments time in betaking himself to his beloved zarima his strength just served him to present himself before her and to fall exhausted with his wounds at her feet  terrible interview zarima was expiring she had taken poison  the supplications of an aged father the deliverance of a suffering city the salvation of an ancient empire and above all the example as she believed of her betrothed abdullah had prevailed with this heroic princess to sacrifice herself to the detested arms of kamhi the contract had been fulfilled upon her fathers part but to survive it was more than she had engaged for and an indignity which her nature could not submit to as soon as the battle joined she put her resolution into act and swallowed the mortal draught life just sufficed to relate this dismal tale to the dying abdullah and to receive the account from his lips of the deception which abderama had put upon him the body of her dead father was now brought into the palace she cast a look upon it but was speechless fainting and in the article of death she dropped into the arms of abdullah her head fell upon his breast just as it was heaving with the last longdrawn sigh that stopped his heart for ever  no xxiii amongst the variety of human events which come under the observation of every man of common experience in life many instances must occur to his memory of the false opinions he has formed of good and evil fortune things which we lament as the most unhappy occurrences and the severest dispensations of providence frequently turn out to have been vouchsafements of a contrary sort whilst our prosperity and success which for a time delight and dazzle us with gleams of pleasure and visions of ambition turn against us in the end of life and sow the bed of death with thorns that goad us in those awful moments when the vanities of this world lose their value and the mind of man being on its last departure takes a melancholy review of time misspent and blessings misapplied  though it is part of every good mans religion to resign himself to gods will yet a few reflections upon the worldly wisdom of that duty will be of use to every one who falls under the immediate pressure of what is termed misfortune in life by calling to mind the false estimates we have frequently made of worldly good and evil we shall get hope on our side which though all friends else should fail us will be a cheerful companion by the way by a patient acquiescence under painful events for the present we shall be sure to contract a tranquillity of temper that will stand us in future stead and by keeping a fair face to the world we shall by degrees make an easy heart and find innumerable resources of consolation which a sretful spirit never can discover  i wonder why i was so uneasy under my late less of fortune said a very worthy gentleman to me the other day seeing it was not occasioned by my own misconduct for the health and content i now enjoy in the humble station i have retired to are the greatest blessings of my life and i am devoutly thankful for the event which i deplored  how often do we hear young unmarried people exclaim  what an escape have i had from such a man or such a woman  and yet perhaps they had not wisdom enough to suppose this might turn out to be the case at the time it hapdened but complained lamented and reviled as if they were suffering persecution from a cruel and tyrannic being who takes pleasure in tormenting his unoffending creatures  an extraordinary example occurs to me of this criminal excess of sensibility in the person of a frenchman named chaubert who happily lived long enough to repent of the extravagance of his misanthropy chaubert was born at bourdeaux and died there not many years ago in the franciscan convent i was in that city soon after this event and my curiosity led me to collect several particulars relative to this extraordinary humorist he inherited a good fortune from his parents and in his youth was of a benevolent disposition subject however to sudden caprices and extremes of love and hatred various causes are assigned for his misanthropy but the principal disgust which turned him furious against mankind seems to have arisen from the treachery of a friend who ran away with his mistress just when chaubert was on the point of marrying her the ingratitude of this man was certainly of a very black nature and the provocation heinous for chaubert whose passions were always in extremes had given a thousand instances of romantic generosity to this unworthy friend and reposed an entire confidence in him in the matter of his mistress he had even saved him from drowning one day at the imminent risque of his life by leaping out of his own boat into the garonne and swimming to the assistance of his when it was sinking in the middle of the stream his passion for his mistress was no less vehement so that his disappointment had every aggravation possible and operating upon a nature more than commonly susceptible reversed every principle of humanity in the heart of chaubert and made him for the greatest part of his life the declared enemy of human nature  after many years passed in foreign parts he was accidentally brought to his better senses by discovering that through these events which he had so deeply resented he had providentially escaped from miseries of the most fatal nature thereupon he returned to his own country and entering into the order of franciscans employed the remainder of his life in atoning for his past errors after the most exemplary manner on all occasions of distress father chauberts zeal presented itself to the relief and comfort of the unfortunate and sometimes he would enforce his admonitions of resignation by the lively picture he would draw of his own extravagancies in extraordinary cases he has been known to give his communicants a transcript or diary in his own handwriting of certain passages of his life in which he had minuted his thoughts at the time they occurred and which he kept by him for such extraordinary purposes this paper was put into my hands by a gentleman who had received much benefit from this good fathers conversation and instruction i had his leave for transcribing it or publishing if i thought fit this i shall now avail myself of as i think it is a very curious journal  my son whoever thou art profit by the words of experience and let the example of chaubert who was a beast without reason and is become a man by repentance teach thee wisdom in adversity and inspire thy heart with sentiments of resignation to the will of the almighty  when the treachery of people which i ought to have despised had turned my heart to marble and my blood to gall i was determined upon leaving france and seeking out some of those countries from whose famished inhabitants nature witholds her bounty and where men groan in slavery and sorrow as i passed through the villages toward the frontiers of spain and saw the peasants dancing in a ring to the pipe or carousing at their vintages indignation smote my heart and i wished that heaven would dash their cups with poison or blast the sunshine of their joys with hail and tempest  i traversed the delightful province of biscay without rest to the soles of my feet or sleep to the temples of my head nature was before my eyes dressed in her gayest attire  thou mother of fools i exclaimed why do thou trick thyself out so daintily for knaves and harlots to make a property of thee the children of thy womb are vipers in thy bosom and will sting thee mortally when thou have given them their fill at thy improvident breasts  the birds chaunted in the groves the fruit trees glistened on the mountain sides the waterfalls made music for the echoes and man went singing to his labor  give me said i the clank of fetters and the yell of galleyslaves under the lashes of the whip  and in the bitterness of my heart i cursed the earth as i trod over its prolific surface  i entered the ancient kingdom of castile and the prospect was a recreation to my sorrowvexed soul i saw the lands lie waste and fallow the vines trailed on the ground and buried their fruitage in the furrows the hand of man was idle and nature slept as in the cradle of creation the villages were thinly scattered and ruin sat upon the unroofed sheds where lazy pride laid stretched upon its straw in beggary and vermin ah this is something i cried out this scene is fit for man and i will enjoy it  i saw a yellow halfstarved form cloaked to the heels in rags his broadbrimed beaver on his head through which his staring locks crept out in squalid shreds that fell like snakes upon the shoulders of a fiend  such ever be the fate of human nature i will aggravate his misery by the insult of charity harkye castilian i exclaimed take this pisette it is coin it is silver from the mint of mexico a spaniard dug it from the mine a frenchman gives it you put by your pride and touch it  cursed be your nation the castilian replied i will starve before i will take it from your hands  starve then i answered and passed on  i climbed a barren mountain the wolves howled in the desert and the vultures screamed in flocks for prey i looked and beheld a gloomy mansion underneath my feet vast as the pride of its founder gloomy and disconsolate as his soul it was the escurial  here then the tyrant reigns said i here let him reign hard as these rocks his throne waste as these deserts be his dominion  a meagre creature passed me famine stared in his eye he cast a look about him and sprung upon a kid that was browsing in the desert he smote it dead with his staff and hastily thrust it into his wallet  ah sacrilegious villain  cried a brawny fellow and leaping on him from behind a rock seized the hungry wretch in the act he dropped upon his knees and begged for mercy  mercy cried he that seized him do you purloin the property of the church and ask for mercy take it  so saying he beat him to the earth with a blow as he was kneeling at his feet and then dragged him toward the convent of saint lawrence i could have hugged the miscreant for the deed  i held my journey through the desert and desolation followed me to the very streets of madrid the fathers of the inquisition came forth from the cells of torture the cross was elevated before them and a trembling wretch in a saffroncoloured vest painted with flames of fire was dragged to execution in an open square they kindled a fire about him and sang praises to god whilst the flames deliberately consumed their human victim he was a jew who suffered they were christians who tormented  see what the religion of god is said i to myself in the hands of man  from the gates of madrid i bent my course toward the port of lisbon as i traversed the wilderness of estremadura a robber took his aim at me from behind a cork tree and the ball grazed my hat upon my head  you have missed your aim i cried and have lost the merit of destroying a man  give me your purse said the robber  take it i replied and buy with it a friend may it serve you as it has served me  i found the city of lisbon in ruins her foundations smoaked upon the ground the dying and the dead laid in heaps terror fate in every visage and mankind was visited with the plagues of the almighty famine fire and earthquake  have they not the inquisition in this country i asked i was answered they had  and do they make all this outcry about an earthquake said i within myself let them give god thanks and be quiet  presently there came ships from england loaded with all manner of goods for the reief of the inhabitants the people took the bounty were preserved then turned and cursed their preservers for heretics  this is as it should be said i these men act up to their nature and the english are a nation of fools i will not go amongst them  after a short time behold a new city was rising on the ruins of the old one the people took the builders tools which the english had sent them and made themselves houses i overheard a fellow at his work say to his companion  before the earthquake i made my bed in the streets now i shall have a house to live in  this is too much said i their misfortunes make this people happy and i will stay no longer in their country  i descended to the banks of the tagus there was a ship whose canvass was loosed for sailing  she is an english ship says a galliego porter they are brave seamen but damned tyrants on the quarter deck  they pay well for what they have says a boatman and i am going on board her with a cargo of lemons  i threw myself into the wherry and entered the ship the mariners were occupied with their work and nobody questioned me why i was amongst them the tide wasted us into the ocean and the night became tempestuous the vessel labored in the sea and the morning brought no respite to our toil  whither are you bound said i to the master  to hell said he for nothing but the devil ever drove at such a rate  the fellows voice was thunder the sailors sung in the storm and the masters oaths were louder than the waves the third day was a dead calm and he swore louder than ever  if the winds were of this mans making thought i he would not be content with them  a favorable breeze sprung up as if it had come at his calling  i thought it was coming says he put her before the wind it blows fair for our port  but where is your port again i asked him  sir says he i can now answer your question as i should do with gods leave i am bound to bourdeaux every thing at sea goes as it pleases god  my heart sunk at the name of my native city i was freighted added he from london with a cargo of goods of all sorts for the poor sufferers by the earthquake i shall load back with wine for my owners and so help out a charitable voyage with some little profit if it please god to bless our endeavors  heyday thought i how fair weather changes this fellows note  lewis said he to a handsome youth who stood at his elbow we will now seek out this monsieur chaubert at bourdeaux and get payment of his bills on your account  show me your bills said i for i am chaubert  he produced them and i saw my own name forged to bills in favor of the villain who had so treacherously dealt with me in the affair of the woman who was to have been my wife  where is the wretch said i who drew these forgeries  the youth burst into tears  he is my father he replied and turned away  sir says the master i am not surprised to find this fellow a villain to you for i was once a trader in affluence and have been ruined by his means and reduced to what you see me but i forgive what he has done to me i can earn a maintenance and am as happy in my present hard employ nay happier than when i was rich and idle but to defraud his own son proves him an unnatural rascal and if i had him here i would hang him at the mizen yard  no xxiv chauberts narrative proceeds as follows  when the english master declared he was happier in his present hard service than in his former prosperity and that he forgave the villain who had ruined him i started with astonishment and stood out of his reach expecting every moment when his phrensy would break out i looked him steadily in the face and to my surprise saw no symptoms of madness there there was no wandering in his eyes and content of mind was impressed upon his features  are you in your senses i demanded and can you forgive the villain  from my heart answered he else how should i expect to be forgiven  his words struck me dumb my heart tugged at my bosom the blood rushed to my face he saw my situation and turned aside to give some orders to the sailors after some minutes he resumed the conversation and advancing toward me in his rough familiar manner said  it is my way mr chaubert to forgive and forget though to be sure the fellow deserves hanging for his treatment of this poor boy his son who is as good a lad as ever lived but as for father and mother  who is his mother what was her name i eagerly demanded her name had no sooner passed his lips than i felt a shock through all my frame beyond that of electricity i staggered as if with a sudden stroke and caught hold of the barricade an involuntary shriek burst from me and i cried out  that woman  oh that woman  was a devil said the master and if you knew but half the misery you have escaped you would fall down upon your knees and thank god for the blessing i have heard your story mr chaubert and when a man is in love do you see he does not like to have his mistress taken from him but some things are better lost than found and if this is all you have to complain of take my word for it you complain of the luckiest hour in your whole life he would have proceeded but i turned from him without uttering a word and shutting myself into my cabin surrendered myself to my meditations my mind was now in such a tumult that i cannot recall my thoughts much less put them into any order for relation the ship however kept her course and had now entered the mouth of the garonne i landed on the quay of bourdeaux the master accompanied me and young lewis kept charge of the ship the first object that met my view was a gibbet erected before the door of a merchants comptinghouse the convict was kneeling on a scaffold whilst a friar was receiving his last confession his face was turned toward us the englishman glanced his eye upon him and instantly cried out  look look mr chaubert the very man as i am alive it is the father of young lewis  the wretch had discovered us in the same moment and called aloud  oh chaubert chaubert let me speak to you before i die  his yell was horror to my soul i lost the power of motion and the crowd pushing toward the scaffold thrust me forward to the very edge of it the friar ordered silence and demanded of the wretch why he had called out so eagerly and what he had farther to confess father replied the convict this is the very man the very chaubert of whom i was speaking he was the best of friends to me and i repaid his kindness with the blackest treachery i seduced the woman of his affections from him i married her and because we dreaded his resentment we conspired in an attempt upon his life by poison  he now turned to me and proceeded as follows  you may remember chaubert as we were supping together on the very evening of louisas elopement  handed to you a glass of wine to drink to your approaching nuptials as you were lifting it to your lips your favorite spaniel leaped upon your arm and dashed it on the floor in a sudden transport of passion which you were ever addicted to you struck the creature with violence and laid it dead at your feet it was the saving moment of your life  the wine was poisoned inevitable death was in the draught and the animal you killed was gods instrument for preserving you reflect upon the event subdue your passions and practice resignation father i have no more to confess i die repentant let the executioner do his office    here ends the diary of chaubert  i do not mean to expose my ideas to ingenious ridicule by maintaining that every thing happens to every man for the best but i will contend that he who makes the best of it fulfils the part of a wise and good man another thing may be safely advanced namely that man is not competent to decide upon the good or evil of many events which befall him in this life and we have authority to say woe be to him that calls good evil and evil good i could wish that the story of chaubert as i have given it might make that impression upon any one of my readers as it did upon me when i received it and i could also wish that i felt myself worthy to add to it the experience of many occurrences in my own life to which time and patience have given colors very different from those they wore upon their first appearance  when men sink into despondency or break out into rage upon adversities and misfortunes it is no proof that providence lays a heavier burden upon them than they can bear because it is not clear that they have exerted all the possible resources of the soul  the passions may be humoured till they become our masters as a horse may be pampered till he gets the better of his rider but early discipline will prevent mutiny and keep the helm in the hands of reason if we put our children under restraint and correction why should we who are but children of a larger growth be refractory and complain when the father of all things lays the wholesome correction of adversity on our heads  amongst the fragments of philemon the comic poet there is part of a dialogue preserved between a master and his servant whose names are not given which falls in with the subject i am speaking of these fragments have been collected from the works of the scholiasts and grammarians and many of them have been quoted by the fathers of the christian church for the moral and pious maxims they contain i think the reader will not be displeased if i occasionally present him with some specimens from these remains of the greek comedy and for the present conclude my paper with the following translation  servant whilst you live sir drive away sorrow it is the worst company a man can keep   master whilst i live sirrah why there is no living without it   servant never tell me sir the wounds of the mind are not to be healed by the tears of the eyes if they were who would be without the medicine they would be the best familyphysic in nature and if nothing but money would buy them you could not pay too dearly for the purchase but alackaday what do they avail weep or weep not this stubborn world of ours will have its way sighing and groaning take my word for it is but labor lost   master granted for its use i will not contend nor can you as i take it dispute its necessity it is as natural for the eyes to shed tears in affliction as for a tree to drop its leaves in autumn   servant that i deny the necessity of evil i admit but not the necessity of bewailing it mark how your maxims and mine differ you meet misfortune in the way i let misfortune meet me there are too many evils in life that no mans wisdom can avoid but he is no wise man who multiplies too many by more now my philosophy teaches me that amongst all the evils you complain of there is no evil so great as your complaint itself why it drives a man out of his senses out of his health nay at last out of the world so shall it not me if misfortune will come i cannot help it but if lamentation follows it that is my fault and a fool of his own making my good master is a fool indeed   master say you so sirrah now i hold your insensibility to be of the nature of a brute my feelings i regard as the prerogative of a man thus although we differ widely in our practice each acts up to his proper character   servant if i am of the nature of a brute because i fear the gods and submit to their will the gods forgive me if it be the prerogative of a man to say i will not bear misfortunes i will not submit to the decrees of the gods let the gods answer that for themselves i am apt to think it is no great mark of courage to despair nor any sure proof of weakness to be content if a man were to die of a disappointment how the vengeance does it come to pass that any body is left alive you may if you think well of it counteract the designs of the gods and turn their intended blessings into actual misfortunes but i do not think their work will be mended by your means you may if you please resent it with a high hand if your mother or your son or your friend should take the liberty to die when you wish them to live but to me it appears a natural event which no man can keep off from his own person or that of any other you may if you think it worth your while be very miserable when this woman miscarries or that woman is brought to bed you may torment yourself because your mother has a cough or your mistress drops a tear in short you may send yourself out of the world with sorrow but i think it better to stay my time in it and be happy   no xxv i mentioned in my seventh paper that i had a card from vanessa inviting me to a feast of reason i confess i was very curious to know what the nature of this feast might be and having been since favored with a second invitation i shall take the liberty of relating what i saw and heard at that ladys assembly  the celebrated vanessa has been either a beauty or a wit all her life long and of course has a better plea for vanity than falls to most womens share her vanity also is in itself more excuseable for the pleasing colors it sometimes throws upon her character it gives the spring to charity goodnature affability it makes her splendid hospitable facetious carries her into all the circles of fine people and crowds all the fine people into here is it starts a thousand whimsical caprices that furnish employment to the arts and it has the merit of opening her doors and her purse to the sons of science in short it administers protection to all descriptions and degrees of genius from the manufacturer of a toothpick to the author of an epic poem it is a vanity that is a sure box at an authors first night and a sure card at a performers benefit it pays well for a dedication and stands for six copies upon a subscribers list vanessa in the center of her own circle sits like the statue of the athenian minerva incensed with the breath of philosophers poets painters orators and every votarist of art science or fine speaking it is in her academy young noviciates try their wit and practice panegyric no one like vanessa can break in a young lady to the poetics and teach her pegasus to carry a sidesaddle she can make a mathematician quote pindar a master in chancery write novels or a birmingham hardwareman stamp rhimes as fast as buttons  as i came rather before the modern hour of visiting i waited some time in her room before any of the company appeared several new publications on various subjects were lying on her table they were stitched in blue paper and most of them fresh from the press in some she had stuck small scraps of paper as if to mark where she had left off reading in others she had doubled down certain pages seemingly for the same purpose at last a meagre little man with a most satirical countenance was ushered in and took his seat in a corner of the room he eyed me attentively for some time through his spectacles and at last accosted me in the following words you are looking at these books sir i take for granted they are newly published i believe they are i replied i thought so says he then you may depend upon it their authors will be here by and by you may always know what company you are to expect in this house by the books upon the table it is in this way vanessa has got all her wit and learning not by reading but by making authors believe she reads their works and by thus tickling their vanity she sends so many heralds into the world to cry up her fame to the skies it is a very pretty finesse and saves a world of time for better amusements he had no sooner said this than vanessa entered the room and whilst i was making a most profound reverence i beheld something approaching to me which looked like columns and arches and porticos in the perspective of a playhouse scene as i raised my eyes and examined it a little closer i recognized the ruins of palmyra embroidered in colored silks upon vanessas petticoat it was the first visit i had ever paid and vanessa not being ready with my name i made a silent obeisance and receiving a smile in return retreated to my chair my friend said a great many smart things upon the ruins of palmyra which vanessa on her part contended to be a very proper emblem for an old woman in decay who had seen better days the wit replied that instead of palmyra it ought to have been athens and then she would have been equipped from head to foot in character vanessa smiled but maintained the propriety of her choice bidding him observe that though she carried a city upon her back that city all the world knew was planted on a desert she now addressed herself to me and in the most gracious manner asked me when i hoped to put my project into execution i answered in about two months thinking she alluded to the publication of these papers a circumstance i knew she was informed of well i protest says vanessa i envy you the undertaking and wish i could find courage enough to accompany you i assured her there was nothing in the world would make me so happy as her assistance and that i was confident it would ensure success to my undertaking there you flatter me says she for i should do nothing but look after shells and corals and the palaces of the tritons and naiads if i was to go down with you  here i began to stare most egregiously  but after all added she will your divingbell carry double this luckless divingbell was such an unexpected plunge to me that if i had been actually in it i could scarce have been more hampered so i thought it was better to remain under water and wait till the real artist came in to set the mistake to rights this however my neighbor with the spectacles would not allow of for suspecting the malentendu he began to question me how long i could stay under water and whether i could see distinctly he then took a pamphlet from the table and spreading out a large engraved plan of a divingbell desired me to inform him how i managed those pipes and conductors of air all this while he was slyly enjoying my confusion till i summoned resolution to apprise vanessa of her mistake this produced a thousand polite apologies on her part  but these wretched eyes of mine says she are for ever betraying me into blunders that is a pity indeed replied the wit for they illuminate every body else but if they betray their owner adds he it is gods revenge against murder several literati now entered the room to whom vanessa made her compliments particularly to a blind old gentleman whom she conducted to his chair with great humanity and immediately began talking to him of his discoveries and experiments on the microscope ah madam replied the minute philosopher those researches are now over something might have been done if my eyes had held out but i lost my sight just as i had discovered the generation of mites but this i can take on myself to pronounce that they are an oviparous race be content replied vanessa there is a blessing upon him who throws even a mite into the treasury of science the philosopher then proceeded to inform her that he had begun some curious dissections of the eye of a mole but that his own would not serve him to complete them if i could have proceeded in them says he i am verily persuaded i could have brought him to his eyesight by the operation of couching and now says he i am engaged in a new discovery in which i mean to employ none but persons under the like misfortune with myself  so interesting a discovery raised my curiosity as well as vanessas to enquire into it and methought even the wit in the spectacles had a fellowfeeling in the subject  it is a powder madam added the philosopher which i have prepared for destroying vermin on fruit trees and even ants in the west indies i confess to you says he it is fatal to the eyesight for i am persuaded i owe the loss of mine to it rather than to the eggs of mites or the couching of moles and accordingly i propose that this powder shall be blown through bellows of my own inventing by none but men who are stone blind it will be very easy for your gardener or overseer of your plantations to lead them up to their work and then leave them to perform it for the dust is so subtle that it is scarce possible to invent a cover for the eyes that can secure them against it i believe added he i have some of it in my pocket and if you have any flies or spiders in the room i will soon convince you of its efficacy by an experiment before your eyes vanessa eagerly assured him there was no such thing in her room and drawing her chair to a distance begged him not to trouble himself with any experiment at present  there sat an ordinary woman in a black cloak by the fire side with her feet upon the sender and her knees up who seemed employed upon a cushion or pillow which she kept concealed under her apron without once looking at the work she was upon you have read of the witch of endor says she to me observing i had fixed my eyes upon her i am a descendant of that old ladys and can raise the dead as well as she could  immediately she put aside her apron and produced a head molded in wax so strikingly like my deceased friend the father of calliope that the shock it gave me was too apparent to escape her  you knew this brave fellow i perceive says she england never owned a better officer he was my hero and every line in his face is engraved in my heart  what must it be in mine i answered and turned away to a circle of people who had collected themselves round a plain but venerable old man and were very attentive to his discourse he spoke with great energy and in most chosen language nobody yet attempted to interrupt him and his words rolled not with the shallow impetuosity of a torrent but deeply and fluently like the copious current of the nile he took up the topic of religion in his course and though palsy shook his head he looked so terrible in christian armor and dealt his strokes with so much force and judgment that infidelity in the persons of several petty skirmishers sneaked away from before him one little fellow however had wriggled his chair nearer and nearer to him and kept baying at him whilst he was speaking perpetually crying out  give me leave to observe  not to interrupt you sir  that is extremely well but in answer to what you say  all this had been going on without any attention or stop on the part of the speaker whose eyes never once lighted on the company till the little fellow growing out of all patience walked boldly up to him and catching hold of a button somewhere above the waistband of his breeches with a sudden twitch checked the movingspring of his discourse and much to my regret brought it to a full stop the philosopher looked about for the insect that annoyed him and having at last eyed him as it were askaunce demanded what it was provoked him to impatience  have i said any thing good sir that you do not comprehend  no no replied he i perfectly well comprehend every word you have been saying  do you so sir said the philosopher then i heartily ask pardon of the company for misemploying their time so egregiously  and stalked away without waiting for an answer  vanessa had now recollected or enquired my name and in a very gracious manner repeated her excuses for mistaking me for the diver  but if the old saying holds good adds she that truth lies at the bottom of a well i dare say you will not scruple to dive for it so i hope i have not given you a dishonorable occupation i was endeavoring at a reply when the wit in the spectacles came up to us and whispered vanessa in the ear that the true divingbell was in yonder corner she immediately turned that way and as she passed whispered a young lady loud enough for me to hear her  my dear i am in your third volume  the girl bowed her head and by the arcadian grace that accompanied it i took it for granted she was a novelist  i now joined a cluster of people who had crowded round an actress who sat upon a sopha leaning on her elbow in a pensive attitude and seemed to be counting the sticks of her fan whilst they were vying with each other in the most extravagant encomiums  you was adorable last night in belvidera says a pert young parson with a high toupee i sat in lady blubbers box and i can assure you she and her daughters too wept most bitterly  but then that charming mad scene by my soul it was a chef doeuvre pray madam give me leave to ask you was you really in your senses  i strove to do it as well as i could answered the actress do you intend to play comedy next season says a lady stepping up to her with great eagerness  i shall do as the manager bids me she replied i should be curious to know says an elderly lady which part madam you yourself esteem the best you play  i always endeavor to make that which i am about the best an elegant young woman of fashion now took her turn of interrogatory and with many apologies begged to be informed by her if she studied those enchanting looks and attitudes before a glass  i never study any thing but my author  then you practice them in rehearsals rejoined the questioner  i seldom rehearse at all replied the actress she has fine eyes says a tragic poet to an eminent painter what modest dignity they bear what awful penetration mark how they play in those deep sockets like diamonds in the mine whilst that commanding brow moves over them like a cloud and carries storm or sunshine as the deity within directs she is the child of nature or if you will allow me the expression nature herself for she is in all things original in pity or in terror penitent or presumptuous famished mad or dying she is her authors thought personified and if this nation which fashion now nails by the ears to the shameful pillory of an italian opera shall ever be brought back to a true relish of its native drama that woman will have the merit of their reformation this rhapsody was received with great tranquillity by the painter who coolly replied  all that is very well but where will you see finer attitudes than in an opera dance or more picturesque draperies than in a masquerade every man for his own art vanessa now came up and desiring leave to introduce a young muse to melpomene presented a girl in a white frock with a fillet of flowers twined round her hair which hung down her back in flowing curls the young muse made a low obeisance in the style of an oriental salam and with the most unembarrassed voice and countenance whilst the poor actress was covered with blushes and suffering torture from the eyes of all the room broke forth as follows  oh thou whom natures goddess calls her own pride of the stage and favorite of the town   but i can proceed no further for if the plague had been in the house i should not have ran away from it more eagerly than i did from miss and her poetry  no xxvi leontine is one of those purseproud humorists who profess to speak what they think  for why he is independent and fears no man if you complain of an affront from leontine you are sure to be told  that is his way that is so like leontine you must take him as he is  in short there are certain savages in society who seem to have a patent for their brutality and he is one  i often think i can give a good guess at the temper of the master by the servants looks in leontines family it is strongly marked i was let in the other day by a staring halfstarved fellow fresh from the country who was out of his wits for fear not knowing whether he was to say his master was at home or abroad whilst he stood gaping with the door halfopened in his hand a voice roared out from the parlour who is there upon which he slapped the streetdoor in my face and ran to his master as i was quietly walking away he followed me up the street and told me to come back for his master would see me i found leontine in a fit of the gout his wife on her knees wrapping flannel round his foot it mortified me to see how much the world is governed by the abject principle of fear for the assiduity with which this bashaw was waited upon by his wife and servants was surprising after having cursed the gout damned his servants and scolded his wife for her awkwardness in swathing his foot he began to rave about the state of the nation crying out to me every now and then  a fine pass you have brought things to at last i always told you how it would be but you would not believe me and now you are ruined bankrupt and undone to the devil i thought what it would come to with your damned american war  i told him i had nothing to do with politics and knew very little of the matter  that is true says he i understand you are writing a book and going to turn author you know i am your friend and always speak my mind therefore i must tell you you will repent of what you are about cannot you let the world alone is it in your power to make it better can the devil make it worse why i could write a book if i pleased but i scorn it nay i was fool enough to do it once from a silly principle of good will to my country and what was the consequence why after proving as plain as two and two make four that we were no longer a nation that we were broken baffled defeated and upon the eve of being a province to france  after having proved all this do you see for the good of my country what was my reward think you but to be abused vilified posted in the rascally newspapers who threw the twelfth of april in my teeth and set the peoples heads a madding contrary to all sense and reason though i had been at the pains of convincing them how foolish all such hopes were and that there was not a chance left though miracles should be wrought in their favor of any possible salvation for this devoted kingdom  as leontine is one of those pro and con reasoners who handle their own argument in their own way by question and answer and know what their opponent has to offer before he has uttered three words i always leave him a clear stage to fight out the subject by himself as he can so that he proceeded without interruption to put a number of questions to which he regularly made responses and though these were the very opposites to what i should probably have given i let them pass without contradiction till there was a stop to the torrent by the introduction of a stranger who after telling leontine his name proceeded to say he had a little necessary business to settle with him which he should take the liberty to explain in very few words this stranger was a little meagre consumptive man far advanced in years of an aspect remarkably meek and humble so that it was not without surprise i heard him begin as follows  i wait upon you sir to demand full satisfaction and atonement for an injury you have done to my character by the basest lie that ever man uttered and which if you do not disavow in as public a manner as you reported it i shall expect you will immediately answer my challenge as there is no other mode of redressing wrongs of so insidious a nature when this gentleman announced his name and description i found he was a general officer who had been upon an unsuccessful command in the course of the war and that leontine in one of his political rhapsodies had treated his character according to his custom with great scurrility this had unluckily passed in hearing of a friend of the generals who had endeavored to stop leontine in time but not being able so to do had made report to his friend of what had been said of him in his absence as he fixed his eyes upon leontine in expectation of his answer i observed his cheeks which before were of a ruddy scarlet turn to a deep purple which gradually darkened into a livid tawney fear so transformed his features that the flying soldier in le bruns battle was not a more perfect model of horror his lips which so lately thundered out vengeance and anathemas against the whole host of critics magazinemongers newswriters and reviewers with all their devils runners and retainers now quivered without the power of utterance till at last a gentle murmuring voice was heard to say  general if i have given you offense i am very sorry for it but i suspect that what i said must have been unfairly stated else  here the little gentleman immediately interrupted him by saying  this excuse affects the veracity of my friend i shall therefore take the liberty of calling him into your room which i did not choose to do in the first instance not knowing you had any body with you but if this gentleman will have the goodness to stand in place of your referee on the occasion i will bring my witness face to face who will testify to the very words you spoke this was no sooner said than done for the friend was in the passage and in the most precise terms asserted the truth of his information  and now sir resumed the general give me leave to say there is not a man in england more abhors a personal quarrel than i do but i make it my study to give no offense and both my reputation and my profession indispensibly oblige me not to put up with insult from any man there is no alternative therefore left to either of us but for you to sign this paper which i shall use as i see fit in my own vindication or turn out i am very sorry for it it is an unhappy custom but if occasions can justify it i take the present to be one  having so said he tendered the paper to leontine with as much politeness and address as if he had been delivering a petition to the commander in chief  the intimidated boaster took the paper with a trembling hand and throwing his eye over it begged to know if it might not be mitigated in some particulars  i should be very glad to oblige you says the general in what you wish but they are my words and as i generally think before i speak or write i am not in the habit of unsaying any thing i assert you must therefore sign to all or none  if it must be so it must says leontine with a sigh and took the pen  stop sir if you please interposed the general i would know of this gentleman if he has any thing to offer on your behalf why you should not sign that paper i answered that i had nothing to offer in the case upon which leontine put his name to the paper sir says the general i am perfectly satisfied and beg your pardon for the trouble i have given you i am persuaded you are not a person who can injure my character and this paper is of no further use  so saying he threw it into the fire and having made his bow to leontine and wishing me a good morning took his friend under the arm and coolly walked out of the house as i was suspicious leontines courage might return after his departure i thought it best to follow his example and taking up my hat left the mortified bashaw to his meditations well satisfied to find an example in confirmation of my opinion  that a bully at home is a coward abroad  as i walked along meditating on what had passed a doubt for the first time arose in my mind as to the practice of duelling and i began to think there might be certain advantages accruing to society which if the immorality of the action could be dispensed with might possibly balance the evils so evidently to be set against them on the one side i saw in all its horrors the untimely catastrophe of a father husband son or brother hurried out of life and made the sacrifice of a savage fashion which the world calls honor on the other part i reflected within myself what the state of manners might probably be reduced to and how much society would suffer if such overbearing insolent characters as leontine were not held in restraint by those personal considerations which owe their influence to the practice of duelling to their wives servants and dependant inferiors from whom no resentment is to be apprehended these tyrants are insupportable to society in general they are offensive as far as they dare it is not shame nor a respect to good manners in any degree nor the fear of the laws which stop them for none of these considerations affect them neither is it the unarmed hand of man that can correct them for these brutal natures are commonly endowed with brutal strength and leontine would no more have feared his puisny antagonist without a weapon than i should stand in awe of an infant if these creatures thought i were let loose upon society and we had nothing but our fists to keep them in order the proverb would be literally made good and the weakest must go to the wall but that same lucky invention of gunpowder levels the strong with the feeble and puts all who bear the character of a gentleman upon the same line of defense if blows were to be exchanged with impunity and foul language was to be endured without account we should be a nation of rabble it seems therefore as if nothing more were to be wished than for certain mitigations of this terrible resource which must ultimately depend upon the voluntary magnanimity of those who are compelled to resort to it what i mean is to express a wish that gentlemen would think it no derogation from their honor to acknowledge an error or ask pardon for an offense and as it can very rarely happen but that one party must to his own conviction be in the fault it seems to follow that all those affairs of honor that can be done away by an apology might by manly and ingenuous characters be prevented from extremities as to injuries of that deep nature which according to the infirmity of human ideas we are apt to call inexpiable i presume not to give an opinion and in the aggravating instance of a blow i have only to lament that the sufferer has to expose his person to equal danger with the offender though some unhappy instances of frivolous duels have lately occurred i cannot think that it is the vice of the times to be fond of quarrelling the manners of our young men of distinction are certainly not of that cast and if it lies with any of the present age it is with those halfmadeup gentry who force their way into halfprice plays in boots and spurs and are clamorous in the passages of the front boxes in a crowded theater i have with much concern observed this to be an increasing nuisance and have often wished those turbulent spirits to be better employed and that they had dismounted from their horses either a little sooner or not so soon but it is not by reasoning these gentlemen will be taught to correct their behavior  i would seriously recommend to my readers of all descriptions to keep a careful watch upon their tempers when they enter into argumentation and dispute let them be assured that by their management of themselves on such occasions they are to decide their characters and whether they are to pass as men of education temper and politeness or as illiterate hot and illbred blockheads will depend upon their conduct in this particular if the following short and obvious maxims were attended to i think animosities would be avoided and conversation amended  every man who enters into a dispute with another whether he starts it or only takes it up should hear with patience what his opponent in the argument has to offer in support of the opinion he advances every man who gives a controverted opinion ought to lay it down with as much conciseness temper and precision as he can an argument once confuted should never be repeated nor tortured into any other shape by sophistry and quibble no jest pun or witticism tending to turn an opponent or his reasoning into ridicule or raise a laugh at his expense ought by any means to be attempted for this is an attack upon the temper not an address to the reason of a disputant no two disputants should speak at the same time nor any man overpower another by superiority of lungs or the loudness of a laugh or the sudden burst of an exclamation it is an indispensible preliminary to all disputes that oaths are no arguments if any disputant slaps his hand upon the table let him be informed that such an action does not clinch his argument and is only pardonable in a blacksmith or a butcher if any disputant offers a wager it is plain he has nothing else to offer and there the dispute should end any gentleman who speaks above the natural key of his voice casts an imputation on his own courage for cowards are loudest when they are out of danger contradictions are no arguments nor any expressions to be made use of such as  that i deny  there you are mistaken  that is impossible  or any of the like blunt assertions which only irritate and do not elucidate the advantages of rank or fortune are no advantages in argumentation neither is an inferior to offer or a superior to extort the submission of the understanding on such occasions for every mans reason has the same pedigree it begins and ends with himself if a man disputes in a provincial dialect or trips in his grammar or being scotch or irish uses national expressions provided they convey his meaning to the understanding of his opponent it is a foolish jest to turn them into ridicule for a man can only express his ideas in such language as he is master of let the disputant who confutes another forbear from triumph forasmuch as he who increases his knowledge by conviction gains more in the contest than he who converts another to his opinion and the triumph more becomes the conquered than the conqueror let every disputant make truth the only object of his controversy and whether it be of his own finding or of any other mans bestowing let him think it worth his acceptance and entertain it accordingly no xxvii the following story is so extraordinary that if i had not had it from good authority in the country where it happened i should have considered it as the invention of some poet for the fable of a drama  a portuguese gentleman whom i shall beg leave to describe no otherwise than by the name of don juan was lately brought to trial for poisoning his halfsister by the same father after she was with child by him this gentleman had for some years before his trial led a very solitary life at his castle in the neighborhood of montremos a town on the road between lisbon and badajos the frontier garrison of spain i was shown his castle as i passed through that dismal country about a mile distant from the road in a bottom surrounded with corktrees and never saw a more melancholy habitation the circumstances which made against this gentleman were so strong and the story was in such general circulation in the neighborhood where he lived that although he laid out the greatest part of a considerable income in acts of charity no body ever entered his gates to thank him for his bounty or solicit relief except one poor father of the jeronymite convent in montremos who was his confessor and acted as his almoner at discretion  a charge of so black a nature involving the crime of incest as well as murder at length reached the ears of justice and a commission was sent to montremos to make enquiry into the case the supposed criminal made no attempt to escape but readily attended the summons of the commissioners upon the trial it came out from the confession of the prisoner as well as from the deposition of witnesses that don juan had lived from his infancy in the family of a rich merchant at lisbon who carried on a considerable trade and correspondence in the brazils don juan being allowed to take this merchants name it was generally supposed that he was his natural son and a clandestine affair of love having been carried on between him and the merchants daughter josepha who was an only child she became pregnant and a medicine being administered to her by the hands of don juan she died in a few hours after with all the symptoms of a person who had taken poison the mother of the young lady survived her but a few days and the father threw himself into a convent of mendicants making over by deed of gift the whole of his property to the supposed murderer  in this account there seemed a strange obscurity of facts for some made strongly to the crimination of don juan and the lastmentioned circumstance was of so contradictory a nature as to throw the whole into perplexity and therefore to compel the prisoner to a further elucidation of the case it was thought proper to interrogate him by torture  whilst this was preparing don juan without betraying the least alarm upon what was going forward told his judges that it would save them and himself some trouble if they would receive his confession upon certain points to which he should truly speak but beyond which all the tortures in the world could not force one syllable he said that he was not the son as it was supposed of the merchant with whom he lived nor allied to the deceased josepha any otherwise than by the tenderest ties of mutual affection and a promise of marriage which however he acknowledged had not been solemnized that he was the son of a gentleman of considerable fortune in the brazils who left him an infant to the care of the merchant in question that the merchant for reasons best known to himself chose to call him by his own name and this being done in his infancy he was taught to believe that he was an orphan youth the son of a distant relation of the person who adopted him he begged his judges therefore to observe that he never understood josepha to be his sister that as to her being with child by him he acknowledged it and prayed god forgiveness for an offense which it had been his intention to repair by marrying her that with respect to the medicine he certainly did give it to her with his own hands for that she was sick in consequence of her pregnancy and being afraid of creating alarm or suspicion in her parents had required him to order certain drugs from an apothecary as if for himself which he accordingly did and he verily believed they were faithfully mixed inasmuch as he stood by the man whilst he prepared the medicine and saw every ingredient separately put in  the judges thereupon asked him if he would take it on his conscience to say that the lady did not die by poison don juan bursting into tears for the first time answered to his eternal sorrow he knew that she did die by poison  was that poison contained in the medicine she took  it was  did he impute the crime of mixing the poison in the medicine to the apothecary or did he take it on himself  neither the apothecary nor himself was guilty  did the lady from a principle of shame he was then asked commit the act of suicide and infuse the poison without his knowledge  he started into horror at the question and took god to witness that she was innocent of the deed  the judges seemed now confounded and for a time abstained from any further interrogatories debating the matter amongst themselves by whispers when one of them observed to the prisoner that according to his confession he had said she did die by poison and yet by the answers he had now given it should seem as if he meant to acquit every person on whom suspicion could possibly rest there was however one interrogatory left which unnatural as it was he would put to him for forms sake only before they proceeded to greater extremities and that question involved the father or mother of the lady  did he mean to impute the horrid intention of murdering their child to the parents  no replied the prisoner in a firm tone of voice i am certain no such intention ever entered the hearts of the unhappy parents and i should be the worst of sinners if i imputed it to them  the judges upon this declared with one voice that he was trifling with the court and gave orders for the rack they would however for the last time demand of him if he knew who it was that did poison josepha to which he answered without hesitation that he did know but that no tortures should force him to declare it as to life he was weary of it and they might dispose of it as they saw fit he could not die in greater tortures than he had lived  they now took this peremptory recusant and stripping him of his upper garments laid him on the rack a surgeon was called in who kept his fingers on his pulse and the executioners were directed to begin their tortures they had given him one severe stretch by ligatures fixed to his extremities and passed over an axle which was turned by a windlass the strain upon his muscles and joints by the action of this infernal engine was dreadful and nature spoke her sufferings by a horrid crash in every limb the sweat started in large drops upon his face and bosom yet the man was firm amidst the agonies of the machine not a groan escaped and the fiend who was superintendant of the hellish work declared they might increase his tortures upon the next tug for that his pulse had not varied a stroke nor abated of its strength in the smallest degree  the tormentors had now begun a second operation with more violence than the former which their devilish ingenuity had contrived to vary so as to extort acuter pains from the application of the engine to parts that had not yet had their full share of the first agony when suddenly a monk rushed into the chamber and called out to th judges to desist from torturing that innocent man and take the confession of the murderer from his own lips upon a signal from the judges the executioners let go the engine at once and the joints snapped audibly into their sockets with the elasticity of a bow nature sunk under the revulsion and don juan fainted on the rack the monk immediately with a loud voice exclaimed  inhuman wretches delegates of hell and agents of the devil make ready your engine for the guilty and take off your bloody hands from the innocent for behold and so saying he threw back his cowl behold the father and the murderer of josepha    the whole assembly started with astonishment the judges stood aghast and even the demons of torture rolled their eye balls on the monk with horror and dismay  if you are willing says he to the judges to receive my confession whilst your tormentors are preparing their rack for the vilest criminal ever stretched upon it hear me if not set your engine to work without further enquiry and glut your appetites with human agonies which once in your lives you may now inflict with justice  proceed said the senior judge  that guiltless sufferer who now lies insensible before my eyes said the monk is the son of an excellent father who was once my dearest friend he was confided to my charge being then an infant and my friend followed his fortunes to our settlements in the brazils he resided there twenty years without visiting portugal once in the time he remitted to me many sums of money on his sons account at this time a hellish thought arose in my mind which the distress of my affairs and a passion for extravagance inspired of converting the property of my charge to my own account i imparted these suggestions to my unhappy wife who is now at her account let me do her justice to confess she withstood them firmly for a time still fortune frowned upon me and i was sinking in my credit every hour ruin stared me in the face and nothing stood between me and immediate disgrace but this infamous expedient  at last persuasion menaces and the impending pressure of necessity conquered her virtue and she acceded to the fraud we agreed to adopt the infant as the orphan son of a distant relation of our own name i maintained a correspondence with his father by letters pretending to be written by the son and i supported my family in a splendid extravagance by the assignments i received from the brazils at length the father of don juan died and by will bequeathed his fortune to me in failure of his son and his heirs i had already advanced so far in guilt that the temptation of this contingency met no resistance in my mind and i determined upon removing this bar to my ambition and proposed to my wife to secure the prize that fortune had hung within our reach by the assassination of the heir she revolted from the idea with horror and for some time her thoughts remained in so disturbed a state that i did not think it prudent to renew the attack after some time the agent of the deceased arrived in lisbon from the brazils and as he was privy to my correspondence it became necessary for me to discover to don juan who he was and also what fortune he was entitled to in this crisis threatened with shame and detection on one hand and tempted by avarice pride and the devil on the other i won over my reluctant wife to a participation of my crime and we mixed that dose with poison which we believed was intended for don juan but which in fact was destined for our only child she took it heaven discharged its vengeance on our heads and we saw our daughter expire in agonies before our eyes with the bitter aggravation of a double murder for the child was alive within her are there words in language to express our lamentations are there tortures in the reach of even your invention to compare with those we felt wonderful were the struggles of nature in the heart of our expiring child she bewailed us she consoled nay she even forgave us to don juan we made immdiate confession of our guilt and conjured him to inflict that punishment upon us which justice demanded and our crimes deserved it was in this dreadful moment that our daughter with her last breath by the most solemn adjurations exacted and obtained a promise from don juan not to expose her parents to a public execution by disclosing what had passed alas alas we see too plainly how he kept his word behold he dies a martyr to honour your infernal tortures have destroyed him    no sooner had the monk pronounced these words in a loud and furious tone than the wretched don juan drew a sigh a second would have followed but heaven no longer could tolerate the agonies of innocence and stopped his heart for ever  the monk had fixed his eyes upon him ghastly with terror and as he stretched out his mangled limbs at lifes last gasp  accursed monsters he exclaimed may god requite his murder on your souls at the great day of judgment his blood be on your heads ye ministers of darkness for me if heavenly vengeance is not yet appeased by my contrition in the midst of flames my aggrieved soul will find some consolation in the thought that you partake its torments  having uttered this in a voice scarce human he plunged a knife to his heart and whilst his blood spouted on the pavement dropped dead upon the body of don juan and expired without a groan  no xxviii quid dignum tanto feret hic promissor hiatu i think it much to be lamented that our english newspapers have such an extensive circulation through europe unless proper means could be taken to restrain their excessive licentiousness as few foreigners will believe any government so void of resource in this particular they can no otherwise account for our not correcting these abuses of the press but because we want the will and not the power amongst the causes that have lately operated to increase their circulation and success i hope for the honor of human nature their licentiousness is not one and yet it appears as if their encouragement had kept pace with their malignance if i had not experienced the bad effects they have upon the minds of people in other countries i should not have thought such publications capable of such mischief though the conductors of them seem careless about consequences i will not believe it was in their minds to do a deliberate injury to their country but as they are not disposed to put a bridle on themselves it were to be wished some prudent hand would do the office for them though i see the difficulty of finding such a curb as shall not gall the mouth of freedom  i am not at present disposed to be any longer serious on this subject and therefore waving all the weighter matters of my charge i shall take notice only of one ridiculous circumstance in which they abound vulgarly called puffing  i have been turning over some papers to find out the chief professors of this art which i believe is now carried to its highest state of improvement truth compels me to say that with regret i have discovered several amongst them who ought to have understood themselves better but whilst there is hope they will amend i am contented they should escape at least i shall pass them over in silence regarding them for the present as persons surprised into bad company and chargeable with indiscretion rather than depravity  our advertising quacks or empirics are an ancient and numerous class of puffers a collision of rival interests occasions these gentlemen to run foul of each other in their general undertakings and betrays their natural modesty into a warmer style of coloring their own merits than the liberal study of physic and the publicspirited principle on which they pretend to act would otherwise warrant if the candid reader can find an excuse for them in their zeal and anxiety to recommend the blessings which they offer to mankind i will not impede the plea a foolish partiality some people still have for physicians regularly bred and a squeamish unwillingness to repair to backdoors and blind alleys for relief oblige them to use strong words to combat strong prejudices but though they are at some pains to convince us that our bills of natural deaths might be all comprised under the single article of old age there is yet here and there an obstinate man who will die felo de se before the age of threescore years and ten  whilst the sages are puffing off our distempers in one page the auctioneers are puffing off our property in another if this island of ours is to be credited for their description of it it must pass for a terrestrial paradise it makes an english ear tingle to hear of the boundless variety of lawns groves and parks lakes rivers and rivulets decorated farms and fruitful gardens superb and matchless collections of pictures jewels plate furniture and equipapes townhouses and countryhouses hothouses and icehouses observatories and conservatories offices attached and detached with all the numerous etceteras that glitter down the columns of our public prints numerous as these are it is less a matter of surprise with me where purchasers are found than why any one whose necessities are not his reason will be a vender of such enchanting possessions though a mans caprice may be tired of a beautiful object long enjoyed yet when he sees an old acquaintance dressed out in new colors and glowing in the flowery description of these luxuriant writers i should expect that his affection would revive and that he would recall the cruel sentence of alienation pliny never so described his villa as these puffers will set forth the castoff mansion of a weary owner put a vicious lame and stumbling horse into their hands and he comes out safe and sound the next morning and is fit to carry the first lady in the land weed your collections of their copies and counterfeits by the help of a persuasive tongue quick eye and energetic hammer they are knocked down for originals and antiques and the happy buyer bears them off delighted with his bargain what is the harp of an orpheus compared to the hammer of an auctioneer  i must in the next place request the readers attention to the polishing puffers a title by which i would be understood to speak of those venerable teachers and instructors who are endowed with the happy faculty of instilling arts and sciences into their disciples like fixed air into a vapid menstruum these are the beatified spirits whom virgil places in his poetical elysium foolish men amongst the greeks such as socrates plato and others trained their pupils step by step in knowledge and made a bugbear of instruction pythagoras in particular kept his scholars five years in probationary silence as if wisdom was not to be learned without labor our modern polishers puff it into us in a morning the polish is laid on at a stroke just as boys turn a brass buckle into a silver one with a little quicksilver and brickdust the polisht buckle indeed soon repents of its transmutation but it is to be hoped the allusion does not hold through and that the polisht mind or body does not relapse as soon to its primitive rusticity strange that any body will be a clown when the graces invite us to their private hops with handbills and advertisements why do not the whole court of aldermen dance at my lord mayors ball instead of standing with their hands in their pockets when grown gentlemen let them grow to what size they may are taught to walk a minuet gracefully in three lectures amazing art only to be equalled by the obstinacy that resists it how are the times degenerated orpheus fiddles and the brutes will not dance go to the courts of law listen to the bellowing of the bar mount the gallery of the senate observe how this here and that there orator breaks poor priscians head for the good of his country enter our theaters  does that gentleman speak to a ghost as a ghost ought to be spoken to walk into a church if you have any feeling for the sacred sublimity of our service you will never walk into another where it is so mangled every one of these parricides might be taught not to murder his mother tongue without mercy if he would but believe an advertisement and betake himself to the polisher education at our public schools and universities is traveling in a wagon for expedition when there is a bridle road will take you by a short cut to parnassus and the polisher has got the key of it he has elocution for all customers lawyers players parsons or senators readymade talents for all professions the bar the stage the pulpit or the parliament  there is another class of puffers who speak strongly to the passions and use many curious devices to allure the senses fitting out their lotteryoffices like fowlers who catch birds by night with lookingglasses and candles to entice us to their snare some of them hang out the goddess of goodfortune in person with moneybags in her hands a tempting emblem others recommmend themselves under the auspices of some lucky name confounding our heads with cabalistical numbers unintelligible calculations and mysterious predictions whose absurdity is their recommendation and whose obscurity makes the temptation irresistible omnia enim stolidi magis admirantur amantque inversis quae sub verbis latitantia cernunt   essences cosmetics and a hundred articles of pretended invention for the frivolous adorning of our persons engross a considerable share of our public papers the puffs from this quarter are replete with all the gums and odours of arabia the chemists of laputa were not more subtle extractors of sunbeams than these artists who can fetch powder of pearls out of rotten bones and mercury odor of roses from a turnip and the breath of zephyrs out of a cabbagestalk they can furnish your dressing room with the toilette of juno bring you bloom from the cheeks of hebe and a nosegay from the bosom of flora these puffers never fail to tell you after a court birthday that their washes powders and odours were the favorites of the drawing room and that the reigning beauties of the assembly bought their charms at their counters  after these follow a rabble of rareeshewmen with mermaids mantygers ourangoutangs and every monster and abortion in creation columns of giants and lightinfantry companies of dwarfs conjurers ropedancers and posturemasters toothdrawers oculists and chiropodists every one puffs himself off to the public in a style as proud as ancient pistols every fellow who can twirl upon his toe or ride a gallop on his head pastes himself up in effigy on our public offices and churches and takes all the courts in europe to witness to the fame of his performances if a rascal can show a louse through a microscope he expects all the heads in england to itch till they behold it if a son of the gallows can slide down a rope from the top of a steeple he puffs off his flight in pindarics that would make a moderate mans head giddy to read nay we have seen a gamblinghouse and a brothel thrown open to the town and public lectures in obscenity audaciously advertised in a christian city which would not have been tolerated in sodom or gomorrah  i cannot dismiss this subject without hinting to the proprietors of our royal theaters that this expedient of puffing is pardonable only in a troop of strollers or the master of a puppetshew whilst the muses keep possession of our theater and genius treads the stage every friend to the national drama will condemn the practice and hold them inexcusable who are responsible for it if they do not discontinue it it is hardly possible that any cause can be profited by puffing if any can it must be a contemptible one the interests of literature are amongst the last that can expect advantage from it or that should condescend to so mean a resource instead of attracting curiosity it creates disgust instead of answering the temporary object of profit it sinks the permanent fund of reputation as to the impolicy of the measure many reasons may be given but these i shall forbear to mention lest whilst i am stating dangers i should appear to suggest them in conclusion i have no doubt but the good sense of the proprietors will determine on a reform for i am persuaded they cannot be profited by houses of their own filling nor any author flattered by applauses of his own bestowing  no xxix society in despotic governments is narrowed according to the degree of rigor which the ruling tyrant exercises over his subjects in some countries it is in a manner annihilated as despotism relaxes toward limited monarchy society is dilated in the same proportion if we consider freedom of condition in no other light than as it affects society a monarchy limited by law like this of ours is perhaps the freest constitution upon earth because was it to diverge from the center on which it now rests either toward despotism on one hand or democracy on the other the restraints upon social freedom would operate in the same degree though not in the same mode for whether that restraint is produced by the awe of a court or the promiscuous licentiousness of a rabble the barrier is in either case broken down and whether it lets the cobbler or the kings messenger into our company the tyranny is insupportable and society is enslaved  when an englishman is admitted into what are called the best circles in paris he generally finds something captivating in them on a first acquaintance for without speaking of their internal recommendations it is apt to flatter a mans vanity to find himself in an exclusive party and to surmount those difficulties which others cannot as soon as he has had time to examine the component parts of this circle into which he has so happily stepped he readily discovers that it is a circle for he goes round and round without one excursion the whole party follows the same stated revolution their minds and bodies keep the same orbit their opinions rise and set with the regularity of planets and for what is passing without their sphere they know nothing of it in this junto it rarely happens but some predominant spirit takes the lead and if he is ambitious of making a masterstroke indeed he may go the length to declare that he has the honor to profess himself an atheist the creed of this leading spirit is the creed of the junto there is no fear of controversy investigation does not reach them and that liberality of mind which a collision of ideas only can produce does not belong to them you must fall in with their sentiments or keep out of their society and hence arises that overruling selfopinion so peculiar to the french that assumed superiority so conspicuous in their manners which destroys the very essence of that politeness which they boast to excel in  politeness is nothing more than an elegant and concealed species of flattery tending to put the person to whom it is addressed in good humor and respect with himself but if there is a parade and display affected in the exertion of it if a man seems to say  look how condescending and gracious i am  whilst he has only the common offices of civility to perform such politeness seems founded in mistake and calculated to recommend the wrong person and this mistake i have observed frequently to occur in french manners  the national character of the spaniards is very different from that of the french and the habits of life in madrid as opposite as may be from those which obtain at paris the spaniards have been a great and free people and though that grandeur and that freedom are no more their traces are yet to be seen amongst the castilians in particular the common people have not yet contracted that obsequiousness and submission which the rigor of their government if no revolution occurs to redress it must in time reduce them to the condition which this gallant nation is now found in between the despotism of the throne and the terrors of the inquisition cannot be aggravated by description body and mind are held in such complete slavery by these two gloomy powers that men are not willing to expose their persons for the sake of their opinions and society is of course exceedingly circumscribed to trifle away time seems all they aspire to conversation turns upon few topics and they are such as will not carry a dispute neither glowing with the zeal of party nor the cordial interchange of mutual confidence day after day rolls in the same languid round through life their seminaries of education especially since the expulsion of the jesuits are grievously in decline learning is extinct their faculties are whelmed in superstition and ignorance covers them with a cloud of darkness through which the brightest parts cannot find their way  if this country saw its own interests in their true light it would conciliate the affections of the spanish nation who are naturally disposed toward england the hostile policy of maintaining a haughty fortress on the extremity of their coast which is no longer valuable than whilst they continue to attack it has driven them into a compact with france odious to all true spaniards and which this country has the obvious means of dissolving it is by an alliance with england that spain will recover her pristine greatness france is plunging her into provincial dependency there is still virtue in the spanish nation honesty simplicity and sobriety are still characteristics of the castilian he is brave patient unrepining no soldier lives harder sleeps less or marches longer treat him like a gentleman and you may work him like a mule his word is a passport in affairs of honor and a bond in matters of property that dignity of nature which in the highest orders of the state is miserably debased still keeps its vigor in the bulk of the people and will assuredly break out into some sudden and general convulsion for their deliverance if there are virtue and good sense in the administration of this country we shall seize the opportunity yet open to us  it now remains that i should speak of england and when i turn my thoughts to my native island and consider it with the impartiality of a citizen of the world i discern in it all advantages in perfection which man in a social state can enjoy a constitution of government sufficiently monarchical to preserve order and decorum in society and popular enough to secure freedom a climate so happily tempered that the human genius is neither exhausted by heat nor cramped and made torpid by cold a land abounding in all manner of productions that can encourage industry invite exercise and promote health a lot of earth so singularly located as marks it out by providence to be the emporium of plenty and the asylum of peace a religion whose establishment leaves all men free neither endangering their persons nor enslaving their minds a system of enlightened education so general and a vein of genius so characteristical that under the banners of a free press must secure to the nation a standing body of learned men to spread its language to the ends of the world and its fame to all posterity  what is it then which interrupts the enjoyments of social life and disturbs the harmony of its inhabitants why do foreigners complain that time hangs heavy on their hands in england that private houses are shut against them and that were it not for the resource of public places they would find themselves in a solitude or more properly speaking solitary in a crowd how comes it to pass that country gentlemen who occasionally visit town see themselves neglected and forgotten by those very people who have been welcomed to their houses and regaled with their hospitality and men of talents and character formed to grace and delight our convivial hours are left to pace the park and streets of london by themselves as if they were the exiles from society  the fact is trade occupies one end of the town and politics engross the other as for foreigners of distinction who ought in good policy to be considered as the guests of the state after they have gone through the dull ceremonial of a drawing room the court takes no further concern about them the crown has no officer charged with their reception provides no table within or without the palace for their entertainment parliamentary or official avocations are a standing plea for every state minister in his turn to neglect them the winter climate and coast of england is so deterring to natives of more temperate latitudes that they commonly pay their visits to the capital in the summer when it is deserted so that after billeting themselves in some empty hotel amidst the fumes of paint and noise of repairs they wear out a few tedious days and then take flight as if they had escaped from a prison when parliament is sitting and the town is full a man who does not interest himself in the politics and party of the day will find the capital an unsocial place that degree of freedom which in other respects is the life of society now becomes its mortal foe the zeal and even fury with which people abet their party and the latitude they give themselves in opinion and discourse extinguish every voice that would speak peace and pleasure to the board and turn good fellowship into loud contention and a strife of tongues  the right assumed by our newspapers of publishing what they are pleased to call parliamentary debates i must regard as one of the greatest evils of the time replete with foreign and domestic mischief our orators speak pamphlets and the senate is turned into a theater the late hours of parliament which to a degree are become fashionable are in effect destructive to society i cannot dispense with observing collaterally on this occasion that professional men in england consort more exclusively amongst themselves and communicate less generally than in other countries which gives their conversation however informing an air of pedantry contracted by long habits great ardour for their profession and deep learning in it  as for slander which amongst other evils owes much of its propagation to the same vehicle of the daily press it is the poison of society depresses virtuous ambition damps the early shoots of genius puts the innocent to pain and drives the guilty to desperation it infuses suspicion into the best natures and loosens the cement of the strongest friendships very many affect to despise it few are so highminded as not to feel it though common slanderers seldom have it in their power to hurt established reputations yet they can always contrive to spoil company and put honest men to the trouble of turning them out of it  it is a common saying that authors are more spiteful to each other and more irritable under an attack than other men i do not believe the observation is well founded every sensible man knows that his fame especially of the literary kind before it can pass current in the world pays a duty on entrance like some sort of merchandise ad valorem he knows that there are always some who live upon the plunder of condemned reputations watching the tides of popular savor in hopes of making seizures to their own account  habent venenum pro victu immo pro deliciis  the little injury such men do to letters chiefly consists in the stupidity of their own productions they may to a certain degree check a mans living fame but if he writes to posterity he is out of their reach because he appeals to a court where they can never appear against him  when we give our praise to any mans character or performances let us give it absolutely and without comparison for it is justly remarked by foreigners that we seldom commend positively this remark bears both against our goodnature and our good sense but let no man by this or any other declamation against slander be awed into that timid prudence which affecting the name of candor dares not to condemn and of course is not entitled to applaud truth and justice have their claims upon us and our testimony against vice folly and hypocrisy is due to society manly resentment against mischievous characters cleanly ridicule of vanity and impertinence and fair criticism of what is under public review are the prerogatives of a free spirit they peculiarly belong to englishmen and he betrays a right constitutionally inherent in him who from mean and personal motives forbears to exercise it  when i have said this i think it right to add that i cannot state a case in which a man can be justified in treating anothers name with freedom and concealing his own  no xxx et quando uberior vitiorum copia quando major avaritiae patuit sinus alea quando hos animos neque enim loculis comitantibus itur ad casum tabulae posita sed luditur arca juvenal sat   the passage which i have selected for the motto of this paper will show that i intend to devote it to the consideration of the vice of gaming and i forbore to state it in my preceding essay amongst the causes that affect society in this country because i regarded it as an evil too enormous to be brought within the brief enumeration therein contained resolving to treat it with that particular respect and attention which its high station and dignity in mischief have a claim to  though i have no hesitation at beginning the attack i beg leave to premise that i am totally without hope of carrying it i may say to my antagonists in the words though not altogether in the sense that the angel gabriel does to his  satan i know thy strength and thou know mine what avails my hurling a feeble essay at the heads of this hydra when the immortal drama of the gamester lies trodden under his feet  conscious that i do not possess the strength i shall not assume the importance of a champion and as i am not of dignity enough to be angry i shall keep my temper and my distance too skirmishing like those insignificant gentry who play the part of teazers in the spanish bullfights sticking arrows in his crest to provoke him to bellow whilst bolder combatants engage him at the point of his horns  it is well for gamesters that they are so numerous as to make a society of themselves for it would be a strange abuse of terms to rank them amongst society at large whose profession it is to prey upon all who compose it strictly speaking it will bear a doubt if a gamester has any other title to be called a man except under the distinction of hobbes and upon claim to the charter of homo homini lupus  as a human wolf i grant he has a right to his wolfiso prerogatives he who so far surprises my reason or debauches my principle as to make me a party in my own destruction is a worse enemy than he who robs me of my property by force and violence because he sinks me in my own opinion and if there was virtue in mankind sufficient for their own defense honest men would expel gamesters as outlaws from society and good citizens drive them from the state as the destroyers of human happiness wretches who make the parent childless and the wife a widow  but what avail a parcel of statutes against gaming when they who make them conspire together for the infraction of them why declare gamingdebts void in law when that silly principle so falsely called honor at once the idol and the idiot of the world takes all those debts upon itself and calls them debts of honor it is not amongst things practicable to put gaming down by statute if the face of society was set steadily against the vice if parents were agreed to spurn at the alliance of a gamester however ennobled if our seminaries of education would enforce their discipline against early habits of play if the crown as the fountain of honor and the virtuous part of the fair sex as the dispensers of happiness would reprobate all men addicted to this desperate passion something might perhaps be done if tradesmen would consult their own interest and give no credit to gamesters if the infamous gang of moneylenders could be absolutely extinguished and the people at large instead of rising against a loyal fellowsubject because he worships god according to the religion of his ancestors at a catholic altar would exercise their resentment against those illegal places of resort where desperadoes meet for nightly pillage this contagious evil might possibly be checked but when it is only to be hoped that a combination of remedies might stem the disease how can we expect a recovery when no one of them all is administered  though domestic misery must follow an alliance with a gamester matches of this sort are made every day a parent who consents so to sacrifice his child must either place his hope in her reforming her husband or else he must have made up his mind to set consequences at defiance a very foolish hope or a very fatal principle there can be no domestic comfort in the arms of a gamester no conjugal asylum in his heart weak and ignorant young women may be duped into such connections vain and selfconceited ones may adventure with their eyes open and trust to their attractions for security against misfortune but let them be assured there is not a page in the worlds history that will furnish them with an example to palliate their presumption eager to snatch the present pleasures of a voluptuous prospect they care little for the ruin which futurity keeps out of sight  with the clearest conviction in my mind of the general advantages of public education i must acknowledge a suspicion that due attention is not paid in our great seminaries of education to restrain this fatal passion in its first approaches i fear there are some evidences of a guilty negligence now in operation spreading poison as they flow and carrying with them in their course all the charms of eloquence the flow of wit and fascinating spell of science sanctified by fashion gaminghouses which outpeer the royal palace rise around it in defiance trophies and monuments of the triumphs of dissipation the wife whose husband enters those doors and the parent who owns a son within them must either eradicate affection and nature from their hearts or take leave of happiness for ever woe be to the nation whose police cannot or dare not correct such an evil it is foolish to lament the amputation of a limb when the mortality is in our vitals  i shall not take upon myself to lay down rules for kings or affect to pronounce what a sovereign can or cannot do to discountenance gaming in this kingdom but i will venture to say that something more is requisite than mere example it was in the decline of rome when the provinces were falling off from her empire whilst a virtuous but unfortunate prince possessed the throne that the greatest part of africa was in revolt the general who commanded the roman legions was a soldier of approved courage in the field but of mean talents and dissolute manners this man in the most imminent crisis for the interests of rome suffered and encouraged such a spirit of gaming to obtain amongst his officers in their military quarters that the finest army in the world entirely lost their discipline and remained inactive whilst a few levies of raw insurgents wrested from the roman arms the richest provinces of the empire history records nothing further of this mans fate or fortune but leaves us to conclude that the reproaches of his own conscience and the execrations of posterity were all the punishment he met with the empire was rent by faction and his party rescued him from the disgrace he merited  the last resource in all desperate cases which the law cannot or will not reach lies with the people at large it is not without reason i state it as the last because their method of curing disorders is like the violent medicines of empiries never to be applied to but in absolute extremity if the people were like shakespeares julius caesar never to do wrong but with just cause i should not so much dread the operation of their remedies i shall therefore venture no further than to express an humble wish that when it shall be their high and mighty pleasure to proceed again to the pulling down and burning of houses those houses may not be the repositories of science but the receptacles of gamesters  when a man of fortune turns gamester the act is so devoid of reason that we are at a loss to find a motive for it but when one of desperate circumstances takes to the trade it only proves that he determines against an honest course of life for a maintenance and having his choice to make between robbery and gaming prefers that mode of depredation which exposes him to least danger and has a cowards plea for his vocation such an one may say with ancient pistol  i will live by nym and nym shall live by me and friendship shall combine and brotherhood is not this just    in the justice of his league i do not join with ancient pistol but i am ready to allow there is some degree of common sense in this class of the brotherhood of which common sense i cannot trace a shadow amongst the others a preference therefore in point of understanding is clearly due to the vagabonds and desperadoes as to the man who for the silly chance of winning what he does not want risques every thing he ought to value his defense is in his folly and if we rob him of that we probably take from him the only harmless quality he is possessed of if however such an instance shall occur and the demon of gaming shall enter the same breast where honor courage wit wisdom reside such a mind is like a motley suit of cards where kings queens and knaves are packed together and make up the game with temporary goodfellowship but it is a hundred to one but the knave will beat them all out of doors in the end  as there are separate gangs of gamesters so there are different modes of gaming some set their property upon games of simple chance some depend upon skill others upon fraud  the gamesters of the first description run upon luck a silly crew of fortunes fools this kind of play is only fit for them whose circumstances cannot be made worse by losing otherwise there is no proportion between the good and the evil of the chance for the good of doubling a mans property bears no comparison with the evil of losing the whole in the one case he only gains superfluities in the other he loses necessaries and he who stakes what life wants against that which life wants not makes a foolish bet to say no worse of it games of chance are traps to catch schoolboy novices and gaping countrysquires who begin with a guinea and end with a mortgage whilst the old stagers in the game keeping their passions in check watch the ebb and flow of fortune till the booby they are pillaging sees his acres melt at every cast  in games of skill depending upon practice rule and calculation the accomplished professor has advantages which may bid defiance to fortune and the extreme of art approaches so closely to the beginning of fraud that they are apt to run one into the other in these engagements selfconceit in one party and dissimulation in the other are sure to produce ruin and the sufferer has something more than chance to arraign when he reviews the wreck of his fortune and the distresses of his family  the drama of a gamester commonly has selfmurder for its catastrophe and authors who write to the passions are apt to dwell upon this scene with partial attention as the striking moral of the piece i confess it is a moral that does not strike me for as this action whenever it happens devolves to the share of the losing not of the winning gamester i cannot discover any particular edification nor feel any extraordinary pathos in a mans falling by his own hand when he is no longer in a capacity of doing or suffering further injury in society i look upon every man as a suicide from the moment he takes the dicebox desperately in hand and all that follows in his career from that fatal time is only sharpening the dagger before he strikes it to his heart  my proper concern in this short essay is to show that gaming is the chief obstructing cause that affects the state of society in this nation and i am sensible i need not have employed so many words to convince my reader that gamesters are very dull and very dangerous companions when blockheads rattle the dicebox when fellows of vulgar and base minds sit up whole nights contemplating the turn of a card their stupid occupation is in character but whenever a cultivated understanding stoops to the tyranny of so vile a passion the friend of mankind sees the injury to society with that sort of aggravation as would attend the taking of his purse on the highway if upon seizure of the felon he was unexpectedly to discover the person of a judge  end of the first volume
