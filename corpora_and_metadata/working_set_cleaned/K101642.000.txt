eye the bard who thus employs his useful pen imprints his drama on the hearts of men commands respect from age applause from youth and makes the stage assist the cause of truth yet has an author many an anxious fear as his probationary night draws near when to his friends the manuscript is read each social critic nods the approving head most yield him flattery  some with jaundicd eye glance at a fault and at a beauty sigh but these are few  true genius still delights to gaze with rapture at the muses slights and scorns to triumph at a brothers fall when fames wide dome is large enough for all

expect  not being able to settle his affairs immediately on the death of his father he sent her before him unwilling to detain her from her mother   lady jem why is the mother in england   leon yes

friends will worship you for the introduction think what will be the magnificence of their house the splendor of their equipage the brilliancy of their entertainments such suppers as theirs will be the fashionable world would scramble for a seat at even if they were given by a personage from a hotter place than bengal   old vis leonard says very truly we shall get credit by showing such gold pheasants to our friends   leon certainly for all will be charmed with the splendor of their plumage  even those who are so little fashionable as not to attempt plucking the feathers   old vis well we

well son pursue your own inclinations my affection for you will always make me yield to your wishes   leon then this glorious fortune may be mine invite them to your house the mother having long experienced a constrained seclusion from society will doubtless be gratified with attentions from a woman of your rank  the daughter is young  i dont despair of success with her and the preference the

often is the time that i have danced her otop of it well that is neither here nor there when her father died  ah i shall never forget it  he has not left a better man behind him  there was not a dry eye in the village except the undertakers and folks do say he cried a bit well her father good soul had met with so many losses and crosses that there was little enough left for his daughter to live like a lady on so she was persuaded by her friends to take a voyage to india with a cousin of here is who had married and was going to settle there   leon mr cleveland has acquainted me with the rest there he married her and from thence by the severity of his father he was forced to send her   oakw ah poor dear home she came again miserable enough to be sure well mayhap all for the best now she will be as happy as the day is long but for this many a year she has led but a lonesome sort of a life for you may think my dame and i though we love her like a child of our own cannot have been company good enough for her but she was as kind to us and made as much of us as though we had been the best people in the land   lady jem we shall soon i hope have the pleasure of receiving her in

house but their own leon certainly  how right you were oakw and i am glad to find such friendly good souls in this great town of london  for do you know i had got a notion of its being but a bad sort

oakworth and lady jemima leon will not you accompany my mother sir i have business which must detain me   old vis yes yes i will go with you lady jemima calling after her  i say leonard where will her ladyship wish the rustic if she meets any of her noble relatives ha ha it is a good joke  ah leonard you are a droll dog exit   manet leonard if my designs succeed on what a pinnacle of fortune shall i be placed the independence bequeathed me by my grandfather i have turned to good account what though it has been the means of effecting the ruin of a few thoughtless profligates there vices were incurable and they would have been as completely beggared by the skilful operations of others if all my thoughts had been engaged in the exercise of devotion and my guineas appropriated to charitable donations  nay to preserve my estimation with the world i have raised from the earth those whom others less mindful of opinion would have left grovelling in misery  psha when i scrutinize my conduct with an eye half inclined to condemnation i find matter for praise instead of censure dupes will be dupes  knaves will make their prey of them  and lucky is the dupe that becomes the prey of a knave with some conscience and a great regard for a good reputation whom have we here   enter sharpset dressed as a methodist preacher shar peace be unto this house   leon who is this with what hedge divine have i the honor of an acquaintance   shar thy name is leonard visorly   leon well sir what is your business   shar to discourse with thee on the state of thy conscience   leon i request you will save yourself that trouble my conscience is a charge of which i choose to have the sole guardianship   shar but it is my duty to inquire whether thou have treated that precious charge like unto a faithful guardian  whether thou have not stained with guilt that which was consigned to thy care spotless and pure and which now goads thee with complainings for thy iniquity therefore i say    leon you shall say no more in this house out with you directly offering to push him out   shar oh leonard leonard is this the way you treat an old friend after so long an absence   leon an old friend  what do you mean who are you   shar and so my reverend appearance has concealed from your recognition your friend and brother in iniquity jeremy sharpset   leon sharpset   shar the very same   leon but what is the meaning of this transformation   shar the restlessness of my disposition and inclination for any pursuit in preference to laudable exertion and honest industry   leon you always had a propensity to confess your faults sharp yes but not much propensity to amend them to be sure i showed a little disposition toward it by quitting you leon your most humble servant shar i am afraid you felt the loss of me   leon yes i confess it  you were very serviceable   shar yes i was i did the roguery and you received the profits   leon come come  you were not ill paid   shar oh no  i dont complain how is poor drooply   leon still the creature of my bounty   shar well that is kind of you  a generous weakness in your character  you swindled him out of two thousand a year and are good enough to allow him a hundred ah you are a model of philanthropy   leon come a truce with your sarcasm   shar ah bless your honest tender heart he is as grateful to you as ever i conclude   leon yes he esteems me his friend and preserver   shar poor fellow he was wont to set the table in a roar now quite chopfallen i declare i never think of him but with a heartache   leon well well  but what have you been doing since we parted   shar all sorts of things i ought not to do to confess the truth the reason i quitted you was i was tired of the work you chalked out for me  you wanted to push me a little farther in roguery than i liked i am but a petty larceny villain  that ruin of poor drooply in which i was the chief engine for you  that hit me hard i am foolish enough to have qualms i know you despise me for it but we all have our weaknesses   leon well well but what became of you   shar i will tell you i had unluckily once in my life dined at a lord mayors feast  i shall never forget it talk of earls and dukes entertaining  psha a rivulet to the ocean ever after i panted for city honors  so all my honest earnings i was determined to deposit in trade an opportunity soon offered  i was to become a sleeping partner in a great house i paid down my cash to the last guinea  a docket was struck against the firm the very next week so the poor sleeping partner had nothing but the open air for his slumbers and instead of being in the road to claim a seat at a guildhall dinner i had scarcely enough to purchase one in porridge island   leon so all your hopes of a gold chain vanished   shar yes and i was in a very likely way to be adorned with an iron one  but i was resolved to take myself out of the reach of temptation and danger by leaving london   leon in what capacity did you travel   shar still i had a taste for partnership i engaged with a very respectable gentleman to divide with him the attention and profits of    leon of what   sharp a collection of wild beasts   leon i guess you were not a sleeping partner here   sharp no my companions were rather hostile to repose not much liking such uncivilized society and being a little apprehensive that my fellowtravellers might one time or other make a supper of me i soon cut this connection and instead of exhibiting the merits of others i got a taste for displaying my own   leon how pray   shar i joined a party of strolling players   leon indeed   shar i know you must be shocked at my descending so damned low as to turn actor but i did not disgrace myself long   leon how happened that   shar the audience would not let me   leon how so   shar i came out in richard the third i thought it devilish fine but the good folks in the front thought otherwise i ranted  they hooted  however i outroared them and pushed on till i got into bosworth field  a horse a horse my kingdom for a horse when a drunken foxhunting squire i shall never lose the sound of his damned voice bawled out of the boxes that i should have the best horse in his stable if i would ride away directly and never come back again   leon ha ha ha   shar the actors warned me it would not do i thought it envy in them and have some reason to think they sent in a party to hiss me however by way of comfort they told me though i should never act tragedy they thought i should succeed in low comedy  low comedy only think of their impudence is this a face for low comedy no no damn it i could not stoop to that   leon well your next resource   shar oh then i got a call and mounted the habiliments in which you see me this was lucrative but my conscience would not suffer me any longer to drain from the pockets of the poor the earnings of their industry nay what is worse embitter their innocent minds with groundless terrors and inspire them with prejudice against their fellow creatures   leon so then you deign at last to return to me   shar yes for i had rather cheat the rich than delude the poor   leon well well i will endeavor to find you employment   shar that i dont doubt as long as there is a pigeon to be plucked and as i am disposed to be a rook at your service   leon no i have at present honester objects in view to attain which i may need your assistance   shar well i am glad of that for upon my soul i am tired of being a rogue   leon if i reach the point of my present aim i may myself relinquish that character i shall then have wealth enough to gratify even my ambition i am no further a knave than as it forwards my grand pursuit the attainment of wealth and who would not use any means to gain that which covers vice with the garb of respect and without which virtue meets but pity or derision   shar well observed and never was observation more patly illustrated you are a glorious instance of the first part of your sentiment and here comes a proof of the latter  sharpset walks up the stage enter drooply leon ah drooply how do you do   dro how do you do my dear fellow   leon where have you hid yourself nobody has seen you of late   dro i have been striving to follow the example of my acquaintances and learning to be as shy of them as they are of me   leon why what an altered being you are you used to be a merry fellow   dro yes for i used to be a rich fellow   leon come come cheer up good spirits are a mans best friends   dro ay but like the rest of his friends when his money leaves him they leave him too   leon nay nay your friends have not all deserted you   dro all but you there is not another man in the world who would care a straw if the devil had one   leon if you are so despondent i must recommend you a spiritual comforter can your reverence administer consolation to this afflicted being to sharpset   shar no for i cannot return him the money i won of him   dro whom have we here   shar what not remember me if i had done you a kindness i might expect to be forgotten but i thought every one remembered an illturn   leon in this pious pastor you behold a quondam acquaintance mr sharpset   dro what sharpset turned methodist   shar yes but dont wrong my understanding  only from necessity   leon you might triumph now if you were disposed to indulge spleen for the man who was the chief gainer by your losses at play is now as low in the world as yourself   shar no i am so completely without gratification i have not even the comfort a malicious disposition would afford me it is far from a relief to me to see another unfortunate   leon you are mutually distressed yet how differently you bear your misfortunes   shar that is easily accounted for i have a thousand resources  drooply has none born to no other inheritance i have learned to turn to account what i inherit from nature so that though my acquisitions have been squandered i am still in possession of my original patrimony   dro ah you lucky dog you have an estate in every corner of your brain and a pretty income at the end of every finger now the whole produce of my skull would not get me change for sixpence and as for my hands curse them they are fit for nothing but to dangle by my sides or stuff out my coatpockets   leon why i am afraid they will never fill your pockets with any thing but themselves   dro oh i wish i had been a turk   leon a turk   dro yes a turk they are the only wise people on earth they teach all their great men some honest employment   leon do they i know some great men i wish they would give a lesson to   dro oh if we had that good mussulman custom among us how many a rich man would be of more use to society when his estate was gone than while he possessed it as a good cobbler is a more valuable character than a rich man who does not employ his wealth properly   leon why you are turning moralist   dro yes the loss of wealth seldom lessens a mans morality while i am creeping about such a piece of moving lumber what respect i feel for every reputable tinker that comes in my way this very morning how i did envy a merry rogue of a shoeblack with what glee he put the polish of an artist on the boot he was blacking how merrily he brushed and sung and how conceitedly and happily he looked at his work when he had done it oh you jolly dog thought i what a happy man had been spoiled if you had been born to two thousand a year you would never have enjoyed the luxury of polishing a shoe or the independent exultation of existing by your own industry   leon we must endeavor to dispel your melancholy you are a martyr to ennui i must find you employment   dro you must do something beside  find me capacity   leon that you dont want your talents have been only slumbering   dro havnt they they have had a pretty long nap and a sound one too i am afraid it will be a hard matter to wake them   leon i dont despair especially when i shall set the loud voice of friendship to rouse them   dro if they dont wake at that call you may take your oath their slumber is everlasting but though i am master of this poor tenement i really am so ignorant of the state of the upper story as not to know whether the inhabitants have perished by neglect or are only dozing from want of employment but this i do know there is a lively fellow in the first floor pointing to his heart who would dance with joy to do you the slightest service and lose every drop of blood to prove his friendship and gratitude exeunt   act ii scene i  an apartment in visorlys house enter leonard and caroline car yes i have not been in town above half an hour   leon have you brought with you from the country house the box which i told you contains the writings of your property   car yes  shall i give it to you   leon no i am too busy at present  only take care of it   car well my dear brother i am so glad we are to have our house full of company  oh that is delightful how i do love a racketting noisy scene in a morning the fashionable bustle of bondstreet the musical thunder of a footmans rap  the dealing out tickets to the whole tonworld  and then at night driving to twenty different assemblies  seeing the whole world in the course of an evening  oh dear dear what a charming age to live in we see more of life in one day than our ancestors did in their whole existence   leon yes but i doubt whether we are the happier for it   car to be sure we are what is all this but happiness care can never reach us for in all this hurry nobody has time to think and you know it is thinking makes one unhappy   leon well i am not cynic enough to attempt to reason people out of their notions of happiness for as it exists in imagination the idea is the reality but my dear caroline i have told you my wish to be thought well of by this young east indian from living in the same house and being nearly of an age you will most likely contract a friendship   car yes and her taking my brother for her lover will be the best security for that friendship for then we cannot be rivals  and nothing is so apt to make young ladies disagree as being both of the same mind   old

labored for the nearest shore but ound that an attempt to land would whelm us in the raging surf  thus were we compelled to trust our little skiff to the wide ocean and for many hours were driven at random by its fury  at length we gained the land but far from the coast on which we left our wreck julia but why did you not the instant that you landed acquaint us with your safety   clev alas i had lost the power of doing so enfeebled by fatigue when i reached the shore i scarce had sense or motion a fever followed from which reason and health returned together  so on the instant i set out to be

offer   old vis very indeed may be you think a third would be enough   clev no no far from it for though the bribe sounds handsomely it would be want of policy in me to take it   leon how   clev for

appointed now sir depart loaded not with my reproaches not with my malediction for the whole worlds contempt and the heaviest curses of the injured would add but a feathers weight to the mountain of remorse which conscious guilt will heap upon thy wretched bosom when i reflect on the severity of suffering conscience can inflict i could almost forget my injuries and pity thee   leon to palliate my guilt i do not seek  yet in justice let me declare the erroneous judgment of the world made me a villian i beheld the eye of observance and respect ever directed to the wealthy were he fool or knave no matter while all that is truly amiable or great in genius or in virtue when linked with poverty was heeded with the stare of disavowal or the scowl of contempt to be a golden idol for the worlds worship was my aim i have lost my fortune character and happiness in the attempt and now must meet in penury mankinds abhorrence and feel too i deserve it exit   mrs clev to caroline i grieve to think

luxury and i trust with minds to employ it only in pursuit of one  the luxury of doing good   finis epilogue written by john tailor esquire and spoken by mrs pope well though our bard has tried his utmost art to show how riches will pollute the heart no doubt his labor has been all in vain and poverty will never one convert gain how could the man attempt a task so bold but what forsooth can authors know of gold an ore that rarely darts on them a beam unless perchance in hopes delusive dream hope that misleads them through lifes weary way and scarcely leaves at last the barren bay what wean the human heart from love of pelf a toil too hard for hercules himself nay that great hero as we learn in story strove for a little gain as well as glory else why attack the dreadful scaly brute if not to grasp the rich hesperian fruit hence avarice is a passion not so odd since as we find it urged a demigod twas also said of yore the female tribe are frail as men when tempted by a bribe and mighty jove with all his boasted power was forced to woo amid a golden shower oh wondrous charm of allpersuasive gold that fires the timid and subdues the bold gold that can give the upstart blockhead fame and make a fawning world his wit proclaim that lends deformity resistless grace oerthrows the mighty and exalts the base great substitute for learning genius worth despotic sovereign of adoring earth but let me check the rash injurious thought for in this court no verdict can be bought here merit safely may assert her plea while candor regulates the mild decree and by that candor one who often has tried its generous force his fate must now abide in hopes one error more will pardon find since to his others you have so long been kind new publications printed for t n longman and o rees
