the life of dr oliver goldsmith written from personal knowledge authentic papers and other indubitable authorities to which are added such select observations from various parts of this writers works as may tend to recreate the fancy improve the understanding and amend the heart  sweet poet of nature dear goldsmith adieu as i witnessed thy worth to thy fame i will be true the tear of soft feeling most surely will start he must reach the warm bosom who writes to the heart but why should i check of sensation the tear the muses already have wept on thy bier london printed for j swan in the strand      price  s  d  the life of doctor oliver goldsmith to write the life of dr goldsmith is far from being a laborious task since little more is required than to give a transcript of the fairest pages of the human mind to have known shenstone cunningham and goldsmith is to have been happy in an acquaintance with the brightest side of the landscape of humanity but to have seen one of these amiable pictures is to have seen them all abating for that slight difference in the coloring which became necessary from the different points of view in which the pictures were to be placed  the virtues of dr goldsmiths mind will long be conspicuous in his written page and the reader will be warmed with the glowing graces which at once animate and develope the soul of the author  i know not if the observation was ever made but i believe it will be found true that when great abilities are united with very great virtues if the possessor should be a writer at all he will be a poet and if a poet a very excellent one in that case as cunningham sings we shall mark in his elegant lines the graces that glow in his mind   i fancy if we were to try all the living writers by this standard we should be able to form a more just opinion of their real characters as men than by any other criterion it is true at least with regard to the literary men within the circle of my knowledge that in proportion to the virtues of their minds is the elegance of their writings and that there is not a fool or a worse character among them that may not be distinguished by the turgidity of his style and the consequential nothingness of his phrase  who could hesitate a moment to distinguish between the manly dignity of style of the poet whose loss we now lament and the frippery bombast of a murphy or a kelly  but the difference lay chiefly in the mind and the one was exactly as much a better writer than the others as a better man  it is an observation that dr goldsmith has made in his vicar of wakefield that where the mind is capacious the affections are good i believe that the remark is founded in the laws of nature  god is infinite in wisdom and goodness  what is genius but an emanation of the divine beam know you a man distinguished from all the rest of his acquaintance for the frigid narrowness and selfishness of his soul  depend on it he is remarkably deficient in point of intellect he may have much cunning but he has no wisdom on the contrary know you a man of a warmer heart  rest assured that he has a clearer head than those who are strangers to that sublime feeling which does honor to humanity  if there be an apparent exception to this rule and such may be found it must be attributed to that commerce with mankind which will in some degree contaminate the purest sentiments but even under all appearances of variation the latent principles of the mind need only to be drawn forth to appear the same  roscommon in ireland claims the honor of dr goldsmiths birth his father who was a gentleman of a small estate had nine sons of whom oliver was the third he was born in the year      received a good classical education and was intended for holy orders with this view he was sent with his brother henry to trinity college dublin in the year      where he obtained a bachelors degree but his brothers merit on leaving the college not being rewarded with any preferment in the church our author was advised to the study of physic which he commenced by attending several courses of anatomy in dublin  in the year      he left dublin and went to edinburgh where he prosecuted the study of medicine under several celebrated professors of that university but he had not resided long in scotland before he began to feel the ill effects of his unbounded benevolence and he was at length absolutely obliged to leave the country to avoid a prison for he had bound himself to pay a larger sum for a friend than the narrowness of his finances would enable him to discharge  it was in the beginning of the year      that he quitted edinburgh but he had no sooner reached sunderland than he was arrested for the amount of his bond but he was happily relieved from his distress by the humanity of dr sleigh and mr laughlin maclane  the debt being discharged our ingenious philanthropist embarked on board a dutch vessel bound for rotterdam in which place he continued but a short time and then went to brussels he now made the tour of a considerable part of flanders took the degree of bachelor of physic at louvain and thence went through switszerland to geneva in company with an english gentleman whom he had made an acquaintance with in the course of his travels in flanders  when our poet sailed from england he was almost destitute of money so that he was under the necessity of traveling on foot or declining a journey in which he promised himself much satisfaction from a review of the customs and manners of different countries mr goldsmith was at this period in good health possessing a strength of constitution and a vigor of mind which bid defiance to danger and fatigue he was a tolerable proficient in the french language and played on the german flute with a degree of taste something above mediocrity thus qualified he traveled on anxious to gratify his curiosity and doubtful of the means of subsistence his classical knowledge however afforded him occasional entertainment in the religious houses while his musical talents continued to feed and lodge him among the merry poor of flanders etc  the doctor in relating the history of this part of his travels would say when i approached a peasants house in the evening i played one of my most merry tunes which procured me not only a lodging but subsistence for the following day but i must own that when i attempted to entertain persons of a higher rank they always thought my performance contemptible nor ever made me any return for my endeavors to please them  our author evidently refers to these circumstances of his life in the following lines in his traveller to kinder skies where gentler manners reign i turn and france displays her bright domain gay sprightly land of mirth and social ease pleased with thyself whom all the world can please how often have i led thy sportive choir with tuneless pipe beside the murmuring loire where shading elms along the margin grew and freshend from the wave the zephyr flew and happily though my harsh touch faltering still but mocked all tune and marred the dancer skill yet would the village praise my wondrous power and dance forgetful of the noontide hour alike all ages dames of ancient days have led their children through the mirthful maze and the gay grandsire skilled in gestic lore has friskd beneath the burden of threescore   dr goldsmith had not been long at geneva when a young fellow arrived there to whom he was recommended as a tutor in his travels through the rest of europe this youth having had a large fortune left him by his uncle a pawnbroker in london resolved to improve himself by travel but as avarice was his ruling passion he saw little more of the the curiosities of the continent than are to be seen without expense he was continually remarking how extravagant were the expenses of traveling and perpetually contriving methods of retrenching them so that it is not to be wondered if our author and his pupil parted which they did at marseilles where the latter embarked for england happy to save money rather than to gain knowledge  there was at this time but a small balance due to goldsmith who was once more left to struggle with adversity he now wandered alone through the greater part of france till having gratified his curiosity and sufficiently experienced those inconveniences attennding the almost pennyless traveller he sailed for england and arriving at dover toward the latter end of the year      he hastened immediately to london where he found himself a perfect stranger with scarce a shilling in the world  thus situated he began to be extremely uneasy his friend dr sleigh now resided in london goldsmith enquired him out and was received with every mark of friendship and esteem an offer was now made him of the place of usher at dr milners academy at peckham and this he eagerly acceped unwilling to subsist on the bounty of dr sleigh  about this period he wrote some criticisms for the monthly review which meeting with high approbation mr griffiths the proprietor engaged him to superintend that publication he therefore repaired to london and commenced author in form this was in the year      when he wrote a few pieces and but a few for the booksellers and though his pay was as it merited greater than that of many other writers it was nevertheless very disproportionate to the merit of such a writer and still farther below the merit of such a man as dr goldsmith yet were not the booksellers his employers worthy of censure as his name was not known to the public and his essays and poems were inserted among the promiscuous crowd in magazines and other periodical publications  it was at this period that the doctor became acquainted with the late mr newberry who being a proprietor of the public ledger our poet was engaged as a writer in that paper then newly established in which he published a series of valuable letters which have been since printed in volumes under the title of the citizen of the world  hitherto the doctor had lodged much in the style of a poor author in greenarbor court in the old bailey but he now got better apartments in wineoffice court fleet street and a summer lodging at canonbury house islington where he continued a considerable time and then removed first to the kings bench walks and afterward to brick court in the temple where he died  with the publication of the traveller our authors literary fame began to increase very fast and it was established by the appearance of the vicar of wakefield for he was now equally and justly esteemed both as a poet and novellist he had been before known for a good critic and he has since shone as a learned historian  the publication of the vicar of wakefield was succeeded by that of the comedy of the goodnatured man which was performed nine nights at covent garden theater but did not meet with an applause equal to its merit though it was far from being illreceived  the next piece of any consequence that our author presented the world with was his deserted village a poem abounding in nature truth elegance and benevolence a circumstance respecting the sale of the copy of this piece marks very strongly the authors simplicity of mind and unbounded goodness of heart the manuscript having been delivered to the bookseller he gave the doctor his note of hand for one hundred guineas for the copyright the doctor mentioned this circumstance the same day to a gentleman who said he thought it a large sum for so small a piece in truth said the poet i think so too nor have i been easy since i received it i will therefore go and return him his note  this he actually did leaving the payment to the booksellers honor when the sale should inform him what he might afford to give  the success of the doctors last comedy she stoops to conquer is too generally known to need being mentioned it is in fact the most laughable piece which has been brought on the stage for many years  mr colman was or pretended to be of opinion that this piece would be damned a proof that managers are not always the best judges of the taste of the town and one would think that they are not therefore the most proper caterers however they may have assumed a right of cramming the public with any trash they think proper  the fate of a writer for the stage is not much to be envied after many months labor to complete a piece to his own approbation he is to summon patience to a bide all the managers affected corrections and still more mortifying delays and after all perhaps a disgusted acquaintance shall make a party raise a riot and damn the play  our ingenious writer had laid a plan for writing an universal dictionary of arts and sciences in which he had a promise of the occasional assistance of dr johnson sir joshua reynolds mr beauclerc and david garrick esquire  of the success of this great work the doctor had formed high expectations but he did not live to make any progress in it  it is said that our author cleared   00 l in one year by his writings notwithstanding which partly by the unbounded benevolence of his disposition and partly from an unhappy turn for gaming which he contracted in his latter years he was often distressed for cash in a very great degree  dr goldsmiths great and shining talents procured him many friends and admirers among persons in the first walk of life among others the duke of northumberland is mentioned as having wished to be known to our poet who himself told the following story of his visit to the peer  i was invited said the doctor by my friend mr percy to wait upon the duke in consequence of the satisfaction he had received from the perusal of one of my productions i dressed myself in the best manner i could and after studying some compliments i thought necessary on such an occasion proceeded to northumberlandhouse and acquainted the servants that i had particular business with his grace they showed me into an antichamber where after waiting some time a gentleman very elegantly dressed made his appearance taking him for the duke i delivered all the fine things i had composed in order to compliment him on the honor he had done me when to my great astonishment he told me i had mistaken him for his master who would see me immediately at that instant the duke came into the apartment and i was so confused on the occasion that i wanted words barely sufficient to express the sense i entertained of the dukes politeness and went away exceedingly chagrined at the blunder i had committed  dr goldsmith happy as he thought himself in the strength of a vigorous constitution paid at all times too little regard to the preservation of that health so dear to his friends so important to the public  i remember some years since on the doctors partial recovery from a fit of illness he came into the chapter coffeehouse when a gentleman observed how pale he looked and expressed his fears for his safety  pale cried the poet in a pettish humor that may be sir but the staminas good  the staminas good  dr goldsmiths natural disposition led him to covet a life of learned leisure but this was too often interrupted by that want of money to which the benevolence of his disposition frequently reduced him when his circumstances were embarrassed his temper was so ruffled that he often expressed himself in the most vehement manner these gusts of passion as they were very violent were very short the philosopher recollected and resumed himself on a moments reflection but his servants profited by their masters violence for they would put themselves in his way when he was in a passion sure to reap the reward of undeserved chastisement  it is very remarkable of this gentleman that contrary to the opinion of almost all the world he thought ben johnson beaumont and their cotemporaries but secondrate poets indeed he considered shakespeare himself as inferior to vanburgh and farquhar  the doctor was from principle an enemy to that class of patriotic writers as they are called who distinguish themselves by abusing the government under which they live in fact he considered them as enemies to all good government he was a friend to monarchy and held sacred the person of the sovereign but if he was an enemy to those who abused our government and governors indiscriminately he was much more so to those paltry those detestable writers who sacrificing every consideration at the shrine of plutus wrote on both sides of a contested question and on both at the same time for hire it is said that dr goldsmith did not speak to mr kelly for seven years preceding his death  he firmly believed the doctrine of a future state in which the miseries of the virtuous in this life would be amply rewarded by a permanency of happiness incapable of decay above flattering the vices or follies of the rich or great he was ill qualified to push his fortune among those whom his genius taught to court his company yet was he happy in a connection with many of the greatest and best characters of this kingdom  dr goldsmith being seized with a violent indisposition on the   th of march      sent for mr hawes an apothecary in the strand the night succeeding that day and declared his intention of taking dr jamess fever powders to his persisting in which resolution many of his warmest friends have ascribed the loss of this great and good man how far they are right in their conjectures it would be needless if it were not impossible to say mr hawes has published an account of the doctors illness so far as relates to the exhibition of these powders the public may be interested in the enquiry into the probable effects of so powerful a medicine the writer of these pages has only to say that mr hawes is a man whose skill or veracity will not be doubted for a moment by any one who has the honor of knowing him  this delightful poet this sweet moralist this excellent man departed this life on the  th of april      and was interred in the buryingground of the temple it was proposed to have buried him in westminsterabey where however a monument is to be erected to his memory  but the best and most lasting monument will be found in his works  dr goldsmith was in stature rather under the middle size and built more like the porter than the gentleman his complexion was pale his forehead low his face almost round and pitted with the small pox but marked with the strong lines of thinking upon the whole there was nothing in his appearance that would not rather prepossess the mind against him but to those who knew him there appeared a melting softness in his eye that was the genuine effect of his humanity never did that eye behold an object of distress but it conveyed an intelligence to the heart that stretched out the hand irresistibly to relieve and it is well known that his unbounded philanthropy contributed to keep him poor but he ever felt a satisfaction in the conscious dignity and liberality of his mind that the possession of wealth without the will to distribute it could never have afforded  presuming that the best use to which biography can be applied is to profit by the amiable part of the authors character i shall extract for the entertainment and instruction of my readers such passages of dr goldsmiths works as mark in a striking manner the unbounded benevolence of his temper or the elegant simplicity of his mind that he thought justly on most occasions is a fact which will appear incontestible from the perusal of many of the following observations  as some men gaze with admiration at the colors of a tulip or the wing of a butterfly so i was by nature an admirer of happy human faces vicar of wakefield vol i p    th edition  never was the family of wakefield known to turn the traveller or the poor dependant out of doors ib p    let us draw upon content for the deficiencies of fortune ib p     the slightest distress touched him to the quick and his soul labored under a sickly sensibility of the miseries of others ib p     my youngest boys being appointed to read the lessons for the day and he that read loudest distinctest and best was to have a halfpenny on sunday to put in the poors box ib p     i do not know whether such flouncing and shredding is becoming even in the rich if we consider upon a moderate calculation that the nakedness of the indigent world may be clothed from the trimmings of the vain ib p     the virtue which requires to be ever guarded is scarce worth the sentinel ib p     hospitality is one of the first christian duties the beast retires to its shelter and the bird flies to its nest but helpless man can only find refuge from his fellow creature the greatest stranger in this world was he that came to save it he never had a house as if willing to see what hospitality was left remaining among us ib p     we should never strike an unnecessary blow at a victim over whom providence holds the scourge of its resentment ib p     such as are poor and will associate with none but the rich are hated by those they avoid and despised by those they follow ib p      the pain which conscience gives a man who has already done wrong is soon got over conscience is a coward and those faults it has not strength enough to prevent it seldom has justice enough to accuse ib p   0  the opinion a man forms of his own prudence is measured by that of the company he keeps ib p      wit and understanding are trifles without integrity it is that which gives value to every character the ignorant peasant without fault is greater than the philosopher with many ib p   0  the reputation of men should be prized not for their exemption from fault but the size of those virtues they are possessed of ib p   0  when great vices are opposed in the same mind to as extraordinary virtues such a character deserves contempt ib p      bad men want shame they only blush at being detected in doing good but glory in their vices ib p      for the first time the very best may err art may persuade and novelty spread out its charm the first fault is the child of simplicity but every other the offspring of guilt ib p      man little knows what calamities are beyond his patience to bear till he tries them as in ascending the heights of ambition which look bright from below every step we rise shows us some new and gloomy prospect of hidden disappointment so in our descent from the summits of pleasure though the vale of misery below may appear at first dark and gloomy yet the busy mind still attentive to its own amusement finds as we descend something to flatter and to please still as we approach the darkest objects appear to brighten and the mortal eye becomes adapted to its gloomy situation ib p      the looks of domestics ever transmit their masters benevolence ib vol ii p     i found that monarchy was the best government for the poor to live in and commonwealths for the rich i found that riches in general were in every country another name for freedom and that no man is so fond of liberty himself as not to be desirous of subjecting the will of some individuals in society to his own ib p     go my boy and if you fall though distant exposed and unwept by those that love you the most precious tears are those with which heaven bedews the unburied head of a soldier ib p  0  wisdom makes but a slow defense against trouble though at last a sure one ib p     in all human institutions a smaller evil is allowed to procure a greater good as in politics a province may be given away to secure a kingdom in medicine a limb may be lopt off to preserve the body but in religion the law is written and inflexible never to do evil ib p  0  that single effort by which we stop short in the downhill path to perdition is itself a greater exertion of virtue than a hundred acts of justice ib p     none but the guilty can be long completely miserable ib p     that melancholy which is excited by objects of pleasure or inspired by sounds of harmony sooths the heart instead of corroding it ib p     though the mind may often be calm under great injuries little villainy can at any time get within the soul and sting it into rage ib p     good council rejected returns to enrich the givers bosom ib p      it were highly to be wished that the legislative power would direct the law rather to reformation than severity that it would seem convinced that the work of eradicating crimes is not by making punishments familiar but formidable then instead of our present prisons which find or make men guilty which enclose wretches for the commission of one crime and return them if returned alive fitted for the perpetration of thousands we should see as in other parts of europe places of penitence and solitude where the accused might be attended by such as could give them repentance if guilty or new motives to virtue if innocent and this but not the increasing punishments is the way to mend a state ib p      to religion we must hold in every circumstance of life for our truest comfort for if already we are happy it is a pleasure to see that we can make that happiness unending and if we are miserable it is very consoling to think that there is a place of rest thus to the fortunate religion holds out a continuance of bliss to the wretched a change from pain ib p      after a certain degree of pain every new breach that death opens in the constitution nature kindly covers with insensibility ib p      no efforts of a refined imagination can sooth the wants of nature can give elastic sweetness to the dank vapor of a dungeon or ease to the throbbings of a broken heart let the philosopher from his couch of softness tell us that we can resist all these  alas the effort by which we resist them is still the greatest pain ib p      the greatest object in the universe says a certain philosopher is a good man struggling with adversity yet there is still a greater which is the good man that comes to relieve it ib p      you imagine perhaps that a contempt for your own life gives you a right to take that of another but where sir is the difference between a duellist who hazards a life of no value and the murderer who acts with greater security is it any diminution of the gamesters fraud when he alleges that he has staked a counter ib p      the above will we conceive be deemed a sufficient specimen of dr goldsmiths abilities as a prose writer the reader will not be displeased to see how the poetical talents of this admirable genius are equally adapted to charm the imagination and win the heart to virtue  in his traveller after having described the fraternal fondness of an  untravelled heart he addresses his brother as follows  eternal blessings crown my earliest friend  and round his dwelling guardian saints attend  blessed be that spot where cheerful guests retire  to pause from toil and trim their evening fire  blessed that abode where want and pain repair  and every stranger finds a ready chair  blessed be those feasts with simple plenty crowned  where all the ruddy family around  laugh at the jest or pranks that never fail  or sigh with pity at some mournful tale  or press the bashful stranger to his food  and learn the luxury of doing good   is not the following as beautiful in point of poetry as the wish that concludes it is honorable to the feelings of the writers heart  as some lone miser visiting his store  bends at his treasure counts recounts it over  hoards after hoards his rising raptures fill  yet still he sighs for hoards are wanting still  thus to my breast alternate passions rise  pleased with each good that heaven to man supplies  yet often a sigh prevails and sorrows fall  to see the hoard of human bliss so small  and often i wish amidst the scene to find  some spot to real happiness consigned  where my worn soul each wandering hope at rest  may gather bliss to see my fellows blessed   our author seems to have been of opinion that however different in appearance the degrees of happiness in different countries the beneficent author of nature has given an equal share to all  and yet perhaps if countries we compare  and estimate the blessings which they share  though patriots flatter still shall wisdom find  an equal portion dealt to all mankind  as different good by art or nature given  to different nations makes their blessings even   speaking of italy and its inhabitants our author has the following beautiful lines  but small the bliss that sense alone bestows  and sensual bliss is all the nation knows  in florid beauty groves and fields appear  man seems the only growth that dwindles here  contrasted faults through all his manners reign  though poor luxurious though submissive vain  though grave yet trifling zealous yet untrue  and even in penance planning sins anew   but let us with the poet turn to  where the bleak swiss their stormy mansions tread  and force a churlish soil for scanty bread  no product here the barren hills afford  but man and steel the soldier and his sword  no vernal blooms their torpid rocks array  but winter lingering chills the lap of may   of france and its inhabitants he says   ostentation here with tawdry art  pants for the vulgar praise which fools impart  here vanity assumes her pert grimace  and trims her robes of frize with copper lace  here beggar pride defrauds her daily cheer  to boast one splendid banquet once a year  the mind still turns where shifting fashion draws  nor weighs the solid worth of self applause   his picture of the dutch is very striking   their muchloved wealth imparts  convenience plenty elegance and arts  but view them closer craft and fraud appear  even liberty itself is bartered here  at golds superior charms all freedom flies  the needy sell it and the rich man buys  a land of tyrants and a den of slaves  here wretches seek dishonorable graves  and calmly bent to servitude conform  dull as their lakes that slumber in the storm   is he not equally happy in describing our own country and its inhabitants   my genius spreads her wing  and flies where britain courts the western spring  where lawns extend that scorn arcadian pride  and brighter streams than famed hydaspis glide  there all around the gentlest breezes stray  there gentle music melts on every spray  creations mildest charms are there combined  extremes are only in the masters mind  stern over each bosom reason holds her state  with daring aims irregularly great  pride in their port defiance in their eye  i see the lords of human kind pass by   this very elegant poem concludes with the following lines  vain very vain my weary search to find  that bliss which only centers in the mind  why have i strayed from pleasure and repose  to seek a good each government bestows  in every government though terrors reign  though tyrant kings or tyrant laws restrain  how small of all that human hearts endure  that part which laws or kings can cause or cure  still to ourselves in every place consigned  our own felicity we make or find  with secret course which no loud storms annoy  glides the smooth current of domestic joy  the lifted ax the agonizing wheel  lukes iron crown and damiens bed of steel  to men remote from power but rarely known  leave reason faith and conscience all our own   in the deserted village our poet execrates and laments that increase of luxury which will probably hasten the ruin of this empire the coloring of this poem is very warm but i am afraid it is too just  the luxuries of the higher ranks have been so long taxing the industry of the lower and such numerous emigrations have already taken place that there seems every reason to apprehend that dr goldsmiths deserted village may in another century be realized in a deserted kingdom  this poem is every where and so equally excellent that we know not to which particular beauty to turn the eye of the reader the following extracts will show to what a height of elegance the english language may arrive and how astonishingly sweet may be the harmony of its periods without their deducting any thing from the sterling manliness of their sense  sweet auburn loveliest village of the plain  where health and plenty cheard the laboring swain  where smiling spring its earliest visit paid  and parting summers lingering blooms delayed  ill fares the land to hastening ills a prey  where wealth accumulates and men decay  princes and lords may flourish or may fade  a breath can make them as a breath has made  but a bold peasantry their countrys pride  when once destroyed can never be supplied  near yonder copse where once the garden smiled  and still where many a garden flower grows wild  there where a few torn shrubs the place disclose  the village preachers modest mansion rose  a man he was to all the country dear  and passing rich with forty pounds a year  thus to relieve the wretched was his pride  and even his failings leaned to virtues side  but in his duty prompt at every call  he watched and wept he prayed and felt for all  and as a bird each fond endearment ties  to tempt its newfledged offspring to the skies  he tried each art reproved each dull delay  allured to brighter worlds and led the way  beside the bed where parting life was laid  and sorrow guilt and pain by turns dismayed  the reverend champion stood at his control  despair and anguish fled the struggling soul  comfort came down the trembling wretch to raise  and his last faultering accents whispered praise   behold the picture of the country scoolmaster  beside yon straggling fence that skirts the way  with blossomed furze unprofitable gay  there in his noisy mansion skilled to rule  the village master taught his little school  a man severe he was and stern to view  i knew him well and every truant knew  well had the boding tremblers learned to trace  the days disasters in his morning face  full well they laughed with counterfeited glee  at all his jokes for many a joke had he  full well the busy whisper circling round  conveyed the dismal tidings when he frowned  yet he was kind or if severe in aught  the love he bore to learning was in fault  the village all declared how much he knew  twas certain he could write and cipher too  lands he could measure terms and tides presage  and even the story ran that he could gauge  in arguing too the parson owned his skill  for even though vanquished he could argue still  while words of learned length and thundering sound  amazed the gazing rustics ranged around  and still they gazed and still the wonder grew  that one small head could carry all he knew   having painted the village alehouse decayed of course since its customers had been obliged to leave their native land in search of bread our poet has the following picturesque lines  thither no more the peasant shall repair  to sweet oblivion of his daily care  nor more the farmers news the barbers tale  no more the woodmans ballad shall prevail  no more the smith his dusky brow shall clear  relax his ponderous strength and lean to hear  the host himself no longer shall be found  careful to see the mantling bliss go round  nor the coy maid half willing to be pressed  shall kiss the cup to pass it to the rest   this following picture of a rustic family on the point of emigrating will give a melancholy but i fear a just idea of scenes that too often occur in the distant parts of these kingdoms   good heaven what sorrows gloomd that parting day  that called them from their native walks away  when the poor exiles every pleasure past  hung round their bowers and fondly looked their last  and took a long farewell and wished in vain  for seats like these beyond the western main  and shuddering still to face the distant deep  retuned and wept and still returned to weep  the good old sire the first prepared to go  to new found worlds and wept for others woe  but for himself in conscious virtue brave  he only wished for worlds beyond the grave  his lovely daughter lovelier in her tears  the fond companion of his helpless years  silent went next neglectful of her charms  and left a lovers for a fathers arms  with louder plaints the mother spoke her woes  and blessed the cot where every pleasure rose  and kissed her thoughtless babes with many a tear  and claspt them close in sorrow doubly dear  whilst her fond husband strove to lend relief  in all the silent manliness of grief we shall conclude with the following lines sorry only that as general experience has proved their truth england seems resolved not to become an exception to the rule  o luxury thou cursed by heavens decree  how ill exchanged are things like these for thee  how do thy potions with insidious joy  diffuse their pleasures only to destroy  kingdoms by thee to sickly greatness grown  boast of a florid vigor not their own  at every draught more large and large they grow  a bloated mass of rank unwieldy woe  till sapped their strength and every part unsound  down down they sink and spread a ruin round   as dr goldsmiths ballad of the hermit has been justly celebrated on account of its elegant tenderness and sweet simplicity i presume i cannot oblige my readers with a more acceptable present a ballad i  turn gentle hermit of the dale  and guide my lonely way  to where yon taper cheers the vale  with hospitable ray ii  for here forlorn and lost i tread  with fainting steps and slow  where wilds immeasurably spread  seem lengthening as i go iii  forbear my son the hermit cries  to tempt the dangerous gloom  for yonder faithless phantom flies  to lure thee to thy doom iv  here to the houseless child of want  my door is open still  and though my portion is but scant  i give it with good will v  then turn tonight and freely share  whatever my cell bestows  my rushy couch and frugal fare  my blessing and repose vi  no flocks that range the valley free  to slaughter i condemn  taught by that power that pities me  i learn to pity them vii  but from the mountains grassy side  a guiltless feast i bring  a scrip with herbs and fruits supplied  and water from the spring viii  then pilgrim turn thy cares forego  all earthborn cares are wrong  man wants but little here below  nor wants that little long ix soft as the dew from heaven descends his gentle accents fell the modest stranger lowly bends and follows to the cell x far in a wilderness obscure the lonely mansion lay a refuge to the neighboring poor and strangers led astray xi no stores beneath its humble thatch required a masters care the wicket opening with a latch received the harmless pair xii and now when busy crowds retire to take their evening rest the hermit trimmed his little fire and cheered his pensive guest xiii and spread his vegetable store and gayly pressed and smiled and skilled in legendary lore the lingering hours beguiled xiv around in sympathetic mirth its tricks the kitten tries the cricket chirrups in the hearth the crackling faggot flies xv but nothing could a charm impart to sooth the strangers woe for grief was heavy at his heart and tears began to flow xvi his rising cares the hermit spied with answering care oppressed  and whence unhappy youth he cried  the sorrows of thy breast xvii  from better habitations spurned  reluctant do thou rove  or grieve for friendship unreturnd  or unregarded love xviii  alas the joys that fortune brings  are trifling and decay  and those who prize the paltry things  more trifling still than they xix  and what is friendship but a name  a charm that lulls to sleep  a shade that follows wealth or fame  but leaves the wretch to weep xx  and love is still an emptier sound  the modern fair ones jest  on earth unseen or only found  to warm the turtles nest xxi  for shame fond youth thy sorrows hush  and spurn the sex he said but while he spoke a rising blush his lovelorn guest betrayed xxii surpised he sees new beauties rise swift mantling to the view like colors over the morning skies as bright as transient too xxiii the bashful look the rising breast alternate spread alarms the lovely stranger stands confessed a maid in all her charms xxiv  and ah forgive a stranger rude  a wretch forlorn she cried  whose feet unhallowed thus intrude  where heaven and you reside xxv  but let a maid thy pity share  whom love has taught to stray  who seeks for rest but finds despair  companion of her way xxvi  my father lived beside the tyne  a wealthy lord was he  and all his wealth was marked as mine  he had but only me xxvii  to win me from his tender arms  unnumberd suitors came  who praised me for imputed charms  and felt or feigned a flame xxviii  each hour a mercenary crowd  with richest proffers strove  among the rest young edwin bowed  but never talked of love xxix  in humblest simplest habit clad  no wealth nor power had he  wisdom and worth were all he had  but these were all to me xxx  the blossom opening to the day  the dews of heaven refined  could naught of purity display  to emulate his mind xxxi  the dew the blossom on the tree  with charms inconstant shine  their charms were his but woe to me  their constancy was mine xxxii  for still i tried each fickle art  importunate and vain  and while his passion touched my heart  i triumphed in his pain xxxiii  till quite dejected with my scorn  he left me to my pride  and sought a solitude forlorn  in secret where he died xxxiv  but mine the sorrow mine the fault  and well my life shall pay  i will seek the solitude he sought  and stretch me where he lay  xxxv  and there forlorn despairing hid  i will lay me down and die  twas so for me that edwin did  and so for him will i xxxvi  forbid it heaven the hermit cried and clasped her to his breast the wondering fair one turned to chide twas edwins self that pressed xxxvii  turn angelina ever dear  my charmer turn to see  thy own thy long lost edwin here  restored to love and thee xxxviii  thus let me hold thee to my heart  and every care resign  and shall we never never part  my life  my all that is mine xxxix  no never from this hour to part  well live and love so true  the sigh that rends thy constant heart  shall break thy edwins too   since doctor goldsmiths death a poem has appeared entitled retaliation which owes its origin to the following circumstance the doctor was a member of a kind of club of wits which met occasionally at the st jamess coffee house and a member of the society having proposed to write epitaphs on our poet he was called upon for retaliation in consequence of which he wrote and produced at the next meeting of the club a poem under that title from which the following characters are selected  here lies our good edmund burk esquire member for wendover edmund whose genius was such  we scarcely can praise it or blame it too much  who born for the universe narrowd his mind  and to party gave up what was meant for mankind  though fraught with all learning yet straining his throat  to persuade t townsend member for whitchurch tommy townsend to lend him a vote  who too deep for his hearers still went on refining  and thought of convincing while they thought of dining  though equal to all things for all things unfit  too nice for a statesman too proud for a wit  for a patriot too cool for a drudge disobedient  and too fond of the right to pursue the expedient  in short twas his fate unemployd or in place sir  to eat mutton cold and cut

care  to draw men as they ought to be not as they are  his gallants are all faultless his women divine  and comedy wonders at being so fine  like a tragedy queen he has dizend her out  or rather like tragedy given a rout  his fools have their follies so lost in a crowd  of virtues and feelings that folly grows proud  and coxcombs alike in their failings alone  adopting his portraits are pleased with their own  say where has our poet this malady caught  or wherefore his characters thus without fault  say was it that vainly directing his view  to find out mens virtues and finding them few  quite sick of pursuing each troublesome elf  he grew lazy at last and drew from himself  here lies david garrick describe me who can  an abridgement of all that was pleasant in man  as an actor confessed without rival to shine  as a wit if not first in the very first line  yet with talents like these and an excellent heart  the man had his failings a dupe to his art  like an illjudging beauty his colors he spread  and beplasterd with rouge his own natural red  on the stage he was natural simple affecting  twas only that when he was off he was acting  with no reason on earth to go out of his way  he turned and he varied full ten times a day  though secure of our hearts yet confoundedly sick  if they were not his own by finessing and trick  he cast off his friends as a huntsman his pack  for he knew when he pleased he could whistle them back  of praise a mere glutton he swallowed what came  and the puff of a dunce he mistook it for fame  till his relish grown callous almost

manner in both of which taken in the point of time described must be allowed by those who have been witnesses of such a scene to be as happily given upon paper as that great artist himself perhaps could have exhibited upon canvas and only took snuff  here whitefoord reclines and deny it who can  though he merrily lived he is now a mr w is so notorious a punster that doctor goldsmith used to say it was impossible to keep him company without being infected with the itch of punning grave man  rare compound of oddity frolic and fun  who relished a joke and rejoiced in a pun  whose temper was
