represents commerce as the child of neptune and born on the coast of libya in an island celebrated in fabulous antiquity for its fruitfulness and plenty during the first uncultivated ages whence the new divinity is supposed to convey these blessings round the world her birth is attended by many of the gods who endow her with their several gifts among the rest apollo appoints her to be the inventress of letters sir isaac newtons opinion being here alluded to that merchandise gave rise to this wonderful discovery commerce is then described as making her first appearance to the world among the phoenicians the earliest people who exercised an extensive trade from thence she proceeds to visit other parts of the globe and endeavors to erect her principal empire at carthage situated in libya the country assigned for her nativity upon the destruction of that city she again removes from place to place but at length allured by the vigor and singular resolution of the dutch in throwing off the spanish yoke she takes up her residence with that indefatigable people lastly by the good laws which have been made from time to time for the encouragement of trade among us especially by the act of navigation which has transferred a great part of the dutch traffic to ourselves she is supposed on our invitation to choose england for her chief abode more particularly london our principal emporium as well as capital city and upon this occasion an enquiry is made how it has come to pass that notwithstanding the great wealth and power attending commerce the course of trade should so often have shifted its seat and the means conceived most effectual to fix this wanderer here are pointed out  london or the progress of commerce ye northern blasts and the east wind

retreat whence she contemplates with a tranquil mind her various wanderings from the fated hour that she abandoned her maternal clime neptunian commerce whom phoenice bore illustrious nymph that named the fertile plains along the sounding main extended far which flowery carmel with its sweets perfumes and with its cedars libanus oershades her from the bottom of the watery world as once she stood in radiant beauties graced to mark the heaving tide the piercing eye of neptune viewed enamored from the deep the god ascending rushes to the beach and clasps the affrighted virgin from that day soon as the paly regent of the night nine times her monthly progress had renewed through heavens illumined vault phoenice led by shame once more the seaworn margin sought there paced with painful steps the barren sands a solitary mourner and the surge which gently rolled beside her now no more with placid eyes beholding thus exclaimed ye fragrant shrubs and cedars lofty shade which crown my native hills ye spreading palms that rise majestic on these fruitful meads with you who gave the lost phoenice birth and you who bear the endearing name of friends once faithful partners of my chaster hours farewell to thee perfidious god i come bent down with pain and anguish on thy sands i come thy suppliant death is all i crave bid thy devouring waves inwrap my head and to the bottom whelm my cares and shame she ceased when sudden from the unclosing deep a crystal car emergd with glittering shells called from their oozy beds by tethys train and blushing coral decked whose ruddy glow mixed with the watery luster of the pearl a smiling band of seaborn nymphs attend who from the shore with gentle hands convey the fearsubdud phoenice and along the lucid chariot place as there with dread all mute and struggling with her painful throes she lay the winds by neptunes high command were silent round her not a zephyr dared to wanton over the cedars branching top nor on the plain the stately palm was seen to wave its graceful verdure over the main no undulation broke the smooth expanse but all was hushed and motionless around all but the lightlysliding car impelled along the level azure
