a fragment of the history of that illustrious personage john bull esquire  price two shillings and sixpene  a fragment of the history of that illustrious personage john bull esquire compiled by the celebrated historian sir humphry polesworth lately discovered in the repairs of grubhatch the ancient seat of the family of the polesworths now first published from the original manuscript by peregrine pinfold of grubhatch esquire  et modo quos illi fato contingere non est prospicit occasus interdum respicit ortus quidque agar ignarus stupet et nec fraena remittit nec retinere valet p ovid nas metam lib ii london printed for the editor by t wilkins no    cow lane snow hill and sold by mr debrett opposite burlingtonhouse piccadilly mr bew paternoerrow mr keaesley fleet treet and at all the pamphlet shops at the royal exchange  preface circumstances which of themselves might appear trivial and insignificant become highly interesting when they are connected with or are explanatory of great and important events and so great and important do i consider the discovery of this precious fragment of history which i now give to the public that i am persuaded i need offer no apology for minutely relating the manner in which it so accidentally and so happily fell into my hands  my father having having pursued the profession of a pinmaker with great success acquired a very handsome fortune with which he purchased grubhatch the ancient seat of the family of the polesworths at his death i succeeded to that estate and wishing to live as became a person of my rank and fortune i determined like other young gentlemen to pull to pieces modernise and adorn so commodious but so antiquated a house  unluckily i was not acquainted with any fashionable architect and was determined not to be so vulgar as to employ a city surveyor i concluded therefore that my best way was to consult my cook maid upon this occasion who i had always found to be a very shrewd sensible woman and who besides had a damned good taste of her own accordingly having mentioned the subject to her one day she told me that she had formerly lived with a family in marylebone and that in one of the streets there she remembered to have seen a very tasty house built on a new principle by a very famous and fashionable architector whose name she had forgot but she remembered to have often admired his house as being uncommonly crips and nict and not in the least like a dwelling house for it looked for all the world like a chapel from this account which pleased me i determined to enquire after this great artist and having gone on purpose to look at his house i saw it answered precisely to my cook maids description i next went to look at an addition by him made to a great mans house adjoining to the river and from the skill and dexterity with which i observed the artist had there avoided all regularity proportion taste and elegance i concluded he must have a perfect knowledge of his art to enable him to deviate from all its rules and all its beauties with such ingenuity and correctness i did not therefore hezitate a moment in determining that this was the proper person for me to employ  accordingly he came to my house and gave me a monstrous beautiful design for taking away all my old towers turrets and battlements and every thing else which gavemy house an appearance of antiquity or of old fashioned magnificence and in their stead he substituted venetian and palladian windows ballustrades and pilasters and in short every thing that is handsome modern and tonish i was perfectly charmed with all this when an accident happened which had nearly made me frantic and curse my architect for an illiterate booby who deserved to be buried in one of his deepest foundations  i am sure the public will forgive my rage when i relate that one day my workmen in pulling down part of a round tower came to a small concealed closet in the wall in which was lodged a very old iron chest with a rusty padlock upon it  they immediately concluded they had found a treasure and proposed to take an oath of secrecy to each other respecting the contents  but one of them cried out damn it let us first see if there is any thing in the chest worth swearing about  let us open him and examine his belly this they did by striking off the padlock when upon lifting up the lid  lo there was nothing to be found but a parcel of old musty papers in manuscript much decayed from age very damp and almost perished for want of air at this critical moment my architect entering the tower enquired of the workmen what they were about they being extremely disappointed at neither finding gold nor silver told him they had just discovered a parcel of old dirty papers not worth a t  d let me see them says he and then turning over some leaves he reads on the title page the history of john bull but the ignorant nincompoop never having before heard of the name of that illustrious person exclaimed ay this is a cock and a bull story indeed and reading still farther he came to those beautiful and well selected lines of ovid upon which he observed that this was some damned greek or latin jargon which he thanked god he knew nothing about and therefore says he as the paper is very nice and soft i will carry it to town with me and shall do what perhaps the author could not have done for himself for i shall certainly transmit his work to posterity having pronounced this witticism with an air of selfapplause he began to bundle up his papers when by the most accidental stroke of good luck i came sauntering into the place  what have you got here good sir says i nothing worth looking at replied the artist telling me at the same time where and how these old fusty papers as he was pleased to call them had been discovered this raised my curiosity and having read the title page and the learned historians quotation from ovid i jumped for joy and exclaimed by god i have found a treasure upon this i observed both my architect and workmen began to stare at me and at oneanother like so many stuck pigs at length the artist addressing himself to me are these sir said he title deeds which we have now discovered title devils replied i you had nearly ruined me by your ignorance but thank god i came in time to save this valuable work and then collecting the moldy sheets away i capered to my study in a transport of joy and immediately set myself down to read over this admirable performance  i soon perceived that the air began to have a sensible effect upon the sheets of my manuscript as they became so tender it was with difficulty they could bear turnning over i was therefore under the necessity to set about transcribing the whole with great care and fidelity altering not a word nor a syllable nor even a letter of this excellent and justly admired historian  i may therefore boast with great truth that such as i found it i give it to the world uninjured unaltered unimpaired at what time this fragment was originally wrote i leave to the conjectures and investigation of the learned and ingenious neither shall i pretend to decide what period of the life and transactions of the illustrious john bull is here narrated i do not mean to indulge conjecture our historian has himself hinted that he treats of a period of that great mans existence when he was rather verging toward dotage indeed the inconsistency of his conduct as here related with the whole tenor of his former life and conversation affords but too good ground to justify our authors observation nor does even his nuptials with the young the proud the haughty and assuming miss prerogative in any way disprove but rather confirms what our author has advanced  but what above all serves to establish this fact is the visible decline of that great mans mental faculties to that degree as to allow himself to be completely deceived and led blindfold by the nurse of whom he was wont to entertain so rooted a jealousy and to permit her without opposition to employ for his steward an ignorant school boy altogether unacquainted with mankind and unskilled in business  and this at a time when johns affairs were much embroiled and his finances almost exhausted by continual expensive and vexatious litigations so that really if there was in his family one man with more wisdom experience and knowledge than another this was undoubtedly the time to have called for an exertion of his abilities  be that as it may we all know that johns great failings from his infancy were rashness and precipitancy and that he was credulous to a degree scarcely consistent with common sense these foibles exposed him sadly to the malicious and fabricated reports of talebearers gossips slanderers and liars and are prominent features of his character which our author has here most admirably depicted  i once proposed to have presented the english reader with a translation of our authors quotation from ovid but not finding myself quite equal to the task i applied to our parson who is reckoned a very pretty scholar however his version did not altogether please me and i dropped my design he for instance had translated occasus ireland and ortus the east indies this i objected to observing that although ovid might very probably have heard of the east indies yet i could not imagine that he had ever heard or read much about ireland and for this and other reasons i determined to lay aside all thoughts of an english version  i have only farther to add that although i have considered it as a pious duty which i owed to the manes of so great an historian to give his work to the public without hazarding the smallest alteration yet i am not so blinded by the brilliant merit of this celebrated writer as not to confess that many inaccuracies have crept into his work which in candor and fairness we ought surely to attribute to his not having had sufficient leisure before his death to reduce it into a state of finished correctness we must therefore view this little fragment of history as the precious and spirited sketch of a great painter which had not yet received the last and most corrective strokes of his pencil and where unhappily for mankind too few of the wished for pentimenti appear and where still more unhappily the ample canvas is left unfilled with the grand and glorious composition  if the perusal of this curious and interesting fragment should afford as much entertainment and satisfaction to the public as it has done to me i shall esteem myself amply rewarded for all my trouble in the publication  peregrine pinfold grubhatch april  0      the dedication to the rt hon william pit first lord of the treasury and chancellor of the exchequer etc etc etc most sublime and wonderful sir i once intended to have given to the public the following fragment of the history of that most excellent and eminent tradesman john bull esquire without seeking for any great or powerful patron under whose protection it might be ushered into the world with greater luster and eclat i had indeed almost persuaded myself that so authentic an history of that great man written by so admirable an author as sir humphry polesworth whose character as an able and faithful historian has been long established beyond all the effort of cavil and criticism could not require any such extraordinary recommendation to a nation of tradesmen whose chief glory consists in having like the celebrated john bull made their way through all difficulties by a most assiduous and laborious industry  but whilst i was ruminating upon this matter it suggested itself to my imagination that it would be much more fashionable to prefix a dedication to this most inestimable work  fashion sir which has such influence over great minds at once determined me and i could not help recollecting with pleasure that even you yourself was during last session of parliament prompted by this powerful motive to save the national credit by paying the navy and victualling billholders at par which no other consideration on earth but fashion could have induced you to have done  this sir has also prevailed upon me to attempt this daring measure of dedication but how to approach you in terms of adequate eulogy is that which creates my greatest difficulty i am sensible that i cannot possibly say any thing very new upon a subject where you yourself and so many other ingenious statesmen and orators have been exhausting all the most pompous expressions and fulsome figures to bestow praise  in this dangerous situation coming over t lfsame ground i am afraid i may ntly incur the reproach of plagism sir richard hill for instance that sublime prophet preacher and poet has unhappily anticipated a very grand idea which i had formed concerning you and which indeed neither he nor i need to plume ourselves much upon since it must be obvious and will naturally occur to every one who will give themselves a moments reflection i mean that sublime idea by him so beautifully expressed that old england and the son of old chatham must fall together it is indeed a very true but a very mortifying consideration to think that both these melancholy events cannot be at any great distance durum sed levius fit patientia quidquid corrigere est nefas   but great sir allow me to say that however true and however sublime this idea yet was it extremely imprudent in our friend sir richard to have mentioned this matter in so public an assembly when it is well known that there is one person in the kingdom still greater than yourself who may have taken the alarm at this position and who i verily believe would be the most miserable of mankind did he consider you as a fixture to the premises not moveable at pleasure the very essence of authority for which he has been struggling with so much zeal vigor and duplicity ever since you was born  besides by thus divulging the grand arcanum of the empire the worthy baronet has exposed us to our enemies who i have no doubt should you fall would be ready to invade us by sea and land nay perhaps by air thus rendering by means of balloons our insular situation no security against our aerostatic foes  but while i thus descant upon your amazing utility to the state i forget the principal purport of this dedication which was to declare to you that you may depend upon me as being attached to you and you alone for the rest of my life unless any thing of greater advantage than your patronage should tempt me to seek for protection elsewhere in which case i am sure even your little knowledge of mankind will prevent you from expecting any farther friendship from me indeed almost all of your present fast friends may from past experience teach you this important lesson the treasurer of the navy after trying all parties clings to you as most useful to himself and to the state the lord chancellor lord gower the duke of richmond the rat catcher and all lord norths quondam band of illustrious contractors understand this maxim completely and permit me to add the greatest of all examples virtuous and immaculate sir that you yourself when interest and ambition lead the way can wheel from privilege to prerogative with a crane neck on a new principle by letters patent under the great seal and what was so well said of a former popular minister in this country may with equal justice be applied to your immaculate self  now he will command and now obey bellows for liberty today and roars for power tomorrow   but again i forget myself on this bewitching subject  i forget that i write a dedication and allow myself to be hurried down the rapid stream of dissertation permit me only to add in your own classical and elegant style that if i have missed any portion of praise i should have bestowed i do assure you it was not from any intention of blinking this favorite subject  consider it great sir as a mark of my impotence rather than any failure of my desires   i have the honor to be with the most profound veneration and adoration divine and immaculate sir your most devoted and obsequious servant peregrine pinfold

history being now arrived at that period of the history of the admirable and inimitable john bull which teems with the greatest and most interesting events of that great mans life i should think myself perfectly inexcusable if in imitation of other celebrated historians i did not here pause in order to inform my gentle reader that i am highly sensible of the dignity and importance of my subject and that no pains have been wanting on my part to search for truth wherever she could be found i have not only examined every author who has treated of these complicated transactions but i have conversed with many persons of great consequence in john bulls own family and have compared their accounts with what i found narrated in the annals and other authentic records of the times carefully rejecting what appeared to me either false or spurious  barely to mention the numberless volumes which i have found it necessary to consult  the pamphlets magazines newspapers  speeches never spoken  statutes never understood those which have been repealed and those which ought never to have passed  petitions remonstrances representations and addresses  the ballads songs squibs and epigrams  barely to enumerate these learned authorities would form a catalogue as voluminous as my history itself and might appear in me an effect of extreme ostentation and a vain parade of science which i would at all times wish to avoid  whether i have succeeded in accomplishing this great and important task with skill and ability becomes not me to determine but i shall certainly await the decision of a well informed public with a long and respectful silence  chapter i john bulls age  his pensive and sensible soliloquy  some prominent features of his character described  john bull was now arrived at that time of life when people begin to suspect that some of the follies incident to human nature may not improperly be imputed to a sort of premature dotage be that as it may there was no person of acute penetration but might perceive that this great and good man was rather verging toward the wane of life  the tedious irksome and unsuccessfull lawsuit which he had carried on with his ungrateful and rascally tenants in the west country who in order to cast john had been supplied both with cash and with counsel by his old and inveterate enemy louis baboon and others had fretted john to the very guts and then the disgraceful manner in which that business had been compromised by malagrida his late steward had hurt his feelings very much for to say truth john was even as humane a good hearted fellow as you would see amongst a thousand he was frequently seen walking in a pensive mood backwards and forwards through his hall at bullocks hatch and was often overheard muttering to himself somewhat to the following purposse  zounds my people might at least have taken some care of those poor tenans of mine in the west country who really befriended my cause but to leave them to be turned out of their farms  to be dragged from their houses and homes nay even to have many of their throats cut by those inhuman and lawless banditti their neighbors appears to me a most shocking business  oh john bull  john bull thou art sadly disgraced by thy servants  but damn it what could i expect from that infamous hardened scoundrel malagrida  i suppose he found it necessary for himself that matters should be made up  no doubt he and his associate that supple loon harry mac bumbo  have filled their pockets by it  well i do really think one of the best things ever my poor wife did for me was the dismissing of those knaves from my service i know the nurse has a sort of sneaking kindness for that fellow malagrida for he has a cursed artful wheedling tongue can flatter ye by the hour and lie like the very devil  when it serves his purpose  for my own part i cannot say i ever had a good opinion of the dog  i like people of my own temper  fair open and above board nothing hidden or concealed at the same time i must confess i am so far of the nurses way of thinking that it appears to me a very ridiculous thing to see my old friends boreas and young renard so cordial and shaking hands together after giving one another the lie so often in my wifes hearing and calling one another all the bad names they could invent this to be sure is somewhat very extraordinary and almost convinces me that these gentry fall in and fall out just as their own interest directs them without much minding my good or that of my family i believe verily they are all rogues together that i take to be the plain english of it  not but that i must needs confess i think both boreas and renard are very clever fellows as any ever i had within my doors  boreas i always took to be a good humoured droll facetious fellow with a vast of wit great parts and great experience in my affairs and had always a deal to say for himself he was once as well with the nurse as any man alive that is while the obeyed all her orders implicitly much against his own inclination but now i know she hates him like the devil for his junction with renard and the more he acts like a man of honor in his new connection she will like him the worse  for she is a proud obstinate vindictive old b  as ever existed well hang her if i care a damn whether she is pleased or no if they agree so as to manage my affairs to good purpose for i am sure they never required more care attention and ability than at present to get me out of the cursed scrape i am now in for which i have to thank her pride and obstinacy and be damned to her leading me in to all this foolish absurd litigation with such a set of rascally ungrateful scoundrels  and now i have got a complete verdict against me with exorbitant costs of fuit and where all this immense sum is to come from god only knows  thus john went on in a soliloquy that had no end when he was in these gloomy pensive moods and these recurred but too frequently of late for he really felt his situation grievous unsuccessful in his lawsuit and up to the eyes in debt what was his only confort and i sincerely believe he felt it as a real comfort at this time was to think that his affairs were now both in active and able hands for although he was at first somewhat hurt at the sudden coalition of boreas and renard  yet he was soon reconciled to it and used to confess what was true that it was very much his own temper to forgive injuries and forget animosities  i can easily suppose says he that being both open frank and good humoured they have agreed to meet with some mutual friends over a bottle and to shake hands and forget all former quarrels  besides says john my wife who is a very discreet sensible woman has a high opinion of them both and has frequently told me she was perfectly sure that it was their sincere affection for me that prompted them to so unexpected a reconciliation for that they could not bear to see my affairs so bungled and bedeviled as they were by that sad dog malagrida and his profligate associate harry mac bumbo with young pam his apprentice such was the language which john bull used to hold once and again on this subject but alas his satisfaction and peace of mind were not long lived as we shall see by the sequel of this useful and authentic history  for there it will be found that though john bull was as sensible and as well meaning a tradesman as any you would wish to see or converse withal and one who understood his own business thoroughly and had a sort of a smatter of every thing  yet had he a most unfortunate temper for his own interest by which means he often marred the best concerted plans and even so it happened now john with a very large share of good sense was of all mankind the most credulous you could by art and persuasion and a competent portion of effrontery make him swallow down any thing however absurd and improbable this unlucky temper had made john the constant dupe of every quack of every profession who could get acquainted with him should any man say and assert it boldly that he could go into a quart bottle john would immediately give ear to it ay and would have rode or run a hundred miles to have seen this admirable trick performed if another would pretend that he could pay off all his debts in the course of a few years john would gape and listen to him with the greatest attention  this foible of johns was well known in the family and not this foible only otherwise it might have passed unnoticed as not being attended with any very bad consequences but added to this john was of that violent and precipitate temper that without the least examination into the reasonableness or truth or probability of what he heard he would immediately set to work and enter upon the execution of any new project with as much ardour and zeal as if he had the best authority for it nor would he hear a single syllable from any friend who advised him to think of the matter and to take time to deliberate and consider what he was about many a scoundrel had taken great advantage of these failings to their own emolument and johns disgrace yet he never grew wiser from experience but the next comer that would talk beg enough and boast of his own knowledge and talents was sure to meet the most favorable reception from john who swallowed every species of rodomontade as if it had been gospel and never would give himself time to reflect on the consequences of such egregious folly and nonsense  chap ii boreas and renard set themselves in good earnest to arrange john bulls affairs short history of the east country clerks  their extreme vigilance and avarice described  serious intention to cleanse the counting house which is prevented by john bulls nurse  not only the senfible and thinking part of john bulls own family but likewise all the neighbors to a man agreed that he had been extremely lucky in having his affairs put into such able hands as those of boreas and renard and those who really wished him well were happy in congratulating him upon this event an event which he owed entirely to the good sense prudence and discretion of mrs bull who in every action of her life had shown great dignity and independence and an unremitting zeal for her husbands welfare  nobody knew better than her the embarrassed situation of johns affairs and it was universally allowed that she could not have put them into better or abler hands than into those of boreas and renard who to their talents and experience added great zeal to exert themselves in arranging johns finances in settling his books ballancing his accounts and in extending and regulating his trade but what most of all required their immediate attention was the strange business and abuses that had crept into johns counting house where a set of his clerks had been carrying on a rare spot of work and finding that john was too much engaged in law to give them any great attention they had entered into the saddest scenes of peculation plunder knavery and oppression that ever were heard of in a christian country these fellows contrived a plan by which they thought they might be considerable gainers without hurting john in the smallest degree observing therefore that there was a set of lazy lubbardly eastcountry squires who were not cleverly supplied with johns goods and who had also many commodities the produce of their farms which they imagined would be useful to john in return they proposed to take the carrying on this traffic off johns hands to free him from the trouble and expense of it promising at the same time to bring the whole produce and profits to bullocks hatch by which not only they but also john himself would reap very great advantage  this project pleased john hugely and his wife still more for the ladies are always captivated by wonderful adventures and romantic and difficult exploits which i am convinced may have been partly the cause of their great and ardent desire of traveling into scotland with so much rapidity and eagerness as has often happened in former times  john bull and his wife were therefore perfectly agreed in granting to these same crafty clerks an exclusive privilege to carry on this traffic with the aforesaid squires to work went the clerks with a greedy industry and traded away at a vast rate till they acquired great riches and a greater name then it was that many of the young servants about johns family wished to be sent out that they also might have opportunities of pushing their fortunes and accordingly great numbers of sprightly younkers were sent who being extremely intent upon the neatest way of filling their purses they bethought themselves that trade was not the only method by which large fortunes could be acquired but that it might be to the full as good and as expeditious a way to get rid of the eastern squires altogether by foul or by fair means no matter which and so to take possession of their estates for themselves  this succeeded to a miracle for in a short space of time our spirited younkers stabbed some shot others poisoned sold imprisoned betrayed bribed bullied and trampled down to such a pitch that they made themselves absolute masters of whole parishes and so powerful and so rich were they become by this management that nobody in that part of the country and far less at bullockshatch dared to say a word against them or find any fault whatever with their proceedings  in this way you would often see strange lowlived fellows such as cheesemongersboys waiters at taverns alehousekeepers sons and the like after they had been some years in the east country and being what the scots call sharp loons they would pillage and peculate and plunder and cheat their poor oppressed tenantry to such a degree that in the course of two or three years they would return to bullockshatch with great evergrown fortunes where you might often have seen them strutting about the hall and the parlours and giving themselves incredible airs as if john bull himself had been nothing compared with them nay they were even so amazingly pert and forward from their success that they would have had the impudence to take out a gold pass key which they usually brought home with them and wore in their breeches pocket with which they would at times turn the latch of mrs bulls chamber door and walk in with the greatest ease and familiarity and would then set themselves down upon the first seat that came in their way without so much as saying with your leave or by your leave if mrs bull took no notice of them it was nothing to those gentry if she or any of her servants spoke to them they would begin and chatter away as fast as any of the family could do for their hearts or souls  now it so happened that just at this time those cunning clerks were running a fine career of rapine perfidy and peculation greatly to their own emolument but to the eternal disgrace of john bull and his family in so much that not only johns wife family and friends but likewise all the neighbors were crying shame upon him for not better regulating the conduct of his servants there seemed therefore to be an universal desire in the family to see an end put to these sad scenes of plunder and oppression devastation and ruin  but nobody was more sensible of the necessity of a reform than boreas and renard mr whigman the steward a very honest man had it also much at heart and promised all his assistance to carry on this measure nor did any one about the family pretend more zeal for it than johns nurse a person of a very singular character who in order to indulge in one favorite passion could with pleasure sacrifice to it every consideration and completely disguise every other feeling of her mind to this ruling passion was owing the part we shall now see her play in johns affairs the extraordinary means she used to prevent the proposed reform and the curious steps she took to overset mr whigman boreas renard and the rest of johns ablest and most trusty servants  chap iii birth parentage and education of john bulls nurse  she is enraged but dissembles her anger  she determines to trip up the heels of johns best servants and thus to gratify her revenge  before i proceed to this part of my authentic history it is very necessary for the better understanding of future events that i should here relate a few particulars respecting john bulls nurse and the great sway she bore in his family  mrs herenhausen for that was the name of the nurse was by the fathers side of german extraction and of an exceeding good family both by father and mother and very sensible was she of it herself and very vain of such preeminence her father died when she was yet a child and so the care of her education fell to her mother and to one sawney macthane a queer proud pompous and pedantic fellow formerly of sister pegs family this task sawney undertook with great pleasure and instilled many of his own extravagant and fantastic notions into the girls head  by telling her that she might expect one day or another to have great power in john bulls family and how she ought to manage to drive or lead him  and how she ought to have all his servants of her own choosing and never to permit either john or his wife to make choice of any and if ever it so happens said sawney that they should claim such privileges you should never rest night or day till you can get them dismissed and new ones put in their places for that is the only rule for maintaining absolute power in johns family and indeed it must be confessed that this maxim of sawneys was not a bad one for procuring and maintaining power in any private family  it fell out just as sawney had foretold for he like many more of pegs family was endued with a curious talent called the second sight in short the nurse got a place in johns house and she so improved it what from her own natural temper what from sawneys instructions that she soon acquired great sway there and her word passed for a law amongst all the servants who stood much in awe of her and cringed curtsied and bowed to her more than they did to john bull himself  this naturally increased the nurses pride and high notions of her own dignity and importance and sawneys maxim respecting the management of the servants had made such an impression upon her mind that it was never absent from her imagination so that from the love of sway and john and his wifes easy tempers the old woman was become extremely insolent imperious and so obstinate withal that you might well see she had a good portion of the german blood in her veins  from this arrogance and pride she had first engaged john in that fatal lawsuit with his tenants in the west country her cursed obstinacy was the cause of its being carried on and her damned passion for choosing every person in johns service was the reason why she also took upon her to name johns lawyers and attorneys and so furnished him with as complete a set of rogues and pettyfoggers as any poor litigious man was ever blessed with  never was there a plainer or clearer case than that of johns and if it was necessary to go to law which many sensible men thought neither necessary nor prudent yet certainly the action being once brought and the suit commenced every one must acknowledge john was confoundedly ill used by his counsel who run him to immoderate expense without having genius or capacity and without even inclination to take one decisive step that might bring this affair to a fortunate issue  however all those rare gentry were the choice of the nurse and therefore though john growled he was determined to see it to an end but mrs bull being at length heartily tired and complaining most grievously of the immoderate expense she was fully determined to bring matters to a speedy conclusion  and the nurse seeing she could not help herself employed malagrida to compromise the affair which he did in so scandalous and bungling a manner as both to disgust mr and mrs bull which occasioned his disgrace and dismission from his service  then it was that old boreas and renard determined gloriously to save john and the family from more mischief by making up all their former quarrels and forgetting or forgiving past injuries mrs bull who was as well conditioned a woman as ever lived was extremely happy at this reconciliation for she saw the great advantage it would be of to her husbands affairs but john himself was not near so clear about it and used to reason and growl concerning it exactly in the manner we have described above sometimes he thought it perfectly right sometimes he thought it quite wrong and alleged that it was highly indecent and improper for two goodnatured men to make up their former quarrels in order to serve him and his family  mrs bull however in this matter judged much more dispassionately and sensibly and knowing the great merit of the parties she strongly recommended their being employed in the future settlement of johns affairs which was accordingly done  it is not easy to conceive how much the nurse was enraged at this proceeding for though she had been made privy to it and had coldly assented yet she had not been the person to propose the measure in short the proposition came from mrs bull to whom she had a very great dislike as we shall see more fully hereafter and although she had borne her no ill will whatever still it was mrs bulls and not her own proposal  however as she was from her infancy a perfect mistress of dissimulation she pretended entire satisfaction and acquiescence with all the family arrangements now taking place affected great good humor and put on the air of complete reconciliation and complacency  all this time however she harbored vengeance in her mind  she vowed revenge for being naturally extremely vindictive she waited with impatience a favorable opportunity when she might put her designs into execution and soothe her implacable resentment as we shall see by the sequel of this eventful history  chapter iv the nurse makes choice of pam as the instrument of her vengeance  his education and character  he converses with mrs bull  is disconcerted at his cool reception  is comforted by his cousin trim stutter  the nurse immediately fixed her eyes upon a young lad bred in johns comptinghouse as a fit instrument for her purposed revenge and so he was a very proper agent for her present purposes the young man i mean whose name was pam was son to namby pamby an eminent quack who had practiced in the neighborhood with great success and had acquired thereby a mighty reputation for cures in desperate cases certain it is that he was a very impudent presumptuous and pompous fellow and used to harangue the multitude with great effect so that they would stand with their mouths open and swallow down for gospel all his hubble bubble jargon  if says he there are any distempers raging in america i will cure them by ordering some large doses of my pills to be sent over to germany  this sort of rodomantade nobody understood and to be sure nobody could understand  and yet it was swallowed down with wonderful avidity by the populace who admired the bold asseverations of the man and even gave him credit for his unparralelled effrontery such was the fire of a most promising son who if he had been bred to his fathers profession would have outstripped any empiric of any age or country  never was youth so well calculated by nature for this important science nobody was better qualified for the happy practice of every trick and deceit requisite for succeeding in this ingenious profession no body could have distributed the pill or nostrum with a better grace or more selfsufficiency nobody could have better amused the multitude with founding sentences equally devoid of sense or argument but there is a peculiarity of fate attends every man so that instead of being brought up to the external stage it so fell out that young pam for so his name was familiarly contracted was bound apprentice to a grocer  but this crafty youth aspiring to greater things and feeling in himself the seeds of a towering treachery and chicane soon broke his apprenticeship and john bull for his fathers sake for he had cured him of a bad rupture gave the lad a very snug birth in his comptinghouse where he was put under the immediate and instructive tuition of one harry macbumbo and he together with his preceptor had been aiding and abetting in framing the late infamous compromise respecting the long litigated affair of the west country tenantry  young pam of whom we shall have occasion to speak more at large hereafter was a youth of pregnant parts and as i have before observed had excellent talents for haranguing the multitude though i am apt to think they were much overrated and that his own view of them was through a large magnifying medium add to this he enjoyed a very handsome portion of superciliousness great arrogance great obstinacy great pomposity of expression together with great craft cunning duplicity and meanness of mind  to these were joined a preposterous ambition not for power but for the mere shadow and semblance of it to gratify this strange equivocal passion he would have sacrificed every consideration human or divine  to enjoy this phantom there was no degree of meanness he would not submit to nor did he feel sore at the necessity of flattering fawning and crouching to those who were in possession of the real object of his desires  such was the person fixed upon by the nurse for the management of her proposed enterprise when time should have properly matured matters for action for which she waited with a fever of impatience nor was the youth and inexperience of pam any serious objection in her eyes for what she required was implicit obedience without either reflection or knowledge  she also communicated her secret intentions to some other chosen associates among whom was one surly a leading conspirator to whom it is said pam owed his present promotion having been recommended by him as the most proper tool for such a transaction  surly was by nature formed for a conspirator of a stern and capricious turn of mind he was as shakespeare phrases it fit for treason stratagem and spoil and took upon himself the great direction of this disgraceful business  things were now beginning to ripen and the nurse and surly had settled their plan the nurse therefore sent for pam informing him of what great things she would do for him if he would undertake this business the boys head was perfectly turned with this unexpected piece of good fortune by which he saw plainly that he should have the appearance of enjoying great power and preeminence in the family  accordingly he did not require a moment to consider of what was prudent and proper for him to do or what he really was able for  all that was perfectly out of the question and his usual presumption determined him at once to embrace this tempting offer of the nurse  she finding she had hit upon the fittest tool in the world for her purpose advised him to go without loss of time to mrs bulls apartment and call upon her to exert herself in concerting and carrying through a complete reform and regulation of those clerks who had taken upon themselves the transactions of the east country trade  pam went accordingly and executed his commission with a good grace he told mrs bull that such a licentious conduct in a set of clerks ill became that character for humanity and that reputation for regularity which mr bull had acquired in the trading world that it was a great disgrace upon him and upon the whole family and that for his part he wished of all things to see a proper reform set on foot not a trivial enquiry a palliative or half measure but a strong manly and decided determination to stem that torrent of villainy and abuse of power which were become shameful not only in the eyes of mr bull and his family but also in those of all the neighbors  renard happened to be in mrs bulls chamber when pam held this discourse and said heartily openly and ingeniously that he was truly ashamed he had never yet stirred in a business which he felt so essentially necessary to the reputation and prosperity of mr bull and the house and as one of his confidential secretaries he reckoned it his duty to prepare and lay a plan before mrs bull for her opinion and approbation  accordingly comes mr renard in a few days with his plan and a very sensible and well digested one it was and extremely well calculated for the purpose  pam was present when renard read it over to mrs bull and was chuckling and perfectly happy to think he had now got renard to propose an affair which he was fully convinced would ruin him for ever mrs bull he knew had a little penchant toward the present establishment and he was in the highest hopes that she would reject the plan proposed by renard which plan he thought would throw him into perfect disgrace with john bull his family and counting house  besides pam well knew that many of mrs bulls servants were clearly in the interest of the east country clerks from motives of selfinterest and from douceurs which they had either touched or were in hopes of touching nay it was even shrewdly suspected in the family that the nurse herself and some of her nearest connections had at times felt something of an itching palm and that she had no greater aversion than her neigbours to the luster of oriental gewgaws of which little frailties female minds are wonderfully susceptible how far this may have been the case at present i will not take upon me to determine but if it was so it must be allowed that upon this as well as on other occasions she perfectly understood how to dissemble for she not only agreed to the necessity of a reform but even approved of the proposed plan as effectual  pam was however egregiously mistaken with respect to mrs bull who saw with her usual good sense that trifling regulations would not do the business and that it required such vigorous measures as pam himself had proposed and renard had planned  never was poor wretch so humbled and so crest fallen as was mr pam when he heard mrs bulls sentiments upon this subject he left the apartment quite in despair having no consolation remaining but in the support and obstinacy of the nurse  just as he was going through the lobby with a heavy heart fortunately for him he met with one trim stutter a near relation of his own to whom he briefly related what had passed trim who was a man of intrigue bid pam be of good cheer for so long as he had the patronage and protection of the nurse he said he had nothing to fear i will go to her this very night says trim there is a private back way i have of getting at her apartment and i will then propose a scheme by which i think renards plan may yet be defeated and he and his friends be laid on their backs  chap v how trim stutter mounts the back stairs and gets into the nurses private apartments the curious conversation which there ensued a conversation well worth the strictest attention of statesmen and others  trim was as good as his word  as soon as it was dark away he goes to the back door which leads to a pair of back stairs that go up to the nurses apartment groping his way as well as he could at last with the help of a dark lanthorn he finds out the place and being very thin and lank he squeezes himself up the narrow winders with great stillness and alacrity having now reached the nurses apartment he made an apology for disturbing her at that unseasonable time of night and signified that nothing but the importance of the business could have made him take the liberty of approaching her person but that being extremely attached to her he could do no less than represent the danger which threatened her what what said the nurse as her manner was when she wished to have any thing repeated perhaps on this occasion she might have perfectly understood her informer but she was happy to hear the repetition of a subject so agreeable  what madam said trim can your ladyship for trim was a very courtly person and understood flattery well be ignorant that should this plan of renards take place for the reform of the east country clerks your power in this family will be annihilated for ever  nurse what what  trim dont you plainly perceive madam that this plan puts it out of your ladyships power ever to name any of the servants for the management of the east country business the whole is put into the hands of a few of renards particular friends and they will have so much in their power and so many good things to give away that it must establish on the surest footing both renards and boreass influence in the comptinghouse and in the family insomuch that nobody will ever pay court to your ladyship again and you must remain a cipher for ever after  nurse very just mr stutter very just indeed but how can i prevent this evil what is to be done  trim nothing so easy madam go to mrs bull and let her know that in such a case you can by a long established right which you enjoy absolutely stop the further progress of this abominable plan  nurse that is true mr stutter i know i can but i do not like it you know i have already approved of it and therefore to fly directly in its face would not have a very good look for a person of my family and character  no that will not do but if you can suggest any indirect means of stifling this plan i am very well inclined to adopt that method  trim perfectly right ant please your ladyship but there is still another way which is indirect and consequently better suited to your disposition what i would propose is that your ladyship should give me a few lines to mrs bulls servants in her upper apartment where renards plan now lies and i know that with your authority and a few shiners properly applied together with promises of some of those pretty colored ribbons white sticks and other toys which you used to make presents of i shall get her servants to break their words betray their trusts and throw all the papers out of the window and make them give out that they have been lost or mislaid god knows how  nurse i thank you my good cousin stutter this is an excellent idea of yours  but what is next to be done for this fellow renard is indefatigable you may depend upon it he will have another plan of the same kind prepared and laid before mrs bull who in the humor she is now in will again approve of it and recommend it to john  trim certainly madam all this will be done if your ladyship permits it but lord how easy is it with your power and influence to prevent any such thing  nurse how how mr stutter i am all impatience  trim how why set whigman boreas and renard and all their adherents a packing without any ceremony  nurse yes that i would do with all my heart mr stutter but what would john and what would his wife say to it  trim as to bull madam you well know what a clodpated numsculled beastly fellow it is surely you have not lived so long in this family without learning how easily he may be hoodwinked and convinced that black is white  nurse for godssake explain yourself for i will do any thing from hatred and revenge  trim ay madam these are indeed princely passions and ought to be indulged  was i in your ladyships place i would never forgive those two infamous scoundrels boreas and renard for basely forgetting past injuries and daring to coalesce for the good of bulls affairs this shows more than any thing what damned milky blooded villains they are i beg pardon for swearing in your ladyships presence but i always grow warm on this subject  nurse but good mr stutter i pray you point out my path to vengeance and let me know how i must manage that beastly monster bull   trim the easiest thing in the world madam i shall have a set of profligate hirelings taken into pay in order to spread a parcel of the most confounded lies that ever were invented i will have rumors carried into every coffeehouse tavern and alehouse that bull frequents for instance i will have it given out that renard had formed a plot against your long established authority in this family and that he whigman and boreas had conspired to annihilate your power that in order to do this more effectually they were going to have assumed to themselves all the power and possessions of the east country clerks and that they were going by their new plan under pretense of reformation to have seized and confiscated all their property to have stolen the written agreement formerly made signed sealed and delivered and that this was only a prelude to their making away with every other agreement deed and charter in the possession of john bull by which he holds his lands liberties and franchises i shall also have it given out that this same renard was absolutely caught picking the lock of bulls strongroom where the titledeeds were lodged and even the greatest of all deeds by old glorious styled magna farta and that if it had not been for your ladyships watchful eye and maternal care of johns concerns there is little doubt but the villain would have made away with the whole and got clear off  nurse this is a most admirable stratagem sweet mr trim there is no end to your wonderful fertility in expedients i have no doubt but this will go down and succeed with bull for he is most comfortably stupid  trim go down madam i will pledge myself it shall go down for if he should not believe it at first as to be sure it is somewhat incredible yet i will have a set of fellows hireed ycleped garreteers and scriblers who shall force it down his throat so that he shall either swallow or choke upon it  nurse ha ha ha my dear cousin stutter though i am very poorly with a bilious complaint yet i must laugh at your way of expressing yourself there is no resisting your sterling humor i now see my way distinctly i shall get complete revenge of those worthless scoundrels who wanted to govern this family by means of mrs bull forsooth as if her word was to be a law no truly this family and all mankind shall see that mrs herenhausen is somebody  trim somebody madam why if you know yourself you are every body and every thing and should and shall absolutely command this family from head to foot  nurse my dear cousin you shall know all the feelings of my soul i will not attempt to conceal any of them from you love of sway desire of revenge and a little squeeze of malice here and there by way of relish are what i like with all my heart and therefore to indulge these at present i would give up any consideration whatever i would even sacrifice bull and his affairs and allow them to go to the devil i could be reconciled to my most detested enemies so they could be aiding to my present purpose on such an irresistible occasion i could embrace with cordiality the once loathsome jack squintum  the blasphemer of his god the libeller of his king and the traducer of my mothers fair fame  trim very noble very generous indeed madam every word every feeling shows what a great soul you are possessed of  nurse but mr stutter allow me to say there is still one great desect in our plan for though we may and i trust we have contrived to blindfold bull completely yet we have a much more difficult task to reconcile his wife to our plan for she no doubt is a sensible woman and is most sincerely attached from good opinion both to boreas and renard  and consequently may take their dismission extremely ill out in this case perhaps she may dispute the point with me and if she gets john to side with her he may play up old gooseberry with us for you well know what a furious ungovernable animal it is   trim i perfectly foresee this difficulty and do think with your ladyship that it is not impossible but mrs bull may opiniatre the matter a little  and no doubt this requires management but mrs bull is not inflexible she may be coaxed  we must keep well with her servants  veils madam veils will do a great deal  and then as i before observed your ladyship has so many pretty things to give  honors and preferments  and increase of wages and to the maidservants ribbons stars and garters and such like toys with these you may depend upon it we shall bring mrs bull over to our interest  nurse i have great confidence in your opinion mr stutter  but if i should be disappointed what is next to be done  trim why then madam there is but one way   nurse what is it mr stutter what is it  trim to poison or to stab her at once  nurse alas mr stutter that i would do with all my heart but what would the coroners inquest say to it  trim pooh pooh madam leave that to me i will settle that matter without much trouble in the first place when the murder is done i will lay down the bloody weapon by her side and shall hire some physicians and ruffians the former of whom will swear that mrs bull was perfectly out of her mind and fit only for bedlam the latter will swear that they saw her put an untimely end to her own existence  nurse you quite transport me mr stutter i long to be in at the death but what will bull say to all this  perhaps he will ride restive and have the matter fully investigated  trim bull madam  lord how little your ladyship is acquainted with the character of bull i will engage to convince him that his wife was not faithful to his bed that to my certain knowledge she had been too familiar with and too fond of both boreas and renard  that she had a strong propensity to your portly corpulent men like john himself and that she was often heard to confess that there was no resisting the persuasive eloquence of either of her two favorites bull who is naturally abundantly credulous will give ear to all this and i shall confirm his suspicions by a thousand circumstances  so that i doubt not but he will soon damn her to hell for an abominable strumpet and think himself extremely lucky in having got rid of her  nurse that is a very happy idea besides i have bethought myself of a way to conciliate johns affections and good wishes and to rouse his apprehensions for you know cousin though i have the most sovereign contempt for this great blustering oaf yet i have always pretended vast regard and affection for him and great zeal for his welfare now i doubt not but he is completely gulled by my professions and as he is a good natured beast i have great reason to think that he has a tenderness and good will toward me taking advantage of these i will give it out that being totally disgusted with the insolent behavior and contumely of mrs bull that i have come to the determination to quit his family for good and never more to set foot within his door i will go further for i ll have a boat ordered to come to bullocks hatch stairs as if i was ready to set off god knows i have no such intention but i know this will move john and many of his old servants will take the alarm and begin seriously to regret my departure fearing that matters may go worse without me  their compassion and their fears once up we may then venture to do with mrs bull what we please and i am convinced we may then get all inquest concerning her madness and death properly made up   trim a most admirable plan indeed madam your ladyship has hit this off wonderfully well you ladies have more invention at these little strokes of intrigue than we men have but now we are upon these subjects will you permit me to ask your ladyship if you have any other cause of resentment to the present set of servants beside the attempt they have now made to deprive you of your usual influence  nurse yes surely mr stutter i have many good reasons for the rooted aversion i bear them did they not come in in a manner selfappointed through the influence of mrs bull do you think a woman of my dignity ought to bear that interference with my authority but this is not all  were they not men of abilities in whom john and his whole family placed great confidence and were they not determined to do what was right and useful without implicitly obeying my commands could any mortal in my situation bear this  trim abominable indeed madam  but boreas was surely accustomed to obey you and would doubtless have continued to have done so   nurse you are quite mistaken cousin he had already declared he had seen his error respecting the conduct of the west country lawsuit and had determined to act as he judged most expedient for the advantage of johns affairs you cannot imagine how much i tried him upon this subject i next tried to sow dissension between him and renard but the fellow pretended strict honor and would not break his promise curse on his honor i think he should have laid that aside where i was concerned but i will now be even with him and his colleague  they may plume themselves now if they please upon their strict honor  trim to be sure it was perfectly ridiculous in them to think of honor  but all the world must allow them abilities   nurse confound their abilities it is for these i hate them i hate abilities wherever i find them they always make men proud and independent the things in the world i most detest in those who fill subordinate stations  trim well madam i can venture to assure you that my cousin pam with all his abilities has not the least idea of dignity or independence i shall be quite deceived if your ladyship does not find him to have a very mean submissive and pliant mind quite suited to your purposes he certainly has ambition but then it is altogether of that grovelling kind which does not court power but merely the semblance of it with leave to boast of it and for that supreme indulgence i promise you he will do every thing you wish he will cringe to old surly and even though that is extremely low i will venture to say he will stoop to take any orders from your waiting maid mrs jenky  nurse upon my word cousin stutter you give me a very high character of mr pam which i do assure you impresses me with the most favorable opinion of the young man but it is now full time i should give you the messages to mrs bulls servants  chap vi extraordinary consequences of an extraordinary conversation  pams plan is burnt by mrs bull  trim recommends murder  mrs bull is saved by the preposterous vanity of pam  thus ended this very extraordinary conversation to the mutual satisfaction of both parties trim took leave in order to go and deliver his messages to mrs bulls servants and at the same time gave them to understand what they were to expect for the service required of them some of them however fought shy upon the subject and said they had promised renard to take particular care of his papers  others who were sincerely attached to boreas and renard said no harm should come to the papers if they could possibly prevent it but far the greatest part of them being naturally of the most accommodating turn of mind took trim aside and told him not to give himself any further trouble for though they had promised renard to take care of his plan yet they had such respect for the nurses opinion in all these matters  that he might rest assured the plan should never more be seen in that apartment  trim was now perfectly overjoyed he returned the following night  by the same dark path to the nurses apartment carrying along with him his cousin pam who was now made steward in the room of mr whigman and trim stutter for his good services was made one of johns secretaries along with one tim simper a poor cuckoldy kind of a fellow who knew nothing whatever of business but was placed there very malapropos to fill a gap  it might now be very properly said that the nurse was as happy as a king she therefore no longer kept any terms with whigman or boreas or renard but was determined to send them all apacking together  being however ashamed of this dirty and deceitful business she would not face the principal but sent a message by trim desiring to have the keys of the house compting house cellars pantry and larder etc delivered up to her which was immediately complied with by the parties  upon hearing of this extraordinary proceeding boreas and renard went immediately to mrs bull to enquire the cause of it she declared she knew nothing of the matter and was as much surprised as they themselves had been renard complained to her loudly of this sort of treatment and said it was singular that people going about their business with all the attention imaginable and doing every piece of drudgery should be undermined by secret influence and backstair visits and turned out of doors without a months warning or a months wages and all this without any reason assigned  pam now came by order of the nurse to pay his respects to mrs bull and to inform her of his promotion he was prodigiously elevated on the occasion and was become very high and mighty and extremely pompous  he told mrs bull that the reason of the dismission of johns late servants was their attempt to carry through the east coutury business in so absurd a manner as to ruin the whole of the poor clerks who had been engaged in that trade by confiscating their property and seizing their goods and warehouses and depriving them not only of their chartered rights but also of their possessions  but that this was not all for that john bull himself was extremely alarmed considering this only as a prelude to deprive him of all his rights and franchises whatsoever  and also taking from the nurse the power and patronage which was her due and which she had so long enjoyed in the family with the universal approbation of all good men  renard who set by and heard all this harangue was perfectly astonished at such amazing effrontery and misrepresentation from so young a dog  and opening upon him with his usual ability and eloquence he so belabored and bespattered and bedeviled him that mrs bull cried shame upon him for a worthless young cur she would have nothing to do with him  but pam who was presumption and arrogance personified  told mrs bull that he would prepare a plan for regulating the clerks and trade of the east country infinitely superior to that of renard for it was to have all the effect without any of the faults  accordingly he brought his plan to mrs bull and having read it to her both boreas and renard disapproved so much of it that mrs bull ordered it to be thrown into the fire  this however did not dismay our stripling  who was now in the secret and knew he had only to brazen it out till mrs bull was dispatched  mrs bull herself knowing the nurses character and her extreme vindictive disposition felt some forebodings of her fate and used to communicate her suspicions to renard and boreas and her other friends  nay she even charged pam to his face with having some evil intentions toward her  but like master like man they say for pam was now become a complete master of dissimulation and swore himself black in the face that there was not the least intention to touch a hair of her head  trim however insisted both with the nurse and with pam that now or never was the time for dispatching the good old lady who he insisted would thwart them in all their views and he declared his fingers were itching for her blood but pam who was young and not yet innured to murder and assassination begged of them to spare her life and having a very high opinion of his own eloquence he said he would try what that could do to bring her over to his way of thinking and truly it must be confessed that for an innocent and immaculate young creature yet unhacknied in the ways of men nobody could set about this business with a better address or with more forcible or persuasive arguments but having now all the affairs of his stewardship upon his hands it could not be supposed he could manage every thing by himself and therefore he found it necessary to employ agents to transact all those matters of bribery and corruption which he found it absolutely necessary for him to carry on in order to gain over mrs bulls servants and it must be allowed he made a very good choice of men who were every way qualified for that purpose  chap vii pams liberal and ingenious plan of bribery and corruption  character of his principle agents  it is highly necessary for the better understanding this my authentic history that i should here give a true and faithful character of those two singular agents who were appointed by young pam to the management of all that liberal and generous branch of business which is vulgarly denominated bribery and corruption this pam determined with his usual noble way of thinking to carry on upon a far more extensive and solid plan than had ever before been attempted even in the golden times of old robin  the first of his runners in rank and in talents was his former master harry macbumbo alias starvation harry alias harry hurlythrumbo alias east country harry alias north country harry  for he was a cunning rogue and like other desperados had taken various names the better to disguise himself and prevent detection he had been heretofore in the service of john bulls own sister peg where he had had the run of her kitchen but finding that fare vastly too scanty for his eager appetite and seeing nothing but starvation staring him in the face he was determined to shift his ground and look out for somewhat more lucrative he hastened therefore to a scene of action much more suitable to his talents and entered into the service of john bull and was by means of his wife placed under the direction of boreas during his stewardship macbumbo who was a sly bustling fellow soon recommended himself to boreas by assiduity activity and zeal and was by him liberally rewarded for his trouble insomuch that harry vowed attachment to his benefactor for life an oath he always readily made on such occasions  when malagrida suceeded to the stewardship he paid his court very successfully to him who finding him useful and ready at all sorts of work and that if well paid he would turn his hand to any thing be it ever so dirty he continued him in the counting house and gave him a very snug birth for which as before he swore an attachment for life to malagrida  when malagrida was dismissed by mrs bull for his abominable compromise as we have before related macbumbo did not think he was likely to be taken much notice of in future either by boreas or renard seeing that they knew him and knew exactly by what steerage he shaped his course he therefore pitched upon young pam for his future patron to whom he once more sold himself for life soul and body as thinking pam stood well with the nurse and trusting that this was far the surest and nearest road to present pay and good quarters macbumbo was a rare talkative fellow in his northern jargon and discoursed with great apparent manliness openness and boldness which was altogether to be attributed to manner for at bottom he was false and hollow he certainly had considerable talents but they were accompanied with great rashness imprudence and precipitation he was prodigal in his expenses and dissolute in his way of life so that he was always in debt and in difficulties  but as he could not live without his pleasures he was glad to procure them at any price money therefore he must have and it was his established maxim no pay no swiss it was no wonder then if macbumbo always devoted himself to the best bidder pam though yet unbacknied in the ways of men plainly perceived that macbumbo was likely to be damned useful where much dirty work was to be done  nor was pam less successful in his choice of a second agent a man whom history sensible of her own dignity stoops with incredible reluctance to describe the meanness of his mind could only be equalled by the lowness of his birth his progenitor was a melter of tallow he was reared in the service of a famous shipbuilder and never in any transaction in his life lost sight of a job he was recommended to boreas by his former master but his gratitude to him for that service never sat heavy on his stomach he improved his opportunities under boreas to great advantage for he being steward in the time of the lawsuit when great sums were annually expended there was much money to be borrowed  great fees to be paid to counsel  great bills to attorneys open table was kept for them and this occasioned a vast expense in cooks scullions firing and god knows what all  nothing of this immense detail escaped the jobbing vigilance of jack the ratcatcher for that was his name and designation he used to sweat every guinea that passed through his hands and much good bread and butter cheese and beer did he make away with besides it was shrewdly suspected that he run snips with all the butchers bakers brewers brokers and contractors of the times till he acquired a fortune more than ministerial  renard when in office wanted very much to have enquired into the state of this mans illgotten gains but boreas from friendship interfered and prevented it as to jack himself he rose up before mrs bull and her whole company and swore upon the holy evangelists that he had only pocketed a very small sum which he said he had scraped together by great penury and attention and this he did with what the irish call a very pretty presence of mind at the same time that almost every body present knew he was living in the greatest splendour and profusion whether mrs bull really gave much credit to his assertions i never could learn but this i know that few besides believed him however he was ably defended by boreas for whose veracity and disinterestedness mrs bull had the highest respect but jack like a complete scoundrel lived to turn tail on his maker and betray his liberal benefactor he had however found means to ingratiate himself much with the nurse and had received from her some marks of her favor  chap viii mrs bull proves refractory notwithstanding all the artifices of macbumbo and jack the ratcatcher  an altercation takes place between her and the nurse  a meeting of mutual friends is held at the old wrestlers  which breaks up re infecta  alarm of mrs bull  is comforted by boreas and renard  john reasons on the state of affairs  the boat trick is tried without effect  such were the runners now in the service of pam and he employed them according to their genius and talents finding mrs bull strongly bent against his appointment to the stewardship as considering him a mere schoolboy inexperienced in business bookkeeping and accounts and without knowledge of mankind he was however determined if possible to win her over to his side and so set mac bumbo and jack to work to corrupt all her servants by foul or by fair means some they bribed others they intimidated and to some they promised little annuities for life or posts or ribbons or stars or white wands and such like baubles which were all to be furnished by the nurse who had a neat assortment of this kind of gewgaws this to manly minds may appear a species of corruption that could but little avail but it should be remembered that they were not ill adapted to the maidservants and other low cattle about mrs bulls family  however all this could not move mrs bull who continued inflexible in spite of every argument that could be used with her servants or that her servants could use with her  at last it came to very severe heartburnings between her and the nurse who complained grievously that mrs bull was of a most incroaching disposition for it has been her province time out of mind to appoint johns domestics and that now mrs bull wanted most unwarrantably to arrogate the whole power to herself besides says she what fault can she find with the young man i have appointed has she any crime to lay to his charge if she has let her name it  on the other hand mrs bull protested that she did not wish to encroach on the nurse s province of appointing the servants on the contrary it would be to her a very troublesome and a very invidious task but at the same time she was obliged to keep the purse and to lay out johns cash to the best advantage and with the greatest management and economy she therefore thought it would be very hard indeed if she had not at least a negative voice and a power of representing her opinion about new servants and of saying such a person will never do i cannot trust him  which is says she all i allege with respect to pam who though i do not charge with any crime yet i must and do insist upon it that i cannot put confidence in him  in short he is too young and inexperienced he is a mere schoolboy who can know nothing of men or of affairs  now though i cannot trust to this boy surely i do not mean to name any body in his place let the nurse choose whom she pleases and if i think he is really qualified for the management of johns affairs i am sure i shall raise no objection whatever but where there is many to choose from i confess i should be very sorry to see a very bad choice made  such was the style in which both parties talked of each other and as it always happens on such occasions the more they talked the more they became irritated at length mrs bull was advised by her friends to write a civil letter to the nurse to explain her sentiments at large this she did in a very polite manner but the nurse as her temper dictated was as obstinate as a mule and would not yield a jot she however thought it requisite to give a civil answer to mrs bulls letter which she did in the most shufling and deceitful language  some mutual friends then interposed and by various meetings at the old wrestlers tried to accommodate matters between the parties but this also failed of success for they could get nothing out of the nurse but equivocal propositions couched in the most obscure terms  it was then the good old lady mrs bull began seriously to apprehend danger to herself and communicated her ideas thereon to boreas and renard  who both assured her she had nothing to fear at present because both the nurse and pam knew that her life was of the greatest importance to her husband and to the existence of the whole family  for she must surely know that she had in her possession a sum of money which could not be touched or disposed of without her consent and approbation which sum was absolutely necessary to save john from immediate bankruptcy  besides said they you have another hold over the nurse and pam which is the arrears due to the counsel and lawyers and the settlement of their business which it is well known they require annually which with their other pressing demands cannot be finally adjusted without your consent and approbation and who in case of any delay or want of punctuality in their payment and such like would bring both the nurse and john himself over the coals in the twinkling of an eye  you may therefore depend upon it nothing can be attempted against your life while you wield these weapons in your own hand  all this while john who had heard of this miff and who had not at first concerned himself much about it thinking it only a foolish squabble between two old women began now to look upon it as a more serious matter than he was aware of and felt rather uneasy about it to be sure quoth john mrs bull is my lawful wife and as such is my representative in this family and is entitled to the respect and attention of the best of them but at the same time i would not have the nurse maltreated or degraded neither she is an old friend and i must not see her wronged but i know she is damned obstinate when she takes any freak in her head o as for that one might as well try to move the great germanic empire  but continued he i dont like this huge familiarity between my wife and boreas and still worse her late gossipings with this same squire renard  hang it i am not naturally jealous neither but yet there is a wonderful sort of a flirtation goes on in that quarter  poh poh it cannot be my wife is too old and too sedate to think of these pranks in her old days  but damn it who knows she may still have a colts tooth in her head i did get such a hint from one of my best friends and one who i am sure wishes me well  just as john was running over a variety of circumstances pro and con in his own mind and trying which way the balance inclined the scale of suspicion seeming rather to proponderate  his lucubrations were all at once interrupted by a flying report that there was a boat gone up to the stairs at bullockshatch in order to take the nurse and all her luggage aboard that she might go home to her own native country  johns uneasiness and apprehensions were rather increased upon this however he plucked up a spirit and observed that if she was tired of him and his family she might go he would keep the boy george who he was very sure would be glad to stay with him this being faithfully reported to the nurse nettled the old woman not a little  and though she laid aside all thoughts of carrying the boat trick any farther lest it should be carried too far  yet there were other stratagems in store and more artillery to be played off  chap ix jemmy macossian is put at the head of a gang of thieves  he propogates falsehoods as gross and palpable as the father that begat them  some curious anecdotes of his life character and conversation  mrs rumor informs john of his wifes death  the next trick to be tried was to have a gang of lying prating thieves who were to disperse themselves in the coffeehouses taverns and alehouses and wherever john was to be seen and there to drum it eternally in his ears as how renard had been seen with mrs bull at all hours of the night and as how he had been overheard proposing to her to break open the strong room and make off with johns titledeeds and as how she being too great with renard did not seem to object  and also as how they had sometimes with them a long robeman who encouraged them in this plan by telling them that titledeeds and even magna farta itsels were nothing to signify for that they were only pieces of parchment with seals dangling to the ends of them  all this curious fabrication of falsehood misrepresentation and mischief was put under the direction of one jemmy mac ossian a very cunning crafty loon as ever sister peg bred in her garret his father had been catched tried and hanged for malpractices and maroding on the outskirts of johns lands  young hopeful had been brought up a scholar and taught his bare bottomed compatriots greek and latin at  s scotch per quarter being however a stout lad and pushing his fortune he made his way into johns kitchen where he fattened on sippets soaked in the dripping pan which he got from the maids for writing songs and talking baudy with them at last he felt a strong itch to translate his native bare broad erse into a good english dress  he came now to carry his head a little higher and got acquainted with some of the clerks of the counting house particularly jack the ratcatcher who employed him to write briefs for the counsel in the west country lawsuit at length being always awake to his own interest he got himself foisted into an east country agency by which means he acquired great wealth and was one of those who dreaded nothing so much as the regulation of those affairs by which an end might be put to pilfering peculation and perfidy  in all of which he was too deeply interested and too succefsfully engaged  this was the captain of that band of infamous storytellers who were now employed by trim and pam to spread the alarm to john and so industrious were they and so often did they repeat their fabrications that a person less credulous than john would have given some credit to them but it was not johns character to be duped by halves when he was gulled he was most completely so and on this occasion macossian and his gang were much an overmatch for him upon hearing the same thing repeated over and over again in every place  without considering the probability of what was so boldly and so roundly asserted  john exclaimed by god what every body says must be true i did suspect says he that there was some damned villiany going on and now the matter is come out as clear as day  well i do say it is impossible to know womankind i thought i could have trusted my wife with my honor with my puise with every thing dear to me and here i find that she and renard were laying their plan to cuckold me in my own house and then to run off with my titledeeds  ah john bull john bull you have made a narrow escape lord lord how deceitful is woman  nobody looks half so composed or so decent so meek or so motherly as my wife  and yet at her time of life to go astray well well this shows what opportunity and importunity will do with womankind  just as john had pronounced this wise observation  he was accosted by old mother rumor who kept the coffeehouse and who civilly asked him if his worship had heard that mrs bull was dead  dead says john what my wife  mrs bull dead yes replied mrs rumor ant please your worship your wife mrs bull is certainly as dead as harry the viiith why you astonish me says john she was in perfect health last night what did she die of nay sir as for the matter of that said mrs rumor to be sure there are various and sundry reports concerning this affair some say she died of a poplectic fit some say that the poor woman was beside herself and that she permitted a fellow of the sea upon her own body  odds bodikins quoth john i am afraid it was a fellow of the land that she permitted on her own body  be that as it may i must go and enquire into this very singular and critical event  fifth part chapter i a true narrative of mrs bulls tragical exit with the unhappy fate of her favorite sister  some remarks on her daughter and a sketch of her will  a curious account of the coroner his inquest and verdict  john bull was not in that humor at present to be much grieved at the death of his wife who as we have above related he began to harbor a very so so opinion of he therefore gave himself but little trouble to find out the cause of her sudden departure and of her sisters misfortune a catastrophe which did not seem to affect him more than it does the common run of fashionable husbands  this however is an event of which we as an authentic historian of the res gestae of those times cannot omit giving a most circumstantial account as faithfully and as correctly as it been wanted to us on the great tide of contemporary writers  the nurse trim and pam were now convinced from experience that mrs bull was far too honest too disinterested and too faithful to her husband to allow herself to be detached from what she thought his real good they therefore determined without further deliberation to bring her to an untimely end but first it was found absolutely necessary to get her to settle the two points above mentioned  for this purpose they chose to dissemble their hatred and even went so far as to cajole the good woman a piece of deceit and duplicity which cost none of them very dear  a young friend of pams of whom mrs bull was known to have a good opinion was now charged with a message to her when assurances passed of the nurses great regard for her and how far it was from her thoughts to have any bad intentions toward her with a thousand such friendly expressions   it is very difficult to say what passes in any bodys mind on most occasions but as mrs bull was a very sensible woman with an uncommon share of penetration we think it more than probable that she was not altogether blinded by those professions  however they certainly made a great impression but what with her made a much greater was the very nice and critical state of johns credit which must have suffered an irrecoverable shock if mrs bull had not given her consent to the payment of those sums of money which now lay at her disposal and further she dreaded extremely the consequences of not satisfying the counsel and other law folks lately employed in her long vexatious suit for she well knew that this sort of people could not be put off but upon the least demur might bring an action of trespass against john these considerations with the assurances given by pam and his friends made her at length come to the fatal resolution of parting with her own security and no sooner was that done but measures were instantly concerted between the nurse trim and pam how and at what time the horrible deed should be perpetrated all this being fixed the nurse sent word that she was coming to wait upon mrs bull about business of consequence she went accordingly dressed out in great parade and having talked over the business in the usual way  the nurse before she retired whispered to surly who was near her upon which he stepping forward and pulling forth a mortal instrument at one blow put a period to the existence of the best of wives  the bloody scene did not end here for there was in the room at the time a younger and favorite sister of mrs bulls  miss darling privilege who seeing the fatal blow aimed run to embrace and protect her sister to her the murderers imagined john was extremely attached and that she would do every thing in her power to prompt him to view this execrable transaction in its true colors and to punish it with severity for this reason it was that the nurse determined to get rid of her also besides she knew that this young lady had been very instrumental in instigating mrs bull to resist her wishes she therefore impressed with the deepest resentment and hoping at once to lay these formidable foes prostrate at her feet drew from her breast a stiletto with which rushing eagerly upon the mild and blooming maid she plunged the dreadful weapon into her lovely bosom she fell upon the body of her expiring sister where swooning away she was thought to be dead by every person present  and such a report was universally propagated however she was afterward found with some signs of life and being privately conveyed to the country her friends began to entertain hopes that her weakness was occasioned only by loss of blood and that with skill and care she might yet be recovered from the dreadful effects of that stunning blow which she had received  thus fell the unfortunate mrs bull one of the best of women who had bestowed true pains to retrieve her husbands embarrassed affairs and to restore them to their usual flourishing condition to which there is no doubt but she would have greatly contributed had she not thus fallen a martyr to the vindictive disposition and ruling passion of the nurse  mrs bull left behind her one daughter named reformia who though not a beauty was what may properly be called a bouncing girl she had several admirers of whom we shall have occasion to speak more fully hereafter  mrs bull bequeathed to this young lady all the savings she had made in the regulating and settling of johns affairs this patrimony was very differently spoken of some calling it a very ample fortune and others perhaps with more justice alleging that it was a very inconsiderable sum  mrs bull together with her blessing bequeathed to john a case of choice cordials which she alleged he would have great occasion for when she was no more what the particular virtues of these cordials were we have never been able to learn  the coroners inquest was now come to sit on the body of the defunct the coroner himself was a person of notorious infamy and therefore extremely fit for the present purpose  his name was lungs he was a mountebank and in his travels through foreign countries he had acquired all the effrontery and all the grimace and jesticulation of that pleasant profession  from professional habit he was extremely addicted to speechifying on all occasions  and as his contortions and writhings were ridiculous in the extreme  nobody who saw him could refrain from laughter but the derision and the contempt of the crowd made no impression upon his brazen countenance or callous mind which was dipped in gaul and steept in depravity to the very brim there was no species of vice he was not capable of so he could but guard himself against the annimadversion of the law if a murderer was wanted lungs was the man to perpetrate such a crime in the most hidden manner and with the most subtle poisons was a perjured evidence required to bolster up a bad cause lungs was the man who for money would go completely through with it and stop at nonothing in short his mind was formed for every thing base and mean and for every thing detestable this wretch had already received his cue from pam to whom he was some how allied  and having packed his inquest and called for evidence properly instructed they brought in their verdict respecting mrs bull felo de se and taking it for granted her sisteralso was dead they thought it proper to bring that in lunacy  improbable as these facts might appear to every judicious person yet certain it is that john bull either did give faith to them or seemed so to do  chap ii the nurse is taken ill is cured by a glyster of pams prescribing  the severe duty of mrs jenky the waiting maid  critical observation of the historian  i have already observed that the impatience which had seized the nurse to get rid of servants who were not altogether of her own choosing but who had been strongly recommended by the late mrs bull  and also that extreme disgust and rage which she had felt at the resistance made by mrs bull to her appointment of pam had so preyed upon her constitution that she was for sometime laboring under the dreadful effects of a lingering and bileous fever  this increasing with the irritation of fresh events had rendered her extremely costive and bound in the belly nor could she ever be prevailed upon during the servitude of mr whigman or his friends to take proper medicines for her complaints  the late sudden changes which she had so artfully contrived and so outrageously accomplished had occasioned a revulsion in her whole frame and pam seeing this encouraged the change of habit by a glyster made up after a quack receipt of his fathers  this coming powerfully in aid of the natural revulsion abovementioned failed not to procure her most copious and fetid evacuations which her physician very sagaciously foretold must do her a great deal of service indeed such was the uncommon abundance of putrid and corrupted matter that flowed from this noxious source that her apartment stunk most infamously in the noses of every one who had any sense of smelling and to that degree was the stench of corrupted corruptible and contagious faeces over the whole house that it was almost insufferable in mrs bulls apartments as well as in the nurses and absolutely pestilential from top to bottom of the back stairs john himself could not but be sensible of it but at this time the nurse and the young quack pam stood so very high in his good graces that it passed for little more than a strong and not unpleasant hautgout with poor john who never was very remarkable for having a good nose or for looking a great way before it and who on this occasion did not foresee the very bad effects and infectious distemper which such a nuisance might one day create in the family  but to return to the nurse who we left upon her closestool  the heat of the matter thus evacuated was so great and in such abundance that it caused a wonderful irritation in the orrifice and circumjacent parts so that the physician recommended the proper application of almond oil and other emolients to soften and cool the parts these were administered with great tenderness and admirable address by the waiting maid mrs jenky who though a tall awkward figure stooped to this operation with a vast deal of grace and deterity  but alas all this would not do the heat and irritation increasing the parts became extremely tender and delicate and an inflammation ensuing it was thought absolutely necessary that mrs jenky should lick with her tongue the place affected a task which she undertook and bent her long back to perform with a suppleness and plyability which excited admiration in every beholder it was however alleged that mrs jenky though long accustomed to the dirtiest of work did grudge her labor in conveying away this nauseous commodity which it is said was by her handed privately to young pam who saw it slyly disposed of in a nasty sink belonging to mrs bulls upper apartment  we hope we shall be excused this short digression from the thread of our history in order to describe the nature of the nurses complaints which we have been more particular in narrating as trivial circumstances of this nature often serve to illustrate the state of affairs in private families better and more distinctly than nobler or more splendid events  chap iii john goes to pay the nurse a visit and congratulates her upon the dismission of his late servants  she talks to john about the death of mrs bull  praises his present servants  advises him to think of looking out for another wife  and proposes a match which she thinks would fit him to a hair  john now thought that seeing all exterior forms respecting his late wife were now fully satisfied that he might go and wait on the nurse in her own apartment accordingly away steps john and having tapped gently at the door was bid to walk in  john made one of his best bows to the nurse and she on her part affected prodigious kindness and cordiallity to john and truly it was no wonder for never had mortal so devoted himself and his interest so implicitly and completely to the will and inclinations and passions of another as john bull had done on this occasion to those of his nurse  john up and told his nurse as how he was come after his late loss to congratulate the nurse upon the change of his late abominable servants whose roguery and treachery were so well known that it made it very unnecessary for him to say any thing more upon the subject but only to return her his best thanks for the maternal and tender care she had taken of his nearest and dearest concerns  on the other hand the nurse who had a most thorough pace contempt for bull was however extremely happy at this visit because it quite silenced all suspicions and future enquiries and complaints  she therefore assured him that next to doing what she reckoned her duty nothing gave her half so much pleasure as to find that he approved of her conduct on this occasion which she said was the only means left in her power to save the family the estate and titledeeds which indeed had been in the utmost jeopardy from that lawless vagabond crew which the late mrs bull had recommended to him here john thought it would be but decent in him to clap his dirty handkerchief to his eyes upon the pretext of wiping away the falling tear  but the nurse let him to know that she thought it very unbecoming in him to lament the loss of any person who could recommend and patronise such servants as his late ones who could use her in so rude and so brutal a manner by crossing her inclinations in the very thing which of all others she wished most  the choice of good and useful and honest servants for his family you may observe continued the nurse what infinite pains i have taken on this occasion to select for your business the very ablest and best of men i have put young pam at the head of them because of his great parts and experience in affairs his vast knowledge of mankind and the purity of his intentions  very true madam  very true replied john young pams tender years and want of opportunity to commit any enormous crimes makes it most natural to imagine that he is very spotless and unhacknied in the ways of men and as to his experience in affairs and knowledge of mankind i think i see in this youth a sort of premature abilities that i am persuaded will answer my purpose vastly well much better indeed than all the boasted acquirements of riper years  besides he seems to have a deal of steadiness and determination  he will not easily be put out nor does he seem to want for a very proper and becomimg confidence in his own talents  you are perfectly right said the nurse i am very sure mr bull that both you and i shall be well satisfied with this young man of whom i have conceived a very high opinion indeed  as to your two secretaries i have equal reason to be well pleased with them i will indeed fairly confess to you that they are not reckoned men of the most shining talents but what of that they are men who will do what they are ordered without hesitation which i take to be the first rate quality in any servant there are some awkward untaught and unmannerly boobies who will stand and consider and pretend to think for themselves what is best to be done  i will venture to say that the present ones are not of that kidney for as they have no ideas of their own they will be very ready to hear any that we shall suggest they will adopt them with eagerness and execute them with pleasure  indeed madam said john every thing you say is a new proof of your wisdom and penetration i was foolish enough formerly to be a little jealous of your power and influence in my family but i protest i now see my own stupidity and in the mind i am now in i think i shall leave the management of all my affairs to you in future and having such an excellent woman to take a charge of my domestic concerns i am sure i of all men have least reason to regret the loss of my wife who by the bye i have some reason to believe was no better than she should be better rejoined the nurse she was worse than it is possible for me to paint  a cross peevish cursed vixen  without common sense or common civility i am sure she behaved to me in a most insolent indecent and disgraceful manner i can never think of it without the blood boiling in my veins and therefore i must avoid the subject least i should bring on a fresh fit of my late complaint which i seriously believe would have done for me had it not been for the great skill of young pam and the greater care and kind offices of mother jenky good creature  well said john madam let us shift this disagreeable subject  we have now all before us and thank god you have at length found me a set of honest and upright men who will serve me with honor and conscience  aye said the nurse that i have mr bull so that you may rest perfectly easy and seeing we are now upon these domestic subjects let me recommend it to you to have an eye to some girl of good family for your future spouse and not connect yourself and contaminate your blood with a vulgar low bred pitiful draggle tailed dowdy like your last wife  your character as a tradesman stands very high and though to be sure your affairs are at present somewhat embarrassed yet you are too young to lay aside thoughts of matrimony besides let me tell you without flattery that mankind have a good opinion of you as an honest industrious good natured fellow who have already made a good husband to a very unworthy match and who of course will make a good husband to a girl of family who might both bring you money and great connexions  john could not help smiling at this conversation but brushing up a little at the compliments paid him by the nurse he modestly observed that sure no girl of good family and fortune would think of having such an old fashioned clumsy fellow as himself  you are mistaken said the nurse good husbands are not so easily come at now a days but for gods sake let me advise you not to think of any future intermarriage with that flaunting tawdry trolloping lowlived family of the privileges  i am sure you have had enough of them to sicken any man  now there is a very fine girl that i have often seen at chapel who i think would suit you prodigiously well a tall genteel majestic elegant looking woman who would do honor to any family a woman of high birth and fashion you will no doubt guess that i point at the charming miss grace prerogative   odds bodikins quoth john who though no chicken had yet a colts tooth in his head miss prerogative is a charming woman sure enough  but would it not have a very strange appearance to the neighbors for me to make up to a young lady whose family i have always been quarrelling with as a most incroaching and dissatisfied set of people  that is the best reason in the world replied the nurse for your making up to the daughter for that will settle all differences and heal old sores  by gingo i believe you are in the right madam said john i have a great mind to give her a call tomorrow morning by way of reconnoitring the premises  indeed said the nurse you are perfectly in the right there is no time to lose for so fine a woman with such genteel connections cannot be long in the market  well by the lord i will have a brush at her quoth john so good bye to ye madam good bye to you  away flung john and left the nurse as may easily be supposed in a rapture of joy so that she could not help exclaiming by the living god i dont believe there is upon earth so good natured or so stupid a mortal as john bull  i think i have him snug he is completely gulled completely duped and completely bedeviled  chap iv john bull is totally captivated by the charms of the lovely and lofty miss prerogative  the marriage settlements  john gives a grand entertainment  the nurse is of the party  pam makes the punch  john gets half seas over is extremely noisy and exposes himself to his guests the nurse proposes a foxchase to john who readily agrees  and proposes figuring on a drayhorse  john was not a man who relished any circumbendibus in his mode of acting he always moved straight forward to his point without much manoeuvering an accomplishment which is now found so essential toward the forming great modern sea officers having been a buck in his younger days he on this occasion clapped on a very smart suit of clothes a neat dressed perriwig white silk stockings and a most exorbitant large pair of buckles as was the fashion in those times and away he marched to squire prerogatives it is alleged however that by the way he felt some few compunctions and qualms of conscience as if he had been acting inconsistently with all the former tenor of his conduct he felt also a little gleam of remorse at connecting himself with a family which had been at constant variance with his former wife and all her connections and who had at times used them in the most contumelious manner damn me says john i wish after all that this is not a rash piece of business i am engaged in i may perchance get into a cursed scrape here and yet she is a fine creature too this bear miss prerogative  a most desirable piece of goods faith with as tight a leg and foot as ever a man laid a long side of  well egad it dont signify i cannot see why i should not please myself as well as another a wife i must have and when i am about it why should not i indulge my present passion i love the girl that is enough urit grata protervitas et vultus nimium lubricus aspici thus john vindicated his passion by a classical quotation for he had been a scholar in his youth and still retained the recollection of a few latin sentences which he sported on proper occasions  we are sorry to observe that contemporary historians have left us totally in the dark as to what passed between john and his mistress at this first interview perhaps indeed this may have been an effect of their great judgment and decorum and they may have chosen to draw a vail over what it might have been highly improper to disclose  for to say truth we have heard from undoubted authority  that the young lady in question was as forward a piece as any in the parish and very likely to allow john to take great liberties even at opening the preliminaries  suffice it therefore to say that john was completely enamoured and very soon obtained the fair ladys good graces as also the consent of parents  after which the settlements were the only remaining obstacle in the way to felicity john therefore with the nurses advice and at her tance appointed three persons of experienced ability and distinguished integrity to superintend this business  these were macbumbo mother jenky and jack the ratcatcher  with three such adepts what business could prove difficult  in short they so smoothed enforced and softened things that the whole affairs were settled before you could say jack robinson  john and the nurse had now appointed the day for the celebration of the nuptials  and john and she had invited all the guests who were vastly too numerous to mention  and a deal of good wholesome eatables and drinkables there was according to the fashion of john s table which never consisted of fricassees and ragouts and whipped syllabubs like louis baboons  but was a solid substantial steady feed  the punch was excellent and very nappy it was of pams composition who was accounted a dab at mixing the ingredients  and john being in rare spirits drank about pretty freely  at last he got very noisy and very voiceferous on the occasion  and sitting near the nurse he filled her glass till she herself inspite of all her prudence and decorum got a little pogy  she then proposed a hunting match to john of which diversion she said she was distractedly fond  now says she there is a damned sly fox upon these grounds which i have long been after and i should have great pleasure to unkennel and have a complete course with him and i warrant you says she snapping her fingers one day or other i will have the damned rogue hip and thigh john protested he would be one of the party and although says he i have long since parted with all my hunters  by george i will mount my drayhorse rather than not attend you on such precious sport from this time and full of this noble idea john began to grow most damnably drunk and insisted upon singing a hunting song the chorus of which was certainly not the first rateflight of poetical fancy let us crush traitor fox tally ho tally ho this he roared so confounded loud and so long and so much like a man who was passed all power of sentiment sense or reflection that many of his guests who were in their sober senses were quite disgusted and scandalized at the ridiculous absurd and beastly manner in which he exposed himself not only to the company but to all the neighbors who were perfectly astonished at johns childishness and folly on this occasion and holding up their hands confessed that they never had seen him make so wretched a figure in all their lives the sober and decent part of the company now slipped off by degrees and left the nurse and mother jenky to put john to bed  here the new married couple were as we suppose left in the dark as we have also been by contemporary historians nothing having ever yet transpired respecting a consummation which was so devoutly wished for by the nurse and all her associates  all therefore that a faithful historian can do is to supply the defects of certainty by the most probable conjectures supported by circumstances  john bull was undoubtedly drunk and a drunken man cannot be supposed to be the most agreeable bedfellow to a young woman of high blood and warm imagination be this as it may  and although the young bride appeared rather gloomy and disconcerted on the ensuing day yet she had so many fine things given her by john and the nurse such dresses such jewels such laces and ribbons and favors and other fine things that in short she became wonderfully satisfied and elevated with her new situation  chap v the custom that prevailed of choosing servants for johns wife  renard puts up for that honor is eagerly opposed by the nurse and young pam the east country clerks old padagra and pelf but is as warmly supported by most of his old friends and many new acquired ones  sister peg and johns first cousin paddy shillaily both strive to serve him and john himself feels a sincere love and regard for him  his character and that of his rival pam  it is highly necessary to acquaint my readers with a circumstance relating to johns family which perhaps they may never before have heard of and that is the singular custom of choosing servants for mrs bull it is no doubt common in most private families for the lady to choose her own servants but that was not the case in johns where it had been customary from time immemorial to leave the choice entirely to the family at large  among many who put up for the honor of serving mrs bull renard was one of the most conspicuous and so he went about to solicit the vote of every one individual in the house it will no doubt appear extremely singular to those who read this extraordinary history that not withstanding the ridiculous and extravagant fancy john took of blaming of renard merely out of complaisance to the nurse and young pam yet he could not help loving him sincerely there was to say truth a great similarity in their characters in many respects for renard with the most uncommon talents joined extreme good nature an openness a frankness and sincerity which are extremely engaging  he was ambitious it is true but he was very disinterested and careless to a fault about money every transaction with him was above board and he strove not even to conceal his own follies he followed the dictates of his passions and pursued his point without any dissimulation or affectation  on the other hand his rival pam was artificial from top to toe every action every jesture were the effects of deliberation and study  his talents were not contemptible but they were brought into play before they were ripe and those premature parts partook so much of hardness and acerbity that it seemed extremely doubtful if ever they would mellow so as to become fit for any useful purpose  his great talent and that indeed in which he showed a peculiar felicity was his collecting and keeping together a gang of the most cosummate scoundrels that ever infested any private family  knowing nothing of mankind he was tempted to supply that deficiency by cunning deceit and duplicity which in the end cut him up by the roots  he was extremely vain presumptuous and selfsufficient these created the most complete arrogance insolence and petulance so that he spared neither rank age abilities nor experience these disgustful passions naturally predominant in haughty minds were much increased by the great notice and sudden preferment procured him by the nurse  this he attributed wholly to his own superiority little thinking that the nurse was as cunning and deceitful as himself and that it was not his abilities that recommended him but because she knew he was young and was in great hopes he might be implicitly led in all his conduct by herself and mother jenky  this was the true cause of the preference and most certain it is that the more mean the more pliable the more humble and subservient the more likely he was to become and to continue a favorite with the nurse who valued no talents but such as were useful to herself  who felt no attachments but to those who were devoted to her will and who never had a friend she would not sacrifice or betray whenever he should differ in opinion from herself  or presume to act contrary to her inclination  pam however was really not known to john who had taken him into his service merely by the nurses recommendation who spoke of him in the highest terms and john when questioned by any of his friends about this ridiculous choice and when they alleged to him that it was absolutely impossible for a schoolboy to manage his complicated affairs  used to to reply  it signifies not a groat i have a good opinion of the boy and he has never yet done any harm nor has he been guilty of any trick that i know of and am persuaded he will come to understand my business as well as the wisest of them give him time  give him time says john he will do he will do  i warrant him  but notwithstanding this strange harum scaram conduct of johns  still he could not forget his old friendship for renard  and therefore he wished to see him in his wifes service although he had approved of his dismission from his own  accordingly he assisted him all he could as did many belonging to sister pegs family and also to the family of paddy shillaily johns first cousin in short they so bustled and so labored and so canvassed that they succeeded against all the intrigues of the nurse and pam and the east countryclerks and the old counts padagra and pelf  who had joined in order to oppose him  but the most curious part of the story is that after renard had carried his point  pam in order to ingratiate himself still more with the nurse denied the fact and swore manfully that he was not chosen  as did also loyd the baker and several other perjured vagabonds who as a cloak to their knavery pretended great knowledge of old rules and orders  and others again assumed a mighty tenderness of conscience  which is the old stale pretext of the most consummate rogues and hypocrites  notwithstanding all which renard won the day to the great distress and vexation both of the nurse and pam  whose character suffered much by his glaring malicious and rascally conduct in this affair john himself who had been so completely blindfolded began now to open his eyes to this obstinate and deceitful stripling but he had been too much taken in by him and had gone too far in his foolish admiration to retreat all of a sudden and therefore he found himself under the necessity of still vindicating him from any bad intentions  but affairs soon occurred which opened his eyes very completely as we shall have occasion to relate more at large in the sequel of this most useful history which i verily believe to be the real mother of wisdom  chap vi pam and strumbolo the coal merchant make love to the late mrs bulls daughter reformia  they are very coldly received   i have before related that the late excellent woman mrs bull left behind her one daughter who was to say truth both a comely and a bouncing wench as one could set their eyes upon and being now in the bloom of youth she failed not to attract a numerous suite of admirers   i will not pretend to say that these no more than other modern lovers were all passionate and disinterested adorers  far from it most of them had heard of the great supposed fortune left by her mothers will  and besides they knew that of late years she was become a mighty favorite with john himself who had been often heard calling lustily for her to come and attend him as much as she could   this being the case it was naturally enough for those who were desirous of ingratiating themselves with john to make up to his young favorite and amongst those who at present stood forward to recommend themselves most to mr bull was the famous strumbolo the coal crimp a person fully blacker in his mind than in his profession  he was one of those dull industrious plodding fellows who are eternally employed in investigating profoundly the mereest trifles and are never happy but when they are pocking their heads into some nasty enquiry about other peoples affairs and this always under the pretext of preventing john from being imposed upon  sometimes he would be going about to see how all the shirts sheets and stockings of the family were washed and spying with his magnifying glass to see if any stains were left or if the laundress adhered strictly to her contract at another time you might see strumbolo busy in getting warrants to arrest some old and faithful servants of johns who had passed their days and risked their lives in his service  the trial and punishment of that sort of men for little petty offenses and oppressing them by the weight of his authority was a supreme delight to srumbolo who had a mortal antipathy to that valor and intrepidity in others which he knew he had not in himself  like an old maid who repines to see the young and the gay in possession of those enjoyments she can never taste and whose envy and malice exerts itself to embitter their pleasures  at another time you might see this archfiend with a great stick in his hand knocking down and otherwise abusing all the poor superannuated pensioners who were worn out in the service of john and his family you damned scoundrels says strumbolo you coming here and get your bellies filled and carry home victuals for your families and all forsooth upon the ridiculous pretext that you have served the family for sixty or seventy years and are no longer fit for labor  a fine reason truly quoth strumbolo because i maintain a man twenty years i must perforce maintain him twenty years more whether i have any use for him or no  i will allow no such abuses and impositions go and get your living where you can  you pretend that at your time of life you are not able to work why the devil then should we pay you for what you cannot do  then strumbolo never saw a tradesman approach the house but what he would have a squeeze at him  you dog you says he you overcharge your bills i know you do i could have the same business done for the one hundredth and fifty sixth part of a penny cheaper than what you have done you are a very great impostor and i will have you turned out of your employment for ever you may go and starve you and your family  but i suppose you have taken care of that you have already feathered your nest i have been informed by two or three of your neighbors with whom you have quarreled that you have saved money so that you must certainly be a very sad scoundrel indeed  now all this time while strumbolo was thus grinding the face of the poor he was pocketing a very handsome perquisite by his coaltrade which from every mean minute and dirty detail he was hoarding up and accumulating to an amazing sum so that the fellow who had really the mean mind of a coal crimp was now become as rich as a lord   amongst others of srumbolos good qualities he was a strange wrangling fellow and loved disputation and bustle and business such as it was  from this love of business he sometimes led john into needless expense and if any of the family found fault with it and he saw himself in any scrape and that an action was brought against him he had art enough to contrive to pack his jury and to be chosen foreman himself by which means it was easy to see that no harm could ever befall him  this respectable personage was some how or other allied to the nurse by the wrong side of the blankets  and it was by means of this connection that he had been let into his profitable perquisites  he was himself very vain of the connection  but she on the other hand though she carried fair with him yet did she hate him most cordially  strumbolo was exceedingly desirous of being well with john a thing which was not very likely to be for his character was one of those that john most detested and despised  but in order to get into his good graces he now made love to reformia with all the assiduity and vigor he was master of strumbolo was not however of that turn of temper or disposition that could make much impression upon a young handsome girls heart  he was naturally serious rigid and austere and had nothing like mirth or good humor about him  it is true he could be extremely well bred  but he never exerted his politeness so much as when wanted to do an injury to deceive and betray or when he was afraid of the resentment of the person he was treating with  a feeling which he was indeed very susceptible of for nobody had greater apprehensions about his own personal safety than strumbolo who had been compelled on various occasions to make very mean and humiliating submissions rather than expose his person to a hearty drubbing which he often had occasion to dread but always had an alacrity to shun  now whether reformia had discovered this failing of strumbolos i will not pretend to say  certain it is the fair sex are very fond of that virtue which seems to be the distinguishing mark of a manly character and as there were public proofs of the infamous cowardice of strumbolo all his prossessions of profound admiration and all his flattery had no effect  however the dog knew what importunity would do and therefore he continued to lay hold of every occasion to tell the lady that she was the most perfect beauty in the world that every body admired her that he for his part wished to see her in every public place diffusing her benign influence universally over all ranks and conditions of men that there was grace in all her steps heaven in her eye in every gesture dignity and love  pam too was a rival lover but even less serious and less sincere perhaps than the former he was however no less desirous than strumbolo to make his court to john bull through the young favorite he therefore made his addresses inform and attacked the fair one with all the pomp of words for not being a passionate admirer he could better command his expressions  and used to pour forth her praise in words of sixfeet long  but alas his reputation among the ladies had not quite as many inches in length  besides notwithstanding the pretended violence of his passion he never went to her alone but had always some friend along with him as if he had been afraid of too private an interview  sometimes he carried along with him jack the ratcatcher  sometimes macbumbo and rather than go alone he would even take mother jenky and what is very odd while he was discoursing his mistress in the most lofty expressions of admiration and eulogy he was all the while making damned faces apart to his friends with now and then a sly wink and nod as much as to say dont you believe i am serious this is a mere farce i am carrying on only to secure johns good opinion  but i know the nurse hates reformia mrs bull considers her as a step daughter and has no affection for her and i myself would rather be crucified than have any thing do with her  it is shrewdly suspected the young lady saw through all this grimace and hypocricy of pam and conceived a great dislike to him besides his charcter among the fair sex did not stand very high on the contrary he was rather considered as a frigid friend to the sex and one who was too great an admirer of himself ever to make a warm lover or a kind husband  it was likewise currently reported that at this time john bull who was not remarkable for seeing farther into an unbored millstone than his neighbors began however to perceive that pam was only toying with his daughter merely for the sake of pleasing him and that he was in fact like many others only a cake and pudding wooer however such was johns prepossession at this time or rather his dislike to appear to have been completely taken in by this pompous and petulant younker that rather than expose his weakness and folly he chose to disguise or conceal his own growing disgust  chap vii a short account of john bulls first cousin paddy shiliaily  his character  his ill treatment by john in his youth  his good sense and great care of his estate  he takes advantage of johns long litigation with his westcountry tenantry to get rid of those shackles john had unjustly imposed upon him  before i proceed further in the history of john bull it is necessary i should here inform my courteous reader that john had a first cousin by the mothers side whose name was paddy shillaily he though somewhat younger than john was educated at the same school with him and together with very good talents had something infinitely droll about him he was a very faithful friend and had on all occasions showed himself much attached to his cousin even in the worst of times john who felt himself stronger than paddy had gained a vast ascendency over him and i must confess did not altogether use him with that liberality and generosity which so strongly marked his character in his dealings with others not but that he would have defended him from the insults or abuse of any other person to the last drop of his blood but on the other hand he himself assumed the privilege of maltreating and greatly oppressing paddy and so buffeted and crushed him and knocked him about that it was the opinion of every body that he had in some measure stunted the poor lads growth and had prevented him from applying with spirit to his book and to his profession which was somewhat in the nature of johns own line in the manufacturing branch  notwithstanding all this however paddy turned out a fine promising lad he was as brave as steel and would rather have a quarrel upon his hands than otherwise he was a good scholar and a very sensible man but had a queer defect in his optics which often prevented him from seeing his object very correctly or in its proper point of view  the same inaccuracy was remarkable in his modes of expression and paddys elocution was often so embarrassed so perplexed and blundering that it frequently afforded much mirth and fun to his companions but it was very necessary for them to make it appear that they were laughing with him and not at him  otherwise they must take the consequences  paddys sentences like the oracles of delphi would generally admit of various interpretations but it truly might be said of him that if his utterance was bad his meaning was good he had a species of sarcastic wit peculiar to himself and his vein of humor however pleasant was seldom without its sting he was by nature prone to be somewhat rude boisterous and forward nor were an over diffidence or bashfulness ever ranked amongst the number of his foibles but when he was sufficiently justled and rubbed about in the world which he certainly required to take off his rust and rough corners no metal could take a brighter polish and one might surely pronounce him to be a clever manly and generous fellow as any you would wish to see  paddys paternal estate which was very considerable lay just over against bullockshatch on the other side of the river and john and he lived together in terms of intimacy and good neighborhood keeping up a very pleasant and friendly intercourse excepting when little differences happened upon matters of self interest  and what relations friends or neighbors do not frequently differ upon that subject john sensible of his own superior strength and the ascendency he had acquired at school always took the upperhand and would allow of no interference in his branches of trade if however paddy was inferior to john in point of strength or trade or income he made up for these difficiences by a very commendable virtue which was a strict and rigid economy when john was engaged in any of his ridiculous lawsuits paddy did not grudge to lend him all the assistance he could but he would never run himself in debt or mortgage his estate as john had done so that he had a great advantage over him in going to market with ready money by which means he got every thing much cheaper and people would work for him at lower wages knowing their pay was sure and no deduction to be made on account of law expenses or interest of money borrowed or the like which was a very common custom with john who used to squeeze his weavers and other manufactures with stoppages in such a manner that at the end of the week they had not two thirds of their wages to receive which greatly distressed them and their families  the day was now come when by means of these cursed expensive litigations johns nose was most damnably in the dirt for lewis baboon lord strut nic frog and yankey were all upon him at the same time so that he was really sore beset and his finances very low  paddy then bethought himself that now or never was the time for a great exertion to set himself free and to get entirely out of johns clutches  this he executed in a bold and masterly manner and told john fairly that he would no longer be bound and tied down by rules and regulations of his making but would make them for himself in future and he now claimed many privileges from which he had hitherto been debarred  john at present felt himself fairly down and therefore made a virtue of necessity by yielding many points which he thought might be useful to his relation without much injuring himself these well judged concessions were first managed by boreas and afterward by renard with the advice and consent of the late mrs bull ever watchful for johns interest and were the cause of great cordiallity and mutual satisfaction to both parties  chap viii a brief narrative of the state of sister pegs health and how she stood affected on the present occasion  macbumbo tampers with her chaplain who conducts himself with great good sense and dignity  it is now full time i should give some little account of the tender state of health the occupations and sentiments of john bulls own sister peg who for some years past had been subject to the most grievous and oppressive fits of a lethargic disposition whieh had often rendered her in a manner senseless and stupid and unfit for business this shocking distemper did not however prevent her from attending to her own domestic concerns to which she was now become extremely attached  instead of law divinity and literature which had formerly engrossed all her attention she had become very seriously engaged in the cultivation of her paternal estate in building huts for weavers in spinning and carding bucking and bleaching and such like  peg notwithstanding in her lucid intervals was roused at times when she heard that johns affairs were in danger or distress  for she well knew that at present whatever affected him must very essentially affect herself she was therefore much concerned when she was informed of the untimely death of the late mrs bull and the unhappy fate of her sister darling privilege who every body concluded had perished along with her many illjudged and oppressive things were also done by pam to pegs weavers and other manufacturers which helped very much to disgust her however macbumbo who as i have related was formerly in pegs service did every thing in his power to flatter and coax her and he likewise from time to time gave her some little paultry presents which had always a great effect with her who from habits of poverty and economy was now become if possible more selfish and interested than ever though she had certainly less occasion than formerly having by attention and industry filled her pockets pretty handsomely but in this weakness she was not singular since every body knows that it is the way of the world for mankind to become more stingy and avaricious as they become more opulent  amongst others who were in high favor with peg was her chaplain a very honest pious and learned person in whom peg placed great confidence and had very justly great regard and friendship for him indeed she had another reason for her attachment to him besides those i have here mentioned for it is well known that peg was extravagantly fond of preaching and praying and singing of psalms and all manner of spiritual songs and in these her chaplain indulged her completely giving her from time to time such dozes of them as would have perfectly surfeited any moderate christian  to him therefore macbumbo paid great court and wished very much to have had him send a letter of congratulation to the nurse on her having so successfully accomplished her plan of dismissing johns late servants  macbumbo was perfectly aware that the chaplain had always been very sincerely attached to the nurse and her family and really wished her well he did not therefore doubt but he could have persuaded him to have given his sanction by approving of her conduct on this occasion but he was infinitely mistaken for the worthy and pious man rejected the proposal with great disdain and with much dignity and good sense he absolutely refused to countenance a measure which he thought reflected so little honor upon the perpetrators of it   chap ix pam proposes settling all matters of trade between john bull and paddy shillaily  pam is infected with the distemper in paddy s optics  he opens his proposal to paddy and then to mrs bull  john starts and bounces  pam opiniatres it  his childish and ignorant method of conducting business  pam was so much pleased with his impotent and ineffectual plan for settling the east country business  that he thought it would do him equal honor to carry through as great and as wie a measure for adjusting and finally arranging the affairs of john bull and paddy shillaily  in contemplating this grand and glorious object pam was struck all of a heap with the giddy staggers in his head which confounded his optics to that degree that one would have sworn he had been completely infected by paddy  in short he felt himself so perplexed and so blunderheaded that he was quite at a loss which end of the business he should begin with or whether it might not be better to begin in the middle  after due deliberation this last plan pleased him most  so he was determined to open the business to paddy by informing him that if he would be pleased to accept of all johns weavers looms and manufactures whatsoever that he was sure in the present disposition in which john and his wife were he would be answerable he should get them persuaded to assign over to him and his heirs for ever the whole of those advantages and that without any fee or reward excepting only that he meant to ask for john by way of reciprocity the surplus of a fund which had hitherto proved and always would prove deficient until paddy should totally destroy and annihilate johns manufactures and commerce at which time he observed that from his wonderful penetration and sagacity he could foresee that this deficient fund would prove a productive one this proposition was so much beyond what paddy had either wished or expected that his ears began to crow like chanticleer and he really doubted whether the young manager was not laying some snare for him and that he meant to take him in for at this time every body began to suspect his sincerity however having viewed it on all sides he could see no bad consequence from receiving a great deal for which he was to pay nothing but the surplus of a deficiency which paddy concluded could not be very ruinous to him as it would not probably take much of his ready money out of his pocket  he therefore determined to accept and told mr pam so pam who had thus begun in the middle was now determined to take matters by the right end and so he goes next to mrs bull with whom he still continued to be a wonderful favorite for she knew he and his runners had had a great hand in making the match for her  he up and told mrs bull in the presence of a large company what he had done and of the proposals he had made to paddy and how ready and obliging he had been in accepting what was so much to his advantage  and he did not at all doubt but that john bull would approve of his plan as it was much better to give his trade his looms and every thing to paddy rather than live in ill humor with so near a relation he then told mrs bull in his usual way and with a modesty peculiar to himself for he had borrowed a little of what paddy had to spare that his plan was one of the best that ever had been thought of by any human creature boreas he said and renard and the late mrs bull had perfectly botched this business for they had agreed to give away all that he intended to give but they were to get nothing in return whereas he had secured a very useful reciprocity by engaging paddy to pay john the surplus of a deficient fund which paddy had very readily agreed to knowing that such a sum could not possibly hurt him and that in matters of such magnitude a sum like that was neither here nor there nor any where at all at all  pam was so enchanted with his own superior wisdom in transacting this melancholy piece of business that in short there was no end to the praise and panegyric he bestowed on himself and the reproaches he threw out upon his predecessors  and as for mrs bull she was so charmed with the sound of his voice that to her it was of no consequence whether he spoke sense or nonsense or whether she heard him or no she made it a rule always to agree with him and i verily believe that if pam had dared to propose to have incarcerated her husband or even to have castrated him she would readily have assented by declaring she had so much confidence in pam that she was sure that these or any other thing which he should propose would be for her own and her husbands advantage  john bull having been made acquainted with all this began now as well he might to be most seriously alarmed he had for some time been opening his eyes toward the conduct and character of mr pam and this completed the business  he therefore began to growl and bounce and swear like the devil  the weavers and manufacturers particularly had reason to complain seeing they were to be done for completely  they therefore waited on mr pam and remonstrated bitterly  pam with his usual art and duplicity gave them all fair words assuring them that he would take the most tender care of their interest this assurance however renard with that shrewdness which was natural to him soon discovered to be a mere trick and deception in order to keep them quiet till all was irrevocably fixed  when this discovery was made these poor people who now perceived they had been completely duped by this little cunning stripling began forthwith to solicit mrs bull and all their friends in her family  representing in the strongest terms their distress and the danger and ruin to which they their wives and children would be exposed  in vain did boreas and renard and many other sincere friends of john bull and his family interpose with his wife to mitigate the rigor of this ill concerted plan pam was obstinate and of course mrs bull who was a mere creature of pams remained inflexible in spite of every thing that could be said upon the subject in short still mindful of his paternal profession for nature will out pam now flattered himself he had found a nostrum and infallible specific for curing all heart burnings between paddy and john  even sir samuel hannays famous specific is not more powerful or more effectual in preventing evils than was pams in his own opinion who was determined to risk every thing precious on this desperate experiment  the constitution vitals body and soul itself were all to be sacrificed to this boyish rage for prescription and quackery  and here it must be observed that when pam was hard driven on any subject by the superior abilities of boreas and renard  there were two subjects to which he always had recourse to rouse the prejudices of john and his wife and under which he run for shelter as a small frigate will do under the guns of a fortress when chased by a ship of superior force these favorite themes were the west country litigation conducted by boreas and the plan for regulating the east country business proposed by renard  on which occasions there was a regular repetition of the stale story of encroaching upon the power and patronage of the nurse of annihilating the old balance and regulations so long established in the family  of purloining all john bulls charters and of confiscating the property of the poor east country clerks and all that endless gibberish which had neither sense nor argument  after an exordium of this kind pam next proceeded to praise his own amazing abilities and incorruptible integrity and from thence took occasion to attack with infinite insolence arrogance malice and spleen every person who should happen to differ from himself on any subject  and at the same time that he turned every thing they said into perfect ridicule and sneered at and reprobated whatever they proposed  yet was he very attentive all the while to catch up their ideas to mend his plan and would eke and patch up his crude abortions by degrees so that in the end they began to have something of form and feature and if not beautiful or correct they became at least less deformed and capable of being seen without abhorrence or detestation and in this shape they were imposed upon the world as his own progeny  and so it fared with his present plan for settling all affairs with paddy  a for the nurse these were matters in which it was pretended she had no sway  it was however very well known that she was privately consulted by pam and it was as well understood that she gave him her directions through mother jenky and that he obeyed them as implicitly as he was obeyed by mrs bull  in this business no body precisely knew the sentiments of the nurse as she was at pains to conceal them but as she had a great hatred and contempt for john and that pam continued obstinate her opinion on the subject is scarcely to be doubted  the singularity of the situation into which this extraordinary personage had now brought herself is well worth the observation of the curious not only of the present but of all future ages  all her jerks her writhings windings and turnings in order to command had in fact wrought a very different effect from what she wished or expected it is true she enjoyed the supreme gratification of a little present revenge and the sovereign satisfaction of apparent power but to those who look into and examine affairs more intimately it will plainly appear to what a dilemma and into what trammels the nurse had precipitated herself by her own egregious absurdity and folly  with better management she might have preserved equal sway by working one set of servants against the other and still have maintained her own power but by totally discharging the ablest the most responsible and those who were best supported by the old established and wealthy yeomanry on johns lands she was creating an endless fund of powerful and irresistible opposition to her plans besides she was now completely at the mercy of all those proud and petulant spirits who then commanded in the counting house  she had thus left herself without alternative and was exposed to the caprice of the daring and stern surly to the vanity and petulance of the supercilious and pompous pam to the insolence and obstinacy of the vexatious and malignant strumbolo  so that her sole consolation was her having in the rest of the servants a set of eminent ninnies wholly at her command because unable   caetera desunt
