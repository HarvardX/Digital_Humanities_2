musaeus a monody to the memory of mr pope in imitation of miltons lycidas  t hayman inv et del c grignion sculp   london printed for r dodsley at tullys head in pall mall and sold by m cooper at the globe in paternoster row       musaeus a monody sorrowing i catch the reed and call the muse if yet a muse on britains plain abide since rapt musaeus tuned his parting strain with him they lived with him perchance they died for who ever since their virgin train espied or on the banks of thames or that mild plain where isis sparkles to the sunny ray or have they deigned to play where camus winds along his broiderd vale feeding each white pink and each daisie pied that mingling paint his rushyfringed side yet ah celestial maids ye are not dead immortal as ye are ye may not die and well i ween ye cannot quite be fled ever ye entune his mournful elegy stay then awhile o stay ye fleeting fair revisit yet nor hallowed hippocrene nor thespias shade till your harmonious teen be grateful poured in some slowdittied air such tribute paid again ye may repair to what loved haunt you whilom did elect whether lycaeus or that mountain fair trim maenalus with piny verdure decked but now it boots you not in these to stray or yet cyllenes hoary shade to choose or where mild ladons welling waters play forego each vain excuse and haste to thamess shores for thames shall join our sad society and passing mourn letting cold tears bedew his silver urn and when the poets widowed grot he laves his reedcrownd locks shall shake his head shall bow his tide no more in eddies blithe shall rove but creep soft by with longdrawn murmurs slow for often the poet roused his charmed waves with martial notes or lulled with strain of love he must not now in brisk maeanders flow gamesome and kiss the sadlysilent shore without the loan of some poetic woe can i forget how erst his osiers made sad sullen music as bleak eurus fanned can i forget how gloomd yon laureat shade ever death remorseless waved his ebon wand how midst yon grot each silver trickling spring wandered the shelly channels all among while as the coral roof did softly ring responsive to their sweetlydoleful song meanwhile all pale the expiring poet laid and sunk his awful head while vocal shadows pleasing dreams prolong for so his sickening spirits to release they poured the balm of visionary peace first sent from cams fair banks like palmer old came came tityrus etc i e chaucer a name frequently given him by spenser vide shep call ecl        and elsewhere tityrus slow with head all silvered over and in his hand an oaken crook he bore and thus in antique guise short talk did hold great clerk of fame is house whose excellence mae well befitt thilk place of eminence mickle of well betide thy hours last for mich good wirke to me don and past for syn the days whereas my lyre ben strongen and deftly many a merry lay i songen old time which all things don maliciously gnawen with rusty tooth continually gnattrid my lines that they all cancrid ben till at the last thou smoothen hem have again sithence full semely gliden my rymes rude as if fitteth thilk similitude when shallow brook yrenneth hobling on ovir rough stones it maken full rough song but them stones removen this lite rivere stealen forth by making plesaunt murmere so my sely rymes whosoever may them note thou maken everichone to ren right sote and in thy verse entuneth so fetisely that men sayen i make true melody and speaken every dele to mine honor mich well great clerk betide thy parting hour he ceased his homely rhyme when colin clout i e spenser which name he gives himself throughout his works colin clout elizas shepherd swain the blithest lad that ever pipd on plain came with his reed softwarbling on the way and thrice he bowed his head with motion mild and thus his gliding numbers began essay i the two first stanzas of this speech as they relate to pastoral are written in the measure which spenser uses in the first eclogue of the shepherds calendar the rest where he speaks of fable are in the stanza of the faery queen ah luckless swain alas how art thou lorn who once like me could frame thy pipe to play shepherds devise and cheer the lingering morn ne bush ne breere but learnt thy roundelay ah plight too sore such worth to equal right ah worth too high to meet such piteous plight ii but i naught strive poor colin to compare my hobbins or my thenots rustic skill to thy deft swains whose dapper dities rare surpass ought else of quaintest shepherds quill even roman tityrus that peerless wight mote yield to thee for dainties of delight iii eke when in fables flowery paths you strayed masking in cunning feints truths splendent face ne sylph ne sylphid but due tendence paid to shield belindas lock from felon base but all mote naught avail such harm to chase then una fair gan droop her princely mien eke florimel and all my faery race belinda far surpast my beauties sheen belinda subject meet for such soft lay i ween iv like as in villagd troop of birdlings trim where chanticleer his red crest high does hold and quaking ducks that wont in lake to swim and turkeys proud and pigeons nothing bold if chance the peacock does his plumes unfold eftsoons their meaner beauties all decaying he glistneth purple and he glistneth gold now with bright green now blue himself arraying such is thy beauty bright all other beauties swaying v but why do i descant this toyish rhyme and fancies light in simple guise pourtray listing to cheer thee at this ruefull time while as black death does on thy heartstrings prey yet read aright and if this friendly lay thou nathless judge all too slight and vain let my wellmeaning mend my ill essay so may i greet thee with a nobler strain when soon we meet for aye in yon starsprinkled plain last came a bard of more exalted tread and hight thyrsis i e milton lycidas and the epitaphium damonis are the only pastorals we have of miltons in the latter of which where he laments car deodatus under the name of damon he calls himself thyrsis thyrsis hight by dryad fawn or swain whenever he mingled with the sylvan train but seldom that for higher thoughts he fed for him full often the heavenly muses led to clear euphrates and the secret mount to araby and eden fragrant climes all which the sacred bard would often recount and thus in strain unused in grove or shade to sad musaeus rightful homage paid thrice hail thou heavntaught warbler last and best of all the train poet in whom conjoined all that to ear or heart or head could yield rapture harmonious manly clear sublime accept this gratulation may it cheer thy sinking soul nor these corporeal ills ought daunt thee or appall know in high heaven fame blooms eternal over that spirit divine who builds immortal verse there thy bold muse which while on earth could breath maeonian fire shall soar seraphic heights while to her voice ten thousand hierarchies of angels harp symphonious and with dulcet harmonies usher the song rejoicing i meanwhile to sooth thee in these irksome hours of pain approach thy visitant with mortal laud to praise thee mortal first as first beseems for rhyme subdued rhyme erst the minstrel rude of chaos anarch old she near his throne often taught the rattling elements to chime with tenfold din till late to earth upborn on strident wing what time fair poesy emergd from gothic cloud and faintly shot rekindling gleams of luster her the fiend oppressed forcing to utter uncouth dirge runic or leonine and with dire chains fettered her scarcefledgd pinion i such bonds aimed to destroy mistaking bonds like these twere greater art tennoble and refine for this superior part musaeus came thou came and at thy magic touch the chains off dropped and passing strange softwreathed bands of flowers their place supplied which well the muse might wear for choice not force obstruction none but lovliest ornament wondrous this yet here the wonder rests not various argument remains for me all doubting where to cull the primal grace where countless graces charm various this peaceful scene this mineral roof this semblage meet of coral ore and shell these pointed crystals fair mid each obscure bright glistring all these slowlydripping rills that tinkling stray amid the cooly cave yet not this various peaceful scene with this its mineral roof nor this assemblage meet of coral ore and shell nor mid the obscure these pointed crystals glistring fair nor rills that straying tinkle through the cooly cave deal charms more various to each raptured sense than thy mellifluous lay   cease friendly swain musaeus cried and raised his aching head all praise is foreign but of true desert plays round the head but comes not to the heart ah why recall the toys of thoughtless youth when flowery fiction held the place of truth when fancy ruled when trilld each trivial strain but idly sweet and elegantly vain o in that strain if all of wit had flowed all music warbled and all beauty glowed had liveliest nature happiest art combined that lent each grace and this each grace refined alas how little were my proudest boast the sweetest trifler of my tribe at most to sway the judgment while he charms the ear to curb mad passion in its wild career to blend with skill as loftiest themes inspire all reasons rigor and all fancys fire be this the poets praise with this uncrownd wit dies a jest and poetry a sound come then that honest fame whose sober ray or gilds the satire or the moral lay which dawns though thou rough done hew out the line but beams sage horace from each strain of thine o if like these one poet more could brave the venal statesman or the titled slave brand frontless vice strip all her stars and strings nor spare her basking in the smile of kings yet stoop to virtue though the prostrate maid lay sadly pale in bleak misfortunes shade if grave yet lively rational yet warm clear to convince and eloquent to charm he poured for her loved cause serene along the purest precept in the sweetest song for her loved cause he traced his moral plan yon various region of bewildring man explored alike each scene that frowned or smiled the flowery garden or the weedy wild unmoved by sophistry unawed by name no dupe to doctrines and no fool to fame led by no systems devious glare astray as earthborn meteors glitter to betray but all his soul to reasons rule resigned and heavens own views fairopning on his mind caught from bright natures flame the living ray through passions cloud poured in resistless day and this great truth in all its luster showed that god is wise and all creation good if this his boast pour here the welcome lays praise less than this is impotence of praise to pour that praise be mine fair virtue cried and shot all radiant through an opening cloud but ah my muse how will thy voice express the immortal strain harmonious as it flowed ill suits immortal strain a doric dress and far too high already have thou soared enough for thee that when the lay was over the goddess clasped him to her throbbing breast but what might that avail blind fate before had opened her shears to slit his vital thread and who may hope gainsay her stern behest then thrice he waved the hand thrice bowed the head and sighed his soul to rest then wept the nymphs witness ye waving shades witness ye winding streams the nymphs did weep the heavenly goddess too with tears did steep her plaintive voice that echoed through the glades and cruel gods and cruel stars she cried nor did the shepherds through the woodlands wide on that sad day or to the pensive brook or stagnant river drive their thirsty flocks nor did the wildgoat brooze the steepy rocks and philomel her customd oak forsook and roses wan were waved by zephyrs weak as natures self was sick and every lilly drooped its velvet head and groaned each faded lawn and leafless grove sad sympathy yet sure his rightful meed who charmed all nature well might nature mourn through all her sweets and flower and lawn and shade all vocal grown all weep musaeus dead here end we goddess this your shepherd sang all as his hands an ivy chaplet wove o make it worthy of the sacred bard and make it equal to the shepherds love nor thou musaeus from thine ear discard for well i ween thou hearst my doleful song whether mid angel troops the stars among from golden harp thou callst seraphic lays or anxious for thy dearest virtues fare thou still art hovering over our tuneless sphere and movst some hidden spring her weal to raise thus the fond swain on doric oate essayed manhoods prime honors downing on his cheek trembling he strove to court the tuneful maid with stripling arts and dalliance all too weak unseen unheard beneath an hawthorn shade but now dun clouds the welkin gan to streak and now downdropt the larks and ceased their strain they ceased and with them ceased the shepherd swain finis
