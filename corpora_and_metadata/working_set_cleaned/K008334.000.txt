receipts for preparing and compounding the principal medicines made use of by the late mr ward  together with an introduction etc  by john page esquire to whom mr ward left his book of secrets  london printed for and sold by henry whitridge at the southwest corner of the royal exchange in cornhill       sold also by mr marsh bookseller at charing cross by mr r withy bookseller near the royal exchange and at the magdalenhouse in prescotstreet goodmansfields at which three lastmentioned places the late mr wards medicines now made public are appointed to be sold  to the public friendship and perhaps gratitude having incited the late mr ward of whitehall in his last illness to order his book of medicinal secrets to be delivered to me as my property in case of his death i should think myself unworthy of a bequest of this nature and made upon such honorable principles if i was not disposed to apply it to the noblest of all purposes the common good of mankind  this was the first impression i felt upon the information i received of my being made master of this book valuable for its contents although i understood it to be given to me as it certainly was in the most liberal manner to be absolutely at my own disposal and without condition direction or limitation of any kind whatever  many and various have been the thoughts which have occurred to me and the opinions i have heard as to the best method to be taken in order to answer the great end i wished to accomplish and many were the difficulties which presented themselves and encountered the idea of dispensing the principal medicines made use of by mr ward under the direction of a regularly bred physician of known honor and integrity as well as that of throwing them open to the world taking care at the same time to have the said medicines duly prepared in the same manner they used to be and publicly sold at prices so moderate that the lowest of his majestys industrious subjects may have the benefit of them  however as i was inclined to allow mr wards executors a reasonable time to dispose of the prepared medicines which became their property i had thereby leisure to deliberate upon these two principal propositions the latter of the two i always stood most inclined to adopt  but vain would have been my inclination in this particular had not his majestys most benevolent disposition and extensive bounty removed an insurmountable obstacle which stood in my way by making ample provision for certain ingenious chemists who had been employed by mr ward the moment it came to be humbly represented to him  by his majestys royal bounty then these men were made willing to give me that assistance which i could not in conscience have otherwise asked or expected from them as it would have been injurious to themselves and without which i could not have made all these medicines known to the world on account of certain omissions and inaccuracies discovered upon examination in the book since none but such as have been employed in making the chemical medicines could give a clear and perfect account of the processes which had been actually used in the preparing of them  having presumed to suppose that what i have by his majestys bounty been enabled to do and am now in consequence thereof going to do will prove beneficial to mankind in general it may be thought reaonable that i should inform the public upon what foundation i raise my expectation of seeing so happy an effect resulting from it  it is shortly this i knew the late mr ward at paris before he began to administer medicines and when he did i resided there for a considerable time at different periods i had attention to the operation and effects of them there as well as here when their reputation had opened his way to his native country  i took his emetic drop and sweats myself above thirty years ago and at a time when i was reduced by a complication of disorders occasioned by my stomach having lost the power of digesting properly the most simple food to so low and wretched a state both in body and spirits that those who were supposed to understand most and knew me best looked upon me as past all hope of recovery  to the use of these medicines under god i always thought i owed the happy removal of the cause of all my disorders i have often given them with success in my own family and at times to that part of it which sat nearest my heart i have encouraged many to apply themselves to mr ward in very strong cases i have distributed his medicines to the afflicted in various disorders which he used to give me for that purpose and i can wind up all i have said upon this head with averring to the public that i myself never as far as i can recollect knew any person excepting one the person here referred to had great pains in the body and took mr wards sweating powders thirtytwo successive nights taking sometimes half sometimes three quarters of a dose which brought on a weakness of which this person complained but this seems to have been owing to the quantity of these powders taken in so short a time and not to their quality  who thought himself hurt by taking or dissatisfied for having taken mr wards medicines on the contrary i have known many great and radical cures effected upon those of my acquaintance who have taken them in the space of more than thirty years and that without complaining of the medicines for their manner of operating  when i have said this no one will wonder that i not only hope but presume to expect that the publication of these medicines and causing them to be sold at very low prices will prove beneficial to mankind whatever some may think whose minds remain warped by prejudice or others may say whose interest perhaps may have prompted them to infuse those prejudices  to the former of these i cannot help saying i should wonder extremely if time and observation had not showed me the great force of prejudice that any strong suspicion should still remain of these medicines being dangerous when taken in proper quantities and under proper regulations now that all the world knows they have been gaining ground and reputation for so many years only by the force of their own acts notwithstanding they had to break their way through the strong barriers of interest prejudice and ridicule  to the latter i shall only say that the medicines i am now going to make public are such as have been mostly applied to cases called chronical and generally to such as were of oldstanding before the sufferers under them would consult mr ward and if in the same sort of cases they should hereafter be taken without waiting so long i hope the gentlemen of the faculty especially the candid and respectable will not set up an opposition to them and endeavor to discourage the middling and lower sort of people from taking what will cost so little and probably do them a great deal of good  in this reasonable hope i flatter myself i shall not be disappointed yet if that should happen to be the case i shall be sure of their approbation for one certain effect of this publication and which indeed was a great motive to it suppressing the practice of ignorant pretenders to the knowledge of mr wards secrets and thereby preventing the mischiefs which would otherwise be done by such bold practitioners dispensing under the name of these excellent medicines  one knows not what  i shall trouble the public no farther now upon this subject in general but proceed to give the genuine receipts for making each particular medicine specifying the doses and the several disorders to which they have been usually applied according to my observation and the best information i have been yet able to obtain  method of preparing antimony for the pill and drop provide yourself with an earthen unglazed pan that will hold three or four quarts set it on a naked fire and have in readiness of the finest and purest crude antimony as much as you please that which appears in long shining needles and is the easiest powdered is the best being most free from metallic or other heterogeneous bodies powder it indifferently fine put ten or twelve ounces into your pan stirring it continually with an iron spatula and increasing your fire till it sends forth white fumes and a flame like burning brimstone continue that degree of fire continually stirring till it burns or fumes no more but is become a gray or ashcolored powder if it should melt and run into lumps in the beginning of your operation you must take it out of your pan and pound it again putting it in again and stirring as before till it be thoroughly calcined then put in four ounces more of your crude matter proceeding as before and continuing so to do till you have as much as you desire by this method you will calcine your antimony with much less labor and time than in doing it all together as is usual for by putting your crude antimony to your calcined its melting will be prevented and the fumes will fly off much sooner   n b it must be done in a chimney otherwise the fumes will be hurtful to the operator  take a clean crucible which will hold about a quart put into it about two pounds of your calcined antimony set it in a melting furnace and make a gradual fire under it put coals nearly to the top of your crucible keep it in a moderate fusion sometimes stirring it about with an iron rod care must be taken that your fire be not too violent while your matter is in fusion or it will liquify it to such a degree and render it so subtle that it will all run through the pores of your crucible into your ashhole not leaving one single drop or grain behind  when you find your matter which adheres to your rod transparent and bright which it will be in about half an hour after it is in fusion if you have kept a proper degree of fire have in readiness a smooth marble stone well dried and heated as hot as you can bear your hand upon it for fear your hot matter should break it it will be proper to have an iron curb round your marble to rise half or three quarters of an inch above its surface to prevent your matter from running off pour your vitrified matter upon your stone and if you have any more of your calcined matter put your crucible again into the fire put in more and proceed as before if your crucible is good and your fire moderately governed you may use the same crucible five or six times as i myself have frequently done  thus have you a fair and pure glass of antimony of a light red color  as i have been informed that most if not all the glass of antimony used in this kingdom is imported and that the erroneous process in making it is also introduced here i shall make the following observation upon it  as the glass of antimony used here is made abroad we cannot be competent judges whether it is made of pure antimony or such as may be mixed with other heterogeneous matter i have also observed that keeping the crucible covered during the time of its fusion both hinders the vitrification and makes the glass less pure by preventing the remaining combustible parts of the antimony from flying off  the pill and drop are made as follows take of the aforesaid glass of antimony as much as you please pound it in a clean iron mortar and sift it through a fine lawn sieve then grind or levigate it on a smooth marble stone to an impalpable powder take also dragons blood dried and powdered to four ounces of your levigated glass put one ounce of this dragons blood grind them very well together and with good sack or rich mountain wine make into a mass for pills of about one grain and half each which is a full dose for a man or woman  the drop so called is made by putting about half an ounce of your levigated glass of antimony into a quart of the richest malaga mountain or sack shake them well together and let them stand two or three days to settle and grow clear then pour it off gently to be quite fine  the full dose half an ounce is for a man or woman but best to begin with the half or two thirds according to age or strength of constitution  observations common glass of antimony as sold at the shops though reckoned a very rough medicine is i find prescribed in dispensatories from two to eight grains therefore i shall make the following observations upon it  first as i have made large quantities of glass of antimony for mr ward so i find a very essential difference between what i made by the foregoing process and what i have bought in the shops mine being of a brighter red much softer and not so harsh and gritty in the pulverisation and levigation whence i imagine that the glass of antimony imported is not prepared from pure antimony or not genuinely prepared  secondly i apprehend that where it has been prescribed and given inwardly it has only been powdered and sifted whereby it is not reduced to the hundredth part of the fineness to which it is brought by the aforesaid levigation if duly performed it is well known to the learned in chemistry that by trituration see quincys dispensatory on trituration page  0    ed       several rough bodies may be rendered soft and smooth corrosive mercury by repeated operations is changed from a violent poison to a safe medicine frequently prescribed even for children i have found by experience that the pill and drop is a safe and very efficacious medicine when prepared as before directed  i must farther observe that by grinding and incorporating the vitrified antimony with the dragons blood which is a balsamic gum the medicine is rendered still more soft and smooth  attested december        by me john white  the pill and drop were the two first medicines which mr ward administered at paris and were to the best of my remembrance the principal things made use of when he first returned from thence to london  these were in      attacked in a printed pamphlet by mr jos clutton apothecary and chemist who being honestly concerned for the public good vid preface page    told the world he had discovered the component parts of the pill to be red arsenic and glass of antimony equal parts with about one sixteenth part of calcined cobalt vid pamphlet page  0    this he pretended to have proved with so much plausibility and reasoned upon the supposed proof with so much real art and seeming sincerity that he had well nigh sunk the credit of these medicines for mr ward could only deny what was averred upon pretended chemical demonstration unless he would have declared his secret which was at once depriving himself of all future benefit from it as this candid writer well knew  at last truth prevails as it generally does sooner or later and it is now known to the public that there was neither the least particle of arsenic nor cobalt in the composition of these medicines which i have so often seen taken with such surprising success in various cases that i am convinced glass of antimony duly prepared and given in proper quantities will often prove a remedy in cases which may baffle the skill of the ablest physician  wherefore i hope those gentlemen will pardon my presumption if i venture to recommend it to their serious attention and wish them to make experiments upon some of their hospital patients in desperate and perplexing cases  to encourage them thereto and farther to apologize for the liberty i have taken i proceed to relate the following facts  in the year      being then in the country with my family my housekeeper from forty to fifty years of age had long complained of indigestions reachings at some times sickness and at others pains in her stomach etc for which she took the usual remedies and was sometimes better sometimes worse for what she took but the greatest relief she found from the best advice to be had at newbury was very transient and her disorder increased until she became as they call it very bad indeed this inclined her to venture upon one of mr wards pills which had no other effect than that of a vomit and by clearing her stomach seemed to have wrought a perfect cure however i remember that i advised her to take a second pill in about a fortnight or three weeks it did not operate near so much as the first the offending matter being greatly diminished but estaished the cure for she lived with me several years afterward without any complaints of that nature  about the same time a manservant of mine had frequent complaints in his bowels to which he said he had been long subject at length he grew very ill the passages seeming to be obstructed and he was distressed for want of a stool under these circumstances i gave him one of these pills which very soon relieved him for it moved him downwards and carried off his pains i do not remember to have heard him complain during some months which he afterward remained in my service  the third and last case i shall mention is that of a womanservant at the same time in my family she was confined to her bed by violent rheumatick pains all over her body i gave her this pill having before seen very extraordinary good effects from it in rheumatick cases it caused her to sweat profusely for several hours during which time she said she felt little workings in the leg most affected and in a few days she was able to do her business about the house  i mention these three particular cases only to show that in my own house and in a very short space of time this pill cured three people of complaints very different in their nature by as many different though proper operations from whence and other instances which i have seen i am inclined to think that the nature of antimony thus prepared is to work safely upon vicious humors in the body to carry them off by the proper channels and to remove obstructions in some degree if not totally wherever it meets with them but if it meets with neither obstructions to remove nor bad humors to work upon it passes quietly through the body without giving it the least disturbance as i have known it do in the shape of these pills after taking three or four of them within a month and even the first time when taken by a person in perfect health which fact i saw verified by a gentleman who took one of them in contempt of its size there are few medicines which will bear the change of climate the damps and closeness of a ship in long voyages whereas these pills neither suffer by time nor those alterations and there is scarce a remedy applicable to so many disorders as is sufficiently evinced by the cases abovementioned at the same time that the cheapness of them will render an experiment very easy to seafaring men   nevertheless to deal heartily in all respects i must confess that it is not advisable according to my information to adminster these pills in cases wherein the viscera or inwards are judged to be unfound  i have said a great deal upon these pills and more perhaps than may be thought prudent though true but as my view is what i at first professed to promote the common good of mankind the object is too great and i am too much in earnest in the pursuit to suppress truth or my opinion founded upon truth although the cautious may impeach my understanding and the interested may ridicule it  the drop so called though not with strict propriety as appears from the manner of preparing it has been usually given in disorders occasioned by foul stomachs and indigestion it generally operates as an emetick as it did with me yet sometimes it moves both ways as does the pill they both make the patient sick very much like seasickness for a short time before the discharge if upwards and the stomach be loaded with a great quantity of very foul matter but not otherwise if the stomach be thus foul the putting the matter into motion must occasion sickness in proportion to its quantity and quality but it came from me and i have seen it do the same in others with more ease and less straining than is oceasioned by the emeticks usually given  with this medicine it is not necessary to drink large quantities to gorge the stomach half a pint of warm water or thin gruel when the sickness comes on may generally suffice when that is come away and the reaching over for that time half a pint more may be taken going on thus till the sickness returns no more  i have taken about three of these emetick drops treating them in the manner above described and dont remember that any of them worked more than six times not always so often yet they may work oftener where the peccant matter to be brought away is more abundant  the full dose in which it will be made up and sold is for a man or woman  for young persons it must be proportioned to the respective age and strength of each individual even full grown people if of weakly constitutions may abate of the full quantity for the first time at least  the chief object before me in publishing these receipts being as i have said promoting the common good of mankind i should act very inconsistently with that profession if i was not explicit upon this important subject  upon this principle i think myself obliged to inform the public that the book left me by the late mr ward supposed to contain full and clear receipts for preparing all the medicines he made use of does not upon examination fully answer that end  what the omissions and inaccuracies are to be imputed to i am not able to determine all i know is that some few receipts are not yet found in this book and some alterations if not mistakes appear in the entry of others however by the help of the chemists employed by mr ward and other information i have been enabled to get those defects supplied and rectified to my satisfaction as far as this publication extends  it must be confessed that the receipts for preparing the two original medicines viz the pill and drop are as yet no where discovered in the book but mr ward has owned to me that the principal ingredient in them is antimony prepared in a particular manner every circumstance attending their operation i am told confirms it and mr white mr white is the ingenious chemist who carried on the great vitriol works at twickenbam for mr ward and was employed by him in other chemical preparations  persuaded that glass of antimony prepared by him for mr ward was the essential ingredient made use of in these medicines assures me that he has long made and administered them in his family etc and upon a comparison as well of their operation as analization he found them at that time to answer exactly to those made by mr ward  for these reasons and others which i forbear to mention i have no doubt that the above receipts point at the genuine and best manner of preparing the pill and drop  the true and genuine method of preparing the white drop pound and bruise fourteen pounds of the cleanest copperas into a rough powder then dry it with a very gentle heat spreading it thin till it becomes a dry and subtle powder to appearance like quick lime only much whiter care must be taken at the beginning of the drying that the heat be very moderate otherwise it will melt and shut up the pores of the copperas and greatly injure your future operation  when your copperas is thus become dry and subtle which may be done in about   or   days weigh it and take an equal quantity of good and clean rough nitre or salt petre which let also be tolerably dry pound your nitre and dried copperas together and sift them through an indifferently fine hair sieve then put them into a large glass retort coated at the bottom and set it in a sand furnace let not your retort be above an inch from the bottom and sides of your sandpan fix on a very large receiver and lute it but leave a small venthole in the joint by sticking in the point of a small skewer to let out the wind which will issue from the matter at the first making of your fire by drawing it out and putting it in as you shall see occasion to prevent your retort or receivers bursting make a gentle fire for the first three or four hours then increase it gradually for four hours longer till your iron pan be red at bottom continue your fire for about thirty hours then let it out and when all is cool you will have a most powerful aqua fortis put it into a bottle and stop it close let it stand six or eight days the longer the better to digest itself  put this aqua fortis into a glass retort let it be about half or two thirds full set it in your sandheat and fix on a receiver which need not be very large make an indifferent fire till all your aqua fortis is come over into your receiver leaving behind only a brown reddish earth which was forced over by the violence of the fire in the first distillation thus have you a most strong and pure aqua fortis  as i have never been able to procure any aqua fortis proper for making the said drops but what i made myself i have here set down a true and full process for making it  take of your rectified aqua fortis as much as you please put it into a large bolthead with a long neck but not above a quarter full then take of the purest and finest volatile sal ammoniac in which there is not the least acid salt or lime  as i have usually bought this volatile salt ready made and doubt not but it may be had pure and genuine at apothecarys hall i have omitted here setting down the process for making it having bought it of mr godfrey chemist  to sixteen ounces of the aforesaid aqua fortis in your bolthead take seven ounces of the said volatile sal ammoniac and by half an ounce at a time put it into your bolthead to your aqua fortis immediately stopping the mouth of your bolthead till the fermentation is over yet not so close but to leave some small vent for fear the wind caused by the violent fermentation should burst your glass when all your sal ammoniac is in let it stand two or three hours till the fumes are settled  n b this is the right and exact proportion if your operations in making your aqua fortis are rightly performed and your volatile sal ammoniac be good and pure  now put it into a smaller bolthead half full and set it in a moderate sandheat when it is warm put in four ounces of the finest quicksilver to each pound of sixteen ounces of your solution and let it stand in that heat till all the quicksilver is dissolved increase your fire a little and put in a small quantity more of quicksilver thus letting it dissolve by gentle additions as much as it will when it will dissolve no more take it out of the bolthead put it into an open glass vessel or a large white stone bowl i generally cut off a large glass body in the middle set it in a moderate sandheat and let it evaporate till a pellicle or skin comes over the top of it then take it from the fire and let it stand in a cool place to congeal great care must be taken that your heat be not too great in your evaporation nor continued too long or it would coagulate and mix the corrosive oil which is to be poured off after its congealment with the fine pure salt and quite spoil the medicine  there will remain uncongealed a heavy liquor or oil which pour off and let it drain until no more will run or drop from it take the remaining salt put it into a glass body and to each pound sixteen ounces put three pounds of the finest rose water stopping the mouth of your body by tying over it a piece of doubled brown paper set it again in your sandheat make an indifferently hot fire till all your salt is dissolved which is usually done in    hours  thus the white drop is prepared  observation this medicine thus rendered extremely mild cannot possibly be accounted dangerous seeing that in the dose of two drops usually taken in    hours the quantity of mercury does not amount to half a grain  attested december  st      by me john white  this white drop was wholly and constantly prepared by mr white for mr ward i who am neither chemist nor physician do not pretend to say any thing as to the nature of this excellent antiscorbutic medicine and therefore shall confine myself merely to its effects which under my eye have been very extraordinary in the several stages of that distemper and even where the patients have been supposed to derive their disorders from their parents  this being the case and as i am thoroughly convinced that these drops are a most excellent perhaps the greatest known antiscorbutick and best purifier of the blood so i cannot help flattering myself with a hope that they would be a great preservative against that fatal distemper which destroys in a year so many of our brave seamen and often occasions national losses and disappointments in the most important undertakings  the method i would propose is that they be given to the seamen under proper direction from the time of their sailing upon long voyages and i most heartily wish some experiments of this kind may be made of them as i am persuaded that they may be tried without the least hazard and the expense too trifling to be mentioned as an objection  for if they prove successful and answer the end hereby proposed and hoped for it will be happy for the public for the valuable individuals and for me who have presumed to recommend the experiment  late mr wards sweating powder no i according to his book take ipecauanha liquorice and opium each one ounce nitre and vitriolated tartar each four ounces fulminate  beat them in a mortar with the opium sift through a fine sieve to the ipecacuanha and liquorice mix well by sifting  the dose from twenty to forty grains  it appears at first view that mr ward must have made a mistake in ordering nitre and vitriolated tartar to be fulminated together for vitriolated tartar will not fulminate with nitre wherefore i apprehend that the manner in which those ingredients are to be prepared must necessarily be as follows viz  take four ounces of refined nitre and the same quantity of vitriolated tartar rub them together in a mortar into a powder take a crucible not of the blue sort set it in the fire and when it begins to be red put in about half of your nitre and tartar stirring it about with an iron rod there will arise red fumes which take care to avoid for they are noxious when the red fumes cease put in the remainder of your matter stirring it as before till no more fumes arise then pour it out into an iron mortar and when cool put to it opium ipecacuanha and liquorice powder of each one ounce pound and sift them through a fine lawn sieve then mix them well together  n b the ipecacuanha must be picked of such a sort as will break easily and not of the tough woody sort  after these powders are thus prepared they should be spread thin upon white stone dishes and set in a cool place for about two days mixing them very well together and spreading them again twice a day then dry them before the fire or some gentle heat  john white  sweating powders no ii take common tartar and refined nitra each one pound fulminate them together in a crucible or iron pot which will reduce them to about fifteen ounces after the fulmination to these add of white hellebore and liquorice powder each six ounces of opium five ounces powder all these together and sift them through a fine lawn sieve  dose from twentyfive to fifty grains  for it is to be observed that mr ward advised such of his patients as had never taken any of his sweats to begin with half a paper only containing the full dose and to increase the quantity or not according to its operation or the age and strength of the patient  mr wards sweating powders from what i have seen and felt are in my opinion the most excellent of all sweats for removing rheumatic and other pains occasioned by obstructions  they generally raise plentiful sweats the patient drinking moderately now and then something warm they do not fatigue the body nor exhaust the spirits instead of being restless as is commonly the case in a sweat all those who can bear opiates find themselves comfortably at ease during the sweat those with whom opiates do not perfectly agree need not be afraid of the first of these sweats for though i cannot bear even venice treacle or diacodium on account of their narcotic quality yet i have taken these powders without finding that inconvenience this i am told is to be attributed to the correcting ingredients and the manner of preparing and compounding them whether those who have informed me reason justly or not is not my province to determine but the fact in regard to myself is strictly true  i have seen one of these sweats restore a limb rendered almost useless by a paralytic disorder and in rheumatic cases cures performed where the use of all the limbs had been quite taken away  mr ward always advised those who took these and all sweats to put themselves rather between blankets than sheets which i have experienced to be the most agreeable way notwithstanding a little prejudice against trying the experiment  the former of these receipts is taken from mr wards book and i do believe it to be his first manner of making them and what he continued to give for some years for i remember his telling me when i related to him the sensations i felt during their operation that there was opium and ipecacuanha in them  yet i am of opinion that mr ward has in some degree departed from his first manner and made them according to the latter receipt for i am credibly informed that they have been so made and sold since his death excepting in the quantity of opium of which there are three eighths less in this receipt than was put into the powders so made and sold this alteration is made upon hearing that those who took them complained of the effects of so large a quantity of opium however i believe that both are very good with this abatement of that ingredient in the latter and therefore care will be taken that both these sweats be prepared and sold whereby the trial may be made and the preference given to that which shall be found most agreeable to each respective constitution  the first of these powders seems to be most proper for those who have not been used to take opiates or have found them to disagree as they in general do with me and the latter for such with whom they are known to agree for there still remains notwithstanding the beforementioned abatement a larger quantity of opium in the latter than in the former of these two receipts  by way of experiment i prevailed on a person to take one of the latter sweats charged with the full quantity of opium that is three eighths more than in the above receipt and he told me that it affected his head very much  at a proper interval he took one of those according to the first receipt and assured me that both sweated him very well but the former much more agreeably than the latter  paste for the fistula etc take a pound of alicampane root three pounds of fennil seeds and one pound of black pepper pound these separately and sift them through a fine sieve take two pounds of good honey and two pounds of powder sugar melt the honey and the sugar together over a gentle fire scumming them continually till they become bright as amber when they are cool mix and knead them into your powder in the form of a soft paste  this paste has been found to be a specify remedy for the fistula piles etc  the dose is the size of a nutmeg morning noon and night drinking a glass of water or white wine after it  attested by me f j dosterman  as to this fistula paste it is not above twelve years since mr ward first made use of it and it has happened that but one of my acquaintance has been afflicted with this wretched complaint he was under sentence for cutting and was to have been cut had not a sudden and severe frost hindered the operation in the mean time the gentleman hearing that i had spoken of mr wards medicine which cured many of this distemper when the operation had failed sent to me to enquire whether what he had heard was true and whether i thought he had a chance of being relieved by mr ward without undergoing so painful an operation at a time when he had an hectic fever and was upon the whole very ill  having a confidence in what i had heard of the cures made by mr ward with this paste i dispatched the gentlemans servant to london with a letter to mr ward and the gentlemans case in writing drawn up by his surgeon mr ward sent down a ball weighing one pound of this paste directing him to take the size of a nutmeg two or three times a day he did so and in less than three weeks his feverish disorder left him his appetite returned and in about three months he was perfectly cured of his fistula without any visible operation or taking any other medicine to the great surprise of his surgeon however mr ward ordered him to take another ball to confirm the cure which he did at proper intervals and has had no return of his disorder that i have heard of though some years have past and the gentleman lives within a few miles of my house in the country  n b the receipt for making this paste stands entered in mr wards book in some respects different from that i have given from mr dosterman for in the former there is double the quantity of alicampane to what there is in the latter the book likewise directs clarified honey alone whereas the above receipt orders honey and sugar equal quantities clarified together  i suppose therefore that mr ward entered his receipt some time ago and mistook the quantity of alicampane for i am assured and convinced that mr dosterman always prepared this paste for him in the manner he sold it that mr ward never sold any but of mr dostermans preparing and mr dosterman affirms he never put a greater quantity of alicampane into this paste than is mentioned in this receipt signed by him and that the addition of the sugar was made in order to preserve the paste from turning moldy as it is otherwise apt to do  i think it proper in this place to acquaint the public that mr dosterman is another ingenious chemist who has been for several years past consulted and employed by the late mr ward in wholly preparing several of the medicines which he dispensed and particularly those which i thought it necessary for mr dosterman to attest as they differ in some particulars from the entries made in mr wards book  liquid sweat take a gallon of good spirits of wine and half a gallon of good white wine put them into a strong bottle and add half a pound of good saffron four ounces of good cinnamon two ounces of salt of tartar and one ounce of good opium cut into small bits stop the bottle close and set it within the air of the fire eight days shaking it three or four times a day filtre it through filtring paper  the dose is from thirty to sixty drops in a glass of good white wine  attested by me f j dosterman  this liquid sweat i have had no experience of myself nor do i happen to be acquainted with any body who has taken it but i am well assured mr ward used to sell a great many of them in a year finding them answer with some constitutions and in certain cases better than the sweating powders before mentioned  i have not yet found this sweat precisely entered in mr wards book but as he is known to have sold many as i have already said and as i am thoroughly satisfied that mr dosterman always prepared them for him in the manner abovementioned i have thought it right to give this receipt to the public as one worthy of notice  dropsy purging powder from mr ward s book jalap cream of tartar florentine iris each four ounces make them into a fine powder separately and mix them well  dropsy purging powder as prepared by mr dosterman for mr ward take a pound of jalap in powder a pound of cream of tartar and an ounce of bole armenic in fine powder mix them well together  the dose is from thirty to forty grains in broth or warm beer two or three days together or oftener if necessary  this remedy seldom fails in the watery or windy dropsy provided the patient has not been tapt  attested by me f j dosterman  though the above receipts so nearly agree yet as the ingredients differ in some respects i have given both the first is taken from mr wards book the second is vouched by mr dosterman to be the same he prepared for mr ward and he assures me that the powder thus prepared was what mr ward gave with great success in dropsical cases  i am informed by a person skilful in pharmacy that the latter is the softer and smoother medicine for which reason and the assurance given me by mr dosterman that mr ward dispensed it chiefly of late years at least i make no scruple of preferring it  i am not able to say any thing of my own experience or knowledge upon the subject of these powders for i never took any of them myself nor ever knew any body that did but i have heard so much of mr wards success in this distemper and of the efficacy of these powders that i have not the least doubt of their merit  essence for the headache etc from mr wards book spirits of wine four ounces camphor two ounces volatile spirit of camphor two ounces mix well and apply with the hand  essence for the headache etc as prepared by mr dosterman for mr ward take two pounds of true french spirits of wine put them into a large strong bottle and add two ounces of roch alum in very fine powder four ounces of camphor cut very small half an ounce of essence of lemon and four ounces of the strongest volatile spirit of sal ammoniac stop the bottle quite close and shake it three or four times a day for five or six days  the method of using it is to rub the hand with a little of it and hold it hard upon the part affected until it is dry if the pain is not quite relieved repeat it twice or three times  attested by me f j dosterman  the first of these receipts is taken from mr wards book and i suppose it to be a very good one yet i give the preference to the last signed by mr dosterman who assures me that the essence long used by mr ward to remove pains in the head side etc by outward application was prepared and delivered by him from time to time to mr ward at a certain price  i am of opinion that mr ward never sold any of this essence nor would he ever give any of it even to me but he once cured me of the headache with it and afterward told me that he had entirely removed a pain long settled in the upper joint of his late majestys thumb when many other remedies had been tried without effect and that in the same manner as he cured my headache  from many other instances which i have occasionally been informed of i do believe that this essence applied as above will very often remove local pains  what deficiencies have occurred in mr wards book respecting the foregoing receipts i have got supplied to general satisfaction i hope as well as my own  that there are a great many more receipts of various kinds contained in the said book i acknowledge yet i have thought it best for the public to confine myself at present to such as are justly esteemed the principal the most efficacious most known and best understood  having said this i proceed to put down the prices at which these medicines are intended now to be sold viz  l s d white drop in a bottle containing one third of an ounce which is about a third part more in quantity than in the late mr wards bottles for 0   0 red pills six in a box 0 0   emetic sack drop half an ounce in a bottle 0 0   sweating powders no i forty grains 0 0   sweating powders no ii fifty grains 0 0   fistula paste a pound 0     liquid sweat half an ounce about five doses 0   0 dropsy purgingpowders six in a parcel 0 0   essence for the headache etc half an ounce 0   0  the difference in price between what the above medicines were sold for and that at which they will now be sold is undoubtedly great and yet there still remains a considerable difference between the expencs of making them and the prices now put upon them but when it is considered that a profit must be made to pay those who are to have the trouble of selling them and a person who must be employed to carry them from the makers to the venders and keep an account with each what a vast number must be sold at such low rates to raise a sum sufficient to answer these and perhaps other necessary contingent charges and that the surplus after discharging these expenses will under certain limitations be equally divided between two charitable foundations when all this is i say considered no dissatisfaction can i think arise upon account of price neither can i suppose that any prudent or welldisposed person can or will be inclined to buy these medicines of any new makers of them though offered at a lower price when he considers that those who have been long practiced in preparing medicines of this kind are most likely to do it in the best manner and that the net profits accruing from the sale of those made by the two ingenious chemists beforementioned will go toward the support of two laudable undertakings the one intended to preserve young destitute girls from prostitution and wretchedness the asylum  the other to retrieve them from both the magdalen   i have now explained which of the late mr wards medicines i propose to lay open to the public at this time and why i stop here the very low price at which it is intended they shall be sold has been mentioned but let not this circumstance which shows how little they cost in making and renders them attainable to the lower class of mankind cause them to be despised by the highest who ought always to remember that they are of the same species with the lowest and that price does not alter the nature of things though i have seen it influence taste which like other of our senses is too often governed by imagination  nor let this circumstance of cheapness detract in the least from the character of my late friend nor add too much to mine for it should be made known and not forgot that he obtained some of his medicines by experiments some from his assistants in the chemical way whom he paid and others perhaps he bought at high prices that when he returned from paris his sole dependence was upon the sale of his medicines and that he was at considerable expenses to keep himself upon a respectable footing wherefore if for these purposes and the better to enable him to gratify his inclination in giving to the poor he made the rich pay who will blame him  but to me he gave these valuable secrets and i who am not thanks be to god in the situation in which mr ward was at the time i have been speaking of give them to the public  advertisement whereas two charitable institutions the asylum for the support of female orphans and the magdalen for the protection of penitent prostitutes are to have under certain regulations the profits arising by the sale of such of the late mr wards medicines as are now made public and will be prepared by mr white and mr dosterman who have long prepared the greatest part of them for the said mr ward it has been thought advisable for me to give this notice that i have requested and appointed sir john fielding knt one of the guardians of the asylum and robert dingley esquire treasurer of the magdalen to take upon them the trouble of giving such orders directions and public notices by advertisement or otherwise as they shall from time to time judge necessary for carrying on the sale of the said medicines at the prices before specified and to do all such matters and things as shall be found expedient for the purpose above declared  j page  appendix rules necessary to be observed in taking the several medicines of the late mr ward now made public white drop for the scurvy etc take two drops in a small glass of water in the morning fasting or at night going to rest for two or three days together then forbear as many days as you took them and proceed as before till the bottle is finished  they seldom work visibly excepting that in some constitutions they occasion one or two motions  red pill bruise the pill and take it in a spoonful of any small liquid on an empty stomach it sometimes works upwards sometimes downwards according to the nature and seat of the disorder in which cases it is proper to drink a small quantity of balm or sagetea etc between each motion and if it sweats as it sometimes does keep yourself warm and encourage it by drinking as above  the day you take it avoid milk greens and fruit  it has been experienced with great success in cases where the stomach or bowels are foul or the passages obstructed and particularly in inveterate rheumatic disorders  the emetic or sack drop this drop is a vomit when the sickness comes on drink about half a pint of warm water or thin water gruel and continue to do so every time it works  it has been found to cleanse the stomach more effectually than the vomits usually given and that without occasioning uncommon reachings  the bottle is a full dose for a man or woman which must be lessened according to the age and strength of the patient  sweating powders for the rheumatism etc both sorts of these powders are to be taken in any liquid going to bed between the blankets and drinking moderately now and then something warm such as white wind whey balmtea etc the sweating is not to be checked but encouraged by lying still and keeping warm  at first taking it may be proper to begin with half a dose increasing it gradually as occasion may require  if half the quantity does not raise a proper sweat then take the next night three quarters or the whole dose and repeat it every other night at discretion and for as long a time as shall be found necessary or as they agree with the constitution  in stubborn rheumatic cases and other settled pains in the limbs the red pill has been found to answer better than these powders  n b it is to be observed that the quantity of opium is somewhat less in the powder no i than in no ii  paste for the fistula piles etc take the size of a nutmeg twice or three times a day drinking a glass of water or wineandwater after it  liquid sweat this is found by experience to be an excellent remedy for removing pains and sometimes to answer better than the powders  the patient must lie between the blankets and encourage the sweat by drinking now and then something warm taking care not to catch cold by going out too soon after it the dose is from forty to sixty drops in a glass of good white wind  dropsy powder the dose is from thirty to forty grains to be taken in broth or warm beer two or three days together and longer if necessary  they must be repeated at proper intervals as the case may require  essence for the headache and pains gently rub a little of it upon the palm of the hand and apply it to the part affected holding it there till it is dry repeat it two or three times if the pain is not sooner relieved  n b the sweating powder no ii when compounded as ordered in page    and  0 must be spread thin upon white stone dishes etc as directed for the sweating powders no i  finis
