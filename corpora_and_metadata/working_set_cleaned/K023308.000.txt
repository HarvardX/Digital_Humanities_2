the quip modest a few words by way of supplement to remarks critical and illustrative on the text and notes of the last edition of shakspeare occasioned by a republication of that edition revised and augmented by the editor of dodsleys old plays  well sift this matter further all is well that ends well london printed for j johnson in st pauls church yard  m dcc lxxxviii  preface in the beginning of      i published a book or pamphlet entitled remarks critical and illustrative on the text and notes of the last edition of shakspeare which i understand has been represented as the most incorrect publication that ever appeared and indeed from the list of errata in the book itself and the additional one given at the end of this preface the charge does not seem to be without foundation there is however one work which i believe may vye with mine in point of inaccuracy and that is the revised edition of johnson and steevenses shakspeare which has since made its immaculate appearance without the notification of a single error a complete table of errata would be too arduous a task perhaps for an individual the booksellers may therefore think themselves obliged to any person that will contribute to it i accordingly offer my mite in the following brief but decent specimen of the accuracy of this famous edition  v i p    boltsprit for bowsprit v i p    ale wrights for ale knights v i

who appears to have had the care of that edition with the negligence of his printers nor do i think myself at all more culpable on account of the blunders of mine every person who has the entire revision of his own presswork will be soon convinced that nothing is so truly incorrigible as a virgin proof sheet in its primitive state of unamendment there is however some little difference in printers else mercy on the poor author  another charge which has been brought against me is no less than downright felony it seems that some of my happiest emendations had already appeared in the margin of the very edition i had presumed to criticize and the candor of the critical reviewers led them to conclude that i must have stole them ready made those venerable personages who have the disinterestedness to devote six days in seven i conclude that on sunday the worthy critics rest from their labors and go to meeting they are very good christians to the service of the public in passing sentence upon books which they never read and on the character of writers whom they do not know could not for their souls comprehend that two persons might happen to hit upon the same idea or that one having possessed himself of the idea of another might from a defective memory or any other cause come in time to imagine it his own all that i can say upon this head though i shall not expect credit for my assertion from the goodnatured gentlemen i have just mentioned is that at the time of the publication of the book i was not aware of being anticipated in more than a single instance and even that one i thought my own  incorrect however and felonious as these same remarks might be i found that the revised edition i have mentioned had got near  00 of them in its margin all of which were received without opposition not to speak of the alterations or corrections which i had a right to presume myself the occasion of there are a few indeed which have not passed muster but on the contrary are treated with such an air of peevishness that i esteem myself a very unnatural father of so hopeful an offspring in not having come forward in their vindication sooner it will be thought perhaps by some altogether unreasonable that after the editor of the revised edition has adopted so considerable a majority of my remarks i should be disposed to find sault with him for his cavalier treatment of a few i can only say that is was not to me of the smallest consequence whether he condescended to honor my publication with his notice or not but i think it my duty to defend every part of it from injury and misrepresentation i know of no difference between the integrity or character of a writer and that of any other individual nor ought an unjust charge against the former to remain unrefuted any more than one against the latter this defense i allow is rather of the latest in making its appearance and my liberal and candid friends above mentioned will scarcely neglect the opportunity of paying my prudence a compliment in having attended so well to horaces rule the fact is that my notes were taken in turning over the revised edition immediately after its publication but have till very lately been laid aside and in short almost forgotten and perhaps i only anticipate a pleasant observation of my small friends so often alluded to in adding that it would have proved no great loss if they had been altogether so  i must not pretend to be ignorant that i have been accused of treating the most eminent editors commentators and critics with too little ceremory and indeed i fear i have wronged the honorable men whose goosequills have stabbed shakspeare if it be so it is unquestionably a grievous fault but i can with great truth and justice urge in my defense that i have no personal cause to spurn at them but for the general and that how far i have proceeded in this matter or how far further shall is warranted by the example of preceding critics yea the whole critic tribe   before i conclude i beg leave to assure the respectable gentleman who had the care of the revised edition that so far from meaning to treat him with the slightest degree of levity or freedom i do not consider him as responsible for any one of the notes which are the principal objects of the present pamphlet i conclude them to have been furnished by some obliging friend who has desired to be effectually concealed under the sanction of the editors signature this worthy gentleman is probably the infamous scoundrel who published an address to the curious in ancient poetry as however little relation it may have to shakspeare the author has had interest enough to procure it a place in the list of detached pieces of criticism etc prefixed to the revised edition a congeniality of disposition in the critical reviewers procured this fellow a different reception from those literary hangmen from that which he may one day experience from a well known practical professor of the same mystery if i could possibly think this were not the case i am under too many obligations to that gentleman in the course of my different literary pursuits not to have kissed the rod in silence however i doubt not there are many things in the following pages which i might have been allowed to say without running any possible risk of giving offense to him alive as an editor is on such occasions said to feel himself  at the end of the remarks etc i inserted an advertisement of an edition of the plays of shakspeare as then preparing for the press and some enquiries have been made when it would appear in truth the attention requisite to the publication of so voluminous a work and the little likelihood there is of its being productive to the undertaker of any thing but trouble and expense together with other causes of less consequence have hitherto deterred me from putting it to the press but i have neither laid aside all thoughts of bringing it forward nor can i pledge myself to produce it in any given time i have little reason to suppose that the public interests itself at all in the matter and therefore think myself at full liberty to suit my own

gentlemen of verona vol i p     the paging in this pamphlet is generally from the revised edition   in answer to what i have been pleased to assert in defense of shakspeare remarks p   against the charge of taking a liberty with his words by stretching them out to suit the purpose of his meter mr tyrwhitt has observed as follows as to this supposed canon of the english language it would be easy to show that it is quite fanciful and unfounded and what he calls the right method of printing the above words is such as i believe was never adopted before by any mortal in writing them nor can be followed in the pronunciation of them without the help of an entirely new system of spelling but any further discussion of the matter is unnecessary because the hypothesis though allowed in its utmost extent will not prove either of the points to which it is applied it will neither prove that shakspeare has not taken a liberty in extending certain words nor that he has not taken that liberty chiefly with certain words in which l or r is subjoined to another consonant the following are all instances of nouns substantive or adjective which can receive no support from the supposed canon that shakspeare has taken a liberty in extending these words is evident from the consideration that the same words are more frequently used by his contemporaries and by himself without the additional syllable why he has taken this liberty with words in which l or r is subjoined must be obvious to every one who can pronounce the language  country trisyllable  twelfth night act i sc   the like of

trisyllable  coriolanus act iii sc   you do the nobler cor i muse my mother the learned and respectable writer of these observations is now unfortunately no more but his opinions will not on that account have the less influence with the readers of the revised edition of shakspeare i am therefore still at liberty to enforce the justice and propriety of my own sentiments which i trust i shall be found to do with all possible delicacy toward the memory and character of the ingenious gentleman from whom i have the misfortune to differ  i humbly conceive that upon more mature consideration mr tyrwhitt would have admitted that if the method of printing the words in question were once proved to be right it would be of little consequence whether the discovery had ever been adopted before or could be followed in pronunciation without the help of an entire new system of spelling which in fact is the very object i mean to contend for or rather for a system of spelling as i am perfectly confident we have none at present or at least i have never been able to find it i shall have reason to think myself peculiarly unfortunate if after my hypothesis is allowed in its utmost extent it will not prove what it was principally formed to do viz that shakspeare has not taken a liberty in extending certain words to suit the purpose of his meter but surely if i prove that he has only written the words in question as they ought to be written i prove the whole of my position which of course should cease to be termed or considered an hypothesis i may safely admit that the words in question are more frequently used by his contemporaries and by himself without the additional syllable but this will only show that his contemporaries and himself have more frequently taken the liberty of shortening those words than in writing them at length such a word as alarmed for instance is generally perhaps constantly used by poets as a dissyllable and yet if we found it with its full power alarmed we should scarcely say that the writer had taken a liberty in lengthening it a syllable thus too the word diamond is generally spoken as if two syllables but it is certainly three and is so properly given by shakspeare sir i must have that diamond from you the words observation and affection are usually pronounced the one as consisting of three the other of four syllables but each notwithstanding is really a syllable longer with observation the which he vents yet have i fierce affections and think but examples of this nature would be endless  of the words quoted by mr tyrwhitt as instances of the liberty taken by shakspeare those which i admit to be properly a syllable shorter certainly obtained the same pronunciation in the age of that author as he has annexed to them thus country monstrous remembrance assembly were not only pronounced in shakspeares time the two former as three the other as four syllables but are so still and the reason to borrow mr tyrwhitts own words must be obvious to every one who can pronounce the language   henry was not only usually pronounced as indeed it is still but frequently written as a trisyllable even in prose thus in dr huttons discourse on the antiquities of oxford at the end of hearnes textus roffensis king henery the eights college see upon this subject wallisii grammatica p      that mr tyrwhitt should have treated the words angry humbler nobler used as trisyllables among those which could receive no support from the supposed canon must have been owing to the obscure or imperfect manner in which i attempted to explain it as these are the very instances which the canon if a canon it must be is purposely made to support or rather by which it is to be supported this canon in short is nothing but a very short and simple rule of english grammar which has been repeated over and over every word compounded upon the principles of the english language always preserves the radical word unchanged thus humbler and nobler for instance are composed of the adjectives humble and noble and er the sign of the comparative degree angry of the noun anger and y the saxon ig in the use of all these as trisyllables shakspeare is most correct and that he is no less so in england which used to be pronounced as three syllables and is so still indeed with those who do not acquire the pronunciation of their mother tongue from the book and speech certainly preceded writing will be evident from the etymology which should be more and attended to let us examine the word  how is it to be divided england or england it will be evident that there is a defect somewhere but write it as it should be written engleland and you have the meaning and etymology of the word and the origin of the nation at first sight from the saxon englalanda the land or country of the angles as in scotland ireland finland lapland the country of the scot the ine the fin the lap and yet in despite of all sense and reason about half the words in the language are in the same awkward predicament  i flatter myself i have completely justified this divine author from the charge of racking his words as the tyrant did his captives i hope too i have made it appear that there is something defective and improper in the common methods of spelling or rather misspelling a learned and ingenious gentleman who has undertaken a new dictionary of the language upon an excellent plan will have it very much in his power to introduce a systematical reform which once established would remain unvaried and invariable as long as the language endured this johnson might have had the honor of but it is evident that he was very little acquainted with the principles and formation of the words he undertook to explain every dictionary to be perfect should display a system of orthography by dividing the words upon etymological principles at first sight one would think there was very little difficulty in this and yet i know not that any grammarian or lexicographer has attempted it something of this kind has been effected in italy france and spain by the different academies there and however violent the proposed reform may appear it is certain that if two or three of the first printers in london were to adopt it it would cease to be remarkable in half a year but till this is done it does not seem worth the while of an individual to render his self singular when he cannot see the least probability of being able to convince the public of the propriety of his conduct and there seems no necessity for making such a matter as this a point of conscience  p      host remarks p    by my hallidom i was fast asleep  that i should fall into an error myself is perfectly natural but that i should have led the infallible editors of shakspeare into one is strange indeed i had hastily supposed hallidom to be a corruption of holy dame i e the blessed virgin as she is generally called but it is not being immediately from the saxon haligdom which as i take it means my sentence at the general resurrection or as i hope to be saved i see too they have adopted my explanation of valancd remarks p     which either through ignorance or inattention i had made to signify overhung with a canopy or tester like a bed whereas it means furbelowed with a fringed curtain like that which generally surrounds the said canopy or tester and also the bed itself and is to this day called the valance   merry wives of windsor vol i p      slen remarks p    two edward shovelboards that cost me two shillings and twopence apiece  my remark on this passage is considered by my anonymous friend in the following terms dr farmers note and the authority he quotes might i think pass uncensured unless better proofs could be produced in opposition to them they have however been objected to and we are positively told that master slenders edward shovelboards have undoubtedly been broad shillings of edward the third i believe the broad shillings of that monarch were never before heard of as he undoubtedly did not coin any shilling whatever  without attempting to palliate the gross blunder i was undoubtedly guilty of in the remark alluded to i may be permitted to observe that neither dr farmers note nor the authority he quotes was censured in that remark unless difference in opinion necessarily imply censure no one can have either less reason or less inclination to censure this respectable scholar and critic than myself and i am confident that he would never have thought it necessary to defend either his notes or his authorities in such a style as the above by whom the english shilling was first coined is a piece of knowledge from which the possessor can derive so little merit that i should think my pleasant and gentlemanlike friend in the dark will scarcely dispute my having had opportunities of acquiring it how i happened to make so ill a use of them is another matter which i can neither apologize nor account for and though i do not think the inaccuracy or inattention of one writer is any excuse for that of another i may be permitted to notice a few similar slips to prove my offense is not without its parallels  in vol iii p     boccaccio is said to be the inventor of the story of patient grissel though petrarch to whom he had sent it expressly tells him that he had read the story in his infancy  in vol v p     the reader is referred to matthew paris for the proof of a fact in the time of richard the second above a century after the historians death  in vol v p     king henry iv is asserted to be himself the last person that ever bore the title of duke of lancaster though his son afterward henry v is well known to have born it during the whole of his fathers reign  in vol v p     the court of wards which was first erected by henry viii is supposed to exist in the reign of king henry iv  in vol vi p    king henry v is made to address john holland duke of exeter who was beheaded in the first year of king henry iv  in p   0 of the same volume some lines from robert of gloucester are quoted as geoffrey of monmouths and then as geoffrey of monmouth says  i say i only notice these instances to prove that the margin of shakspeare is no more infallible than the text of the remarks and consequently that there was no great need of exultation on the detection of a single mistake  p      pist remarks p    hope is a curtailed dog in some affairs  i believe i was not mistaken in asserting that excauditation was not nor could be in any case ordained by the forest laws but an expression of sir toby belch  call me cut  having induced a suspicion that curtailing or cutting the tail of either horse or dog implied some degree of infamy of shame i was glad to meet with a passage in bracton which may serve to give us a pretty clear idea of the matter of the punishment of a ravisher says this ancient writer according to the laws of the romans franks and english if he were a knight his horse to his disgrace shall have the skin cut off the upper lip and the tail ought to be cut off close to the buttock so a dog if he have one with him greyhound or other shall be disgraced in the same manner l   t   c     the injustice and absurdity of this law will be sufficiently apparent it however leads one to suppose that in the feudal times the distinction between the horse or dog of a knight and that of a villain appeared by the tail and hence the term cut might be as reproachful as the word villain the former implying the horse or dog of a clown the latter the clown himself a supposition chance may one day confirm  measure for measure vol ii p     mr tyrwhitt on reviewing his former note did not remarks p  0 he says think so well of the conjecture in the latter part of it as he had done some years before and therefore wished to withdraw it but he was not inclined to adopt the idea of the author of the remarks as he saw no ground for supposing that isabella had any mask in her hand his notion being that the phrase these black masks signifies nothing more than black masks according to an old idiom of our language by which the demonstrative pronoun is put for the prepositive article and refers to his glossary to chaucer this these shakspeare he adds seems to have used the same idiom not only in the passage quoted by mr steevens from romeo and juliet but also in first henry iv act i scene    and but for these vile guns he would himself have been a soldier as to the quotation from romeo and juliet i had already explained that by the very construction mr tyrwhitt has approved remarks p      but i am not so well satisfied of the justness of its application to the passage cited from first henry iv as i conceive percy is repeating the words of one who spoke with those vile guns before his eye  though this learned and ingenious commentator might see no ground for supposing that isabella held a mask in her hand it does not follow that the notion is entirely groundless it was certainly the fashion in shakspeares time and perhaps long after for ladies to wear masks and as isabella is about to take the veil it may be probable that she could not consistently walk through the streets without a mask which on coming into angelos presence she would of course hold in her hand  i am the rather confirmed that this is the true sense of the passage from the frequency of shakspeares allusions to the custom of wearing masks  thus in the two gentlemen of verona and threw her funexpelling mask away  again in troilus and cressida the latter enumerating her several wards or defenses says she relies upon her mask to defend her beauty  again in cymbeline  lads  with faces fit for masks or rather fairer than those for preservation cased or shame   again in othello to fetch her fan her gloves her mask nor nothing  in loves labor lost the princess and ladies wear taffata masks and autolycus in the winters tale masks for faces and for noses  i shall say nothing more as to the word enshield than that i still think it to be a contraction for enshielded but i shall be very willing to abate my confidence when any authority is produced for the usage contended for of enshelld or inshelld no word i conceive ought to be displaced from the text by one equally objectionable and every word in the old editions is to be deemed certainly shakspeares till the contrary appears  midsummer nights dream vol iii p     ob the human mortals want their winter here remarks p      in reply to the remark on this passage the gentleman who has assumed the signature of the editor after lamenting the misfortune of the commentators and readers of shakspeare in having so much of their time employed in explaining and contradicting unfounded conjectures and assertions produces and extract from mr wartons observations on spensers fairy queen to prove that in shakspeares time the notion of fairies dying was generally known and adds that tickells poem called kensington gardens will show that the opinion prevailed in the present century a future editor of our author he says may without any detriment to his work omit this note which he should have been better pleased to have had no occasion to incumber the page with  every person of feeling must surely sympathise with an editor of shakspeare who contrary to the established practice of gentlemen in his situation instead of the more agreeable employment of making unfounded conjectures and assertions is reduced to the hard necessity of contradicting them more especially when after all his toil and trouble and writing about it and about it the point is left pretty much the same as it was found the real and oftensible editor of the revised edition is a person of too extensive reading as well as of too much good sense to quote the fanciful genealogies of spenser at second hand to illustrate a popular superstition with which as he well knows the faerie queen has not the remotest connection no one who has read even a single canto of spensers poem can be ignorant of the dissimilarity between his fairies and the fairies of shakspeare or that a system imagined to serve the purposes of allegory and allusion to real characters has nothing in common with the vulgar opinion to which in fact he has not been indebted for a single idea mr tickells poem i neither know where to find nor think it worth my while to enquire after i have such authority however for what the above candid and goodtempered pseudoeditor is pleased to call an unfounded conjecture and assertion that far from being disposed to retract and iota of what i have already advanced on the subject i will venture to maintain the propriety of my opinion in its fullest extent viz that the fairies of shakspeare and the common people are immortal and were never esteemed otherwise and first to show how little spenser is to be regarded as an authority in the matter it will be only necessary to have recourse to the doctrine of that poets master the inimitable ariosto who expressly tells us that a fairy can not die morir non puote alcuna fata may fin chel sol gira o il ciel non muta stilo  ma le fate morir sempre non ponno orlando furioso c  0 f       the character of a fairy in the old romances see particularly histoire de melusine of which there is a very ancient english translation in the museum  like that of the acient woodnymphs unites the ideas of power and beauty and such are the fairies of ariosto and spenser as shakspeare himself evidently knew when he made mark antony say to this great fairy i will commend thy acts it is to this species of fairies that milton alludes where he speaks of  fairy damsels met in forest wide by knights of logres and of liones lancelot or pelleas or pellenore the fairies on the contrary of the midsummer nights dream according to a beautiful passage of the same author are  faerie elves whose midnight revels by a forest side or fountain some belated peasant sees or dreams he sees while over head the moon sits arbitress and nearer to the earth wheels her pale course they on their mirth and dance intent with jocond music charm his ear at once with joy and fear his heart rebounds   beaumont and fletcher i should conceive as good a voucher for the popular opinion of shakspeares time as either spenser or tickell and see what they say in the faithful shepherdess a virtuous well about whose flowery banks the nimblefooted fairies dance their rounds by the pale moonshine dipping oftentimes their stolen children so to make em free from dying flesh and dull mortality pretty conclusive evidence this one should think there is indeed a foolish romance entitled huon de bourdeaux which had been turned into english long before shakspeares time where oberon king of the fairies is made to dye and bequeath his dominions to huon and mr steevens vol iii     mentions his having been informed that the originals of oberon and titania are to be sought in this romance they may be there sought indeed but i know by woeful experience they are not there to be found  shakspeare i am convinced was upon this occasion indebted to no book whatever unless it were the great book of society which he perused and studied with so much care and that he himself has expressly represented his fairies immortal will appear from the following quotations which could only have escaped the notice of a supposititious editor less attentive to his authors text than tenacious of the mistakes of his predecessors of himself    fairy to bottom hail mortal hail    puck believe me king of shadows i mistook  ob but we are spirits of another sort    puck if we shadows have offended  i have only to add that the editor might without any detriment to his work have omitted the above note but i cannot think that the page has any particular reason to complain of the encumbrance as it would be no difficult matter to point out several hundreds groaning under an equal burden  merchant of venice vol iii p   0  the editor remarks p  0 or some one under his signature attempts to support mr steevens by a quotation from an old book which seems little or nothing to the purpose the words use usance and usury in the time of shakspeare appear to have had one and the same meaning and to have signified precisely what interest does at present mr steevens by employing the word usury in its present sense makes the jew condemn himself and it may be observed that antonio in this play does not censure the practice of taking excessive interest but that of taking interest at all which has been frequently condemned by others as jewish and antichristian  all is well that ends well vol iv p      lafeu to parolles prithee allow the wind   allow the wind i e stand to the windward

stand to the leeward of him as mr steevens if he had not been misled by his friend johnsons dictionary sufficiently fruitful in such like mistakes might probably have explained it  twelfth night vol iv p      how will she love  when liver brain and heart these sovereign thrones are all supplied and filled her sweet perfections with one selfsame king the original and authentic copy says mr malone as he is become fond of calling the first folio since the second has been the means of detecting so many of his mistakes reads  with one self king same he says was added unnecessarily by the editor of the second folio who in many instances appears to have been equally ignorant of our authors language and meter though this charge were as true as it is otherwise and though the editor of the second folio had understood our authors language and meter as imperfectly as the learned gentleman himself appears to do the present alteration would be no instance of it but see how this ingenious critic explains the passage self king says he is king over herself one who reigns absolute in her bosom king over herself may for any thing i know be very good irish but on would think it ought to be queen over herself to make it good english but this by the way i should i should be glad to know if it be possible for any person who has read but two lines of shakspeare and has but two grains of common sense to betray stronger symptoms of a very imperfect acquaintance with his sense language meter or any thing else as to the meter the additional syllable though not absolutely necessary perhaps is certainly an improvement the word perfections must otherwise have been pronounced as four syllables which though not unusual with shakspeare is far from being harmonious as to the sense that is left pretty much as it was the compound selfsame had come into use in shakspeares time instead of the ancient adjective self he uses both frequently as mr malone if he will take the trouble to read him over for the purpose may for certainty know and the meaning of the passage if indeed it be at all necessary to explain what no one perhaps but mr malone can possibly misconceive is merely and simply this when these sovereign thrones are all supplied and filled with one and the same king i e love  macbeth vol iv p      macb remarks p    the prince of cumberland  mr steevens having observed that the crown of scotland was originally not hereditary and that when a successor was declared in the lifetime of the king the title of prince of cumberland was immediately bestowed on him as the mark of his designation i took the liberty to question the propriety of this observation and to assert that the crown of scotland had been hereditary for ages before duncan  nay from the very foundation of the scottish monarchy that the apparent or presumptive heir was always the known and declared successor and that the kings eldest son or grandson  i e the heir apparent for the time being alone was prince of cumberland mr steevens had originally quoted hollinshed and mr malone in the revised edition supports him by a quotation from bellendens translation of boethius which hollinshed copied i have said that it should seem from the play that malcolm was the first who had the title of prince of cumberland and so it does though this was certainly not the case as malcolm son of donald vi afterward malcolm i is by the scottish historians expressly asserted to have born it in the reign of constantine iii  anno  0  who appointed that thenceforward the heir apparent to the crown of scotland for the time being should possess that country as his appanage shakespeares mistake may be easily accounted for  mr steevens i see has added that  cumberland was at that time held by scotland of the crown or england as a fief but i fancy he will find that fiefs were at that time and long after unknown in either country it might be a custom in denmark when the blood royal was extinct to elect a successor and to this hamlet may allude when he bequeaths his dying voice to fortinbras so in amadis de le      laucine king of swetia dying without heirs gasquilan being known in many places to be one of the most gentle knights that the world yielded was called by them of swetia and elected to be their king b iv c    it may be added that gasquilan was son of laucines sister but then it must be presumed that females or their issue were incapable of inheriting the crown of swetia   king john vol v p     i think it proper to acknowledge that mr malone has produced a sufficient number of instances to justify his assertion remarks p     that one and on are perpetually confounded in the old copies so far at least that on is frequently misprinted for one which i confess as i was not hunting after such trifles had escaped my observation but what end it has answered save as an instance of this ingenious gentlemans industry i am at a total loss to conceive as i have sufficiently proved that one both in and long before shakspeares time had obtained the same pronunciation it does at present  richard the second p      buck my lord of hereford my message is to you  bolin my lord my answer is  to lancaster  this significant dash appears to have been adopted on the credit of the critical acumen of mr malone as the line was before printed he observes the sense was obscure which as he doubtless means to himself we may very readily believe how this same dash was to illumine the passage we might however have still been at a loss to discover if the ingenious commentator had not been pleased to explain it for the benefit of more opaque intellects which he does as follows your message you say is to my lord of hereford my answer is  it is not to him it is to the duke of lancaster now it is conceived that there was scarcely a single reader of shakspeare since he first begun to be read excepting this ingenious gentleman who could have hesitated a moment at the line as it originally stood the sense of it at present indeed even though we be edified by the margin seems confined to the professed critic  my lord of hereford says berkeley i have a message for you my lord says bolingbroke i answer to no name but lancaster and i must find that title in your tongue before i make reply to aught you say and yet mr malone fancies himself such a proficient in our author that he has advertised and as i understand is even about to publish his own edition of him in which we may expect to meet with a few hundred such proofs of the editors peculiar sagacity  p      boling disparkd my parks and felled my forest woods  to dispark mr steevens observes is to throw down the hedges of an enclosure  disspio which seems a strange sort of an explanation of a very common word every field is an enclosure but no one ever heard of the disparking of a field to dispark is merely to unpark to make that which was a park a no more and this is done by throwing down the pales and laying it open mr steevens says he met with word in barrets dictionary    0 it would be difficult perhaps to mention a dictionary in which he could not meet with it  p  00  and when they from they bosom pluck a flower guard it i pray thee with a lurking adder guard it signifies here as in many other places line it malone  mr malone is very industrious in accumulating instances of the use of any particular word will he be so good as point out to us in his edition one or two of the senses he here imputes to the word guard one does not much regard his opinions or his assertions but one is always glad to see his proofs in the mean time i shall be persuaded that by guarding it with a lurking adder shakspeare meant placing an adder in the flower by way of guard putting a soldier in it  p     remarks p      fitz  my rapiers point  in answer to the remark on this passage the editor of the revised edition or rather his skulking friend observes that it is probable that dr johnson did not see the necessity of citing any authority for a fact so well known or suspect that any person would demand one if an authority however only is wanted he says perhaps the following may be deemed sufficient to justify the doctors observation  at that time two other englishmen sir w stanley and rowland york got an ignominious name of traitors this york borne in london was a man most negligent and lazy but desperately hardy he was in his time the most famous of those who respected fencing having been the first that brought into england that wicked and pernicious fashion to fight in the fields in duels with a rapier called a tucke only for the thurst the english having till that very time used to fight with back swords slashing and cutting one the other armed with targets or bucklers with very broad weapons accounting it not to be a manly action to fight by thrusting and stabbing and chiefly under the waste darcies annals of queen elizabeth  to      p     sub anno       again in bulleines dialogue between soarnesse and chirurgi fol      p  0 there is a new kind of instruments to let blood withal which bring the blood letter some time to the gallows because he stryketh to deep these instruments are called the ruffins tucke and long foining rapier weapons more malicious than manly  that dr johnson did not see the necessity of citing any authority to convict shakspeare of this anachronism or suspect that any person would demand one is a little to the purpose as it is true that the fact is well known if dr johnson had been possessed of any authority there can be no doubt that he would have produced it but however confident he may be in his assertions no one was ever more ignorant of the manners either of shakspeares age or of the ages preceding it but ignorant as he was it would not have been difficult for him to have found authorities which make as little in his favor as those brought forward in the revised edition dr johnson has taken upon himself to assert that the rapier was a weapon not seen in england till      that is two centuries after the time of which shakspeare was writing and two years after the publication of this identical play an assertion which the author of the above note out of his zeal for the credit of dr johnson has pronounced a notorious fact and produced what he calls a sufficient authority to justify it this authority however proves at most no more than that a rapier called a tucke only for the thurst had been introduced by a person who was hanged in      and that the long foining rapier was a new kind of instrument in      the rapier not called a tucke and for something more than the thurst or the long foin might for any thing that yet appears to the contrary have been an ordinary weapon long before either york it should appear from caletons thankful remembrance of gods mercy      as quoted by mr malone in the notes to the merry wives of windsor vol i p     that york wasfamous for bringing in a new kind of fight  to run the point of a rapier into a mans body this manner of sight he brought first into england etc that is as i understand it he did not bring the rapier itself into england but only this new meanner of fighting with it  bulleine or shakspeare was born but supposing it was not what then shakspeare could have made use of the word rapier as a general name for a sword the species for the genus and dr johnson might with equal propriety have objected to julius caesars speaking english  shakspeare has so many anachronisms to answer for that some people seem to think it is no matter how many real or pretended they add to the number which as his sincere admirer i am anxious should not be wantonly increased i will not indeed assert that the rapier was actually known in this country under that very name in the time of king richard the second but i shall certainly think it sufficient to prove that it was familiar to us long before the time at which shakspeare wrote and let dr johnsons advocate show why both the poet and his readers have not a right to presume it was so in the times of which he was writing  the fact i take to be this the ancient rapier was a long twoedged sharppointed weapon essentially different from that mentioned by darcy and bulleine which was for the thrust only whereas the other was for both blow and thrust in a note to much ado about nothing vol ii p     mr steevens produces an extract from an old manuscript in the sloane library which seems he says to be the fragment of a register formerly belonging to some of our schools where the noble science of defense was taught from the year      to      in which we find the following entry item a challenge playde before the kings majestir edward vi at westminster at seven kind of weapons that is to say the rapier and target the rapier and cloak etc and in another place mr steevens giving an account of this manuscript expressly tells us that rapier and target rapier and cloak rapier and dagger were among the weapons used in the fencing school this i should conceive a sufficient and satisfactory proof even to the gentleman who has so zealously undertaken to support the random and groundless assertion of dr johnson that the rapier alluded to by shakspeare was not a long foining tucke only for the thirst and that he has not given to the english nobles a weapon which was not seen in england till two centuries afterward  independent of this adventitious assistance shakspeare himself has given such a description of the rapier he meant as could scarcely be overlooked but by an annotator less desirous to illustrate his author than to support the absurdities of an editor thus in twelfth night vol iv p     he is knight dubbed with unhackd rapier i e a rapier or sword that has never struck a blow in the field with a smooth edge an expression perfectly inapplicable to a small sword or long foining rapier only for the thurst so in antony and cleopatra to part with unhackd edges  first part of henry the fourth vol v p        car charles wain is over the new chimney remarks p  0   having professed my obligation to a learned friend for a very ingenious etymology of charless wain i think it proper to mention that the same etymology had been already given by dr hickes and is to be sound in thoresbys ducatus leodiensis so that i have possibly ascribed to my learned friend the merit of a discovery which he was not entitled to and never meant to claim and for which of course he would be very little obliged to me  p      that the sweet wine at present called sack remarks p    is defferent from falstaffs favorite liquor the editor is by no means convinced it would indeed be wonderful enough if he were as there is nothing more difficult or rather less possible than to convince an editor  when he is in the wrong he is therefore inclined to believe that the english of our authors time drank canary the sweetest of wines with sugar i suppose they eat their honey with it too that the sack however mentioned and meant by shakspeare is not the sack of this day will be evident to all but the editor by a passage in one of the notes to his own edition vol iv p     where it is said that moll cutpurse a notorious baggage that used to go in mans apparel when brought up to do penance at pauls cross where she wept bitterly and seemed very penitent was it was afterward doubted maudlin drunk having been discovered to have tippeld of three quarts of sack before she came to her penance let the editor try if he can drink one quart falstaff himself puts the matter out of doubt where in his enumeration of the excellencies of his favorite beverage he expressly calls it sherris see   hen iv act iv scene   indeed if it were possible for the editor to be right in his persuasion and certain jolly fellow could never have sung my friend and i we drank whole pisspots full of sack up to the brim i drank to my friend and he drank his pot so we put about the whim nine bottles and a quart we swallowed down our throat but hang such puny sips as these we laid us all along with our mouths unto the bung and we tippd whole hogsheads off with ease   p      this is the second place in which mr steevens introduces what i conceive a very erroneous explanation of the word mouldwarp and i flatter myself he will not be offended with an attempt to set him right the mouldwarp he says is the mole so called because it renders the surface of the earth unlevel by the hillocks which it raises it certainly is not so called from that circumstance the name arises from and is expressive of the circumstance of the animal warping or turning the mould over the surface of the ground which is actually the case  king henry the fifth vol vi p     cant  also king lewis the ninth remarks p  0    shakspeare wrote tenth as the text is now corrected and i have contended that he was right and the alteration wrong i since find that the latter is in some respect right  and that our old historians  i e fabian hollinshed etc are a unit above the french account i really do not know for what reason this is so but it runs strongly in my mind that fabian has somewhere explained it though i was unable to find the passage a second time  p     living hence the remark upon this passage being clear and intelligible and indeed the only construction it is capable of mr malone with his usual diffidence observes that if hence means here any one word as dr johnson has somewhere observed may stand for another it undoubtedly he adds does not signify here in the present passage and if it did it would render what follows nonsense and this it is supposed the learned gentleman offers as a convincing argument  and so indeed it may be that he understands the passage neither as it is nor as it should be why has not he attempted to explain it but alas we know by experience that such attempts however they may increase difficulties are ill calculated to remove them  not to regard the misconceptions of this most erring commentator by too formal notices it may suffice to entertain the reader with the following specimens of his singular sagacity and acuteness  as you like it vol iii p     as friend remembered not remembered for remembering malone midsummer nights dream vol iii p     make periods in the midst of sentences it should be observed periods in the text is used in the sense of full stops malone nothing can be more worthy of observation than such a comment  julius caesar vol viii p  0   they  come down with fearful bravery thinking by this face to fasten in our thoughts that the have courage with fearful bravery   that is with a gallant show of courage carring with it terror and dismay fearful is used here as in many other places in a active sense  producing fear  intimidating malone how the word fearful may be used in other places i do not know but if it have any meaning at all in this place it is simply full of fear and fearful bravery is a show of courage hiding a cowardly heart anthonys language is certainly the essence of terror and dismay  in p     of the same volume he says that the word charge is abbreviated in old english mss change i think i know enough both of abbreviations and old english mss to enable me to pronounce that such an abbreviation of charge is not nor ever was to be met with in any  troilus and cressida vol ix p     like a strutting player whose conceit lies in his hamstring and does think it rich to hear the wooden dialogue and sound twixt his stretched footing and the scaffoldage the galleries of the theater in the time of our author were sometimes termed the scaffolds malone shakspeare alludes to the clamping of the players buskins upon the stage the wooden meaning of the note i fear must be left to its authors own comprehension  henry the fifth vol vi p     flu splood  up to the preaches you rascals remarks p  0  will you not up to the preaches  fist be merciful great duke to men of mould  the absurdity of this reading is so evident and has been so fully exposed in the remarks that one editor or commentator has had the confidence to say a single word in defense of it except mr malone whose candor and ingenuity are equally conspicuous  he quotes a few words from a long note where it was said that it is the duke of exeter who enters and triumphantly adds that in the only folio of authority this certainly is not the case because forsooth the blundering editors have suffered the name of fluellen to stand before a speech evidently belonging to exeter up to the breach you dogs avaunt you cullions is this the language of fluellen does fluellen ever speak in heroics or is it possible that this line and the pitiful stuff which the editors have so judiciously preferred  splood  up to the preaches you rascals will you not up to the preaches can belong to one and the same person certainly not but then he argues when the king retired the duke of exeter undoubtedly accompanied him and suppose he did what then is he never to come upon the stage again  as to his assertion that  duke means no more here than commander nothing bad enough can be said of it will he have the goodness to produce on single instance from the language of our author in which the title has any such meaning duke theseus every one who has looked into the midsummer nights dream not excepting himself very well knows is theseus duke of athens and though skeleton or any other ancient writer may have called hannibal a duke will he venture to say that any writer ever gave such an appellation to an english officer these are questions indeed which though i ask i do not expect mr malone to answer but i shall be free enough to add that while such critics as he is have the liberty to write such notes as this in the margin of shakspeare it will be in vain to expect either honor or justice done to the author  second part of henry the sixth vol vi p      remarks p   0 k henry i thank thee well these words content me much  in answer to the remark on this passage a remark which i have since learned is not peculiar to myself mr steevens says it has been observed by two or three commentators that it is no way extraordinary the king should forget his wifes name as it appears in no less than three places she forgets it herself calling herself eleanor it has been also said it should be meg and though he allows all this to be very true yet as an alterations must be made theobalds he says is just as good and as probable as any other he has therefore retained it and wishes it could have been done with propriety without a note  i leave it to every reader to form his own conclusions on this extraordinary note which i only wonder to find avowed by mr steevens no unprejudiced person tan hesitate for a moment in admitting this conclusion that as shakspeare has already inadvertently used eleanor for margaret no less than three times so he here uses nell for meg with what reason therefore can it be said that well is just as good and as probable an alteration as any other an alteration which theobald had he noticed the repeated mistake of eleanor for margaret would never have proposed discovery himself  third part of k henry the sixth p      gab the queen with all the northern earls and lords remarks p     intend here to besiege you in your castle  in the course of my remark on this passage i observed that richard was scarcely more than if indeed so much as nine years old i find he was but just turned of eight  p      a chase in the north of england remarks p     this scenical direction is given instead of that i objected to in the former edition a wood in lancashire and yet i have since met with convincing evidence that the king was actually taken in lancashire but whether shakspeare knew it is more than i can tell the importance of the fact deserves a minute investigation  p  0   the ridiculous story of warwicks embassy and the lady bona remarks p     ought to be banished out of history and yet mr hume gives it as circumstantially as if he had found it in a record whereas there is not even a possibility of its having any foundation whatever as warwick actually stood sponsor to the princess elizabeth king edwards first child mr hume indisputably merits great praise as an elegant and nervous writer but he has in numerous instances shown an evident disregard to facts varying and even inventing circumstances for the mere purpose it should seem of telling his story to greater advantage or giving a sort of roundness or point to his periods for this reason his history is in many parts no more to be regarded than a romance as he neither does nor was able to quote any authority for what he relates among the many instances which might be adduced in support of these assertions i shall only mention a remarkable anecdote of colonel kirk who is supposed to have debauched a young woman the sister but according to other the wife or one of the western worde under a solemn promise to grant her the life of her brother as the price of her compliance in the morning to gratify her impatience he insultingly shows her this beloved brother hanging upon a gibbet which he had secretly ordered to be rctd before the window or as some say upon the sign post of his inn the consequence is that the young woman goes distracted and the colonel to breakfast this story mr hume has worked up with all his powers of eloquence and pathos and being so very interesting no doubt is ever entertained of its truth although in fact so far as it regards kirk or the reign of james the second or the english history it is an impudent and barefaced lie mr hume indeed was not the fabricator of the falsehood but his conduct is not the more excusable on that account since he had nothing to warrant it that could deserve the name of an authority and a story that does outrage to human nature ought not to be adopted by a historian without a voucher equal to its incredibility the origin of the fable was probably owing to the pious fraud of the whig party to whom kirk had rendered himself so odious that they endeavor of to blacken his character with every action superlatively abominable which they could find recorded many less important and more probable calumnies remain unnoticed in the libels of the day but this story and some other circumstances mentioned by mr hume such as his hanging    without the least enquiry into the merits of their cause ordering a certain number to be executed while he and his compan should drink to the kings health crying when he observed their e to shake in the agonies of death that he would give them music to th dancing etc which exceed every thing one can conceive of the extent of human wickedness were greedily swallowed and the become part of the history of england i do not indeed question but that there are many wives and many sisters who would show the very same degree of affection for their husbands or their brothers but the other part  the story is out of nature and can only be credible of an incubus  the utmost stretch of infernal malice which religion can teach and bigots credit could not exceed that which is thus reported of kirk the reader will find the original story related more circumstantially though not more affectingly nor perhaps more truly in wanleys wondders of the little world of man      chap       beginning charles duke of burgundy etc  this period of english history equally interesting and obscure but though i have said that the rupture between the king and his political creator is owing to causes which have not reached posterity i have since found that warwick took occasional umbrage at several of the kings proceedings as   his marrying the queens sister to the duke of buckingham   his conferring the office of treasurer which he had taken from the lord montjoy upon lord rivers   his making a match between the son and heir of the lord herbert and mary the queens sister and another between the young lord lisle and the daughter of lord herbert and creating young herbert a knight and lord of dunstar   his making a match between sir thomas gray the queens son and lady anne daughter and heir to the duke of exeter and niece to the king who had been talked of as a wife for the earl of northumberland warwicks brother but here the annals of william wyrcester to whom we are indebted for this valuable information are most unfortunately defective however it appears from rymer that in the beginning of november      no open variance had taken place between the king and warwick though the latter had certainly been accused of favoring king henry and had secretly displeased the king by the proposed match between his daughter and the duke of clarence on the   d march    0 he and the duke were in arms and proclaimed rebels  to the list of battles in p   0 and     may be added  0 the battle of in north wales between jasper earl of pembroke for lancaster and brother to william lord herbert afterward earl of pembroke for king edward in which the former was defeated       the day on which the battle of stamford was

them much trouble to point out the particular book and page from whence it was taken and this they will have a favorable opportunity of doing in the course of the humane treatment my poor literary
