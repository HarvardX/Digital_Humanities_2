thirty eight dialogue ii a it is is all a libel  pxtn sir will say b not yet my friend tomorrow faith it may and for that very cause i print to day how should i fret to mangle every line in reverence to the sins of thirtynine vice with such giantstrides comes on amain invention strives to be before in vain feign what i will and paint it ever so strong some rising genius sins up to my song a yet none but you by name the guilty lash even the ordinary of newgate who publishes the memoirs of the malefactors guthry saves half newgate by a dash spare then the person and expose the vice b how sir not damn the sharper but the dice come on then satire general unconfined spread thy broad wing and sowze on all the kind ye statesmen priests of one religion all ye tradesmen vile in army court or hall ye reverend atheists a scandal name them who b why that is the thing you bid me not to do who starved a mother who forswore a debt i never named  the towns enquiring yet the poisning dame  a you mean  b i dont a you do b see now i keep the secret and not you the bribing statesman  a hold too high you go b the bribed elector  a there you stoop too low b i fain would please you if i knew with what tell me which knave is lawful game which not must great offenders once escaped the crown like loyal hearts be never more run down admit your law to spare the knight requires as beasts of nature may we hunt the squires suppose i censure  you know what i mean  to save a bishop may i name a dean a a dean sir no his fortune is not made you hurt a man that is rising in the trade b if not the tradesman who sets up to day much less the prentice who to morrow may down down proud satire though a land be spoiled arraign no mightier thief than wretched jonathan wild wild or if a court or countrys made a job go drench a pickpocket and join the mob but sir i beg you for the love of vice the matters weighty pray consider twice have you less pity for the needy cheat the poor and friendless villian than the great alas the small discredit of a bribe scarce hurts the lawyer but undoes the scribe then better sure it charity becomes to tax directors who thank god have plums still better ministers or if the thing may pinch even there  why lay it on a king a stop stop b must satire then nor rise nor fall speak out and bid me blame no rogues at all a yes strike that wild i will justify the blow b strike why the man was hanged ten years ago who now that obsolete example fears even peter trembles only for his ears a what always peter peter thinks you mad you make men desperate if they once are bad else might he take to virtue some years hence  b as sk if he lives will love the prince a strange spleen to sk b do i wrong the man god knows i praise a courtier where i can when i confess there is who feels for fame and melts to goodness need i scarbrow name pleased let me own in eshers peaceful grove the house and gardens of esher in surry designed by mr kent  where kent and nature vye for pelhams love the scene the master opening to my view i fit and dream i see my crags anew even in a bishop i can spy desert secker is decent rundel has a heart manners with candor are to benson given to berkley every virtue under heaven but does the court a worthy man remove that instant i declare he has my love i shun his zenith court his mild decline thus summers once and halifax were mine often in the clear still mirror of retreat i studied shrewsbury the wise and great carletons calm sense and stanhopes noble flame compared and knew their generous end the same how pleasing atterburys softer hour how shined the soul unconquered in the tower how can i pultney chesterfield forget while roman spirit charms and attic wit argyle the states whole thunder born to wield and shake alike the senate and the field or wyndham armed for freedom and the throne the master of our passions and his own names which i long have loved nor loved in vain ranked with their friends not numbered with their train and if yet higher the proud list should end still let me say no follower but a friend yet think not friendship only prompts my lays i follow virtue where she shines i praise point she to priest or elder whig or tory or round a quakers beaver cast a glory i never to my sorrow i declare dined with the man of ross or my sir john barnard lord mayr some in their choice of friends nay look not grave have still a secret bias to a knave to find an honest man i beat about and love him court him praise him in or out a then why so few commended b not so fierce find you the virtue and i will find the verse but random praise  the task can never be done each mother asks it for her booby son each widow asks it for the best of men for him she weeps and him she weds again praise cannot stoop like satire to the ground the number may be hanged but not be crowned enough for half the greatest of these days to scape my censure not expect my praise are they not rich what more can they pretend dare they to hope a poet for their friend what richlieu wanted louis scarce could gain and what young ammon wished but wished in vain no power the muses friendship can command no power when virtue claims it can withstand to cato virgil paid one honest line o let my countrys friends illumin mine  what are you thinking a faith the thoughts no sin i think your friends are out and would be in b if merely to come in sir they go out the way they take is strangely round about a they too may be corrupted you will allow b i only call those knaves who are so now is that too little come then i will comply  spirit of arnall aid me while i lie cobbams a coward polwarth is a slave and lyttleton a dark designing knave st john has ever been a wealthy fool  but let me add sir roberts mighty dull has never made a friend in private life and was besides a tyrant to his wife but pray when others praise him do i blame call clodius wolsey any odious name why rail they then if but a wreath of mine oh allaccomplishd st john deck thy shrine what shall each spurgalld hackney of the day when paxn gives him double pots and pay or each newpensiond sycophant pretend to break my windows if i treat a friend then wisely plead to me they meant no hurt but twas my guest at whom they threw the dirt sure if i spare the minister no rules of honor bind me not to maul his tools sure if they cannot cut it may be said his saws are toothless and his hatchets lead it angered turenne once upon a day to see a footman kicked that took his pay but when he heard thaffront the fellow gave knew one a man of honor one a knave the prudent general turned it to a jest and begged he would take the pains to kick the rest which not at present having time to do  a hold sir for gods sake where is the affront to you against your worship what has sk writ when did tyl hurt you with his wit or grant the bard whose distich all commend  in power a servant out of power a friend to wle guilty of some venial sin what is that to you who never was out nor in the priest whose flattery bedropt the crown how hurt he you he only stained the gown and how did pray the florid youth offend whose speech you took and gave it to a friend b faith it imports not much from whom it came whoever borrowed could not be to blame since the whole house did afterward the same let courtly wits to wits afford supply as hog to hog in huts of westphaly if one through natures bounty or his lords has what the frugal dirty soil affords from him the next receives it thick or thin as pure a mess almost as it came in the blessed benefit not there confined drops to the third who nuzzles close behind from tail to mouth they feed and they carouse the last full fairly gives it to the house a this filthy simile this beastly line quite turns my stomach  b so does flattery mine and all your courtly civetcats can vent perfume to you to me is excrement but hear me further  japhet it is agreed writ not and chartres scarce could write or read in all the courts of pindus guiltless quite but pens can sorge my friend that cannot write and must no egg in japhets face be thrown because the deed he forged was not my own must never patriot then declaim at gin unless good man he has been fairly in no zealous pastor blame a failing spouse without a staring reason on his brows and each blasphemer quite escape the rod because the insults not on man but god ask you what provocation i have had the strong antipathy of good to bad when truth or virtue an affront endures the affront is mine my friend and should be yours mine as a foe professed to false pretense who think a coxcombs honor like his sense mine as a friend to every worthy mind and mine as man who feel for all mankind a youre strangely proud b so proud i am no slave so impudent i own myself no knave so odd my countrys ruin makes me grave yes i am proud i must be proud to see men not afraid of god afraid of me safe from the bar the pulpit and the throne yet touched and shamed by ridicule alone o sacred weapon left for truths defense sole dread of folly vice and insolence to all but heavndirected hands denied the muse may give thee but the gods must guide revrent i touch thee but with honest zeal to rowze the watchmen of the public weal to virtues work provoke the tardy hall and goad the prelate slumbering in his stall ye tinsel insects whom a court maintains that counts your beauties only by your stains spin all your cobwebs over the eye of day the muses wing shall brush you all away all his grace preaches all his lordship sings all that makes saints of queens and gods of kings all all bat truth drops dead born from the press like the last gazette or the last address when black ambition stains a public cause a monarchs sword when mad vainglory draws not wallers wreath can hide the nations scar nor boileau turn the in his ode on namur where to use his own words il a fait un astre de la plume blanch qui le roy port ordinairement a son chapeau and qui est en effet une espece de comete fatale a nos ennemis feather to a star not so when diademd with rays divine touched with the flame that breaks from virtues shrine her priestess muse forbids the good to dye and opes the temple of eternity there other trophies deck the truly brave than such as anstis casts into the grave far other stars than  and   wear and may descend to morton from stair such as on dr hough bishop of worcester houghs unsullied mitre shine or beam good digby from a heart like thine let envy howl while heavens whole chorus sings and bark at honor not conferred by kings let flattery sickening see the incense rise sweet to the world and grateful to the skies truth guards the poet sanctifies the line and makes immortal verse as mean as mine yes the last pen for freedom let me draw when truth stands trembling on the edge of law here last of britons let your names be read are none none living let me praise the dead and for that cause which made your fathers shine fall by the votes of their degenerate line a alas alas pray end what you began and write next winter more essays on man finis
