a collection of poems and translations in english and latin  by thomas hull  agedum pauca accipe  primum ego me illorum dederim quibus esse poetis excerpam numero neque enim concludere versum dixeris esse satis neque si quis seribat uti nos sermoni propiora putes hunc esse poetam hor sat iv lib   l     for my own part i claim no portion of the poets art it is not enough to close the flowing line and in ten syllables your sense confine or write in mere prosaic rhimes like me that can deserve the name of poetry franciss transl bath printed for the author and sold by him at tuckers china shop in the churchyard and mr leake and mr frederick booksellers stephen martin printer and mr palmer and mr ward booksellers in bristol  to the right honorable lord boyd my lord it has been ever advanced by all who have understood the world that a great man never distinguishes himself so much as in his behavior and countenance shown to inferiors if so your lordship is certainly the most conspicuous instance of the truth of this maxim in thinking me worthy your least notice  the very grateful sense i have of the honor done me herein i can never be able to express yet my utmost pride shall not influence me to run into the general style of dedicators in attemping an encomium on your lordships virtues your public goodness cannot but be injured by such a pen as mine and your private is surely sufficiently manifested in condescending to smile on a young writer unknown to merit as to fame  the publication of my productions can i am very certain boast no value but what arises from your lordships having set your stamp on them yet whatever reception they meet from the public the utmost poignancy of censure i should always think amply overballanced by the pride and pleasure of your permission to subscribe myself with the utmost respect  my lord your lordships most obliged and obedient servant thomas hull  there are two kinds of poetry to which no preface is necessary viz extreme good and extreme bad the first requires none and the last deserves none for the latter reason i must entreat my very patient readers to take notice that this is an apology which i think indispensibly necessary to obviate two objections  in the first place to those who may ask why i wrote and to be sure the question is highly rational and palpable i answer to employ my leisure hours in an exercise which gives me pleasure and does no one else any injury  and i might no doubt have found many methods of pastime that would not have amounted to so good a purpose as that of doing no harm  in the second place to those who may ask why i published and by the bye this is a question more rational and palpable than the former i answer that i had no other means of convincing the world i ever employed my time to any purpose at all  i am very sensible there may and certainly will be several witticisms smart strokes of raillery and satirical similies on a raw unfledged poet which indeed i could here insert but that i would by no means be so illmannerd to my readers as to take the words out of their mouths or prevent their having their laugh out  however to be serious i cannot in gratitude conclude this address to the public without returning my best thanks to my several friends who have so kindly contributed to the publication of the ensuing trifling performance i have only to desire they will take notice that the paraphrase on the tenth ode of horace the card to venus and ode to cupid are the product of much better pens than mine my reason for mentioning this is only to return their authors thanks for the honor they have done me and not to point out a distinction which must be so very obvious to every capacity  list of the subscribers a francis aylmer esquire of

 i am doomed to part to tear her from my eyes my heart my every hope each wish resign and never never call her mine  but is there none no secret way my vows to waft my duty pay friendship esteem can none of these instruct an artless swain to please yet robbed of the sole power timpart the honest meaning of my heart how can i half its feelings prove how when i dare not mention love yet fly despair

friend thy softest sweetest influence lend the anxious heartexpanding sigh that rises when amasias nigh which kindles all my soul to prove her beautys force the pride of love to view to hear to clasp her once again were cheaply purchased with an age of pain song long at thy altar god of love i paid a double duty a slave to celias voice and wit to chloes taste and beauty fain would i fix my restless heart while they with awkward feature disguise in affectations masque the bounteous gifts of nature celia affecting beautys grace destroys her sense and spirit and chloes charms through fancied wit lose all their wonted merit while in their native beauties decked i can love both  or either  but thus in borrowed airs disguised i can be fond of neither imitation of part of the  d epode

languish teach oh teach me how to please to a friend on his marriage felices ter and amplius quos irrupta tenet copula horat  when dignity and titles wed shall flattery deck the bridal bed when hymens torch must blush for shame that only wealth inspires the flame or when the muse on beautys power attends to grace a venal hour to such shall she her honors pay yet none be found to grace this day shall no applauding verse be read when honesty and goodness wed be it then mine and mine alone for once the nuptial rites to crown stranger to flattery lie or sneer my commendation is sincere and sure the verse you may commend although the poet be  a friend pursue blessed pair the fond regard each others virtues to reward eternal joys shall on ye wait unknown to titles wealth or state now titles wealth and state shall bend overcome by husband consort friend such are the titles that reward unspotted truth and firm regard wealth too your blessings shall approve undying peace immortal love such wealth as this to ye is lent and when shall loves rich store be spent state too  the highest shall ye know virtue  our highest state below to crown your happiness the muse with wish sincere the verse pursues may faith affection and esteem be ever your delighted theme may satisfaction be your bed content a pillow for the head while in each others arms ye lie may love close up the slumbering eye and may each newrevolving sun improve the bliss which this begun ode young corydon for lovely phyllis burned the generous nymph his ardent wailings mourned the nuptial tie her warmer thoughts confined still some emotions fluttered in her mind the wily youth had touched her tender breast when smiling soft the swain she thus addressed cease fond youth no prayer shall move my softened soul to guilty love those passionate complaints give over comply  or never behold me more my rage yet pity disapproves some power oersways but it is not loves be passion lost in friendships flame approach me with that sacred name and every virtuous blessing claim such kind expressions such endearing terms who dares misconstrue what dire lust alarms  the amorous youth her fondness misapplied inflamed with fierce desire and warmly sighed friendship alas in breasts like mine dominion never can own where rebel love holds uncontrolled a firm unshaken throne come let me fold thee in my arms secure from every eye pour forth my soul in raptures heat and on thy bosom die the virtuous nymph in conscious grief and fear mourned silently yet dropped a speaking tear struck with remorse he saw the piercing sign of heavenborn innocence and truth divine sorrow and shame his erring bosom stung and halfbroke accents faulterd on his tongue she saw with pleasure his repentant grief and thus bespoke to give his soul relief how blessed i am no tongue can prove in such superior force to move and heal thy frantic breast such virtue tenderness and truth what power could harm returned the youth he looked and sighed the rest remorse and wonder held them silent long then joy burst forth spontaneous in their song matchless the youth who timely wise can passions faults retrieve matchless the fair who kindly tries those errors to forgive hence shall each meaner bosom learn how virtues power can move how infelt goodness awes the soul and friendship conquers love song of vertumnus imitated what beauteous scenes inchant my sight etc pulchra quae coram video and venusta brachia expandens generosa vitis ecce quam forti placidoque nexu jungitur ulmo  umbra non ulmus sterilis videtur vitis ast uvis onerata circum verreret terram nisi opem tulisse vitis et ipsa  te chloe hoc utinam moveat jugali conjugem fidum sociare vinclo quid ferant vero seniumque curaeque inspice cauta  nota sors felix tibi sit voluptas nota te exardet deus ipse veris proteget saltus virides deus qui praesidet anno  dum flagrant flammis alii caducis illius constans amor usque durat illius fidum repares amorem mutuo amore  nulla sic brumae nivis atque dirae vis ferox veris minuet decorem arbor et nullis violata ventis quaeque vigebit  a paraphrase on psalm    i be thou o lord my refuge in distress my stay in trouble and support in pain so shall adversitys assaults be less and hostile arrows spend their force in vain ii what though the earth from her foundations rise the hills upturnd be cast into the sea and mountains shake to hear the tempests voice unmoved i stand  my trust i place in thee iii though ocean rage and foaming billows roar secure o lord thy great tribunals placed for at thy nod the billows swell no more the earth is firm the mountains are at rest iv terror avaunt  danger is far from hence a guiltless conscience forms it is own reward the mighty lord of hosts is my defense the god of jacob my retreat and guard v come and behold the wonders of his hand lo now destruction reigns and battles ire  now the wars hushed  spears break at his command and chariots crackle in consuming fire vi then free my soul from terror and suspense await with patience the divine award the mighty lord of hosts is thy defense the god of jacob thy retreat and guard pastoral i while the clear brook in prattling murmurs played and solitude adorned the pleasing shade blythe corydon breathed forth his glowing joy  ye swains attend  thus sung the amorous boy ii no more to fancys dreams the notes belong nor weak ideas feebly tune my tongue no more inventions aid the muse requires or faint conceptions momentary fires iii it is gratitude inspires my ravished heart and virtues charms true sentiments impart to my amasias ear the notes belong sweet are the strains if she approve my song iv how blessed am i to see the nymph i love list to my converse and my flame approve who scorns the triflers praise the flattrers art humbly content to take an honest heart v the painted rose that blooms on beautys face the damask lip and every specious grace what solid joys alas can these impart if unattended with a spotless heart vi wherefore did heaven the female race supply with each gay luster that attracts the eye unless the fair appearance was designed the habitation of a fairer mind vii is there who doubts the truth of what i say who thinks all female charms will soon decay  in sweet amasias aspect let him see what beauty is and virtue ought to be viii behold the blooming cheek o joy to look has not the rose her native bed forsook  then read her mind  examine it with care say is not every shining virtue there ix such are the charms that in her bosom shine where chastity and truth and candor join charms that never fade  but hourly will improve amasias charms  and who can blame my love the tenth ode of the second book of horace imitated rectius vives licini etc i dear friend thy steady life must happiest prove if thou nor rashly tempt the angry main nor when embarked each rising gale can move thy purposed soul to make the port again ii whoever the golden medium wisely keeps and timely flies ambitions giddy state exempt from sordid want securely sleeps exempt from envied trappings of the great iii the cloudcapt towers a wider ruin spread the pine full often the tempests rage endures and dreadful lightnings blast the hills high head from which humility the vale secures iv when fickle fortune smiles the steady mind still fears each hour an adverse stroke may bring hopes when she frowns some happier lot behind the power who sends the winter sends the spring v though ruthless fate reject our present prayers it is stern decrees in time may milder grow  phoebus often joins the muses sprightly airs nor always bends his pestilential bow vi boldly do thou my friend with heart prepared stem the strong current of adversity but when prosperitys full gales blow hard reef reef betimes  nor trust the fallacy a card to venus in imitation of the thirtieth ode of the first book of horace o venus regina cnidi etc come venus come and make us blessed mine and my chloes welcome guest what though thy cyprus should repine while in our happy seat you shine our happy seat shall grateful prove and incense shall reward thy love haste and bring thy amorous boy and with him each attendant joy youth and her thousand charms that lie in dimpled cheek or laughing eye wit whom the power of beauty moves and beauty which true wit approves  wl make if with this train you come o chs house the graces home a translation as chloe on flowers reclined oor the stream etc i floribus inclinans fluvii sub margin pictis plorabat lachrymans thyrsida maesta chloe distribuere ti sertumque and ventus odores haud requies pectus virginis ulla fovet ii cursu praecipiti fallax elabitur amnis et fluctus ripae vix tetigere torum perfida blanditiis en vafritreque decora insidias referunt flumina thyrsi tuas iii qui leni nuper spirabat flamine ventus caecat nunc atris imbribus ecce diem leniter ut spirans ut tempestate laborans sic thrysis placidus sic rabieque tumens iv floribus excerptis gemmato germine pictis virginis ante pedes heu decus omne perit thyrisida disjunctum referunt cum perdita forma est praesentemque refert thyrsida forma recens v expes ecce chloe rabie jam concita surgit a pedibusque furens languida serta jacit dimittit fluvio lachrymas suspiria ventis et temere exclamat perfide thyrsi vale vi ira tamen qualis  thyrsis quando obvius ibat dispulit en nubes solis imago micans dispulit en phoebus languorem floribus  iram adveniens thyrsis dispulit atque chloes to amasia with a fan whereon was represented cupid with his bow bent and apollo behind directing him where to shoot i thyrsis who never had felt loves smart or cupids power confessed once to apollo made his court and thus his prayer addressed ii bright power from thee and only thee i will deign to take my doom thy wisdom must with beauty join ere i can be overcome iii beauty alone is but a glass wherein an image shines which pleases only when we are near but when we are gone declines iv give me the nymph whose mind is bright and perfect as her face where sense improves what beauty gave and heightens every grace v such only merits my regard and can my passion move show me this fair with joy i will own i will feel the force of love vi such worth replied the god alone  amasia can impart see venus reigning in her eyes  apollo in her heart to the same while thus in scorching fires i burn amasia doubts the ardent flame what though in silent grief i mourn each heartfelt sigh breathes forth her name o could my prayers inspire her heart to feel the rapture she bestows  yet how can i my pains impart when honor virtue are my foes yes  so extravagant my flame all obstacles it can remove honor and virtue cease your claim what what are ye alas to love in vain do sophists preach that heaven has charms concealed from mortal view they know not what a pledge was given they never amasia gazed on you then in this ecstasy of pain bid me not from your sight retreat let me one heavenly smile obtain and breath my ardors at your feet may soft compassion melt your heart to ease the agonies i feel  in vain i try their force timpart they are more than language can reveal o then behold my dying eyes this trickling tear my pains may prove or read in these heartrending sighs silence is eloquent in love since though your cruelty can kill your tenderness can bid me live then mercys soft commands fulfill and if you cannot bless  forgive by nature to the indians shown an antidote for poisonous pains and who the venom caused alone can chase it from the scorching veins thus fairone you are in justice bound to ease the anguish i endure thou could alone inflict the wound thou can alone apply the cure ode to cupid sent to cleora on newyearsday with wallers poems i ah tell me cupid lovely boy to ease a wound thy arrow gave will thou for once thy hand employ and serve a youth who lives thy slave no more the paphian shrines shall show they with unequaled luster glow thy altars shall thy mothers pride oerturn to thee shall far more grateful incense burn great god of love vouchsafe to smile and thus i will rear a nobler pile ii the sacred myrtle shall conspire to kindle youthful hammonds lyre next folded in a laurel shade i will place the constant nutbrown maid  blooming in verse for ever young as fancy drew when prior sung forsaken saphos song divine with willow bound shall deck the shrine  with roses wreathed i will crown the lays that granville sighed in miras praise  in cypress vaild i will add to these the mournful notes of eloise  and cowley too whose lines impart the plaintive sorrows of his heart his swanlike muse that dying sung so well shall grace again that fane at which he fell iii and though such offerings well require a torch of bright promethean fire to raise a far more brillant flame i will softly sigh cleoras name  ah bear this gift with rapid flight and place it in my charmers sight conceal my name but say i sought to find an emblem of her thought  the lovely image to obtain tell her how long i sought in vain till waller showed his heavenly strain iv waller  who tunes his matchless song soft as her heart and as her reason strong wherever she turns each gazer views her motion graceful as his muse wereer she looks what heart denies his fancy sparkles in her eyes  o then convey with choicest care this faithful mirror of my fair and softly whisper in her ear i sealed it with a kiss sincere this day that leads the circling year v tell her that time is jealous grown i count my life by her alone her absence dares invade his power and turn a minute to an hour  for which whenever she charms my sight the hoary tyrants envious spite makes hours like moments wing their flight vi this said  ah generous god be kind and search the answer of her mind if kind reflection should suggest who it is that feels what you expressed wide spread thy pinions quickly fly and tell me that she thinks it is i vi but if each thought of me overthrown my hapless verse remains unknown or if by fickle fortune fired she scorns to hear what you inspired on me alone thy vengeance fall and let my woes atone for all dying my soul this suit prefers tear tear my breast  but pity here is psalm    paraphrased i be merciful o god and save my soul in thee her trust is placed thy wings for shelter let me have until this tyranny be past ii to thee who help alone can lend both late and early will i call thou from on high shall me defend against him who would my feet entral iii my soul is in the lions den my enemies are gathered round beset with wicked sons of men whose tongues like spears and arrows wound vi lord to deliver me appear above the heaven thy beauties raise thy glorious majesty uprear and over the earth thy brightness blaze v maliciously their snares they laid and to oppress me sorely sought in vain  the lord flew to my aid and in the snare themselves are caught vi oh how shall i thy goodness praise  the heart which thou have saved receive awake my lute thy raptures raise to god eternal honors give vii among the nations will i sing and with my voice the temple rend thy mercies reach to heaven great king thy glories to the clouds extend viii in full effulgence lord appear above the heavens thy beauties raise thy glorious majesty uprear and over the earth thy brightness blaze the circumstances of this piece are founded on facts to which the author was privy but he is obliged to conceal the real names the lady being unhappily disappointed in her passion retired to a convent and to heaven consecrated a heart which elsewhere could receive no ease  the sentiments except the epitaph are taken from original letters of her writing lavinia to aegisthus shut from the world and cloistered from the sun ere half my race of early life is run betrayed by hapless love to endless care condemned to deep distress and dark despair why do i thus recall my fatal woes why why by recollection kill repose  o memory reviver of each pain how long must i endure thy hated reign will thou for ever labor to renew the pleasing hours which once alas i knew  hours no more pleasing  the dear youth is gone and with him every happiness is flown  for ever must these agonies remain still must i wish for ease still wish in vain why could not love that tyrant of my heart cease his proud reign and with the cause depart why should his pleasures but ideal be yet all his tortures prove  reality  o come thou first thou best beloved of men compose my raging thoughts and guide my pen teach me like thee to scorn these frowns of fate to laugh at love and all his idle state his soothing joys without his pains to feel  to this torn breast that happy art reveal or for these pangs which i through thee endure thou who alone could cause alone can cure teach me thy loss no longer to regret o teach that harder science  to forget  he hears not or regardless hears my moan  must i endure these pangs and i alone it is just i should  my throbbing sighs are vain i first indulged and last should feel the pain transported thus i have failed in my design it is passion and not reason paints the line i meant to speak the virtues of his youth his open heart  his honesty and truth he is too generous to augment my care or raise a sorrow which he would not share ye blooming nymphs who feel loves tender flame may worth like his the rising transport claim who dares each vicious principle remove and scorns tinsult the heart he cannot love be such your lot  but never like me to mourn or feel the pains of love without return when this poor form shall in oblivion lie when hope and fear and joy neglected dye if ever in aftertimes ye chance to stray where the tall elms mark yonder gloomy way the inscription read which that most loved of men has deigned to dictate to my trembling pen epitaph beneath o late enjoyment sleeps in peace for the first time a young unhappy fair blessed was the moment when she found this ease her first of pleasure and her last of care to one illomend hour and fatal youth the undesigning author of her woes she gave it was all she had unspotted truth and gained at length it was all she asked repose no farther search into her hapless lot nor blame the failings of her guardless bloom since love unsullied decks the hallowed spot and stainless virtue consecrates the tomb to aspasia a birthday ode hic dies vere mihi festus atras eximet curas horat lib   od    what no unusual splendid ray no blaze to usher in the day no brighter sun to tell the earth this morning gave aspasia birth no glories more than common given no grace pecular from heaven no choral songs no lay sublime none at this fair auspicious time  imperfectly methought i said by fancys airy visions led  when venus to my dreaming sense appears and thus rebukes me  hence thou idle weak complainant  cease  nor tire the powers with cries like these what blaze need usher in the morn when truth and probity was born aspasia wants no ray divine  once formed she selfadornd does shine no bounteous godhead of the sky was absent at her birth save i minerva gave her store of sense and to display it eloquence cupid bestowed a chosen dart and placed it very near her heart to fight to conquer  or to move the jocund soul to laughing love majestic junos care supplied her tender breast with honest pride such pride as teaches to subdue each sordid art and gainful view as bids us undisdaining see misfortunes garb and poverty some power of inferior station gave meekness patience resignation  wistless to wrong to pardon free heavns loveliest child humanity stranger to censure or caprice who into virtue construes vice for ever diligent to trace the fairest meaning of the case and decked with tears still free to flow in pity to the suffrers woe  some wondrous virtues all have given sacred and favorites of heaven that wear their glories in their name and want no blazon to proclaim then mortal thy complaints give over  hear  see  be silent and adore yet deign fair goddess i rejoined to solve one doubt within my mind whence is it that on so sweet so fair semblage of qualities thus rare thy beauteous mark has not been set to make the image quite complete mortal had i my power employed and superadded beautys pride the form would much too fair have been too beauteous for the sons of men too rich for mortal shape to have guarded too good for earth to have rewarded too great for future bliss to have mended and more than woman was intended she fled  and instant fled away my vision  i returned to day then to aspasia ran to view whence fancys pen her picture drew where wrapped i stood in bliss extreme surpised to find twas not a dream to the same a new years ode i as late in fancys lap entranced i lay dozing my softer hours away fairer than ida was the mount she pressed in natures richest verdure dressed the earth with roseat fragrance did abound and all methought was paradise around arrayed in summers fairest vest a nymph with tripping motion came in gentle accents smiling she addressed my listening sense  and fortune was her name ii long has the censring world my power despised of every worth my favor dispossessed to prove me blind malicious tales devised and say through me that merit never is blessed mortal to thee nay cease to bend my suit i make and thy assistance crave  my honors to retrieve thy influence lend and from malicious slander save iii there is a nymph with blushes i must own to whom alas too long i have been unknown who can my gifts behold with unregarding eyes and all my power to harm defies some more than human strength supports her mind some resolution not to earth confined alike esteemed my favor and my frown iv one smile from her would soon destroy malice and envys deadliest rage would hebetate fell satires keen annoy and all my cares assuage no more should men this partial maxim mind fortune is fickle false and blind but all should own with joy sincere her power is fixed her judgment clear this day that leads the circling year v lo what a garland is before thee laid of flowers cropped from natures richest tree bestow them all on honors favorite maid  why do thou pause  aspasia must be she behold this branch of pleasures gilded plant whereon the flower content does grow and here is affections leaf of sweetness nothing scant whence peace of mind it is gentle bud shall blow vi lo here a flaunting branch of wealth i have brought plant that shall never cease to bloom for which from age to age whole worlds in toil have sought with friendships odorous sprig to lend divine perfume and here of love to crown it all this middle branch expanding fair and tall stole from the youth whom most the virgin loves vii with awful reverence at her virtues shrine lowly present the fragrant wreath more to commend it let no praise be mine say fate not fortune does the gift bequeath ah should she kindly deign receive what i with more than duteous pleasure give my power my honor shall for ay survive viii mortal in thee i must confide in this thy strictest faith be tried  i bowed in token of my promised care and looked obedience  ere i had expressed my thanks thus honored with so fair behest she vanished into air ix the garden where i lay now over and over with curious search i gan texplore so rich a chaplet to contain a suited cage to form all art were vain yet of the rarest twigs the muse could find in artful plyant foldings twined a neat receptacle the best she could she joined that no unhallowed touch the garland might profane x esteem his nervous stem provides the groundwork to compose honor and fairest truth connect the sinuous sides while here and there between the chains fraternal love like ore through natures richest veins it is supple sweetness shows xi modestys tender leaf oercoverd all preserving from inclement air  thus wellsecurd the muse shall lowly fall and reverentially present regardful of the goddess great intent with sacred wishes and right faithful prayer xii o may this chaplet heighten it is perfume and day by day improve each flower contained each moment richer wealth pleasure friendship love henceforth no blast no damp come near but all in fresher sweets enrobd appear each day that leads each circling year amelia to eucrates while on her deathbed ere these sad lines arrive which now i send the fondest husband and the truest friend those tender titles will no longer prove the living tokens of our mutual love the hint of this piece is taken from a letter in the spectator to colonel r s in spain  which the reader may find in vol   no  0   no more furvive  for since that fatal day when from my bosom thou were torn away the rigid call of honor to obey my maladys increased my end i see and health and joy and life all fled with thee that fond regard i owe the best of men alone enables me to use my pen the pain to write i scarce can undergo and my tears trickle where the ink should flow yet the sole terror death presents to view oh muchloved consort is to part from you else wherefore should i fear his sure behest  no unrepenting folly loads my breast no guilt inexpiate i leave behind no vicious love that dares pollute my mind but in reflecting on those tender hours when love and peace and happiness were ours i reenjoy our every pleasure past and sigh to think they can no longer last  is this a crime to wish their lasting stay and strive to put the stroke of death away no  sure it is pietys and virtues task for such enjoyments length of days to ask those rapturous moments once more to redeem when love and love alone was all our theme when social tenderness approved the flame and friendship sanctified a husbands name since it is not ours texplore the work of fate but descant darkly on that future state where vice shall meet it is due proportioned pain and virtue lasting happiness attain why may we not talleviate the strife twixt hope and fear when we resign this life at least indulge a wish that we may know each stroke that is aimed at mortals here below and be employed perhaps to guide their ways with whom in life we passed our guiltless days  may i over thee a guardian angel placed unseen allay the conflicts in thy breast no more as now a weak and fearful mate to sigh and wish away the stroke of fate but meet misfortune with undaunted eye rush boldly on and deaths worst power defy incapable of wound thy steps attend thy lovely face in battle to defend to view each threatening danger from
