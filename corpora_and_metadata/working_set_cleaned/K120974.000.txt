the nonjuror  a comedy  as it is acted at the theater royal  by his majestys servants  written by mr cibber   pulchra laverna da mihi fallere da justum sanctumque videri noctem peccatis and fraudibus

mrs vanderbank  the scene an anti chamber of sir johns house in london  to the king sir in a time when all communities congratulate your majesty on the glories of your reign which are continually rising from the prosperities of your people be graciously pleased dread sir to permit the lowest of your subjects from the theater to take this occasion of offering their most humble acknowledgments for your royal favor and protection  your comedians sir are an unhappy society whom some severe heads think wholly useless and others dangerous to the young and innocent this comedy is therefore an attempt to remove that prejudice and to show what honest and laudable uses may be made of the theater when its performaces keep close to the true purposes of its institution that it may be necessary to divert the sullen and dissaffected from busying their brains to disturb the happiness of a government which for want of proper amusements they often enter into wild and seditious schemes to reform and that it may likewise make those very follies the ridicule and diversion even of those that committed them our labors have at least this glory to boast that since plays were first exhibited in england they were never totally suppressed but by those very people that turned our church and constitution into irreligion and anarchy  of all errors those that are the effect of superstition make us naturally most obstinate it is therefore no wonder that the blinded proselytes of our few nonjuring clergy are so hard to be recovered by the clearest evidences of sense and reason but when a principle is once made truly ridiculous it is not in the power of human nature not to be ashamed of it from which reflection i was first determined to attack those lurking enemies of our constitution from the stage and though my success has far exceeded my expectation yet i grieve when i perhaps with vanity imagine it might had thrice the good effect on the minds of your majestys people were it not under the misfortune of being written by a comedian i am therefore in some terror notwithstanding its public applause to reflect how far your majesty in your wisdom may think it proper to withold your pardon for the unlicensed boldness of my undertaking i am sensible it may be justly urged against me that even truth and loyalty might have lost their luster by appearing reduced to want the defense of so inconsiderable a champion but as i never believed the best play could be supported in an ill cause so was i assured the worst might pass with favor in a good one and though my duty and concern has made me more careful in the conduct of this than any of my former endeavors i am convinced that what may have been extraordinary in the success of it is utterly owing to a happy choice of the subject and as its meeting no opposition from our public malcontents seems in some degree an argument of the clear and honest truth of those principles it vindicates so may it of the equal falsehood of the rebellious and unchristian tenets it exposes nay i have yet a farther hope that it has even discovered the strength and number of the misguided to be much less than may have been artfully infinuated there being no assembly where people are so free and apt to speak their minds as in a crowded theater of which your majesty may have lately seen an instance in the insuppressible acclamations that were given on your appearing to honor this play with your royal presence  but were the disaffected yet as numerous as some few may wish them what honest englishman can ever think them formidable that considers his security in the wisdom of your majestys counsels and your heroic resolution to execute them and as every action of your regal power has shown the nation that your greatest glory and delight is in being the father of your people so may it convince its enemies that they will always find you king of your subjects  but i am wandering into thoughts that awe me into silence and humbly beg leave to subscribe my self  may it please your majesty your majestys most dutiful and most obedient subject and servant colley cibber  prologue written by n row esquire to night

john woodvil and the colonel col pray consider sir   sir john so i do sir that i a er father and will dispose of her as i please   col i dont dispute your authority sir but am i am your son too i think it my duty to be concerned for your honor have not you countenanced his addresses to my sister has not she received them how then is it possible that either you or she with honor can recede   sir john why sir suppose i was about buying a padnag for your sister and upon enquiry should find him not sound pray sir would there be any great dishonor in being off of the bargain   col with submission sir i dont take that to be the case mr heartlys birth and fortune are too well known to you and i dare swear he may desy the world to lay a blemish upon his principles   sir john why then sir since i must be catechisd i must tell you i dont like his principles for i am informed he is a timeserver one that basely flatters the government and has no more religion than you have   col sir we dont either of us think it proper to make boast of our religion but if you please to enquire you will find we go to church as orderly as the rest of our neighbors   sir john ay to what church   col  st jamess church  the established church   sir john established church   col sir    sir john nay you need not stare sir and before he values himself upon going to church i would first have him be sure he is a christian   col a christian sir   sir john ay that is my question whether he is yet christened i mean by a pastor that had a divine uninterrupted successive right to mark him as a sheep of the true fold   col is it possible are you an englishman and offer sir a question so uncharitable not only to him but the whole nation   sir john nay sir you may give your self what air of amazement you please  i will not argue with you you are both of you too hardened to be converted now but since you thing it your duty as a son to be concerned for my errors i think it as much mine as a father to be concerned for yours  i will only tell you of them if you think fit to mend them  so  if not  take the consequence   col aside o give me temper heaven this vile nonjuring zealot what poisonous principles has he swelled him with  well sir since you dont think it proper to argue upon this subject i will wave it too but if i may ask it without offense are these your only reasons for discountenancing mr heartlys address to my sister   sir john these are they not flagrant would you have me marry my daughter to a pagan for so he is and all of you till you are regularly christians in short son expect to inherit no estate of mine unless you resolve to come into the pale of the church of which i prosess my self a member   col i thought i always was sir and hope i am still unless you have lately been converted to the romans   sir john no sir i abhor the thoughts on it and protest against their errors as much as you do   col if so sir where is our difference   sir john difference twould make you tremble sir to know it but since it is fit you should know it look there  gives him a book read that and be reformed   col what is here reads the case of schism etc thank you sir i have seen enough of this in the daily courant to be sorry its in any hands but those of the common hangman   sir john profanation   col and though i always honored your concern for the churchs welfare i little thought twas for a church that is established no where   sir john o perverseness but there is no better to be expected from your course of life this is all the effects of your modern loyalty your conversation at buttons will you never leave that foul nest of heresy and schism   col yes sir when i see any thing like it there and should think my self obliged to retire where such principles were started  i own i use the place because i generally meet there instructive or diverting company   sir john yes fine company indeed arians partypoets players and presbyterians   col that is a very unusual mixture sir but if a man entertains me innocently am i obliged to enquire into his profession or principles would not it be ridiculous for a protestant that loves music to refuse going to the opera because most of the performers are papists but sir this seems foreign to my business mr heartly intends this morning to pay his respects to you in hopes to obtain your final consent and desired me to be present as a mediator of articles between you   sir john i am glad to hear it   col that is kind indeed sir   sir john may be not sir  for i will not be at home when he comes   col nay pray sir twill be but civility at least to hear him   sir john and because i will not tell a lie for the matter i will go out this moment   col good sir   sir john but because i will not deceive him neither tell him i would not have him lose his time in fooling after your sister  in short i have another man in my head for her  exit sir john col another man twould be worth ones while to know him  pray heaven this nonjuring hypocrite has not got some beggarly traitor in his eye for her  i must rid the house of him at any rate or all the settlement i can hope from my father is a castle in the air nor can indeed his life be safe while such a villain makes it an act of conscience to endanger it if his eyes are not soon opened against him the crowns more likely to inherit his estate than i am and though the government has beey very favorable upon those occasions it is but a melancholy business to perition for what might have been ones birthright my sister may be ruined too  here she comes if there be another man in the case she no doubt can let me into the secret   enter maria sister good morrow  i want to speak with you  mar nay but prithee brother dont put on the wise politic face then why you look as if the minority had like to have carried the question   col come come a truce with your raillery what i have to ask of you is serious and i beg you would be so in your answer   mar well then provided it is not upon the subject of love i will be so  but make haste too  for i have not had my tea yet   col why it is and it is not upon that subject   mar o i love a riddle dearly  come  let us hear it   col nay pish  if you will be serious say so   mar o laid sir i beg your pardon  there  there is my whole form and features totally disengaged and lifeless at your service now put them in what posture of attention you think fit  she leans against him with her arms awkardly falling on her knees col was there ever such a giddy devil  prithee stand up i have been talking with my father and he declares positively you shall not receive any farther addresses from mr heartley   mar are you serious   col he said it this minute and with some warmth too   mar i am glad on it with all my heart   col how glad   mar to a degree do you think a man has any more charms for me for my fathers liking him no sir if mr heartley can make his way to me now he is obliged to me only besides now it may have the face of an amor indeed now one has something to struggle for there is difficulty there is danger there is the dear spirit of contradiction in it too o i like it mightily   col i am glad this does not make you think the worse of heartley  but however a fathers consent might have clapped a pair of horses more to your coach perhaps and the want of that may pinch your fortune   mar burn fortune am not i a fine woman and have not i above  000 l in my own hands   col yes sister but with all your charms you have had it in your hands almost these four years pray consider that too   mar pshah and have not i had the full swing of my own airs and humors these four years but if i will humor my father i will warrant he will make it three or four thousand more with some unlickd lout of a fellow to drub me into the bargain a comfortable equivalent truly  no no let him light his pipe with his consent if he pleases willful against wife for a wager   col well said nothing goes to your heart i find   mar no no brother the suits of my lovers shall not be ended like those at law by dull council on both sides i will hear nothing but what the plaintiff himself can say to me twould be a pretty thing indeed to confine my airs to the directions of a solicitor to look kind or cruel only as the jointure proposed is or is not equal to the fortune my father designs me what do you think i will have my features put into the gazette to be disposed of like a parcel of dirty acres by an old master in chancery to the fairest bidder no if i must have an ill match i will have the pleasure of playing my own game at least   col there spoke the spirit of a freeborn englishwoman  well i am glad you are not startled at the first part of my news however but farther  pray sister has my father ever proposed any other man to you   mar another man let me know why you ask and i will tell you   col why the last words he said to me were that he had another man in his head for you   mar and who is it who is it tell me dear brother quickly   col why you dont so much as seem surpised at it   mar no but impatient and that is as well you know   col why how now sister  gravely mar why sure brother you know very little of female happiness if you suppose the surprise of a new lover ought to shock a woman of my temper  dont you know that i am a coquette   col if you are you are the first that ever was sincere enough to own her being so   mar to a lover i grant you but i make no more of you than a sister i can say any thing to you   col i should have been better pleased if you had not owned it to me  it is a hateful character   mar ay it is no matter for that its violently pleasant and there is no law against it that i know of you had best advise your friend heartley to bring in a bill to prevent it all the discarded toasts prudes and superannuated virgins would give him their interest i dare swear take my word coquetry has governed the world from the beginning and will do so to the end on it   col heartlys like to have a hopeful time on it with you   mar well but dont you really know who it is my father intends me   col not i really but i imagined you might and therefore thought to advise with you about it   mar nay he has not opened his lips to me yet  are you sure he is gone out   col you are very impatient to know methinks what have you to do to concern your self about any man but heartly   mar o lud o lud o lud dont be so wise prithee brother why if you had an empty house to let would you be displeased to hear there were two people about it can any woman think herself happy that is obliged to marry only with a hobsons choice no dont think to rob me of so innocent a vanity for believe me brother there is no fellow upon earth how disagreeable soever but in the long run of his addresses will utter something at least that is worth a poor womans hearing besides to be a little serious heartly has a tincture of jealousy in his temper which nothing but a substantial rival can cure him of   col o your servant madam now you talk reason i am glad you are concerned enough for heartlys faults to think them worth your mending  ha ha   mar concerned why did i say that  look you i will deny it all to him  well if ever i am serious with you again    col here he comes be as merry with him as you please   mar pshah   enter heartly maria takes a book from the table and reads hear dear colonel your servant   col i am glad you did not come sooner for in the humor my father left me twould not have been a proper time to have pressed your affair  i touched upon it  but  i will tell you more presently in the mean time lose no ground with my sister   heart i shall always think my self obliged to your friendship let my success be what it will  madam  your most obedient  what have you got there pray   mar repeating her lively looks a sprightly mind disclose quick as her eyes and as unfixd as those   hear pray madam what is it   mar favors to none to all she smiles extends   hear nay i will see   strugling mar putting him by ost she rejects  but never once offends  col have a care she has dipped into her own character and she will never forgive you if you dont let her through with it   hear i beg your pardon madam  gravely mar bright as the sun her eyes the gazers strike and like the sun they shine on all alike  um  um  hear that is something like indeed   col you would say so if you knew all   hear all what pray what do you mean   col have a little patience i will tell you immediately   hear aside confusion some coxcomb now has been flattering her i will be cursed else she is so full of her dear self upon it   mar turning to heartly if to her share some female errors fall look on her face  and you will forget them all is not that natural mr heartly   hear for a woman to expect it is indeed   mar and can you blame her when it is at the same time a proof of the poor mans passion and her power   hear so that you think the greatest compliment a lover can make his mistress is to give up his reason to her   mar certainly for what have your lordly sex to boast of but your understanding and till that is entirely surrendered to her discretion while the least sentiment holds out against her a woman must be downright vain to think her conquest completed   hear there we differ madam for in my opinion nothing but the most excessive vanity could value or desire such a conquest   mar o do you hear him brother the creature reasons with me nay has the frontless folly to think me in the wrong too o lud he would make a horrid tyrant  positively i will not have him   hear well my comfort is no other man will easily know whether you will have him or not   mar affoctedly smiling am not i a horrid vain silly creature mr heartly   hear a little bordering upon the baby i must own   mar laud how can you love one so then but i dont think you love me though  do you   hear yes faith i do and so shamefully that i am in hopes you doubt it   mar poor man he would fain bring me to reason  smiling in his face hear i would indeed nor am ashamed to own it  nay were it but possible to make you serious only when you should be so you would be the most perfect creature of your sex   mar o lud he is civil    hear come come you have good sense use me but with that and make me what you please   mar laud i dont desire to make any thing of you not i   hear dont look so cold upon me by heaven i cannot bear it   mar well now you are tolerable  gently glancing on him hear come then be generous and swear at least you will never be anothers   mar ah lard now you have spoiled all again beside how can i be sure of that before i have seen this the other man my brother spoke to me of  reads to her self again hear what riddles this  to the col col i told you you did not know all to be serious my father went out but now on purpose to avoid you in short he absolutely retracts his promises says he would not have you fool away your time after my sister and in plain terms told me he had another man in his head for her   hear another man confusion who what is he did not he name him   col no nor has he yet spoke of him to my sister   hear this is unaccountable  what can have given him this sudden turn   col some whim our conscientious doctor has put in his head i will lay my life   hear he he cannot be such a villain he professes a friendship for me   col so much the worse by the way i am now upon the scent of a secret that i hope shortly will prove him a rogue to the whole nation   hear you amaze me  but on what pretense what ground what reason what interest can he have to oppose me  this shock is insupportable  he stands fixed and mute col aside to maria are you really as unconcerned now as you seem to be   mar thou art a strange dunce brother thou know no more of love than i do of a regiment  you shall see now how i will comfort him   she goes to heartly  mimicks his posture and uneasiness then looks seriously in his face and blurts into a laugh hear i dont wonder at your good humor madam when you have so substantial an opportunity to make me uneasy for life   mar o lud how wise he is well his reproaches have that greatness of soul  the confusion they give one is insupportable  betty is the tea ready   enter betty bet yes madam   mar mr heartly your servant  exit col so so you have made a fine spot of work on it indeed   hear dear tom you will pardon me if i speak a little freely i own the levity of her behavior at this time gives me harder thoughts than i once believed it possible to have of her   col indeed my friend you mistake her   hear o pardon me had she any real concern for me the apprehension of a mans addresses whom yet she never saw must have alarmed her to be something more than serious   col not at all for let this man be who he will i take all this levity as a proof of her resolution to have nothing to say to him   hear and pray sir may i not as well suspect that this artful delay of her good nature to me now is meant as a provisional defense against my reproaches in case when she has seen this man she should think it convenient to prefer him to me   col no no she is giddy but not capable of so serious a falsehood   hear it is a sign you dont judge her with a lovers eye   col no but as a stander by i often see more of the game than you do dont you know that she is naturally coquette and a coquetts play with a serious lover is like a back game at tables all open at first she will make you twenty blots  and you  spare none take them all up to be sure while she  gains points upon you so that when you eagerly expect to end the game on your side slap  as you were she whips up your man she is fortified and you are in a worse condition than when you begun with her  upon which you know of course you curse your fortune and she laughs at you   hear faith you judge it rightly  i have always found it so   col in short you are in have to be up and she is resolved to make you play out the game at her leisure you play for the fair stake and she for victory   hear but still what could she mean by going away so abruptly   col you grew too serious for her   hear why who could bear such trifling   col you should have laughed at her   hear i cannot love at that easy rate   col no  if you could the uneasiness would lie on her side   hear do you then really think she has any thing in her heart for me   col ay marry sir  ah if you could but get her to own that seriously now  lord how you could love her   hear and so i could by heaven  eagerly embracing him col ay but it is not the nature of the creature you must take her upon her own terms though faith i thought she owned a great deal to you but now did not you observe when you were impatient with what a conscious vanity she cried  now you are tolerable   hear nay the devil can be agreeable when she pleases   col well well i will undertake for her if my father dont stand in your way we are well enough and i dont question but the alarm he has given us like his other politic projects will end all in fumo   hear what says my lady you dont think she is against us   col i dare swear she is not she is of so soft so sweet a disposition that even provocation cannot make her your enemy   hear how came so fine a creature to marry your father with such a vast inequality of years   col want of fortune frank she was poor and beautiful he rich and amorous  she made him happy and he her    hear a lady   col and a jointure  now she is the only one in the family that has power with our precise doctor and i dare engage she will use it with him to persuade my father from any thing that is against your interest by the way you must know i have some shrewd suspicions that this sanctified rogue is carnally in love with her   hear o the liquorish rascal   col you shall judge by the symptoms first he is jealous of every male thing that comes near her and under a friendly pretense of guarding my fathers honor has persuaded him to abolish her assemblies nay at the last masquerade this conscientious spy unknown to her was eternally at her elbow in the habit of a cardinal at dinner he never fails to sit next her and will eat nothing but what she helps him always takes her side in argument and when he bows after grace constantly ogles her bids my sister if she would look lovely learn to dress by her and at the teatable i have seen the impudent goat most lusciously sip off her leavings she lost one of her slippers the other day by the way she has a mighty pretty foot and what no you think was become of it   hear you puzzel me   col i gad this lovesick monkey had stole it for a private play thing and one of the housemaids when she cleaned

but i dont remember i ever one heard you name them   doct that is only to shorten the service lest in so large a family some few vain idle souls might think it tedious and we ought as it were to allure them to what is good by the gentlest easiest means we can   hear how how doctor are you sure that is your only reason for leaving their names out   doct but pray sir why is naming them so absolutely necessary when heaven without it knows the true intention of our hearts  beside why should we when we so easily may avoid it give the least color of offense to tender consciences   col ay now you begin to open doctor    hear have a care sir the conscience that equivocates in its devotions must have the blackest color hell can paint it with   col well said to him heartly   hear your

outrageous arrogance could have lurked under so lamblike an outside   col this fellow has the spleen and spirit of ten beckets in him   hear what the devil is he whence came he what is his original is he really a doctor   col so he pretends and that he lost his living in ireland upon his refusing the oaths to the government now i have made the strictest inquiries and cannot find the least evidence that ever he was in the country but as i hinted to you there is now in prison a poor unhappy rebel i went to school with whose pardon i am soliciting and he assures me he knew him very well in flanders and in such circumstances as when it can be serviceable to me to know them he faithfully promises to discover but begs till then i will not insist upon it   hear i gad this intelligence may

hands is this poor family fallen into and how the traitor seems to triumph in his power how little is my father like himself by nature open just and generous but this vile hypocrite drives his weak passions like the wind and i foresee at last will dash him on his ruin   hear nothing but your speedily detecting him can prevent it   col i have a thought and it is the only one that can expose him

children makes me shudder at the villainy what desperation may a son be driven to so barbarously disinherited  beside his daughter fair maria too is wronged wronged in the most tender point for so extravagant is this settlement it leaves her not a shilling but on her conditionally marrying with the doctors consent which seems by what i have heard intended as an expedient to oblige her to accept the doctor himself for her husband now twere but an honost part to let maria know this snare that is laid for her this deeds not signed and might be yet pervented  it shall be so  twere folly not to try  my condition cannot be worse  who knows how far her good nature may think herself obliged for the discovery  must he ruin as he has done mine all families he comes into   enter sir john lady

lady w marias of a cheerful temper my dear but i know you dont think she wants discretion   sir john i shall try that presently and you sweetheart shall judge between us in short daughter your course of life is but one continual round of playing the fool to no purpose and therefore i am resolved to make you think seriously and marry   mar that i shall do before i marry sir you may depend upon it   sir john um  that i am not so sure of  but you may depend upon my having thought seriously and that is as well for the person i intend you is of all the world the only man can make you truly happy   mar and of all the world sir that is the only man i will positively marry   lady w aside to mar thou have rare courage maria if i had such a game to play i should be frighted out of my wits   mar lord madam he will make nothing on it depend upon it  aside sir john mind what i say to you  this wonderful man i say  first as to his principles both in church and state in unquestionable   mar sir i leave all that to you for i should never ask him a question about either of them   sir john you need not i am fully satisfied of both  he is a true stanch member of the english catholic church   mar methinks though i would not have him a roman catholic sir because you know of double taxes   sir john no he is no roman   mar very well sir    sir john then as to the state he will shortly be one of the most considerable men in the kingdom and that too in an office for life which on whatsoever pretense of misbehaviour no civil government can deprive him of   mar that is fine indeed i was afraid he had been a clrgyman   sr jhn i have not yet said what his function is  as for his private life  he is sober   mar o i should hate a sot   sir john chaste   mar a hem  stifling a laugh sir john what is it you sneer at madam  you want one of your fine gentlemanrakes i suppose that are snapping at every woman they meet with   mar no no sir i am very well satisfied  i  i should not care for such a sort of man no more than i should for one that every woman was ready to snap at   sir john no you will be secure from jealousy he has experience ripeness of years he is almost forty nine your sexes vanities will have no charm for him   mar but all this while sir i dont find that he has any charm for our sexes vanity how does he look is he tall well made does he dress sing talk laugh and dance well has he a good air good teeth fine eyes fine fair perriwig  does he keep his chaise coach chariot and berlin with fix flouncing flanders does he wear blew velvet clean white stockings and subscribe to the opera   sir john was there ever so profligate a creature what will this age come to   lady w nay maria here i must be against you  now you are blind indeed a womans happiness has little to do with the pleasure her husband takes in his own person   sir john right   lady w it is not how he looks but how he loves is the point   sir john good again   lady w and a wife is much more secure that has charms for her husband than when the husband has only charms for her   sir john admirable go on my dear   lady w do you think child a woman of five and twenty may not be much happier with an honest man of fifty than the finest woman of fifty with a young fellow of five and twenty   sir john mark that   mar ay but when two five and twenties come together  dear papa you must allow they have a chance to be fifty times as pleasant and frolicksome   sir john frolicksome why you sensual idiot what have frolicks to do with solid happiness i am ashamed of you  go you talk worse than a girl at a boardingschool  frolicksome as if marriage were only a license for two people to play the fool according to law methinks madam you have a better example of happiness before your face  here is one has ten times your understanding and she you find has made a different choice   mar lord sir how you talk you dont consider peoples temper i dont say my lady is not in the right but then you know papa she is a prude and i am a coquet she becomes her character very well i dont deny it and i hope you see every thing i do is as consistent with mine your wise folks may lay down what rules they please but it is constitution that governs us all and you can no more bring me sir to endure a man of forty nine than you can persuade my lady to dance in a church to the organ   sir john why you wicked wretch could any thing persuade you to that   mar lord sir i will not answer for any thing i should do when the whims in my head you know i always loved a little flirtation   sir john o horrible my poor mother has ruined her leaving her a fortune in her own hands has turned her brain in short your sentiments of life are shameful and i am resolved upon your instant reformation therefore as an earnest of your obedience i shall first infist that you never see young heartly more for in one word the good and pious doctor wolfs the man that i have decreed your husband   mar ho ho ho  laughing aloud sir john it is very well  this laugh you think becomes you but i shall spoil your mirth  no more  give me a serious answer   mar gravely i ask your pardon sir i should not have smiled indeed could i have supposed it possible that you were serious   sir john you will find me so   mar i am sorry for it but i have an objection to the doctor sir that most fathers think a substantial one   sir john name it   mar why sir you know he is not worth a groat   sir john that is more than you know madam i am able to give him a better estate than i am afraid you will deserve   mar how sir   sir john i have told you what is my will and shall leave you to think on it  enter charles charles aside to sir john sir if you are at leisure the doctor desires a private conference with you upon business of importance   sir john where is he   charles in his own chamber sir just taking his leave of the count and another gentleman that came this morning express from avignon he has sent you too the note you asked him for   sir john it is well i will come to him immediately  ex charles daughter i am called away and therefore have only time to tell you as my last resolution that if you expect a shilling from me the doctor is your husband or i am no more your father  exit sir john and drops the paper mar o madam i am at my wits end not for the little fortune i may lose in disobeying my father but it startles me to find what a dangerous influence this fellow has over all his actions   lady w dear maria i am now as much alarmed as you for though in compliance to your father i have been always inclined to think charitably of this doctor yet now i am convinced it is time to be upon our guard  he is stepping into his estate too   mar here is my brother madam well consult with him   to them the colonel col madam your most obedient  well sister is the secret out who is this pretty fellow my father has picked up for you   mar even our agreeable doctor   col you are not serious   lady w he is the very man i can assure you sir   col confusion what would the jewish cormorant devour the whole family your ladyship knows he is secretly in love with you too   lady w fie fie colonel   col i ask your pardon madam if i speak too freely but i am sure by what i have seen your ladyship must suspect something of it   lady w i am sorry any body else has seen it but i must own his civilities of late have been something warmer than i thought became him   col how then are these opposites to be reconciled can the rascal have the assurance to think both these points are to be carried  but he does nothing like other people he is a contradiction even to his own character most of your nonjurors now are generally people of a free and open disposition mighty pretenders to a conscience of honor indeed but you seldom see them put on the least show of religion but this formal hypocrite always has it at his tongues end and there it sticks for it never gets into his heart i will answer for him   lady w ay but that is the charm that first got him into sir johns heart who good man is himself i am sure sincere however now misguided twas not so much his principles of government as his well painted piety his seeming selfdenial resignation patience and humble outside that gave him first so warm a lodging in his bosom   mar my lady has judged it perfectly right   col i am afraid it is too true there has been his surest footing but here we are puzzled again  what subtle fech can he have in being really in love with your ladyship and at the same time making such a bustle to marry my sister   mar truly one would not suspect him to be so termagant i fancy the gentleman might have his hands full of one of us   col and yet his zeal pretends to be so shocked at all indecent amors that in the country he used to make the maids lock up the turkycocks every saturday night for fear they should gallant the hens on a sunday   lady w o ridiculous   col upon my life madam my sister told me so   mar i tell you so you impudent    lady w fie maria he only jests with you   mar how can you be such a monster to be playing the fool here when you have more reason to be frighted out of your wits you dont know perhaps that my father declares he will settle a fortune upon this fellow too   col what do you mean   lady w it is too true it is not three minutes since he said so   col nay then it is time indeed his eyes were opened and give me leave to say madam it is only in your power to save not only me but even my father too from ruin   lady w i shall easily come into any thing of that kind that is practicable  what is it you propose   col why if this fellow which i am sure of is really in love with you give him a fair opportunity to declare himself and leave me to make my advantage of it   lady w i apprehend you  i am loath to do a wrong thing    mar dear madam it is the only way in the world to expose him to my father   lady w i will think of it   musing col when you do madam i am sure you will come into it  how now what papers this it is the doctors hand   mar i believe my father dropped it   col what is here  reads laid out at

brother leave it where you found it    lady w by all means if sir john should know it is in your hands it may make him desperate    col you are in the right madam  he lays down the paper lady w let us

here it is  what a blessed escape was this if my hotbraind son had found it i suppose by tomorrow he would have been begging my estate for the discovery   enter doctor wolf o doctor all is well i have found my paper  doct i am sincerely glad of it  it might have ruined us   sir john well sir what say our last advices from avignon   doct all goes right  the council has approved our scheme and press mightily for dispatch among our friends in england   sir john but pray doctor    doct hold sir  now we are alone give me leave to inform you better  not that i am vain of any worldly title but since it has pleased our court to dignify me our churches right obliges me to take it   sir john pray sir explain   doct our last express has brought me this  be shows a writing which far unworthy as i am promotes me to the vacant see of thetford   sir john is it possible my lord i joy in your advancement   doct it is indeed a spiritual comfort to find my labors in the cause are not forgotten though i must own some less conspicuous instance of their favor had better suited me such high distinctions are invidious and it would really grieve me sir among my friends to meet with envy where i only hope for love not but i submit in any way to serve them   sir john ah good man this meekness will i hope one day be rewarded  but pray sir  my lord  i beg your lordships pardon  pray what other news how do all our friends are they in heart and cheerful   doct to a man never in such sanguine hopes  the courts extremely thronged  never was there such a concourse of warlike exiles though they talk this sharp season of removing farther into italy for the benefit of milder air well the catholics are the sincerest friends   sir john nay i must do them justice they are truly zealous in the cause and it has often grieved my heart that our churches differences are so utterly irreconcilable   doct o nourish still that charitable thought there is something truly great and humane in it and really sir if you examine well the doctrines laid down by my learned predecessor in his case of schism you will find those differences are not so terribly material as some obstinate schismatics would paint them ah could we but be brought to temper a great many seeming contradictions might be reconciled on both finds but while the laity will interpret for themselves there is indeed no doing it now could we sir like other nations but once restrain that monstrous license ah sir a union then might soon be practicable   sir john auh twill never do here the english are a stubborn heanstrong people and have been so long indulged in the use of their own senses that while they have eyes in their heads you will never be able to persuade them they cannot see there is no making them give up their humane evidences and your credo quia impossible est is an argument they will always make a jest of no no it is not force will do the thing your pressed men dont always make the best soldiers and truly my lord we seem to be wrong too in another point to which i have often imputed the ill success of our cause and that is the taking into our party so may loose persons of dissolute and abandoned morals fellows whom in their daily private course of life the pillory and gallows seem to groan for   doct it is true indeed and i have often wished twere possible to do without them but in a multitude all men will not be all saints and then again they are really useful nay and in many things that sober men will not stoop to  they serve poor curs to brak at the government in the open streets and keep up the wholesome spirit of clamor in the common people and sir you cannot conceive the wonderful use of clamor it is so teizing to a ministry it makes them winch and fret and grow uneasy in their posts  ah many a comfortable point has been gained by clamor it is in the nature of mankind to yield more to that than reason  even socrates himself could not resist it for wise as he was yet you see his wife xantippe carried all her points by clamor come come clamor is a useful monster and we must feed the hungry mouths of it it being of the last importance to us that hope to change the government to let it have no quiet   sir john well there is indeed no resisting mere necessity   doct besides if we suffer our spirits to cool here at home our friends obroad will send us over nothing but excuses   sir john it is true but still i am amazed that france so totally should have left us  mardyke they say will certainly be demolished   doct no matter let them go  we have made a good exchange our new ally is yet better as he is less suspected  but to give them their due we have no spirits among us like the women the ladies have supported our cause with a surprising constancy o there is no daunting them even with ill success they will starve their very vanities their vices to feed their loyalty i am informed that my good lady countess of nightandday has never been seen in a new gown or has once thrown a die at any of the assemblies since our last general contribution   sir john o my good lord if our court abroad but knew what obligations they have to your indefatigable endeavors    doct alas sir i can only boast an honest heart my power is weak i only can assist them with my prayers and zealous wishes or if i had been serviceable have not you sir overpaid me your daughter sir the sair maria is a reward no merit can pretend to   sir john nays good my lord this tender gratitude confounds me  o this insensible girl  pray excuse me   weeps doct you seemed concerned pray what is amiss   sir john that i should be the father of so blind a child alas she slights the blessing i proposed she sees you not my lord with my fond eyes but lay not i beseech you at my door the ungrateful stubbornness of a thoughtless girl   doct nay good sir he not thus concerned for me we must allow her female modesty a time your strict commands perhaps too suddenly surpised her maids must be slowly gently dealt with and might i sir presume to advise    sir john any thing your will shall govern me and her   doct then sir abate of your authority and let the matter rest a while suppose i first should beg your good lady sir to be my friend to her women will hear from their own sex what sometimes even from the man they like would startle them may i have your permission sir when dinner is removed to entertain my lady on this subject privately   sir john o by all means and troth it is an excellent thought i will go this instant and prepare her to receive you and will myself contrive your opportunity   doct you are too good to me sir  too bountiful   sir john nay now my lord you drive me from you   doct pray pardon me   sir john no more i beg you good my lord  your servant  exit doct ha ha what noble harvests have been reaped from bigoted credulity nor ever was a better instance of it would it not make one smile that it should ever enter into the brains of this man who can in other points distinguish like a man that a protestant church can never be secure till it has a popish prince to defend it   enter charles so charles have thou finished those letters  charles i have brought them sir   dct it is very well let them be sealed without a direction and give them to aaron sham the jew when he calls for them  o and  here step yourself this afternoon to mr deseazance of grays inn and give him this thirty pound bill from sir harry foxbound beg him to sit up night and day till the writings are finished for his trial certainly comes on this week he knows we cannot always be sure of a jury and a moments delay may make the commissioners lay hold of his estate   charles my lord i will take the utmost care   doct well charles  gravely smiling charles sir john has told me of the new duty i ought to pay when in private   doct but take special heed that it be only private   charles your lordship need not caution me  my lord i hear another whisper in the family i am told you will shortly be allied to it sir john they say has actually consented i hope my lord you will find the fair maria too as yelding   doct such a proposal has indeed been started but it will end in nothing maria is a giddy wanton thing not formed to make a wise man happy her lifes too vain too sensual to elevate a heart like mine no no i have views more serious   charles o my fluttering joy  aside doct marriage is a state too turbulent for me   charles but with sir johns consent my lord her fortune may be considerable   doct thou know charles my thoughts of happiness were never formed on fortune   charles no i find that by the settlement  aside doct or if they were they would be there impossible marias vain distaste of me i knows as deeply rooted as my contempt of her and can thou think i would stain my character to be a wantons mokery to follow through the wilds of folly she would lead me to cringe and dote upon a senseless toy that every feather in a hat can purchase   charles but may not sir john take it ill my lord to have her slighted   doct no no her ridiculous aversion will secure me from his reproaches   enter a servant serve sir my master desires to speak with you   doct i will wait on him  charles you will take care of my directions   charles i will be sure sir  exit doctor kind heaven i thank thee this bar so unexpectly removed gives vigor to my heart and is i hope an omen of its fortune  but i must lose no time the writing may be every moment called for  this is her chamber  he knocks softly  and betty enters to him  is your lady busy  bett i think she is only a reading   charles will you do me the favor to let her know if she is at leisure i beg to speak with her upon some earnest business   maria enter with a book mar who is that   bett she is here  mr charles madam desires to speak with you   mar o your servant mr charles  here take this odious homer and lay him up again he tires me  exit betty with the book how could the blind wretch make such a horrid fuss about a fine woman for so many volumes together and give us no account of her amors you have read him i suppose in the greek mr charles  charles not lately madam   mar but do you so violently admire him now   charles the critics say he has his beauties madam but ovid has been always my favorite   mar ovid o he is ravishing    charles and so art thou to madness  aside mar lord how could one do to learn greek was you a great while about it   charles it has been half the business of my life madam   mar that is cruel now then you think one cannot be mistress of it in a month ar two   charles not easily madam   mar they tell me it has he softest tone for love of any language in the world i fancy i could soon learn it  i know two words of it already   charles pray madam what are they   mar stay let me see  o  ay zoe kai psyehe   charles i hope you know the english of em madam   mar o lud i hope there is no harm in it i am sure i heard the doctor say it to my lady  pray what is it   charles you must first imagine madam a tender lover gazing on his mistress and then indeed they have a softness in em as thus  zoe kai psyche my life my soul   mar o the impudent young rogue how his eyes spoke too  aside what the duce can he want with me   charles i have startled her she muses  aside mar it always ran in my head this fellow had something in him above his condition  i will know presently aside well but your business with me mr charles you have something of love in your head now ill lay my life on it   charles i never yet durst own it madam   mar why what is the matter   charles my story is too melancholy to entertain a mind so much at ease as yours   mar o i love melancholy stories of all things    charles but mine madam cannot be told unless i give my life into your power   mar o lud you have not done any body a mischief i hope   charles i never did a private injury if i have done a public wrong i am sure it might in me at least be called an honest error   mar pray whom did you serve before you lived with the doctor   charles i was not born to serve and had not an unfortunate education ruined me might have now appeared like what i am by birth a gentleman   mar i am surpised your education say you ruin you lord i am concerned for you pray let me know your story and if any services are in my power i am sure you may command them   charles such soft compassion from so fair a bosom oerpays the word than can attend my owning what i am   mar o your servant  but pray let us hear   charles my fathers elder brother madam was a gentleman of an ancient family in the north who having then no child himself begged me from my nurses arms to be adopted as his own with an assurance too of making me his heir to which my father then alas in the infancy of his fortune easily consented this uncle being himself secretly disaffected to the government gave me of course in my education the same unhappy prejudices which since have ended in the ruin of us both   mar then you were bred a roman catholic   charles no madam but i own in principles of very little difference which i imbibed chiefly from this doctor he having been five years my governor as i grew up my fathersmerit had raised his fortune under the present government and fearing i might be too far fixed in principles against it desired me from my uncle home again but i as i then thought my self bound in gratitude excused my going in terms of duty to my father whom since alas i too justly have provoked ever to hope a reconciliation i saw too late my folly and had no defense against his anger but by artfully confirming him in a belief that i had perished with my uncle in the late rebellion   mar bless us what do you mean you were not actully in it i hope   charles i cannot disown the guilt  but since the royal mercy has been refused to none that frankly have confessed with penitence their crime which from my heart i most sincerely do in that is all my hope  my youth and educations all the excuse i plead if they deserve no pity i am determined to throw off my disguise and bow me to the hand of justice   mar poor creature lord i cannot bear it  with concern charles but then unknown and friendless as i am to whom alas can i apply for succor  weeps mar o lord i will serve you depend upon it my brother shall have no rest till he gets your pardon   charles your kind compassion madam has prevented what if i durst i should have mentioned i hope too i shall personally deserve his favor if not your generous inclination to have saved me even in my last despair of life will give my heart a joy   mar lord the poor unfortunate boy loves me too what shall i do with him but mr charles pray once more to your story  what was it that really drew you into the rebellion   charles this doctor madam who as he is now your fathers was then my uncles bosomcounsellor twas his infidious tongue that painted it to us as an incumbent duty on which the welfare of our souls depended he warmed us too into such a weak belief of vile reports as infamy should blush to mention  we were assured that half the churches here in town were lying all in sacrilegious ruins which since i found maliciously was meant even of those that are magnificently rising from their new foundation   mar but pray  while you were in arms how did the doctor dispose of himself   charles he  went with us madam none so active in the front of resolution till danger came to face him then indeed a friendly fever seized him which on the first alarm of the kings forces marching toward preston gave him a cold pretense to leave the town in the defense of which my uncle lost his life and i my only friend with all my long fed hopes of fortune   mar poor wretch but how came you to avoid being prisoner   charles upon our surrender of the place i bribed a townsman to employ me as his servant in a backward workinghouse where from my youth and change of habit i passed without suspicion till the whole affair was over  but then alas whither to turn i knew not my life grew now no more my care  perish i saw i must whether as a criminal or a beggar was my only choice   mar o lord tell me quickly how you came hither   charles in this despair i wandered up to london where i scarce knew one mortal but some few friends in prison what could i do i ventured even hither for my safety where twas my fortune first to see your father madam distributing relief to several he knew my uncle well and being informed of my condition he charitably took me home and here has ever since concealed me as a menial servant to the doctor the detestation of whose vile dishonest practices at last have waked me to a sense of all my blinded errors of which this writing is his least of sordid instances  gives it to maria mar you frighten me pray what are the prposes of it it is neither signed nor sealed   charles no madam therefore to prevent it by this timely notice was my business here with you your father gave it the doctor first to show his council who having since approved it i understand this evening twill be executed   mar but what is it   charlos it grants to doctor wolf in present four hundred pounds per annum of which this very house is part and at your fathers death invests him in the whole remainder of his free estat for you indeed there is a charge of four thousand pound upon it provided you marry only with the doctors consent if not it is added to my ladys jointure but your brother madam is without conditions uttrly disinherited   mar i am confounded  what will become of us my father now i find was serious  o this insinuating hypocrit let me sa  ay  i will go this minute  sir dare you trust this in my hands for an hour only   charles any thing to serve you  my lifes already in your hands   mar and i dare secure it with my own  hark they ring to dinner pray sir step in say i am obliged to dine abroad and whisper one of the footmen to get an hackney coach immediately then do you take a proper occasion to slip out after me to mr doubles chambers in the temple there i shall have time to talk farther with you you will excuse my hurry  here betty my scarf and a mask  ex maria charles what does my fortune mean me she will there talk farther with me of what what will she talk of o my heart methought she looked at parting too as kindly conscious of some obligation to me and then how soft how amiable tender was her pity of my fortune but o i rave keep down my vain aspiring thoughts and to my lost condition level all my hopes  rather content with pity let me live than hope for more than she resolves to give ex the end of the second act act iii maria and betty taking off her scarf etc mar has any one been to speak with me betty   betty only mr heartly madam he said he would call again and bid his servant stay below to give him notice when you came home   mar you dont know what he wanted   betty no madam he seemed very uneasy at your being abroad   mar well  go and lay up those things  ex betty ten to one but his wise head now has found out something to be jealous of if he lets me see it i shall be sure to make him infinitely easy  here he comes   enter heartly hear your humble servant madam  gravely mar your servant sir   hear you have been abroad i hear   mar yes and now i am come home you see   hear you seem to turn upon my words madam is there any thing particular in them   mar as much as there is in my being abrord i believe   hear might not i say you had been abrord without giving offense   mar and might not i as well say i was come home without your being so grave upon it   hear do you know any thing should make me grave   mar i know if you are so i am the worst person in the world you could possibly show it to   hear nay i dont suppose you do any thing you will not justify   mar o then i find i have done something you think i cannot justify   hear i dont say that neither perhaps i am in the wrong in what i have said but i have been so often used to ask pardon for your being in the wrong that i am resolved henceforth never to rely on the insolent evidence of my own senses   mar you dont know now perhaps that i think this pretty smart speech of yours is very dull but since that is a fault you cannot help i will not take it ill come now be as sincere on your side and tell me seriously  is not what real business i had abroad the very thing you want to be made easy in   hear if i thought you would make me easy i would own it   mar now we come to the point  to morrow moring then i give you my word to let you know it all till when there is a necessity for its being a secret and i insist upon your believing it   hear but pray madam what am i to do with my private imagination in the mean time that is not in my power to confine and sure you will not be offended if to avoid the tortures that may give me i beg you will trust me with the secret now   mar dont press me for positively i will not   hear cannot had been a kinder term  is my disquiet of so little moment to you   mar of none while your disquiet dares not trust the assurances i have given you if you expect i should confide in you for life dont let me see you dare not take my word for a day and if you are wise you will think so fair a trial of your faith a favor   hear if you intend it such  it is a favor if not it is something  so  come let us wave the subject   mar with all my heart have you seen my brother lately   hear yes madam and he tells me it seems the doctor is the man your father has resolved upon   mar it is so nay and what will more surprise you he leaves me only to the choice of him or of no fortune   hear and may i without offense beg leave to know what resolutions madam you have taken upon it   mar i have not taken any i do not know what to do what would you advise me to   hear i advise you to nay you are in the right to make it a question   mar he says he will settle all his estate upon him too   hear o take it take it to be sure it is the fittest match in the world you cantt do a wiser thing certainly   mar twill be as wise at least as the ways you take to prevent it   hear i find madam i am not to know what you intend to do and i suppose i am to be easy at that too   mar when i intend to marry him i shall not care whether you are easy or no   hear if your indifference to me were a proof of your inclination to him the gentleman need not despair   mar very well sir i will endeavor to take your advice i promise you   hear o that will not cost you much trouble i dare say madam   mar about as much i suppose as it cost you to give it me   hear upon my word madam i gave it purely to oblige you   mar then to return your civility the least i can do is to take it   hear is it possible how can you torture me with this indifference   mar why do you insult me with such a barefaced jealousy   hear is it a crime to be concerned for what becomes of you has not your father openly declared against me in favor of my rival how is it possible at such a time not to have a thousand fears what though they all are false and groundless are they not still the effect of love alarmed and anxious to be satisfied i have an open artless heart that cannot bear disguises but when it is grieved in spite of me twill show it  pray pardon me  but when i am told you went out in the utmost hurry with some writings to a lawyer and took the doctors own servant with you even in the very hour your father had proposed him as your husband  good heaven what am i to think can i must i suppose my senses fail me if i have eyes have ears and have a heart must it be still a crime to think i see and hear  yet by my torments feel i love   mar asid well i own it looks illnatured now now to show him some concern  but then this jealousy  i must and will get the better of   hear speak maria is still my jealousy a crime   mar if you sll insist on it as a proof of love then i must tell you sir it is of that kind that only slighted hearts are pleased with when i am so reduced then i prehaps may bear it  the fact you charge me with i grant is true i have been abroad as you say but still let appearance look never so pointing while there is a possibility in nature that what i have done may be innocent i will not bear a look that tells me to my face you dare suspect me if you have doubts why dont you satisfy them before you see me can you suppose that i am to stand confounded as a criminal before you how despicable a figure must a woman make to bear but such a moment come come there is nothing shows so low a mind as these grave and insolent jealousies the man that is capable of ever seeing a woman after he believes her false is capable on her submission and a little flattery were she really false poorly to forgive and bear it   hear you will not find me madam of so low a spirit but since i see your tyranny arises from your mean opinion of me it is time to be my self and disavow your power you use it now beyond my bearing not only impose on me to disbelieve my senses but do it with such an imperious air as if my honest manly reason were your slave and this poor grovelling frame that follows you durst show no signs of life but what you deign to give it   mar oh you are in the right  go on  suspect me still believe the worst you can  it is all true  i dont justify my self  why do you trouble me with your complaints if you are master of that manly reason you have boasted give me a manly proof of it at once resume your liberty despise me go go off in triumph now and let me see you scorn the woman whose vile oerbearing falsehood would insult your senses   hear o heaven is this the end of all are then those tender prorestations you have made me for such i thought them when with the softest ind reluctance your rising blushes gave me something more than hope  what all  o maria all but come to this   mar aside o lud i am growing silly if i hear on i shall tell him every thing it is but another struggle and i shall conquer it  so so you ar not gone i see   hear do you then wish me gone madam   mar your manly reason will direct you   hear this is too much  my

nice if wives were never to dissemble what would become of many wilful husbands happiness   lady w nay that is true too   mar i would give the world now methinks to see this solemn interview sure there cannot be a more ridiculous image than unlawful love peeping his sly head out from under the cloak of sanctity o that i were in your ladyships place i would lead that dancing blood of his such a profane courant  your wise fellows make the rarest fools too but your ladyship will make a rogue of him and that will do our business at present   lady w if he makes himself one it is his own fault   mar dear madam one moments truce with the prude i beg you dont start at his first declarations but let him go on till he shows the very bottom of his ugly heart   lady w i will warrant you i will give

ay but i am ticklish   doct they are indeed come to a prodigious perfection in this manufacture  how wonderful is humane art  here it disputes the prize with nature  that all this soft and gaudy luster should be wrought from the poor labors of a worm  stroking it lady w but our business sir is upon another subject sir john informs me that he thinks himself under no obligation to mr heartly and therefore resolves to give you maria now pray be sincere and let me know what your real intentions are   doct is it possible can you divine perfection be still a stranger to my real thoughts has not one action of my life informed you better since i must plainly speak them then marias but a feint a blind to screen my real thoughts from shrewd suspicions eye and shield your spotless fame from worldly censure could you then think twas for marias sake your balls assemblies and your toilet visits have been restrained would i have urged sir john to make that fence to enclose a butterfly no soft and serious excellence your virtues only were the object of my care i could not bear to see the gay the young and the inconstant daily basking in your diffusive beams of beauty without a secret grudg i might say envy even of such insects happiness   lady w well sir i take all this as i suppose you intended it for my good my spiritual welfare   doct indeed i meant you serious cordial service   lady w i dare say you did you are above the low and momentary views of this world   doct ah i should be so  and yet alas i find this mortal clothing of my soul is made like other mens of sensual flesh and blood and has its frailties   lady w we all have those but yours i know are well corrected by your divine and virtuous contemplations   doct and yet our knowledge of eternal beauties do not restrain us wholly from the love of all that is mortal  beauty here it is true must die but while it lives twas given us to admire to wake the sluggish heart and charm the sensible at the first sight of you i felt unusual transports in my soul and trembled at the guilt that might ensue but on reflection found my flame received a sanction from your goodness and might be reconciled with virtue on this i chaced my slandrous fears let in the harmless passion at my eyes and gave up all my heart to love   col behind indeed so warm sir roger but i shall cool your passion with a witness  exit lady w these gay professions sir show more the courtier than the zealot nor could i think a mind so fortify as yours could have been open to such vain temptation   doct what bosom can be proof against such artillery of love i may resist call all my prayers my fastings tears and penance to my aid but yet alas these have not made an angel of me i am still but man virtue may strive but nature will be uppermost permit me then on this fair shrine to pay my vows and offer up a heart    lady w hold sir you have said enough to put you in my power suppose i now should let my husband sir your benefactor know the favor you designed him  she rises doct you cannot be so cruel   lady w nor will on one condition   doct name it   lady w that instantly you renounce all claim and title to maria and use your utmost interest with sir john to give her with her full fortune to mr heartly if you are wise consider on it  sir john and cl behind the doctor  accidentally sees them doct ha the colonel ther his father with him too  may have been some treachery what is to be done   col now sir let your eyes convince you   sir john they do that yours sir have deceived you all this i knew of  apart col how sir   sir john observe and be convinced   doct i have it   lady w to the doctor methinks this business needs not sir so long a pause   doct madam i cannot easily give up such honest hopes   lady w honest   doct perhaps my years are thought unequal to my flame but lady those were found no strong objection twixt sir john and you and can you blame me then for following so sure a guide in the same youthful path to happiness   lady w is this your resolution then   col will you let him go on sir   sir john yes sir to confound your slander  apart col monstrous   doct can you suppose my heart less capable of love than his is it for me to push the blessing from me too for though my flame has been of long duration my conscious want of merit kept it still concealed till his good nature brought it to this blessed occasion and can you then so authorized refuse your friendly pity to my sufferings one word from you compleats my joy in you madam is my only hope my fear my ease my pain my torment or my happiness maria o maria   col confusion   sir john coming forward with the colonel now vile detractor of all virtue is your outrageous malice yet confounded did i not tell you too he only made an interest here to gain your sister   col his devil has outreacht me  aside sir john is this your rank detection of his treachery   doct sir john i did not see you sir i doubt you are come too soon i have not yet prevailed with her  aside to him sir john ah good man be not concerned your trouble shall be shortr for it i will force her to compliance   lady w what have you done  your impatience has ruined all  apart col i s it now too late   sir john now sir will your bas prjudice of party never b at rest am i to be  thought partial blind and obstinate to favor so much injured virtue if thou art a man not lost to conscience or to honor then like a man repair this wrong confess the rancour of thy vile suspicion and throw thee at his feet for pardon   doct what mean you sir   lady w aside while he is in this temper he will not easily be undeceived  i have yet an after game to play till when it is best to leave him in his error  ex lady woodvil sir john what mute defenseless hardened in thy malice   col i scorn the imputation sir and with the same repeated honesty avow however his cunning may have changed appearances that you are still deceived that all i told you sir was true these eyes these ears were witnesses of his audacious love without the mention of my sisters name directly plainly grossly tending to abuse the honor of your bed   sir john audacious monster were not your own senses evidence against your frontless accusation i see your aim wife children servants all are bent against him and think to weary me by groundless clamours to discard him but all shall not do your malice on your own vile heads to me it but the more endears him either submit and ask his pardon for this wrong    doct good sir   sir john or this instant leave my sight my house my family for ever   doct what means this rashness sir on my account it must not be what would the world report of it i grant it possible he loves me not but you must grant it too as possible he might mistake me it must be so  he is too much your son to do his enemy a wilful injury if he i say supposed my converse with your lady criminal to accuse me then was but the error of his virtue not his baseness you ought to love him thank him for such watchful care was it for him to se as he believed your honor in so soul a danger and stand concernless by the law of heaven of nature and of filial duty all obliged him to allarm your vengeance and detect the villainy   sir john o miracle of charity   doct come come such breaches must not be betwixt so good a son and father forget forgive embrace him cherish him and let me bless the hour i was the occasion of so swt a reconcilement   sir john i cannot bear such goodness o sink me not into the earth with shame  hear this perverse and reprobate o could thou wrong such more than mortal virtue   col wrong him the hardened impudence of this painted charity    sir john peace monster    col is of a blacker deeper dye than the great devil himselfin all his triumphs over innocence ever wore   sir john o graceless infidel   col no sir though i would hazard life to save you from the ruin he misleads you to could die to reconcile my duty to your favor yet on the terms that villain offers it is merit to refuse it i glory in the disgrace your errors give me  but sir i will trouble you no more to day is his  to morrow may be mine  exit col doct i did not think he had had so hard a nature   sir john o my good lord your charitable heart discovers not the rancour that is in his but what better can be hoped for from a wretch so swelled with spleen and rage of party   doct no no sir i am the thorn that galls him it is me it is me he hates he thinks i stand before him in your favor and it is not fit indeed i should do so for fallen as he is he is still your son and i alas an alien an intruder here and ought in conscience to retire and heal these hapless breaches in your family   sir john what means your lordship   doct but i will remove this eyesore  here charles   enter charles sir john for goodness sake   doct bring me that writing i gave you to lay up this morning   charles now fortune favor us aside exit charles   sir john make haste good charles it shall be signed this moment   doct not for the world twas not to that end i sent for it but to refuse your kind intentions for with your chrildrens curses sir i dare not must not take it   sir john nay good my lord you carry it now too far my daughter is not wronged by it but if not obstinate may still be happy and for my wicked son shall he then heir my lands to propagate more miserable schismatics no let him depend on you whom he has wronged perhaps in time he may reflct upon his fathers justice be reconciled to your rewarded virtues and rform his  errors   reenter charles with a writing doct that would be indeed a blessing   sir john if heaven should at last reclaim him the power to right him still is yours in you i know he yet would find a fond forgiving father   doct the imagination of so blessed an hour softens me to a tenderness i cannot support   sir john o the dear good man come come let us in to execute this deed   doct will you then force me to accept this trust for call it what you will with me it shall never be more than such   sir john let that depend upon the conduct of my son   doct well sir since yet it may prevent his ruin i consent  so sweet a hope must all my fears control i take the trust as guardian to his soul exeunt the end of the third act act iv maria and charles mar you were a witness then   charles i saw it signed sealed and delivered madam   mar and all passed without the least suspicion   charles sir john signed it with such earnestness and the doctor received it with such a seeming reluctance that neither had the curiosity to examine a line of it   mar well mr charles whether it succeeds to our ends or not we have still the same obligations to you you saw with what a friendly warmth my brother heard your story and i dont in the least doubt his success in your affair at court   charles what i have done my duty bound me to but pray madam give me leave without offense to ask you one innocent question   mar freely sir   charles have you never suspected then that in all this affair i have had some secret stronger motive to it than barely duty   mar yes  but have you been in no apprehensions i should discover that motive  gravely charles pray pardon me i see already i have gone too far   mar not at all it loses you no merit with me nor is it in my nature to use any one ill that loves me unless i loved that one again then indeed there might be danger  come dont look grave my inclinations to another shall not hinder me paying every one what is due to their merit i shall therefore always think my self obliged to treat your misfortunes and your modesty with the utmost tenderness   charles by the dear soft ease you have given my heart i never hoped for more   mar then i will give you a great deal more and to show my particular good opinion of you i will do you a favor mr charles i never did any man since i was born  i will be sincere with you   charles is it then possible you can have loved another to whom you never were sincere   mar alas you are but a novice in the passion  sincerity is a dangerous virtue and often surfeits what it ought to nourish therefore i take more pains to make the man i love believe i slight him than if possible i would to convince you of my esteem and friendship   charles be but sincere in that madam and i cannot complain   mar nay i will give you a proof of it i will show you all the goodnature you can desire you shall make what love to me you please now but then i will tell you the consequence i shall certainly be pleased with it and that will flatter you till i do you a mischief now do you think me sincere   charles i scarce consider that but i am sure you are agreeable   mar why look you there now do you consider that a woman had as live be thought agreeable as handsome and how can you suppose from one of your sense that i am not pleased with being told so   charles was ever temper so enchanting   mar or vanity more venial i am pleased with you  smiling charles distracting sure never was despair administered with a hand so gentle   mar so now you have convinced me i have a good understanding too  why i shall certainly have the better opinion of yours for finding it out now   charles your good opinions what i aim at   mar ay but the more i give it you the better you will think of me still and then i must think the better of you again and then you the better of me upon that too and so at last i shall think seriously and you will begin to think ill of me but i hope mr charles your good sense will prevent all this   charles i see my folly now and blush at my presumption but yet to cure my weaning heart and reconcile me to my doom be yet sincere and satisfy one sickly longing of my soul   mar to my power command me   charles o tell me then the requisites i want and what is the secret charm that has preferred my rival to your heart   mar come then be cheerful and i will answer like a friend the gentleness and modesty of your temper would make with mine but an unequal mixture with you i should be ungovernable not know my self your compliance would undo me i am by nature vain thoughtless wild and wilful therefore ask a higher spirit to control and lead me for whatever outward airs i give my self i am within convinced a woman makes a very wrong figure in happiness that does not think superiority best becomes her husband  but what is yet more though i confess you have qualities uncommon in your sex and such as ought to warm a heart to love yet here you come too late compassions all within my power and i know you cannot but have seen i am under obligations i need not explain to you   charles i am satisfied  you treat me with so kind and gentle a concern that i must submit to it   mar apart well when all is done he is a pretty fellow and the first sure that ever heard reason against himself with so good an understanding   enter a servant with a letter to charles serve sir the colonel ordered me to give this into your own hands   mar from my brother  where is he   serve i left him madam at the secretarys office with one sir charles trueman and mr heartly  exit serve charles ha my father o heaven it is his hand too now i tremble   mar come sir take heart i dare say there is good news in it and i should be glad to hear it  but no ceremony pray read to your self first   charles since you command me madam  reads to himself maria apart lord how one may live and learn i could not have believed that modesty in a young fellow could have been so amiable a virtue and though i own there is i know not what of dear delight in indulging ones vanity with them yet upon serious reflection we must confess that truth and sincerity have a thousand charms beyond it and i now find more pleasure in my selfdenying endeavors to make this poor creature easy than ever i took in humbling the airs and assurance of a man of quality  i believe i had as good confess all this to heartly and even make up the bustle with him too  but then he will so teaze one for instances of real inclination  o god  i cannot bear the thought on it  and yet we must come together too  well nature knows the way to be sure and so i will even trust to her sort  bless me what is the matter you seem concerned sir  to charles wiping his tears charles i am indeed but it is with joy o madam my fathers reconciled to me this letter is from him   mar pray let us hear   charles reading dear charles this day by colonel woodvil i received the joyful news of your being yet alive and well though that is but half my comfort he has assured me too you have renounced those principles that made me think your death my happiness the services you have intended his family and may do the government in your just detection of a traitor that would ruin both have been so well received at court and so generously represented there by the colonel and mr heartly that they have obtained an order for your pardon which i now stay the passing of before i throw my arms about you that i may have no doubt or fear behind to interupt the fullness of my joy i am informed that in revealing your self to a certain fair lady you have let fall some words that show you have an innocent though hopeless passion for her your youth excuses what is past but now consider how far you owe your life to mr heartly i therefore charge you on my blessing to give up every idle thought of love that may interrupt his happiness or abate the merit of what you have done to deserve the pardon of your sovereign or of your affectionate forgiving father  charles trueman   mar i an overjoyed at your good fortune   charles you madam are the scource of all  but i am now unfit to thank you  weeps mar you owe me nothing sir success was all i hoped for   charles pray excuse me  it would be rudeness to trouble you with the tender thoughts this must give a heart obliged like mine  exit charles mar poor creature how full his honest heart is what early vicissitudes of fortune has he run through well this was handsomely done of heartly considering what he had felt upon his account to be so concerned for his pardon   enter lady woodvil lady w dear maria what will become of us the tyranny of this subtle priest is insupportable he has so fortified himself in sir johns opinion by this last misconduct of your brother that i begin to lose my usual power with him   mar pray explain madam   lady w in spite of all i could urge he is this minute bringing the doctor to make his addresses to you   mar i am glad on it for the best must come like a bear to the stake i am sure he knows i shall bait him   lady w no no he presses it to keep sir john still blind to his wicked design upon me  therefore i came to give you notice that you might be prepared to receive him   mar i am obliged to your ladyship our meeting will be a tender scene no doubt on it   lady w you have heard i suppose what an extravagant settlement your father has signed to   mar yes madam but i am glad your ladyships like to be a gainer by it however for when i marry it will be without the doctors consent depend upon it   lady w no child i did not come into sir johns family with a design to injure it or make any one of it my enemy whenever that four thousand pound falls into my hands you will find it as firmly yours as if it had been given you without that odious condition   mar madam i think my self as much obliged by this kind intention as the performance but if your ladyship could yet find a way to prove this hypocrite a private villain to my father i am not without hopes the public will soon have enough against him to give a turn to the settlement   lady w but suppose that fails what will become of your poor brother   mar but dear madam i cannot suppose this fellow must not be hanged at last and then you know the same honest hand that ties him up releases the settlement   lady w not absolutely neither for this very house is given him in present which though that were to be the end of him would then be sorfeited   mar why then my brother must even petition the government there have been presidents of the same favor madam if not he must pay for his blundering and lay his next plot deeper i think   lady w i am glad you are so cheerful upon it however it looks as if you had something in petto to depend upon but here comes the doctor   enter sir john with the doctor sir john daughter since you have the happiness to be thought amiable in the eye of this good man i expect you give him an instant opportunity to improve it into an amity for life   mar i hope sir i shall give him no occasion to alter his opinion of me   sir john why that is well said come sweetheart well use no ceremony  exit sir john with lady w marra and the doctor stand some time mute in formal civilities and a conscious contempt of each other mar please to sit sir  what can the ugly cur say to me he seems a little puzzled this puts me in mind of the tender interview between lady charlotte and lord hardy in the funeral  aside doct look you fair lady not to make many words i am convinced notwithstanding your good fathers favor i am not the person you desire to be alone with upon this occasion   mar your modesty  is pleased to be in the right sir   doct humh if i dont flatter my self you have always had a very ill opinion of me   mar a worse sir of no mortal breathing   doct humh and it is likely it may he immovable   mar no rock so firm   doct humh from these premises then i may reasonably conclude  you hate me heartily   mar most sincerely sir   doct well there is however some merit in speaking truth therefore to be as just on my side i ought in conscience to let you know that i have as cordial a contempt for you too   mar o fie you flatter me  affecting a blush doct indeed i dont you wrong your own imperfections to think so   mar these words from any tongue but yours might shock me but coming from the only man i hate  they charm me   doct admirable there seems good sense in this have you never observed madam that sometimes the greatest discords raise the most agreeable harmony   mar yes but what do you infer from thence   doct that while we still preserve this temper in our hate a mutual benefit may rise from it   mar o never fear me sir i shall not fly out being convinced that nothing gives so sharp a point to ones a version as good breeding as on the contrary ill manners often hide a secret inclination   doct most accurately distinguished  well madam is there no project you can think of now to turn this mutual a version as i said into a mutual benefit   mar none that i know of unless we were to marry for our mutual mortification   doct what would you give then to avoid marrying me   mar my life with joy if death alone could shun you   doct when you marry any other person  my consent is necessary   mar so i hear indeed  but pray doctor tell me how could your modesty receive so insolent a power without putting my poor father out of countenance with your blushes   doct you overrate my prudence i sought it not but he would crowd it in among other obligations he is goodnatured and i could not shock him by a refusal would you have had me plainly told him what a despicable opinion i had of his daughter   mar or rather what a favorable one you had of his wife sir   doct humh you seem to lose your temper   mar why do you suppose the whole family does not see it except my father   doct if you will keep your temper i have something to propose to you   mar your reproof is just but i only raised my voice to let you know i know you   doct you might have spared your pains it being of no consequence to my proposal what you think of me   mar not unlikely come sir i am ready to receive it   doct in one word then  i take it for granted that you would marry mr heartly  am i right   mar once in your life you are   doct nay no compliments let us be plain  would you marry him   mar you are mighty nice methinks  well  i would   doct then i will not consent to it  now if you have any proposal to make me  so  if not our amours at an end and we part as civil enemies as if he had been married this twelvemonth  think of it   mar aside o the mercenary villain he wants to have a fellow feeling i find  what shall i do with him  bite him  pretend to comply and make my advantage of it  well sir i understand every thing but the sum  if we agree upon that it is a bargain   doct half   mar what two thousand pound for your consent only   doct why is not two thousand pound worth two thousand pound dont you actually get so much by it is not the half better than nothing come come say i have used you like a friend   mar nay i think it is the only civil thing you have done since you came into the family   doct do you then make your advantage of it   mar why as you say doctor it is better than nothing but how is my father to be brought into this   doct leave that to my management   mar what security though do you expect for this money   doct o when i deliver my consent in writing heartly shall lay it me down in bankbills   mar well on one proviso i will undertake that too   doct name it   mar upon your immediately owning to my father that you are willing to give up your interest to mr heartly   doct humh stay  i agree to it  you shall have proof of it this evening  but in the mean time let me warm you too dont expect after i have hinted what you desire to your father to make your advantages now by betraying me to him you know my power there if you do i can easily give it a counterturn so discover what you please i shall only pity you   mar o i shall not stand in my own light i know your power and your conscience too well dear doctor   doct nay i dare depend upon your being true to your own interest here comes your father i will break it to him immediately you will prepare mr heartly in the mean time   mar without fail   doct i am satisfied   enter sir john sir john well sir is my daughter prudent has she at last a true and virtuous sense of happiness   doct she understands me better than i hoped sir   mar well said equivocation  aside doct if you please sir john well take a turn in the garden i have something there to offer to you   sir john with all my heart sir  maria  there is a toy for thee  now thou art again my daughter  gives her a ring come sir i wait on you  exeunt sir john and doctor mar what this fellows original was i know not but by his conscience and cunning he would make an admirable jesuit  here comes my brother and i hope with a good account of him  well brother what success   enter colonel col all that my honest heart could wish for  substantial affidavits that will puzzle him to answer i have planted a messenger at the next door who has a warrant in his pocket when i give the word to take him   mar why should not you do it immediately he is now in the garden with my father   col no our seizing him now for treason i am afraid will not convince my father of his villainy my design is not only to get my father out of his hands but to drive the pernicious principles he has instilled out of my father too   mar that i doubt will be difficult   col not at all if we can first prove him a private villain to him my fathers honesty will soon reflect and may receive as sudden a turn as his credulity   mar that is true again and i hope i am furnished with a new occasion to begin the alarm to him   col pray what is it   mar not to trouble you with particulars but in short i have agreed with the doctor that heartly shall give him two thousand pounds for his consent without which you know by my fathers late settlement heartly and i can never come together   col and does the monster really insist upon it   mar not only that but even defies me to make an advantage of the discovery   col one would think the villain suspects his footing in the family is but shortlived he is in such haste to have his pennyworths out on it but prithee sister what secrets this that you have yet behind in those writings that charles brought to you   mar o that is what i cannot yet tell you   col why pray   mar because when you have done all you can i am resolved to reserve some merit against him to my self   col but why do you suppose i would not assist in it   mar you cannot it is now too late   col pshah this is rash and ridiculous   mar ay may be so i suppose heartly will be of that opinion too but if he is you had better advise him to keep it to himself   col you will have your obstinate way i find   mar it cannot be worse than yours i am sure remember how you came off in your last project i know you meant well but you are disinherited for all that   col that is no surprise to me but i am ashamed however   mar by the way what have you done with heartly why is he not here   col he has been here but you must excuse him he was obliged to call in haste for charles whom he took home with him in his own coach where his father waited to receive him   mar the poor boy by this time then has seen him sure their meeting must have been a moving sight i would give the world methinks for a true account of it   col you will have it from heartly by and by it is at his house they meet the father sir charles trueman happened to be heartlys intimate acquaintance   mar well i own heartly has gained upon me by this   col i am glad to hear that at least but i must let my lady know what progress we have made in the doctors business and beg her assistance to finish him  ex col enter a servant ser madam mr heartly   mar desire him to walk in   enter heartly hear to find you thus alone madam was an happiness i did not expect from the temper of our last parting   mar i should have been as well pleased now to have been thanked as reproached for my good nature but you will be in the right i find   hear indeed you took me wrong i literally meant that i was afraid you would not so soon think i had deserved this favor   mar well then one of us has been in the wrong at least   hear twas i i own it  more is not in my power all the amends that have been i have made you my very joy of seeing you has waited till what you had at heart unasked was perfected my own pardon was postpond till i had secured one even for a rivals life whom you so justly had compassionated   mar pooh but why would you say unasked now dont you consider your doing it so is half the merit of the action  lord you have no art you should have left me to have taken notice of that only imagine now how kind and handsome an acknowledgment you have robbed me of   heart and yet how artfully you have paid it with what a wanton charming ease you play upon my tenderness   mar well but was not you silly now   hear gazing on her come  you shall not be serious  you cannot be more agreeable   mar o but i am serious   hear then i will be so  do you forgive me all   mar what  looking on her fan as not hearing him hear are we friends maria   mar o lord but you have told me nothing of poor charles pray how did his father receive him   hear must you needs know that before you answer me   mar lord you are never well till you have talked one out of countenance   hear come i will not be too particular you shall answer nothing  give me but your hand only   mar pshah i will not pull off my glove not i   hear i will take it as it is then   mar lord there there eat it eat it  putting it awkwardly to him hear and so i could by heaven  kisses  eagerly and pulls off her glove mar o my glove my glove my glove  pooh you are in a perfect storm lord if you make such a rout with ones hand only what would you do if you had ones heart   hear that is impossible to tell  but you were asking me of charles madam   mar o ay that is true well now you are good again  come tell me all that affair and then you shall see  how i will like you  wantonly hear o that i could thus play with inclination   mar pshah but you dont tell me now   hear there is not much to tell  where two such tender passions met words had but faintly spoke them the son conducted to the door with sudden fear stopped short and bursting into sights over changed with shame and joy had almost fainted in my arms the father touched with his concern moved forward with a kindly smile to meet him at this he took new life and springing from his hold fell protestate at his feet where mute and trembling for a while he lay at length with streaming eyes and faultring tongue he begged his blessing and his pardon the tender father caught him in his arms and dropping his fond head upon his cheek kissed him and sighed out heaven protect thee then gave into his hand the royal pardon and turning back his face to dry his manly eyes he cried deserve this royal mercy charles and i am still thy father the grateful youth raising his heartswollen voice replied may heaven preserve the royal life that gave it but here their passions grew too strong for farther speech silent embraces alternate sighs and mingling tears were all their language now the moving scene became too tender for my eyes and called methought for privacy there unperceived i left them to recover into breathing sense and utterable joy   mar well of all the inmost transports of the soul there is none that dance into the heart like friendly reconcilements   hear those transports might be ours maria would you bu try your power to pardon   mar which of those two now do you think was happiest at that meeting   hear o the father doubtless great souls feel a kind of honest glory in forgiving that far exceds the transport of receiving pardon   mar now i think to bend the stubborn mind to ask it is an equal conquest and the joy superior to receive where the heart wishes to be under obligations   hear put me into the happy boys condition and i may then perhaps resolve you better   mar you shall positively bring him into acquaintance   hear upon my word i will   mar and show him to all the women of taste and i will have you call him my pretty fellow too   hear i will indeed but hear me    mar i am positive if he had white stockings he would cut down all the danglers at court in a fortnight   hear o no doubt on it but    mar you cannot conceive how prettily he makes love now   hear not so well as you make your defense maria   mar o lord i had forgot  he is to teach me greek too   hear o the trifling tyrant how long maria do you think you can find out new evasions for what i say unto you   mar lord you are horrid silly but since it is love that makes you such a dunce  poor heartly  i forgive you  enter colonel unseen hear that is kind however  but to complete my joy be kinder yet  and    mar o i cannot i cannot  lord did you never ride a horsematch   hear was ever so wild a question   mar because if you have it runs in my head you certainly galloped a mile beyond the winning post to make sure on it   hear now i understand you but since you will have me touch every thing so very tenderly maria how shall i find proper words to ask you the lovers last necessary question   mar o there is a thousand points to be adjusted before that is answered   col coming unexpectedly between them name them this moment then for positively this is the last time of asking   mar pshah who sent for you   col i only came to teach you to speak plain english my dear   mar lord mind your own business cannot you   col so i will for i will make you do more of yours in two minutes than you would have done without me in a twelvemonth why how now what do you think the mans to dangle after your ridiculous airs for ever   mar this is mighty pretty   col you will say so on thursday sevenight for let affairs take what turn they will in the family that is positively your wedding day  nay you shall not stir   mar was ever such assurance   hear upon my life madam i am out of countenance i dont know how to behave my self to him   mar no no let him go on only  this is beyond whatever was known sure   hear admirable i hope it will come to something  aside col ha ha if i were to leave you to yourselves now what a couple of pretty out of countenance figures you would make humming and hawing upon the vulgar  of jointure and pin money  come come i know what is proper oboth sides you shall leave it to me   hear i had rather maria would name her own terms to me   col have you a mind to any thing particular  to maria mar why sure what do you think i am only to be filled out here as you please and sweetened and supped up like a dish of    col why pray madam when your teas ready what have you to do but to drink it but you i suppose expect a lovers heart like your lamp should be always flaming at your elbow and when it is ready to go out you indolently supply it with the spirit of contraction   mar and so you suppose that your assurance has made an end of this matter   col not till you have given him your hand upon it   mar that then would complete it   col perfectly   mar why then take it heartly  giving her hand to heart hear o soft surprise exstatick joy   mar now i presume you are in high triumph sir  to the col col no sister now you are consistent with that good sense i always thought you mistress of   mar i am afraid mr heartly we are both obliged to him   hear if you think so maria my heart  is under double obligations laid  embracing him col  if it cements our friendship i am overpaid  exeunt act v heartly and maria mar well now heartly you have nothing to do but to look forward and if possible to forget what i have been to you though it is a horrid restraint you lay upon our sex you first make it the business of your lives to blow up our vanity and then preposterously expect we should be prudent and humble that is you invite us to a feast where it is criminal to taste or have an appetite you put a sword into a childs hand and then are angry if it does mischief   hear you give up too much maria i never treated you so what might have been flattery to most women was but honest truth to you   mar why look there now is not that enough to turn any poor woman into a changeling   hear no because it is true charge me with a falsehood and i submit   mar nay then did you not once tell me that all my airs and follies were merely put on in compliance to the world and that good sense was only natural to me that even my affectation i have not forgot your words carried more sincerity than the serious vows of other women   hear by all my happiness i think so still   mar what seriously   hear upon my soul i do   mar lord that is delightful do you really love me then heartly do tell me for now i begin to believe every thing you say to me but dont neither  i am vain still  twas my vanity that made me ask you   hear now i dont take it so   mar there was some in it i am sure though it begins to dwindle i can tell you   hear no matter i love you as you are i would not have you lose your pleasantry maria   mar well do let me be silly sometimes   hear o i can play with you for that matter   mar pshah you will laugh at me   heart not while you are good in essentials   mar indeed i will be very good   hear o fie that will be the way to make me so   mar lord what signifies sense where there is so much pleasure in folly   hear no perfect passion ever was without it the pleasure would subside were we always to be wise in it   mar for my part i think so but will you really stand to the agreement though that i have made with the doctor   hear why not you shall not break your word upon my account though he might be a villain you gave it to   mar well i take it as a compliment not but i have some hopes of getting over it and justly too but dont let me tell you now i love to surprise  though you shall know all if you desire it   hear no maria i dont want the secret i am satisfied in your inclination to trust me   mar well then i will keep the secret only to show you that you upon occasion may trust me with one   hear after that maria it would be wronging you to ask it but pray madam has the doctor yet given you any proof ofhis having declined his interest to your father   mar yes he told me just now he had brought him to pause upon it and does not question in two days to complete it but desires in the mean time you will be ready and punctual with the proemium   hear suppose i should talk with sir john my self it is true he has slighted me of late but however i ought at least to ask his consent though i have but little hopes of it   mar by all means do so  here he comes  this may open another scene of action too that we are preparing for   enter sir john and lady woodvil who walks apart with maria sir john mr heartly i am glad i have met with you here   hear i have endeavored twice to day sir to pay my respects to you   sir john sir i will be plain with you  i went out to avoid you but where the welfare of a child is concerned you must not take it ill if we dont stand upon ceremony  however since i have reason now to be more in temper than perhaps i was at that time i should be glad to talk with you   hear i take it as a favor sir   sir john sir  doctor wolf informs me that he is well assured you were horn the year before the revolution now sir i should be glad to be well satisfied in that points a greater consequence depending on it perhaps than you imagine   hear sir i have been always told that was my age but for your farther satisfaction i appeal to the register   sir john sir i dare believe you and am glad to hear it   hear but pray sir may i beg leave to ask why you are so concerned to know this   sir jo because sir if this be true i am satisfied you may be a regular christian the doubt of which may have perhaps done you some disservice in my private opinion   hear sir if that can reconcile me to it i shall be thankful for the benefit without considering why i that way came to deserve it   sir jo that argument might hold us now too long  but sir  here is the case  your principles and mine have the misfortune to differ yours being as i take it entirely on the revolution side   hear if i am not misinformed sir you your self commanded a regiment in defense of it   sir john i did so and thought it just  twould be fruitless perhaps to offer you the reasons that since have altered my opinion but now sir even supposing that i err in principle you must still allow that conscience is the rule that every honest man ought to walk by   hear it is granted sir   sir john then give me leave to tell you sir that giving you my daughter would be to act against that conscience i pretend to and consequently the same ties oblige me to bestow her where the same principles with mine i think deserve her  now sir consult your own honor and tell me how you can still pursue my daughter without doing violence to mine   hear but sir to shorten this dispute suppose the doctor whom i presume you design her for actually consents to give me up his interest might not that soften your objections to me   sir john but why do you suppose sir he would give up his interest   hear i only judge from what your daughter tells me sir   sir john my daughter   hear i appeal to her   mar and i appeal even to your self sir  has not the doctor just now in the garden spoke in favor of mr heartly to you nay pray sir be plain because more depends on that than you can easily imagine or believe   sir john what senseless insinuation have you got in your head now   mar be so kind sir first to answer me that i may be better able to inform you   sir john well i own he has declined his interest in favor of mr heartly but i must tell you madam he did it in so modest so friendly so goodnatured so conscientious a manner that i now think my self more than ever bound in honor to espouse him   mar but now sir only for arguments sake suppose i could prove that all this seeming virtue was utterly artificial that his regard to mr heartly was neither founded upon modesty friendship goodnature nor conscience or in short that he has basely betrayed and sold the trust you made him like a villain bartered bargained to give me to mr heartly for half the four thousand pound you have valued his consent at i say suppose this were the case where would be his virtue then sir   sir john and i say it is impious to suppose it   hear under favor sir how is it possible your daughter could know the doctor had spoke to you upon this head if he himself had not told her so in consequence of his agreement   sir john sir i dont admit your consequence her knowing it from him is no proof that he might not still resign her from a principle of modesty or good nature   mar then sir from what principle must you suppose that i accuse him   sir john from an obstinate prejudice to all that is good and virtuous   mar that is too hard sir what blot has stained my life that you can think so of me but sir the worst your opinion can provoke me to is to marry mr heartly without either his consent or yours   sr john what do you brave me madam   mar in tears no sir but i scarn a lie and will so far vindicate my integrity as to insist on your believing me if not as a child whom you abandon i have a right to throw my self into other arms for protection   hear o maria how thy spirit charms me  apart to her sir john i am confounded those tears cannot be counterfeit nor can this be true   lady w indeed my dear i fear it is it would be cruel to her concern to think it wholly false can you suppose she would urge so gross an accusation only to expose her self to the justice of your resentment   sir john what are you against him too then he has no friend but me and i cannot at so short a warning give him up to infamy and baseness   lady w good sir be composed and ask your heart one farther question   sir john what would you say to me   lady w in all our mutual course of happiness have i ever yet deceived you with a falsehood   sir john never i grant it nor has my honest heart yet wronged thy goodness with a jealous thought of it   lady w would you then believe me should i accuse him too even of crimes that virtue blushes but no mention   sir john to what extravagance would you drive me   lady w i would before have undeceived you when his late artifice turned the honest duty of your son into his own reproach and ruin but knowing then your temper was inaccessible i durst not offer it but now in better hope of being believed i here avow the truth of all he was accused of then   sir john will you distract me my senses could not be deceived   lady w indeed they were he saw you listening and at the instant turned his impious barefaced leve to me into equivocal intercessions pretending to maria   sir john you starrle me   lady w could you otherwise suppose your son would have brought you to be witness of his own weak malice in accusing him   sir john i am all astonishment   lady w come sir suspend your wonder respite your belief even of this till grosser evidence convinces you suppose i here before your face should let you see his villainy make him repeat his odious love to me at once throw off his mask and show the barefaced traitor   sir jhn is it possible make me but witness of that fact and i shall soon accuse my self and own my folly equal to his baseness but pardon me as i in such a case would not believe even him accusing you so am i bound in equal charity to think you yet may be deceived in what you charge on him   lady w it is just  let it be so  well yet suppose him innocent till you your self pronounce him guilty and since i have staked my faith upon the truth of what i urge it is fit we bring him to immediate trial but then sir i must beg you to descend even to the poorshifts we are reduced to   sir john all to any thing to ease me of my doubts propose them   lady w they that would set toils for beasts of prey must lurk in humble caves to watch their haunts   sir john place me where you please   lady w under this table is your only stand the carpet will conceal you   sir john be it so i will take my post what more   lady w mr heartly shall we beg your leave and you maria take the least suspected way to send the doctor to me immediately   mar i have a thought will do it madam  come sir  exit mar and hear lady w here sir take this cushion you will be easier sir john goes under the table now sir you must consider how desperate a disease i have undertaken to cure therefore you must not winch nor stir too soon at any freedom you observe me take with him be sure lie close and still and when the proof is full appear at your discretion   sir john fear not i will be patient   lady w hush he comes   enter doctor with a book doct your woman told me madam you were here alone and desired to speak with me   lady w i did sir but that we may be sure we are alone pray shut the outward door and see that passage too be clear another surprise might ruin us  is all safe   doct i have taken care madam   lady w i am afraid i interrupt your meditations   doct say rather you improve them you madam were the subject of my solitary thoughts i take in all the little aids i can to guard my frailty and truly i have received great consolation from an unfortunate example here before me   lady w pray of what kind sir   doct i had just dipped into poor eloisas passion for abelard it is indeed a piteous conflict how terrible how penitent a sense she shows of guilty pleasures past and fruitless pains to shut them from her memory   lady w i have read her story sir   doct is it not pitiful   lady w a heart of stone might feel for her   doct o think then what i endure for you such are my pains but such is my sincerity though i fear my being reduced to feign a passion for maria in my late surprise has done dishonor to the vows i then preferred to you   lady w twas on that point i wanted now to talk with you not knowing then how fat you might mistake my silence now had i closed with the colonel in accusing you it would have been plain i was your enemy as had i joined in your defense against him it had been as grossly evident i was his but since i have uses for his friendship and as i saw your credit with sir john needed no support i hope you will think betwixt the two extremes i have acted but a prudent part   doct let me presume to hope then what i did you judge was selfdefence and pure necessity   lady w twas wonderful surprising to perfection the wit of it  but i will not tell you what effect it had upon me   doct why madam let me beseech you   lady w no twas nothing  beside  what need you ask me   doct why do you thus decoy my foolish heart and feed it with such hybla drops of flattery you cannot sure think kindly of me   lady w o well feigned fear you too i sind can flatter in your turn you know how well the subtle force of modesty prevails o men men men   doct twere arrogance to think i have deserved this goodness but treat me as you please i will be at least sincere to you and frankly own i still suspect that all this sosrning favor is but artifice   lady w well well i would have you think so   doct what transport would it give to be assured i wrong you but o i fear this shadow of compliance is only meant to lure me from maria and then as fond ixions were of old to fill my arms with air   lady w methinks this doubt of me seems rather founded on your second thoughts of not resigning her it is she i find is your substantial happiness   doct o that you could but fear i thought so how easy twere to prove my coldness or my love   lady w o sir you have convinced me now of both   doct can all this pretty anger then be real take heed fair creature it flatters more than kindness   lady w i can assure you sir i should have spared you this trouble had i known how deeply you were engaged to her   doct nay then i must believe you but indeed you wrong me to prove my innocence it is not an hour since i pressed sir john to give maria to young heartly   lady w o all artifice you knew that modest resignation would make sir john but warmer in your interest   doct since you will ripe the secret from my heart  know then i actually have sold her like a bawble to her childish lover for two thousand times her value   lady w are you serious   doct as this is true or false may i in you be blessed or miserable   lady w but how can you suppose sir john will ever hear of it   doct alas poor man he knows not his own weakness he is molded into any shape if you but gently stroke his humor i dare depend on his consent  beside i intend to morrow to persuade him it is for the interest of our cause it should be so and then i have him sure   lady w fie how is that possible he cannot be so implicitly credulous you dont take him sure for a roman catholic   doct um  not absolutely  but poor soul he little thinks how near he is one it is true name to him but rome or popery he startles as at a monster but gild its grossest doctrines with the style of english catholic he swallows down the poison like a cordial   lady w nay if he is so far within your power it cannot fail he must consent well sir now i give you leave to guess the reason why i too at our last meeting so warmly pressed you to resign maria   doct is it possible was i then so early your concern   lady w you cannot blame me sure for having there opposed your happiness   doct i dye upon the transport  taking her hand lady w be sure you are secret now your least imprudence makes these like fair favors vanish in a moment   doct how can you form so vain a fear   lady w call it not vain for let our converse end in what it may you still shall find my fame is dear to me as life   doct where can it find so sure a guard the grave austerity of my life will strike suspicion dumb and yours may mock the malice of detraction i am no giddy looselivd courtier whose false profession end only his boast of favors no fair spotless miracle the mystery of love are only fit for hearts recluse and elevate as mine my happiness like yours depending on my secrecy   lady w it is you must answer for this folly   doct i take it whole upon my self the guilt be only mine but be our transports mutual  come lovely creature let us withdraw to privacy where murmuring love shall hush thy fears and lose them in the burning joy   sir john stepng softly behind him seizes him by the throat sir john traitor   doct ah  astonished sir john is this thy sanctity this thy doctrine these thy meditations if stung with my abuses i now should stab thee to the heart what devil durst murmur twere not an act of justice but since thy vile hypocrisy unmasked must make mankind abhor thee be thy own shame thy living with punishment   doct do triumph sir  your artifice has well succeeded  i see your ends you needed not so deep a plot to part with me  trembling sir john suppress thy weak evasions  ungrateful wretch have i for this redeemed thee from the jaws of gaping poverty fed clothed loved preferred thee to my bosom to my family and fortune wife children friends servants all that were not friends to thee accounted as my enemies nay more to crown my faith in thee i have relied on they integrity even for my future happiness and how have thou in one short day requited me taking the advantage of my blinded passion thou have turned the duty of my son to his undoing sordidly have sold the trust i made thee of my daughter attempted like a felonious traitor to seduce my wife and have i fear with poisonous doctrines too ensnared my soul   lady w now heaven be praised his heart seems conscious of his error  aside sir john but why do i reproach thee had i not been the weakest of mankind thou never could have proved so great a villain  whether heaven intends all this to punish or to save me yet i know not my senses staggar at the view and my reflexions lost in wild astonishment  he stands musing doct this snare was worthy of you madam it is you have made this villain of me  apart to lady w lady w you would have made me worse but i have only shown him what you were before   doct i thank you   lady w thank your own ingratitude and wickedness but i must now pursue my victory  exit lady w doct apart no it ends not here he was not brought to listen to this proof alone there is something deeper yet designed against me  i must be speedy  suppose i talk with charles allarm him with our common danger point out his ruin as our only means of safety and like panther in the toil provoked turn short with vengeance on my hunters   sir john what still within my sight of all my follys which is it tells thee that i now shall keep my temper   doct turning boldly to him whom do you menace me sir reflect upon your own condition first and where you are   sir john what would the villain drive at i prithee leave me i cannot look on thee thy overbearing insolence confounds me but since thy wickedness has turned my eyes upon my self and to thy crimes detected i hope to owe my future innocence as the sore wound the viper gives the viper best can cure for that one good may heaven like me forgive thee but seek thy biding in some other place  out of my house this instant hence be gone and see my shameful face no more   doct nay then it is time to be my self and let you know that i am master here turn you out sir this house is mine and now sir at your peril dear to insult me   sir john o heaven it is true thou have disarmed my justice and turned its sword into my own weal bosom  i had forgot my folly it is fit it should be so and heaven is just at once to let me see my crime and punishment  o my poor injured son  whither shall i fly to hide me from the world   enter lady woodvil lady w whither are you going sir   sir john i know not  but here it seems i am a trespasser  the master of this house has warned me hence and since the right is now in him it is just i should resign it   lady w you shall not stir he dares not act with such abandoned

affect me  that i know not if charles betrays me not i think his malice cannot reach me   lady w then sir be easy for he has lost his influence there charles has long since perceived his villainy and grew from thence a secret convert to the cause of truth and loyalty of which he has given such meritorious proof that mr heartly and your son this very day sir have obtained his pardon   sir john you

thou mean explain   mar as i was passing by the hall i heard him earnest in discourse with charles and upon their naming you i stopped a while to listen where i heard the doctor urge to him that you were false at heart that from your late frivolous pretense to break with him he was convinced your malice now would stop at nothing to undo him that charles himself was equally in danger and that to save your own life you certainly designed to sacrifice theirs to the government which there was no possibility of preventing but by their immediate joining in a charge of treason against you   lady w o the villain it is well we are secure in charles   sir john if we are not why be it as it may  i will not stir  i will stand upon my innocence or if that is betrayed will throw me on the mercy of that royal breast whose virtues my credulity has injured   lady w and mar ah  a pistol is heard from within sir john what means that pistol   lady w dont stir i beg you sir   mar what terrors has this

expiate my offense with perjury   doct how sir   charles yes perjury for such it must have been should i have charged as you would have had me this gentleman with treason what facts have i been privy to that reach that name the worst i know of him is that all the factious falsehoods you have raised against the best of princes he blinded with your hypocrisy believed   doctor it is well sir you are protected now   charles this sir in short has been our cause of quarrel the doctor finding i received with coldness his vile designs against your life began to offer menaces on mine if i complied not at which i smiling told him the disappointments of his love had made him desperate this stung him into rage and fastening at my throat he answered villain you will be humbler when you groan in chains for this here indeed all temper left me when disengaging from his hold with one home blow i felled him reeling to the pavement at this grown desp erate he ran with fury to some pistols that hung above the chimney to revenge him i in the instant as he reached one seized upon his wrist and as we grappled sir the pistol firing to the cieling alarmed the family when mr heartly and your servants rusht in to part us   sir john insatiate villain o my shame   doct well sir now you have heard this mighty charge what have you more against me   hear more sir i hope is needless but if sir john is yet unsatisfied    sir john o i have seen too much every new instance of his wickedness but adds afresh to my confusion   lady w now sir is your time  apart hear i go this minute madam  apart doct i value not your whispered menaces for know to your confusion my vengeance is not yet defeated you will find sir that to rebel or to conceal a rebel are in the eye of law both equal acts of treason that fact i am sure is evident against you there there stands in proof the riling traitor you have sheltered this sir your whole family can charge you with and swear it home they shall or load their souls with perjury but then to dash your few remaining days with bitterness of misery remember i sir whom mortally you hate succeed the instant heir to your possessions now farewell and let disgrace and beggary

doct ha then i am betrayed indeed   hear this perth it seems sir has mnagd his correspondence at avignon from whence he came last night express but the government having immediate notice of his arrival he was this morning seized and examined before the council where among other facts he has confessed he knew the doctor actually in arms at the first rebellious rising in northumberland which has been since by other witnesses confirmed   col and sir to convince you that even the doctrine he has broached could never flow from the pure fountain of our established faith here are affidavits in my hand that prove him under his disguise a lurking emissary of rome that he is actually a priest in popish orders and has several times been seen as such to officiate public mass in the church of noster dame at antwerp   mar hear and lady w how   sir john i start with horror even at the danger i am freed from   col and now sir had not your insatiate villanys to this family faced me to this close inquiry into your private life perhaps you might have passed unquestioned among the rout of enemies whom our government despises   doct well sir now then you know your worst of me but know what you call criminal may yet before your triumph is secure not only find its pardon but reward i yet may live sir to retort your insult ot least the days that are allotted me will want for no supports of life while this conveyance calls me master   sir john there there indeed he stings me to the heart for that rash act reproach and endless shame will haunt me   mar no sir  be comforted for even there too his abandoned hope must leave him   sir john why do thou totrure me did i not sign that deed   mar yes sir but in that deed you will find my brother not that traitor is your heir for know the fatal deed which you intended sir to sign is here even yet unsealed and innocent   omnes ha  the doctor hastily openes the deed to examine it and all the company seems surpised sir john what means she   mar i mean sir that this deed by accident falling into this gentlemans hands his generous concern for our family discovered it to me when i reduced to this extremity instantly procured that other to be drawn exactly like it which in your impatience sir to execute passed unsuspected for the original their only difference is that wherever here you read the doctors name there you will find my brothers only throughout and wholly sir in every article investing him in all that right and title which you intended for your mortal enemy   doct distraction outwitted by a brainless girl  throws down the writing in rage all the servants having attended to the discovery break out into huzzahs of joy etc while sir john the col charles and maria severally embrace heartily and lady woodvil silently join in their congratulations  doct i cannot bear their irksome joy  come sir lead me where you please  a dungeon would relieve me now   col secure your prisoner   ser huzzah a traitor a traitor  exit mess soldiers doctor and servants mar now heartly i hope i have made atonement for your jealousy   hear you have banished it for ever this was beyond your self surprising   col sister    mar come no set speeches if i deserve your thanks return them in a friendship here  pointing to charles col the business of my life shall be to merit it   charles and mine to speak my sense of obligations   sir john o my child for this deliverance i only can reward thee here  gives maria to heartly for thee my son whose filial virtues i have injured this honest deed in every article shall be ratified i see your eyes are all upon me expecting from that vile traitors parctices some voluntary instance of my hearts conversion i must be blind indeed were i not now convinced he must in all things have alike deceived me as the dial that misstels one hour of consequence is false through the whole round of day let it suffice i see my errors with a conscious shame but hope when i am justly weighed you will find those errors rose but from a ductile heart not disinclind to truth but fatally misled by false appearances   col whoever knows your private life must think you sir in this sincere   hear and now sir since i am sure it will no more offend you give me leave to observe that of all the arts our enemies make use on to embroil us none seem so audaciously preposterous as their insisting that a nations best security is the word of a prince whose religion indulges him to give it and at the same time obliges him to break it and though perhaps in lesser points our politic disputes will not suddenly be ended methinks there is one principle that all partys might easily come into that no change of government can give us a blessing equal to our liberty   grant us but this and then of course you will own to guard that freedom george must fill the throne finis epilogue spoken by mrs oldfield how wild how frantic is the vain essay that builds on modern politics a play methinks to write at all is bold enough but in a play to stand a faction buff not romes old stage presumed or fames a fibber and moderns to attempt it well said cibber was it not enough the critics might pursue him but must he rouse a party to undo him these blows i told him on his play would fall but he unmoved cried  blood well stand it all when priests turn traitors where is the mighty matter since when has treason been exempt from satyr and should from guilt a factious clamor rise such spite must speak them englands enemies but if old englands friends allow it is right we are sure their power can chase the jacobite and put their malice like their troops to flight as for the critics those he owns may teize him because he never took such pains to please them in time place action rules by which old wits made plays as  dames do puddings by receipts but hopes again even rebels cannot say though vanquished they are insulted in his play nay more  to set their cause in fairest light h has made a man of sense  a jacobite though by our bards good leave to take it right his sense was shown when turned from jacobite thus too the fair that may be wrong inclined he hopes to charless passion will be kind and own at worst on their reflecting pillow the rebel after all is a pretty fellow but why you will say was i made heartlys wife consider fair ones heartly saved his life so that you see the boy hant quite miscarried beside  are all those dears so happy you have married how often in that state has love seen elves so crammed with comsort they could han themselves the worst you can against his satyr plead is that my lord of thetfords hanged indeed if that seems hard why grant him your reprive and by an act of grace let this nonjuror live
