reflections critical and satirical upon a late rhapsody called an essay upon criticism  by mr dennis  me remorsurum petis melius non tangere clamo horace london printed for bernard lintott at the cross keys between the two templegates in fleetstreet price   d  the preface it is now almost seven years since i happened to say one morning to a certain person distinguished by merit and quality that wherever the italian opera had come it had driven out poetry from that nation and not only poetry but the very taste of poetry and of all the politer arts and that if the same protection and encouragement were continued to the opera by which it was then supported the same calamity would befall great britain which had happened to the neighboring nations as it is hard to find a man more quick or more penetrating than the person to whom i spoke this he immediately entered into that sentiment and soon after withdrew that encouragement which he had given to the italians all that i foretold and more than all has happened for such things such monstrous things have been lately writ and such monstrous judgments passed that what has been formerly said has been sufficiently confirmed that it is impossible an author can be so very foolish but he will find more stupid admirers  a most notorious instance of this depravity of genius and taste is the essay upon which the following reflections are writ and the approbation which it has met with i will not deny but that there are two or three passages in it with which i am not displeased but what are two or three passages as to the whole  fit chaerilus ille quem bis terque bonum cum risu miror the approving two or three passages amongst a multitude of bad ones is by no means advantageous to an author that little that is good in him does but set off its contrary and make it appear more extravagant the thoughts expressions and numbers of this essay are for the most part but very indifferent and indifferent and execrable in poetry are all one but what is worse than all the rest we find throughout the whole a deplorable want of that very quality which ought principally to appear in it which is judgment and i have no notion that where there is so great a want of judgment there can be any genius  however i had not published the following letter but had suffered his readers to have buggd themselves in the approbation of a pamphlet so very undeserving if i had not found things in it that have provoked my scorn though not my indignation for i not only found my self attacked without any manner of provocation on my side and attacked in my person instead of my writings by one who is wholly a stranger to me and at a time when all the world knew that i was persecuted by fortune i not only saw that this was attempted in a clandestine manner with the utmost falsehood and calumny but found that all this was done by a little affected hypocrite who had nothing in his mouth at the same time but truth candor friendship good nature humanity and magnanimity  it is for this reason that i have published the following letter in which if i have not treated the author of the essay with my usual candor he may thank himself and this goodnaturd town for having observed with no little astonishment that persons have been censured for ill nature who have attempted to display the errors of authors undeservedly successful though they have done this with all imaginable candor and with the best and noblest designs which are the doing justice the discovery of truth and the improvement of arts while writers of lampoons and infamous libels whose anonymous authors have lain lurking in the dark sometimes in clubs and sometimes solitary like so many common rogues and footpads to ruin the fortunes and murder the reputations of others have been caressed and buggd by their thoughtless applauders and treated as if they had been the most virtuous and the best natured men in the world having observed all this with no little astonishment i at last found out the reason of it which is because the attempts of libellers and lampooners hurt only those whom they attack and delight the rest of the readers whereas they who expose by a just criticism the absurdities of foolish fortunate authors attack all those who commend and admire those authors and disturb perhaps by opening their eyes no fewer than a thousand fops in the good opinion which they have conceived of themselves it is for this reason that i have endeavored to comply with this wise and good natured general disposition of minds and to make amends for the ill nature of my criticism by the allurements of my satyr  lately published by mr dennis the grounds of criticism in poetry contained in some new discoveries never made before requisite for the writing and judging of poems surely being a preliminary to a larger work entitled a criticism upon our most celebrated english poets which will be published in small volumes  an essay upon public spirit being a satyr in prose upon the manners and luxury of the times the chief source of our present parties and divisions price   d  both printed for bernard lintott  to mr  at sunninghill berks sir i here send you my answer to the two questions which i lately received from you which are whether the essay upon criticism which i lately sent you is like to take in town and who is the author of that anonymous rhapsody  in answer to the first question my opinion is that it will take very well for the same thing is true of great bodies of men which has been observed of particular persons and that is that when genius thinks fit to depart from among them good taste never cares to be very long after it when the italian opera drove poetry from out this island criticism thought it a very great impertinence for her to stay long behind besides that the elegant translations of the italian operas which mr tonson has published by the most eminent hands have prepared people to like any thing that is of an equal merit with those translations and with tom sternholds version  for the second quaere mr is of opinion that this essay was writ by some experienced judicious person who knows what quantity of base alloy is at this juncture requisite to debase the coin of parnassus and reduce it to the current standard but i am inclined to believe that it was writ by some young or some raw author for the following reasons  first he discovers in every page a sufficiency that is far beyond his little ability and has rashly undertaken a task which is infinitely above his force a task that is only fit for the author with the just encomium of whose essay my lord roscommon begins his own  happy that author whose correct essay repairs so well our old horatian way there is nothing more wrong more low or more incorrect than this rhapsody upon criticism the author all along taxes others with faults of which he is more guilty himself he tells us in the very two first lines that  it is hard to say if greater want of skill appear in writing or in judging ill now whereas others have been at some pains and thought to show each of these wants of skill separately and distinctly his comprehensive soul has most ingeniously contrived to show them both in a supreme degree together  secondly while this little author struts and affects the dictatorian air he plainly shows that at the same time he is under the rod and that while he pretends to give laws to others he is himself a pedantick slave to authority and opinion of which i shall give some instances  in the beginning of his essay he lays down this maxim  let such teach others who themselves excel and censure others who have written well where he would insinuate that they alone are fit to be critics who have shown themselves great poets and he brings in pliny to confirm by his authority the truth of a precept which is denied by matter of fact and by the experience of above two thousand years  de pictore sculptore fictore nisi artifex judicare non potest it has been observed by writers of politics that they who have succeeded best in these kind of writings have never been either governors of provinces or ministers of state as plato and aristotle in greece machiavel in italy and in this island harrington i will not say that this may be applied to critics there are and have been very good ones who have been great poets as horace in italy boileau in france and in great britain my lord roscommon and a living noble author nay i am fully convinced that there never was an admirable poet but he was a great critic for what can be more absurd than to imagine that any man can excel in any art or business or profession who does not understand that profession art or business now he who understands the art of poetry is a critic in poetry but this is undeniable at the same time that there have been critics who have been approved of by all the world who never meddled with poetry was aristotle himself the very father of critics a poet why yes it is pretended that there is a fragment of an ode which was writ by him remaining in athenaeus but is that sufficient to denominate him a poet did he ever write either tragedy or epick poem and yet how freely did he censure both tragic and epick poets dionysius halicarnassaeus and dionysius longinus among the greeks and quintilian among the romans were free censurers yet no poets and so are bossu and dacier at present among the french and what is still more remarkable is that this young author forgets himself to that degree as to commend longinus and quintilian for accomplished critics contrary to his own precept  another instance which i shall give of his being a slave to authority and opinion is the servile deference which he pays to the ancients  p    still green with bays each ancient altar stands above the reach of sacrilegious hands secure from flames from envys fiercer rage destructive war and all devouring age see from each clime the learned their incense bring hear in all tongues triumphant poeans ring in praise so just let every voice be joined and fill the general chorus of mankind which is just the opposite extravagance and extreme to that of monsieur perrault  for the frenchman with an insolent stupidity contemned and blasphemed even those heros of antiquity whose writings are admirable and divine this essayer deifies authors whose writings are but tolerable and indifferent boileau as a reasonable man took the path that lay in the middle of the two extremes as we shall see by what follows  for what remains says he i would not have any one think that in this number of ancient writers approved of by all ages it is my intention to comprehend some authors who indeed are ancient but who have only acquired a moderate esteem as lycophron nonnus silius italicus and the author of the tragedies which are attributed to seneca to whom in my mind we may not only boldly compare but justly prefer several of the modern writers i only admit into that exalted rank that small number of admirable writers whose name alone is their panegyric as homer plato cicero virgil etc and i do not regulate the esteem which i have for them by that length of time which their works have lasted but by the number of years which they have been admired of which it is convenient to advertise a great many people who otherwise perhaps might indiscreetly believe what monsieur perrault has a mind to insinuate that we commend the ancients for no other reason but because they are ancients and blame the moderns for no other reason but because they are moderns which is utterly false since there are several among the ancients whom we do not admire and several among the moderns whom all the world extols the antiquity of a writer is no certain proof of his merit but the ancient and constant admiration which all the world has had for his writings is a certain and infallible proof that we ought to admire them boileau reflect the  th on longinus thus has boileau determined this matter like a dextrous distinguisher and a most rightful judge if i may be allowed to speak my sentiments after so great a master i must freely declare my opinion that of all the poets among the graecians i only admire homer sophocles pindar and euripides though i am very much pleased with some of the rest and of all the poets among the romans i admire only virgil and horace and some parts of lucretius though i am very much pleased with catullus tibullus terence and others for as for lycophron nonnus apollonius rhodius valerius flaccus silius italicus statius i prefer the paradise lost of milton before them all together nay i will go yet farther and declare that though i must freely own that virgil has infinitely the advantage of milton in the wonderful contrivance of his poem in the harmony of his versification and in the constant tenor of his majesty and his elevation yet that milton in some particular parts of his poem has the advantage of virgil and of mankind and though i can by no means believe shakespeare to be of equal merit with sophocles or euripides for which i shall give my reasons in another place yet this i can say for the honor of my countryman and of great britain that there are several single scenes in shakespeare which i prefer to all the tragedies put together of which seneca is accounted the author  i shall give one more instance by which it will appear that while this youngster is pretending to give laws he behaves himself like one who is still in awe of the rod that he admires the ancients because his master tells him that they must be admired and that if the ancients were his contemporaries and produced the same writings now which they did formerly he would use them with the same insolence with which he treats his contemporaries in the  th page of this essay he gives a verbose and indigested encomium of the first grecian critics but forgets and contradicts himself before he comes to the bottom of that very page for says he  the generous critic fanned the poets fire and taught the world with reason to admire then criticism the muses handmaid proud to dress her charms and make her more beloved but following wits from that intention strayed who could not win the mistress wooed the maid set up themselves and drove a separate trade never was any thing more obscure and confused than the foregoing rhimes but if there is any meaning in them it must be that which follows  at first poets and critics were all one and these poets made use of their criticism only to make their poetry more charming and more accomplished but the wits who immediately followed after them deviated from the design of their predecessors and not being able to attain to poetry took up a resolution to drive a separate trade and to set up only for critics if this is not his meaning i should be glad to hear in prose and in plain english what his meaning is for rhyme has been always a wicked abettor and concealer of nonsense but if this is his meaning then i desire to make these two remarks first that the ancientest critics among the graecians were not poets as we observed before and secondly that if aristotle and dionysius halicarnassaeus and others were now alive and their excellent criticisms were now first to appear it would be objected to those great men in order to disqualify them for critics that they were no versifyers and it is plain from the  d page that another objection would be made to them for when he comes there to speak of the moderns he tells us  some dryly plain without inventions aid write dull receipts how poems may be made now it being evident that the criticisms of aristotle and of dionysius halicarnassaeus are writ with a great deal of simplicity it is manifest that if those two critics had writ but yesterday they would be accused to day of being drily plain and of writing dull receipts  but a third infallible mark of a young author is that he has done in this essay what schoolboys do by their exercises he has borrowed both from living and dead and particularly from the authors of the two famous essays upon poetry and translated verse but so borrowed that he seems to have the very reverse of midass noble faculty for as the coursest and the dullest metals were upon the touch of that lydian monarch immediately changed into fine gold so the finest gold upon this authors handling it in a moment loses both its luster and its weight and is immediately turned to lead  a fourth thing that shows him a young man is the not knowing his own mind and his frequent contradictions of himself his title seems to promise an essay upon criticism in general which afterward dwindles to an essay upon criticism in poetry and after all he is all along giving rules such as they are for writing rather than judging in the beginning of the  th page the rules are nothing but nature  these rules of old discovered not devised are nature still but nature methodizd but no sooner is he come to the  0th page but the rules and nature are two different things  when first great maro in his boundless mind a work toutlast immortal rome designed perhaps he seemed above the criticks law and but from natures fountains scorned to draw but in the last line of this very paragraph they are the same things again  learn hence for ancient rules and just esteem to copy nature is to copy them but to this he will answer that he is guilty of no contradiction that he is only showing that virgil was guilty of error and ignorance who first absurdly began to write his aeneis and afterward sat down to learn the rules of writing which when he began to write that poem he took to be things distinct from nature but that after he had wrote part of it he fell to the reading of homer and that undeceived him that while he is talking of virgils error and ignorance he is making a parade of his own incomparable wisdom and knowledge and not contradicting himself but virgil or rather making him appear inconsistent with and contradicting himself for that though virgil took the rules and nature to be distinct from each other for his own part he is wiser and knows better things now is not this a very modest and a very judicious gentleman  a fifth sign of his being a young author is his being almost perpetually in the wrong and here in relation to the foregoing passage i might desire to ask him one or two civil questions first who acquainted him with that noble particularity of virgils life that he designed to write his aeneis without art had he it from ancient or modern authors or does he owe it to a noble effort of his own sagacious soul if virgil had so little knowledge of the rules of his own art and so very little true judgment within him as to be capable of such an extravagance an extravagance which says this essayer nothing but the reading of homer was able to correct how comes he so far to have surpassed his master in the admirable contrivance of his poem but secondly what does he mean by maros designing a work to outlast immortal rome does he pretend to put that figure called a bull upon virgil or would he ambitiously have it pass for his own it is no wonder that one who is capable of imputing so great an extravagance to virgil should be capable of writing himself without any manner of meaning  whenever we find a simile the first line of it is like a warningpiece to give us notice that something extraordinary false or foolish is to follow we have one in the  th page where the former and the latter part have not the least relation and bear not the least proportion to one another  as on the land while here the ocean gains in other parts it leaves wide sandy plains thus in the soul while memory prevails the solid power of understanding fails where beams of warm imagination play the memorys soft figures melt away here the soul in the third verse is made to answer to land in the first and memory to ocean which in the fourth verse is changed for understanding though in this simile the author shows neither memory nor understanding for there are as many absurdities in it as there are lines at this rate a man may make a thousand similes in an hour any thing may become like to any thing jungentur jam gryphes equis but what a thoughtless creature is this essayer to deny in these very rhimes by which he pretends to show both poetry and criticism the coexistence of those qualities without which it is impossible to be both poet and critic besides how wrong is this and how many persons have i known who have had all these qualities at the same time in a very great degree what follows is more wrong and more absurd  one science only will one genius fit so vast is art so narrow human wit is not this a rare pretender to poetry and criticism who talks at this rate when all the world knows that it is impossible for a man with only one science to be either poet or critic which is so much the more unlucky because the very fathers of poetry and criticism homer and aristotle whom he mentions so often in this essay are believed to have had all the sciences it is now between two and three thousand years since aristotle wrote his morals his politics his rhetoric and his poetic and three of these are the very best in their kinds to this very day and have infinitely the advantage of all those several thousand treatises that have been writ since what follows is still more false and more abominable  not only bounded to peculiar arts but even in those confined to single parts what a wretched narrow soul has this essayer and what a thoughtless one  when homer whom he mentions so often in this essay had as admirable a talent for pleasantry as he had a genius equal to the most exalted poetry to come to the romans horace is famous both for elevation and pleasantry virgil succeeded in his bucolicks and georgicks as well as he did in his aeneis to descend to the moderns shakespeare had a very good genius for tragedy and a very good talent for comedy and since him otway had likewise a talent for both  but in the next page there is likewise a simile and therefore we may be sure as we observed above that most of that page is one continued absurdity p    first follow nature and your judgment frame by her just standard which is still the same unerring nature still divinely bright one clear unchanged and universal light life force and beauty next to all impart at once the source and end and test of art now here would i fain ask one or two questions is he giving rules here for judging or for writing and is he prescribing those rules to the knowing or the ignorant if he says to the knowing what is it that he tells them here that they must judge according to nature or write according to nature now does he tell them any thing in this that they did not know before well but he says he is laying down these rules for the ignorant why then i humbly conceive that he ought to have told them what he means by nature and what it is to write or to judge according to nature for by expressing himself at the rate that he does he neither says any thing to the learned which they did not know before nor any thing to the ignorant which they can possibly understand horace proceeded in a very different method from this when he was to acquaint the pisos what was the principal source of good writing he not only told them that it was moral philosophy  scribendi recte sapere est and principium and fons but pointed to the very books where they might find that moral philosophy  rem tibi socraticae poterant ostendere chartae so that in one we have a clear and perspicuous precept and in the other an obscure and unintelligible jargon but let us go on  that art is best which most resembles her which still presides yet never does appear that is as much as to say artis est celare artem the common subject that pedants give their boys to make themes and declamations upon is not this a noble discovery well but now for the simile  in some fair body thus the sprightly soul with spirit feeds with vigor fills the whole each motion guides and every nerve sustains it self unseen hut in the effects remains this youngster has not memory enough to know what he said six lines before  thus in a soul where memory never prevails the solid power of understanding fails in the fifth line of this page it was nature that  life force and beauty must to all impart and here in the  0th we are told that it is art that  with spirit feeds with vigor fills the whole but how absurdly is art compared to the soul to which only genius can be justly compared according to the observation in the essay upon poetry but let us go on and we shall find that as all that went before this simile is unintelligible so all is mighty absurd that follows it  there are whom heaven has blessed with store of wit yet want as much again to manage it by the way what rare numbers are here would not one swear that this youngster had espoused some antiquated muse who had sued out a divorce upon the account of impotence from some superannuated sinner and who having been poxd by her former spouse has got the gout in her decrepit age which makes her hobble so damnably  why this is more dismal than the italian opera both that and the essay are but sounds but that is harmony and this is discord  but now my dear friend if i had young mr bays here i would desire that i might ask him one question and he not be angry and that is what he means by  there are whom heaven has blessed with store of wit yet want as much again to manage it but let us go on and see if it is possible to find it out without him  for wit and judgment ever are at strife though meant each others are like man and wife that is as much as to say there are people who have tha which they call wit without one dram of judgment  not this another wonderful discovery but i fancy tha mr bays has the misfortune to be wrong in the first vers of the foresaid couplet  for wit and judgment ever are at strife what a devil mr bays they cannot be at strife sure after they are parted after wit has made an elopement  has been barbarously forsaken by judgment or turned to separate maintenance much less can they be at strife when they never came together which is the case in the essay but now we talk of man and wife let us consider the yoke fellow to the former rhyme  though meant each others and like man and wife now cannot i for my soul conceive the reciprocal aid that there is between wit and judgment for though i can easily conceive how judgment may keep wit in her senses yet cannot i possibly understand how wit can control or redress or be a help to judgment  if mr bays in that couplet  there are whom heaven has blessed with store of wit yet want as much again to manage it intended to say that people have sometimes store of false wit without judgment to manage it he intended nothing but what all the world knew before but if he meant to fay this of true wit nothing can be more mistaken for i cannot conceive how any one can have store of wit without judgment i believe that father bouheurs has given a tolerable description of wit in his treatise upon that subject cest un solid qxi brille it is a shining solid like a diamond which the more solid it is is always the more glittering and derives its height of luster from its perfect solidity now how any thing in the works of the mind can be solid without judgment i leave mr bays to consider  but let us pass to the   th page at the bottom of which we shall find another simile and consequently another absurdity  poets like painters thus unskilled to trace the naked nature and the living grace with gold and jewels cover every part and hide with ornament their want of art which in prose and plain english runs thus  poets like painters not having the skill to draw nature without art hide their want of art with a superabundance of art in the  0th page we have another simile and consequently another absurdity  but true expression like the unchanging sun clears and improves whatever it shines upon which is borrowed from the essay on poetry  true wit is everlasting like the sun but awkardly borrowed and utterly spoiled in the removal for what can expression be properly said to shine upon true wit or genius for that the noble author means as is plain from several parts of his poem shines through and discovers it self by the expression but expression at the very best can but shine with a borrowed light like the moon and the rest of the planets whereas genius shines and flames with its own celestial fire  his instructions his assertions his commendations his censures his advice wherever they are his own are either false or trivial or both such is that in the beginning of the twelfth page  and though the ancients thus their rules invade as kings dispense with laws themselves have made moderns beware thus is this essayer for a double dispensing power in kings and ancient authors and is for making the moderns doubly slaves slaves in their actions and slaves in their writings but as we boldly deny that kings have either power to make laws or to dispense with them after they are made so those laws of writing were neither made by the ancients nor can those ancients dispense with them as they are the laws of nature and not of men as he has himself hinted in the beginning of the  th page  those rules of old discovered not devised are nature still but nature methodizd they are eternal and irrevocable and never to be dispensed with but by nature that made them and the only rule for that dispensation is this that a less law may be violated to avoid the infringing of a greater and it is equally the duty both of ancients and moderns to break through a less important rule when without that infringement a greater must be violated or the great end of all the rules neglected the great end of all the rules is to instruct and the subordinate end is to please by moving of passion and particularly that kind of passion which ought chiefly to reign in that sort of poetry in which the poet writes now it is a rule in poetry that the notorious events of history are not to be falsified nor the periods of time transposed or confounded and yet virgil in the fourth of his aeneis broke through this rule at once by a bold and a judicious anachronism in order to make his poem more admirable and the more to exalt the glory of the roman name whatever the ancients justly did the moderns may justly do it is ridiculous and pedantick to imagine that the natural powers of the soul were stronger or more excellent in the ancients than they are in the moderns and as to experience we have vastly the advantage of them when we consider experience as my lord bacon observes we are properly the ancients who live in the elder ages of the world and have the advantage of the knowledge of three thousand years over the first writers not but that at the same time that i assert the equality of faculties in the moderns and the advantage of their experience i freely acknowledge the actual preeminence that several of the ancients have over the moderns but i have sufficiently shown in the advancement of modern poetry that that actual preeminence proceeded from accidental causes and not from any superiority of faculties in those ancient authors  at the bottom of the same page    there is something asserted that is both false and impudent where speaking of the ancients he tells us  those are but stratagems which errors seem nor is it homer nods but we that dream which is a presumptuous contradiction of horace  aliquando bonus dormitat homerus and of my lord roscommon  his reeling heros and his wounded gods make some suspect he snores as well as nods and is in effect to declare that horace was a dreamer and my lord roscommon a dotard and i my masters only i am alerte and eueille only i am the man of importance  in the beginning of the   st page there is something too very wrong  in words as fashions the same rule will bold alike fantastic if too new or old be not the first by whom the new are tried nor yet the last to lay the old aside this being directed to all without exception and delivered without limitation or restriction is another flat contradiction of horace  si forte necesse est indiciis monstr are recentibus abdita rerum fingere cinctutis non exaudita cethegis continget dabiturque licentia sumpta pudenter et nova fictaque nuper habebunt verba fidem si graeco font cadant parce detorta this is likewise a libel upon the memory of mr dryden whom he pretends to admire for never any one was a greater coiner than he and it is directly contrary to the improvement of languages for it chaucer and succeeding authors had had this advice given them and had been weak enough to take it how could our language ever have improved in purity in force in grace or in harmony but if it was allowed to chaucer and those who immediately followed him why must it be denied to those who have lived since  quid autem caecilio plautoque dabit romanus ademptum virgilio varroque ego cur acquirre pauca si possim invideor quum lingua catonis and enni sermonem patrium ditaverit and nova rerum nomina protulerit licuit semperque licebit signatum praesente nota procudere nomen i must confess if we speak with relation to the constant and general practice of a writer he ought to take what the french call the best use for the mistress of the language in which he writes but a great poet if he writes in the language which he was born to speak may be allowed the privilege sometimes to coin new words and sometimes to revive the old which last succeeded so well to milton  about the middle of the   d page he gives advice which shows him very inconsistent with himself  and praise the easy vigor of a line where denhams strength and wallers sweetness join how vastly different is this from what he pretends to advise at the bottom of the  th page  be homers works your study day and night read them by day and meditate by night thence form your judgment thence your notions bring and trace the muses upward to their spring still with it self compared his text peruse and let your comment be the mantuan muse now he who is familiar with homer and intimate with virgil will not be extremely affected either with the sweetness of waller or the force of denham he requires something that is far above the level of modern authors something that is great and wonderful if i were to recommend a british poet to one who has been habituated to homer and virgil i would for the honor of my country and of my own judgment advise him to read milton who very often equals both the grecian and the roman in their extraordinary qualities and sometimes surpasses them is more lofty more terrible more vehement more astonishing and has more impetuous and more divine raptures i will not deny but that waller has sweetness and denham force but their good and their shining qualities are so sophisticated and debauched with these modern vices of conceit and point and turn and epigram that it is impossible they can affect in an extraordinary manner those who have been long acquainted with the ancients  there is in the   th and the   th pages another inconsistency which i desire to lay before the reader in the   th page he speaks of horace thus  he who supreme in judgment as in wit might boldly censure as he boldly writ yet judged with coolness though he sung with fire his precepts teach but what his works inspire our critics take a contrary extreme they judge with fury but they write with phlegm before he goes ten lines farther he forgets himself and commends longinus for the very contrary quality for which he commended horace and for the very same thing for which he condemns his contemporaries  the muses sure longinus did inspire and blessed their critic with a poets fire an ardent judge that zealous in his trust with warmth gives judgment yet is always just whose own example strengthens all his laws and is himself that great sublime he draws he commends horace for judging cooly in verse and extols longinus for criticizing with fire in prose what a miserable slave is this author to opinion can any thing be more plain than that he condemns his contemporaries for no other reason but because they are his contemporaries and commends longinus for no other reason but because he has been approved of by others for why should not a modern critic imitate the great qualities of longinus and when he treats of a subject which is sublime treat of it sublimely now he who writes any thing with sublimity let it be prose or verse let it be criticism or poetry writes sometimes with fury as longinus has shown both by his doctrine and his example in the first chapter of his treatise  but pray who are these moderns that judge with fury and write with phlegm who are they that have writ both criticism and poetry who have not in their poetry shown a thousand times this essayers fire who is there among them that is not above borrowing so openly and so awkwardly from the most known authors for what reader is so unacquainted with our english poetry as not to know that he has taken this last couplet with a very little variation from the essay on translated verse  thus make the proper use of each extreme and write with fury but correct with phlegm but what is a perspicuous sensible precept in my lord roscommon as soon as this essayer handles it becomes a gros absurdity and a palpable contradiction  in the   th page there are no less than two or three absurdities in the compass of four lines  now length of fame our second life is lost and bare threescore is all even that can boast our sons their fathers failing language see and such as chaucer is shall dryden be now what does young mr bays mean by our second life and by bare threescore if he speaks of himself and means threescore days he means too much in reason but if he speaks of chaucer spencer and shakespeare and means threescore years he means too little in conscience it is now a hundred years since shakespeare began to write more since spencer flourished and above  00 years since chaucer died and yet the fame of none of these is extinguished the reason that he gives for this is false too  our sons their fathers failing language see mr waller may suffice to show the falsity of this it is above threescore years since that gentleman began to write and yet his language is still good and new thus we find that the assertion is false here the reason of it false and we shall find anon that the inference is false too  and such as chaucer is shall dryden be that is shall grow obsolete and neglected and be either forgot or be read but by a few  whether the language of mr dryden will ever be as obsolete as is at present that of chaucer is what neither this author nor any one else can tell for every language has its particular period of time to bring it to perfection i mean to all the perfection of which that language is capable and they who are alive cannot possibly tell whether that period has happened or not if that period has not yet happened yet it is not the obsoleteness of language which makes a poet fall from the reputation which he once enjoyed provided the language in which that poet wrote was at the time of his writing come to be capable of harmony for spencer is obsolete yet is still renowned that which makes an author fall from his former reputation is says boileau in his seventh reflection upon longinus his not having attained to that point of solidity and perfection which are necessary to give a never dying esteem to his works for example says he the latin tongue in which cicero and virgil wrote was already very much altered in the time of quintilian and of aulus gellius and yet cicero and virgil were more esteemed when those critics wrote than they were in their own age because they had as it were by their writings fixed the roman language having attained to that point of solidity and perfection which i have mentioned above  if we reflect upon that miserable taste which reigns now among our readers and that want of genius which is so deplorable in our present writers and that taste and genius daily more and more decline we may without being prophets foretell according to the forementioned observation of the solidity and perfection of poems that the language is not like to alter to the disadvantage of those poets whose works are the only remains of them here below but be that as it will yet this is certain that mr dryden had one quality in his language which chaucer had not and which must always remain for having acquired some justness of numbers and some truth of harmony and of versification to which chaucer through the rudeness of the language or want of ear or want of experience or rather perhaps a mixture of all could not possibly attain that justness of numbers and truth of harmony and of versification can never be destroyed by any alteration of language and therefore mr dryden whatever alteration happens to the language can never be like to chaucer  wherever this gentleman talks of wit he is sure to say something that is very foolish as page     what is this wit that does our cares employ the owners wife that other men enjoy the more his trouble as the more admired where wanted scorned and envied where acquired here again i desire leave to ask two or three questions first how can wit be scorned where it is not is not this a figure frequently employed in hibernian land the person who wants this wit may indeed be scorned but such a contempt declares the honor that the contemner has for wit but secondly what does he mean by acquired wit does he mean genius by the word wit or conceit and point if he means genius that is certainly never to be acquired and the person who should pretend to acquire it would be always secure from envy but if by wit he means conceit and point those are things that ought never to be in poetry unless by chance sometimes in the epigram or in comedy where it is proper to the character and the occasion and even in comedy it ought always to give place to humor and even to be lost and absorpd in that according to the precept of the noble author of the essay on poetry  that silly thing men call sheer wit avoid with which our age so nauseously is cloyed humor is all wit should be only brought to turn agreeably some proper thought in the beginning of the   d page there is a couplet of advice the first line of which is very impertinent and the second very wrong  be silent always when you doubt your sense now who are the persons to whom he is giving advice here why to poets or critics or both but the persons to whom he ought to be speaking are critics that is people who pretend to instruct others but can any man of common sense want to be told that he ought not to pretend to instruct others as long as he doubts of the truth of his own precepts  but what can be more wrong or more absurd than the latter verse of the couplet  speak when youre sure yet speak with diffidence now i should think that when a man is sure it is his duty to speak with a modest assurance since in doing otherwise he betrays the truth especially when he speaks to those who are guided more by imagination than they are by judgment which is the case of three parts of the world and three parts of the other part  he is so great a lover of falsehood that whenever he has a mind to calumniate his contemporaries he upbraids them with some defect which is just contrary to some good quality for which all their friends and their acquaintance commend them as for example if a man is remarkable for the extraordinary deference which he pays to the opinions and the remonstrances of his friends him he libels for his impatience under reproof on the contrary if he has a mind to extol the ancients he passes by either through envy or ignorance all the great qualities which they have and extols them for some peculiar one the very want of which is known to all the world to be their infirmity and their defect thus in the   th page he takes occasion to commend aristotle for what he wrote in physics a great deal of which is so justly censured and condemned even by the same learned and judicious men who allow his aethicks his politics his rhetoric and his poetic to be worthy of the greatest philosopher and here as the commendation which he gives him is false the manner of giving it is still more false for says he  not only nature did his laws obey but fancys boundless empire owned his sway the expression in the first verse is not only absurd but blasphemous the laws of nature are unalterable and indispensable but by god himself and the greatest excellence to which the wisest philosopher can attain is not to control but to obey nature  in the libel upon king charles the second he has not only endeavored to brand the memory of that prince for something which is utterly false but for something which if it had been true had been an excellence in that prince for wits says he in that monarchs reign had pensions when all the world knows that it was one of the faults of that reign that none of the politer arts were then encouraged for of this we may be sure that whenever we have a prince and ministers who truly understand either their own interest or that of the public arts and learning will be then encouraged i mean not speciously and pretendedly but really and sincerely  the king of france pretended to encourage arts by allowing pensions to some few professors of them whereas at the same time he was and is doing a thing which has a natural tendency to the driving them out of europe for by kindling and prosecuting an unjust war through so many different nations he has gone a very great way toward the barbarizing the christian world and the arts would have been at a much greater height than they are now without any manner of encouragement from him if they had been suffered to have enjoyed the quiet of an universal peace in the same manner some persons of quality in great britain have been kind to some particular professors of poetry but at the very same time by not only introducing the italian opera among us but by continuing constant encouragers of it to this very day they are doing a thing which will drive the very art it self out of the kingdom as it has been already driven out of every other nation and are depriving their favorite authors of more than ever they yet bestowed upon them any great minister would now have a glorious opportunity of being a true encourager of poetry and every other generous art by representing effectually to her majesty the mischief that the italians do both to her subjects and to the arts and so driving those melodious balladsingers out of the nation  but to return to the reign of king charles the second from which i may seem to have in some measure digressd there was then indeed a favorable regard shown to wit but no real encouragement butler was starved at the same time that the king had his book in his pocket another great wit lay seven years in prison for an inconsiderable debt and otway dared not to show his head for fear of the same fate these are some of the glories of that reign according to this author for if it be a vice in a prince to encourage an art it is a virtue to neglect it what a wretched creature is this pretender to criticism and poetry to keep such a pother about an art the encouragement of which he imputes as infamy to king charles the second  well but he tells us that not only  the wits had pensions but young lords had wit here in the compass of one poor line are two devilish bobs for the court but it is no easy matter to tell which way the latter squinting reflection looks for if he pretends to reflect upon that prince for receiving persons of quality who had wit into his court can any thing be more impertinent than twice in one line to libel a monarch for being favorable to that very thing which he takes so much pains in this very book to recommend to the world if he means that the young lords of the court who pretended to wit had it not can any thing be more arrogant than to fly in the face of all mankind and to contradict almost the only thing in which all sorts of people agree even in this divided age britons and foreigners protestants and papists whigs and tories churchmen and dissenters and to pretend to reflect upon persons whose very names are their panegyricks the young lords who had wit in the court of king charles the second are these the young former duke of buckingham the young earl of mulgrave now duke of buckingham the young lord buckhurst afterward earl of dorset and middlesex and the young marquess of halifax the young earl of rochester the young lord vaughan now lord carbury and several others if the looking favorably upon young persons of quality who had wit may be imputed as scandal to the court of king charles the second that court was certainly the most scandalous one in europe but if he says on the other side that it is dishonorable to a prince to be mistaken in this point and to look with a favorable eye on pretenders instead of real masters to that all the world with one accord wlll answer that never prince had a clearer reputation in this point  thus are his assertions and his precepts frequently false or trivial or both his thoughts very often crude and abortive his expressions absurd his numbers often harsh and unmusical without cadence and without variety his rhimes trivial and common he dictates perpetually and pretends to give law without any thing of the simplicity or majesty of a legislator and pronounces sentence without any thing of the plainness or clearness or gravity of a judge instead of simplicity we have little conceit and epigram and affectation instead of majesty we have something that is very mean and instead of gravity we have something that is very boyish and instead of perspicuity and lucid order we have but too often obscurity and confusion  but what most shows him a very young author is that with all these faults and this weakness he has the insolence of a hero and is a downright bully of parnassus who is every moment thundring out fool sot fop coxcomb blockhead and thinks to hide his want of sense by his pretended contempt of others as a hector does his want of courage by his perpetual blustering and roaring and is sagaciously of opinion that he arrogates so much sense to himself as he imputes folly to other people  thus a wild tartar when he spies a man that is handsome valiant wise thinks if he kills him to inherit his wit his beauty and his spirit as if just so much he enjoyed as in another he destroyed by what he says page the   th and his returning to the charge page    his particular pique seems to be at people of quality for whom he appears to have a very great contempt i mean for the authors of that rank as if a man were to assert his title to parnassus by proving himself a plebeian in great britain or as if an english sovereign by making a man honorable made him dull good gods how absolute would our princes be at that rate when they would have the very understandings of their subjects at their disposal and would need only to prefer the disobedient to chastise them  i hope i may without offense gently put young mr bays in mind that the subordination which is absolutely necessary to the government of the world requires that respect should be paid to persons of quality even where esteem cannot be paid to them but that in this case they both may and ought to have our respect and esteem together for i know very few people of quality who have applied themselves to poetry who have not succeeded on the other side it is known to all the world that some of them have been admirable for nothing is more certain than that supposing equal talent and equal application a man of quality has great advantages over the rest of men but can any thing be more stupidly impudent and impertinent than that this little gentleman should rail thus at the writings of people of quality in this very essay the one half of which he has borrowed from two noble authors and appropriated it to himself by the same method by which a jackpudding engrosses a sackposset viz by mingling some beastliness with it which does not fail to render it nauseous to those who made it this extraordinary proceeding of borrowing and railing puts me in mind of a passage in mr cowley  it is now become the frugal fashion rather to bide than pay the obligation nay wrongs and outrages we do lest men should think we owe but the men of quality as they want not the discernment will have the satisfaction to see that as there is a great deal of venom in this little gentlemans temper nature has very wisely corrected it with a great deal of dullness  his rankest libels lull asleep his foes as vipers blood in treacle makes us dose as there is no creature in nature so venomous there is nothing so stupid and so impotent as a hunchbackd toad and a man must be very quiet and very passive and stand still to let him fasten his teeth and his claws or be surpised sleeping by him before that animal can have any power to hurt him  thus in order to find out his outward person have we taken a survey of his inward man in his several noble talents and virtues his poetry his criticism his modesty his humility his gratitude and his good breeding let us now take a survey of his politics and his religion not by any means by way of reflection for poetry and criticism are of no party and of no religion but only to find who he is  i find then that in the compass of one page which is the thirty first he has libelled two monarchs and two nations the two monarchs are king charles and king william the two nations are the dutch and our own the dutch we are told are a parcel of sharpers and we are downright bubbles and fools king charles the second was too much a libertine and too much an encourager of wit for him king william the third was too much a socinian but though he has without mercy condemned the reigns of the forementioned monarchs he is graciously pleased to pass over in silence that which comes between them in the beginning of the   th page we find what that is which so happily reconciled him to it and that was the dispensing power which was set on foot in order to introduce and to establish popery and to make it the national religion now i humbly conceive that he who libels our confederates must be by politics a jacobite and he who libels all the protestant kings that we have had in this island these threescore years and who justifies the dispensing power so long after we are freed from it a power which as was hinted above was set on foot on purpose to introduce popery he who justifies this when he lies under the tie of no necessity nor even convenience to approve of it must i humbly conceive derive his religion from st omers as he seems to have done his humanity and his criticism and is i suppose politickly setting up for poetlaureat against the coming over of the pretender which by his insolence he seems to believe approaching as people of his capacity are generally very sanguine  let us now see if we can find any thing in his rhimes which may direct us to his coffeehouse or to his booksellers by his taking three opportunities to commend mr dryden in so small a compass as p          i fancy we may hear of him at shakespeares head or at wills for to revive old quarrels which have been long out of doors and to renew the memory of poetical wars waged formerly between sir r b mr l m and mr dryden can be agreeable to none but a very few of the frequenters of those places this is to run counter to his own direction for he tells us page    that formerly  pride malice folly against dryden rose in various shapes of parsons critics beaus upon which page    he gives this grave advice  be thou the first true merit to befriend his praise is lost who stays till all commend the appearing in mr drydens behalf now is too late it is like offering a mans self for a second after the principal has been whipped through the lungs now mr dryden is dead he commends him with the rest of the world but if this little gentleman had been his contemporary thirty years ago why then i can tell a very damned shape that pride and malice and folly would have appeared in against mr dryden  for his acquaintance he names mr walsh i had the good fortune to know mr walsh very well who was a learned candid judicious gentleman but he had by no means the qualification which this author reckons absolutely necessary to a critic it being certain that mr walsh was like this essayer a very indifferent poet but he was a man of a very good understanding in spite of his being a beau he loved to be well dressed as dorimant says and thought it no disparagement to his understanding and i remember a little young gentleman with all the qualifications which we have found to be in this author whom mr walsh used sometimes to take into his company as a double foil to his person and his capacity it has been observed that of late years a certain spectre exactly in the shape of that little gentleman has haunted a certain ancient wit and has been by the people of covent garden styled his evil genius for it has been extremely remarkable that while that spectre has haunted that ancient wit he has never been able to write or talk like himself which has by no means happened by any decay of his natural parts but by the wonderful power of magic for as soon as the dumb conjurer has been employed to lay the spectre for three or four months either in the midst of the red sea or the middle of windsorforest the old gentleman has strait been his own man as perfectly as ever he was in his life  and now if you have a mind to enquire between sunninghill and ockingham for a young squab short gentleman with the forementioned qualifications an eternal writer of amorous pastoral madrigals and the very bow of the god of love you will be soon directed to him and pray as soon as you have taken a survey of him tell me whether he is a proper author to make personal reflections on others and tell him if he does not like my person it is because he is an ungrateful creature since his conscience tells him that i have been always infinitely delighted with his so delighted that i have lately drawn a very graphical picture of it but i believe i shall keep the dutch piece from ever seeing the light as a certain old gentleman in windsorforest would have done by the original if he durst have been half as impartial to his own draught as i have been to mine this little author may extol the ancients as much and as long as he pleases but he has reason to thank the good gods that he was born a modern for had he been born of grecian parents and his father by consequence had by law had the absolute disposal of him his life had been no longer than that of one of his poems the life of half a day instead of setting his picture to show i have taken a keener revenge and exposed his intellectuals as duly considering that let the person of a gentleman of his parts be never so contemptible his inward man is ten times more ridiculous it being impossible that his outward form though it should be that of downright monkey should differ so much from human shape as his immaterial unthinking part does from human understanding how agreeable it is to be in a libel with so much good company as i have been with two great monarchs two mighty nations and especially the people of quality of great britain and this libel composed by a little gentleman who has writ a panegyric upon himself which panegyric if it was not writ with judgment yet was it published with discretion for it was published in mr ws name so that by this wise proceeding he had the benefit of the encomium and mr w had the scandal of the poetry which it brought upon him to such a degree that it is ten to one if ever he recovers the reputation of a good versifyer and thus for the present i take my leave of you and of this little critic and his book a book throughout which folly and ignorance those brethren so lame and so impotent do ridiculously at one and the same time look very big and very dull and strut and hobble cheek by jowl with their arms on kimbo being led and supported and bullybackd by that blind hector impudence i am  sir your etc  annotations   first follow nature p    horace has given a precept which may be quoted by undistinguishing people to keep this in countenance  respicere exemplar vitae morumque jubebo doctum imitatorem and veras hinc ducere voces for he bids the person to whom this is directed consult nature but then he does three things which vastly distinguish him from the writer of the essay for first he makes it very plain what sort of person this is to whom he directs himself and that is doctus imitator one who is both poet and critic dramatick poet and dramatick critic one who writes plays and understands the rules and knows the secrets of his art notwithstanding which he may be ignorant of that important one which horace is about to discover to him or in case he does already know it he may want to be put in mind of it because his interest as we shall find anon is a strong temptation to deviate from it but secondly horace tells us very intelligibly what he means by nature here and that is human life and the manners of men thirdly he makes it as clear as the sun what it is to follow nature in giving a draught of human life and of the manners of men and that is not to draw after particular men who are but copies and imperfect copies of the great universal pattern but to consult that innate original and that universal idea which the creator has fixed in the minds of every reasonable creature and so to make a true and a just draught for as every copy deviates from the original both in life and grace and resemblance a poet who designs to give a true draught of human life and manners must consult the universal idea and not particular persons for example when a poet would draw the character of a covetous or a revengeful person he is not to draw after lucius or caius but to consult the universal pattern within him and there to behold what revenge or covetousness would do in such and such natures upon such and such occasions for if he draws after lucius or caius the workings of revenge and covetousness in these two being but copies and imperfect copies of their workings according to the universal idea and the poet degenerating in his draught even from those faint and imperfect copies whenever a just and discerning judge comes to compare that draught with the original within him he immediately finds that that draught falls extremely short of the truth of nature and immediately disapproves of it as a second ungraceful faint unresembling copy agreeable to this is that passage of the most discerning author of the essay upon poetry  if once the justness of each part is lost well may we laugh but at the poets cost thus horace here speaks to the knowing yet tells them something that several of them want to be taught and several to be put in mind of for it has been a complaint of two thousand years standing that poets have been used to violate their subjects and to force their characters out of complaisance to their actors that is to their interest most of the writers for the stage in my time have not only adapted their characters to their actors but those actors have as it were sat for them for which reason the luster of the most shining of their characters must decay with the actors while those of sophocles euripides terence and ben johnson will eternally remain    still green with bays each ancient altar stands p     if mr bays should say here that by each ancient altar he does not mean every ancient poet but only those few who have been admired by all succeeding ages to this i answer that besides that the expression will by no means bear this sense it appears plainly from the two first lines of p    that he speaks of the ancients in general  and though the ancients thus their rules invade as kings dispense with laws themselves have made moderns beware p    i think nothing can be more plain than that here he prefers all the ancients before all the moderns treating the former as so many monarchs and legislators at the same time in the regions of sense and the latter as so many slaves besides that these verses manifestly relate rather to the indifferent poets among the ancients than to those who are admirable for the indifferent ones have most and oftnest invaded the rules indeed they have scarce ever observed them as homer and virgil have scarce ever transgressed them  finis
