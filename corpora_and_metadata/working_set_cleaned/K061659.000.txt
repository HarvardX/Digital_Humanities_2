an apology for the life of mr t c comedian being a proper sequel to the apology for the life of mr colley cibber comedian with an historical view of the stage to the present year supposed to be written by himself in the style and manner of the poet laureat   of all the assurances i was ever guilty of this of writing my own life is the most hardy impudent is what i should have said through every page there runs a vein of vanity and impertinence which no french ensigns memoirs ever came up to my style unequal pert and frothy low and pompous crammed with epithets strewn with scraps of secondhand latin aiming at wit without hitting the mark my subject below all pens but my own which whenever i keep to is flatly daubed by one eternal egotism colley cibbers life p        sequiturque patrem non possibus aequis london printed for j mechell at the kingsarms in fleet street    0 price two shillings  to a certain gentleman sir because i know you do not love to see your name in print imagining it is used in some impertinent satire though i was now writing the daintiest dedication of any modern author yet i would choose to conceal it  let me talk then just as it comes into my head about you and to you this way let me tell you of what i will or how i will you are under no necessity of taking it to yourself nor when i boast of your excellences and transactions need you blush that i have performed them in such a manner as to claim the complimental homage of my pen or i may now give you all the attributes that raise a cunning intriguing man to the highest offices and employments and no be censured as one of your hireling advocates either by my own or your enemies  i place my own first not because they are the greater number but as in the cermonialia of heraldrv the most insignificant personages begin the pomp to introduce those of more elevated consequence i mentioned my enemies first to introduce the mention of yours  yours and such you have for they are not so wellbred as not to declare themselves have carried on long though successless attacks against you and sir give me leave to compare my little self to your great honor as there is no hazard or visible terror in an attack upon my defenseless station my censurers like yours have been persons of an intrepid sincerity but i shut the door against them all while i am thus privately talking to you and have little to apprehend from either of them  under this shelter then i may safely tell you that the greatest reason i have had to publish this wol has arisen from the several performances which i published last summer and which you had goodness enough to patronize how far indeed your good nature to a young politician or your reluctance to put the vanity of one of your new authors out of countenance may have carried you i cannot be sure and yet appearances give me stronger hopes for was not the complaisance of a whole summers sufferance to employ my talents in your service as much as an author of more importance ought to have expected  why then was he desired by mr p  xt  n to write second gazeteers or why was i kept in the service to tell more of the same stories  if these employments have made me vain shall i say sir you are accountable for them  no sir i will rather say that my own forwardness and dashing through thick and thin recommended me to the notice of your supervisorgeneral for gazeteering and pamphleteering or rather so far flatter myself as to suppose it possible that you having been a patron and lover of master walsingham and dame osborn and one of those good judges who know the use and value of such writers under a right regulation might incline you to think my labors and lucubrations of more consequence than they may naturally be to others of different sense who may have less concern or taste for them but be all this as it may as for this apology for my life i have written it not only to show my own parts and illustrate my own story but i have decorated it with several remarks political as well as theatrical and explained the meaning of some of my writings which were dedicated to your service now sir as my apologetical brat is born rather than see it starve on bare parishprovision i choose clandestinely to drop it at your door that it may exercise one of your many virtues your charity in supporting a very dull dog of an author  now sir were the world to know into what right honorable hands i have thrown the following history their regard to its patron might incline them to treat it as one of his own family  they might say such things of it as may be improper for me to mention  for this reason i conceal your name as that must necessariy lead me to descant on a subject which might be ungrateful to your ears for i am at characterising friend or foe a very devil at my pen  in consciousness therefore of what i am i choose not to say what you are  i leave that for other historians and for posterity to relate  however as your equals in rank have done public justice to your character the concealment of your name may be an unnecessary diffidence but am i sir of consequence enough in any guise to do honor to sir  were i to set you sir in the most true lights that your actions deserve or your own likeness requires yet my officious mite would be lost in that general character and regard which people of the first consequence even some of all parties even some of your own dependants have a pleasure of speaking of in private encomiums to persons in your high station are liable to the suspicion of flattery and can add little luster to what before was visible to the public you are cloyed without doubt by such offerings you have them almost daily offered up to you in public and in private at your lve at the t  y at the drawing room and lobby of the senate house besides the zealous ejaculations which are offered for your service in an inimitable paper which is distributed throughout the kingdom gratis  but these offerings like pagaa incense evaporate on the altar and rather gratify the priest than the deity  but you sir are approached frequently and often in terms of common sense the honest oblation of hearts which have just sense enough to mix reason with accusation how really true or whether the zeal of such devotees of common sense are false i shall not here examine but sir was i admitted with all my laughing spirits about me to be my idle self and to write what i could write on that subject i should surely be distinguished by you from a parcel of dull set of rogues whom your good nature and charity induce you to believe are wits this nakedness of temper the world may place in what rank of vanity they please but till wisdom shall point out a way to make me more heartily happy than your favors i am content to be gazed at as your creature as i am without lessening my respect for you and laugh at those whose intellects may be more soberly covered  yet sir i will not deceive you it is not the luster of the power you possess the immenseness of your fortune your figure in life and the just rewards for your services which you had rather deserve than be told of that have made my plain honest heart hang after you these are but incidental ornaments that may be of service to you but my particular esteem has risen from a mere natural and more engaging charm  the agreeable rewards which you confer on your creatures  nor is my vanity so much gratified in the honor as my convenience in the delight of such pecuniary felicities to see you lay aside your superiority and conser with a mean author give him instructions and gold vid c cibbers dedication it is then i tae you then life runs high i desire i possess you  yet sir it must be a farther share of pleasure to look on you with the public eye and view your intregrity  this sir is a theme si mihi sint centum linguae sint oraque centum had i an hundred tongues this theme to raise had i an hundred mouths  to mouth thy praise those tongues these mouths that praise could never tell how you can all and even yourself excel none but yourself can be your parallel when i consider you in this view and in the height of power i could rejoice mightily for you and myself to see you in this particular light of glory and myself admitted to reflect the beams of it throughout great britain  if this apology for my life discourages you not to prevent my design i have some thought of writing an apology for yours i think myself equal to the subject and should be proud if you would by this exercitation of my genius suffer me to approve myself  sir your most obedient most obliged and most humble servant t c july      0 an apology for the life of mr t  c  etc chap i the introduction  reason for writing an apology  the authors birth and family  apromising genius  sent to winchester school  an occurrence there  a digression on vanity and ambition  of systems of philosophy etc  among all the foibles incident to human nature none take a stronger possession of the soul of man than ambition there are indeed sundry ways and arts to gratify this lofty passion which though it may divide itself into different channels yet from the same source various streams take their rise  my readers may be surprised at my setting out with so philosophical an apothegm but it is a very proper introduction to the following apology as it was from an innate thirst of ambition that i undertook to publish these memoirs of my own life some witty smart gentlemen may call it vanity with all my heart and to deal ingenuously with them i frankly confess it was that species of ambition which by hereditary happiness descends to me called vanity  a vanity for what cries a more grave annotator to show there are two coxcombs in a family  must there be two apologies for the lives of two fellows no one cared a halfpenny for  why perhaps merely to signalize myself or perhaps to imitate the laudable steps of my worthy parent or perhaps to defend my conduct from some public reproaches i have thought proper to make an aplogy for my life and surely among the majority of the world this attempt will stand uncensurd as they will be ready enough to allow the life of no man stood more in need of an apology than mine and to show my readers what a candid impartial person i am i will in this disquisition of myself bring my own heart to the bar and try it without favor or affection i shall consequently betray much folly and talk much of myself but i have very great examples to authorize such a liberty old mich montaign it seems in his essays tattled more about his own queer body and mind his cat and an old woman than all the world beside so much had he set his heart upon himself the ingenious and modest mr colley cibber has outdone montaign and not only talked a great deal of himself but has set so great a value on himself that after being so long known he will not let any one know what he really is under a less consideration than a guinea since this was wrote the apology is sold for  s but in these memoirs of my humble self i shall at a cheaper rate take the liberty to illustrate my way of thinking writing and acting both as to my theatrical and private life by the apology which he has made for his own nor can i think the public will be displeased to see what kind of a parallel will be drawn between a father and son who have on many occasions so remarkably distinguished themselves  nam vitiis nemo sine nascitur optimus ille qui minimis urgetur i shall therefore conclude this introduction to my story in his words upon an honest examination of my heart i am afraid the same vanity which makes even homely people employ painters to preserve a flattering record of their persons has seduced me to print off this chiaro oscuro of my mind  but as he hopes immediately after that no one will expect a man of his hasty head should confine himself to any regular method i am in equal hope that no method or connection or regularity will be expected from mine i shall also make digressions in my memoirs when i think they begin to grow too heavy for the readers digestion vide c cibbers life p    for digressions it seems are in this kind of writing what eggs are in a pudding they lighten the composition and render it more palatable and digestive this is my apology and the best apology i can make for becoming my own biographer  i come to that customay and important point in all histories of great men their birth parentage and education so great a curiosity is there in mankind to be informed of these particulars that almost every revolving moon produces illustrious memoirs of heroes and heroines whom dire destiny has allotted to a fatal end as these records are to preserve their memories from more than lethaean oblivion every minute circumstance of their entering into the first scenes of life are related the name of the parents their trade and calling and whether they sent them to school and had them instructed in reading and writing are told with great fidelity these things on mature deliberation may seem very trifling and of no signification to the world whether they were known or not  very true  but yet there is such an avidity in human nature for trifling that these tyburnian memoirs are read by the great vulgar and the small with no little delectation was there no other excuse than this humor of mankind i know not how i could let my birth be passed over in silence but the excuse my father had made before me must stand for mine which is what my brother bays makes prince prettyman say in the rehearsal viz i only do it for fear i should be thought nobodys son at all  though i cannot think i use this theatrical wit with a force equal to that which he quoted it for the public having long known my father they have unanimously paid him a compliment which all fathers have not paid them viz  that i am my fathers own son  but whose sons son i was guess from the following extract from the apologist i imitate  his paragraph of lineage runs thus  i was born in london on the  th of november      in southampton street facing southampton house my father caius gabriel cibber was a native of holstein who came into england sometime before the restoration of king charles the second to follow his profession which was that of a statuary etc the basso relievo in the pedestal of the great column in the city and the two figures of the lunaticks the raving and the melancholy over the gates of bethlehem hospital are no ill monaments of his fame as an artist my mother was the daughter of william colley esquire of a very ancient family of glaiston in rutlandshire where she was born my mothers brother edward colley esquire who gave my christian name being the last heirmale of it the family is now extinct i shall only add that in wrights history of rutlandshire published      the colleys are recorded as sheriffs and members of parliament from the reign of henry vii to the latter end of charles i in whose cause chiefly sir anthony colley my mothers grandfather sunk his estate from three thousand to about three hundred pounds per annum  although i am very far from laying any stress on the pomp of heraldry and a long scroll of family descents for well i know my pedigree though traced as i doubt not but it might be to william the conqueror will confer no intrinsic value on me for conscious i am that any regard to my being must be beamed only by the rays of virtue yet in simple truth i must confess that i think i owe something to having good blood in my veins  for a latin poet justly says  qui viret in foliis venit a radicilus humor et patrum in natos abeunt cum femine mores which i thus venture to translate  the leaves their verdure from the roots receive and souls their children have the parents give every one who has read horace knows  fortes creantur fortibus etc  still from the valiant are the valiant sprung  i need make no application but if valiant why not witty  these scraps of latin may seem very unnecessary for some they might still seem more unnecessary had not i translated them for others however i cannot think them in the least bagatelle they introduce very properly the next thing i was to mention which was my education nay when i have given such a proof of it as to quote latin and translate it i think no farther need be given but however as in my apology i would be like another apologist   longo sed proximus intervallo  i shall follow his manner  about the year      or      i was sent by my father to winchester school in order to be elected into winchester college for it seems by my fathers mothers side i was descended from william of wickham the founder  in what branch i am ingenuous enough to say i know not yet from my soul i contemn that vile insinuation which a certain counselor at a certain trial made that it was by some collateral branch as william of wickham was a churchman at a time when matrimony was not allowed of  the inference is evident  but i will be bold to say that glittering glaring glistering  witwoud flash is as unjust as unmannerly  it equally affects all those educated in winchester college as well as he  who was intended to be educated there as descendants from the founder  but to return  in this school i received the first and last rudiments of learning as my father did his at grantham in lincolnshire but if he has more learning than me it is to be observed he went from the lowest form to the highest and i did not proceed above half the way yet this analogy appears between us  he says c cibbers life p   even there i remember i was the same inconsistent creature i have been ever since always in full spirits in some small capacity to do right but in a more frequent alacrity to do wrong  just such a creature was have been and am  am i  he gives us as the first remarkable error of his life vid p   jesting and jeering and joking on a schoolfellow i have also been thrashd unpitied for the same thing but such circumstances even though my fathers pen was to relate them may be thought damned ridiculous be it enough that i was always eager of fame and glory and making an ecclarisement about the town i loved to make an appearance and remember in some extraordinary adventure the taking another boys laced hat to wear occasioned me much posterior anxiety but vive hodie was my motto  some immediate satisfaction of my passions which were always varying sometimes to dress sometimes to eating or drinking etc was my desire from an infant and i am afraid some charitable folk may say i retain too much of the same temper now i am a man   i very well remember when i was a child i took an ambitious liking to a scarlet cloak with gold trimmings and wept most resolutely for the same which was the only means i could think of for coming at my ends but my mother counterplotted me and bribed away my pride with a crooked sixpence and indeed in those days i would have dropped my most towering aims for a lump of gilded gingerbread or a custard sometimes a goosberrytart would cure a furious fit of ambition  once i remember when i had thrown myself on the ground with a resolution to die because my father would not give me a horse to ride and manage as i thought proper being then full five years old but my mother cured this ambition by showing me a pair of new white gloves and a handful of cherries  i cannot pass by without throwing out some farther reflections on these boyish tricks  c cibbers life p   whether flat or spirited new or common false or true right or wrong they will be still my own and consequently like me i therefore go on to show as well the weakness as the strength of my understanding  by a digression therefore to make this tittle tattle sit light on a readers digestion i draw a moral from it  ambition or vanity when uppermost is bad for either man or child and as it makes children naughty it makes men children  i have often thought my childish ambition for a scarlet cloak of the same stamp as we often meet with in higher life it is the same principle which swells the hearts of the great as puffed up mine and if a due regard to nature be observed it will be allowed so for instance if a man of the first quality as the duke of  i had almost named his title  but i say suppose a man of the first quality who had lived to about his thirtieth year despising to be distinguished by any public gewgaw opposing a minister from a supposition of his being an evil one should all of a sudden run bowing to that ministers levee desert his party break with his relations and turn as great a slave as any he despised  would not any one think there must be some great power of reason to cause so surprising a change but what if it should be ambition would they not think something very august was the object of his soul but if after all it was only a red coat would not his caprice of ambition prove as ridiculous as mine for a red cloak  i could illustrate my other childish appetites by more examples were i not afraid the partiality might give offense to my courtfriends for however like my passions and some great mens may in fact be it is not my interest nor duty to make the comparisons  ex pede herculom  however i may observe that the variety of my desires in my childhood for there was a time when i was a child are such as are to be observed daily among mankind i have known a young gentleman of fortune set out with all the heyday expenses of the mode yet when he found himself overweighd with appetites he grew restless kicked up in the middle of the course and turned his back upon his frolicks i have also known a very witty young fellow become a very grave man and yet when he was in company and was called to it could still make himself the fiddle of it  if i were capable of envy this last gentlemans character would incline me to it for to be wise and at the same time merry is a state of happiness in perfection  c cbbers life p    when i speak of happiness i go no higher than that which is contained in the world we now tread upon and when i speak of being merry i dont simply mean what every oaf is capable of but that kind of mirth which not is more limited than recommended by that indulgent philosophy cum ratione insanire  these sentiments of my philosophy i have expressed in the words of that great author whom i imitate and of whose sect i confess myself a disciple and i will here observe to the reader that through the whole course of these rhapsodical memoirs i shall quote from that incomparable apologist whatever may equally allude to myself not only as my mean style cannot reach his daintiness of expression but as this method will the better show what an analogy there is between us  the readers who are candid will say  juta positi magis lucescunt but as to my philosophy for this is making a digression in a digression  i remember a merry laughing wity complisant fellow who was always the most obsequious humble servant of some man of fortune or other compared himself once to a philosopher and the under of a new sect it was honest gnatho in one of terences plays who said all the followers of his system should be called gnathonici  i know not but from my fathers apology some new philosophers may arise and posterity not give a proper title to their sect therefore i here mention that all who are of our opinion may distinguish themselves by the name of cibberiani  to be a reasonable madman is what i always would be though i have too often been said insanire sine ratione  some may say that i had better not be mad at all  but as my father charmingly says  is this a time of day for me to leave off my fooleries and set up for a new character can it be worth my while to waste my spirits to bake my blood with serious contemplations and perhaps impair my health in the fruitless study of advancing myself into the better opinion of those very  very few wise men who may think different from me no the part i have acted in real life shall be all of a piece   servetur ad imum qualis ab incepto processerit  i can no more put off my follies than my skin i have tried but they stick too close to me and when i have seen others whose rank and fortune have laid a sort of restraint upon their liberty  i have softly said to myself  well there is some advantage in having neither rank nor fortune  give me the joy i always took in the end of an old song  my mind my mind is a kingdom to me let the world call me any fool but an unchearful one i live as i write while my way amuses me it is as well as i wish it  the man whose becalmed passions know no motion seems to be in the quiet state of a green tree he vegetates it is true but shall we say he lives  o expressive description this is the ratione insanire in the very style incomprehensibly sublime  o dainty simile a tree when it is green and vegetates and flourishes cannot be said in our philosophy to live  reader take heed for i have a strong impulse to talk impertinently and show myself in all my lights  here i could draw an imaginary monarch and dress him in all the mockery of greatness with all the cumbersome robes of majesty with all the devastation of ambition in his thoughts till my imagination was heated and fatigued in dressing up a phantome of felicity  and what then  why prove he was not half so happy a fellow as myself  let them be converts to the cibberian sect who will our founder does not impose these laws but follows them himself and is followed by myself  if we are misguided it is natures fault we follow her and reason good  nature has distinguished us from the brutecreation by our risibility homo animal risibile est her design was by our os sublime our erected faces to lift up the dignity of our form god gave to man an upright face that he might view the stars  corner of an almanac from this system we may justly style ourselves natural philosophers  but nevertheless without divine assistance be we never so wise or foolish we cannot reach this merry felicity so that all my parade and grimace of philosophy has been only making a merit of following my own inclination  a very natural vanity  but this vanity does not impose on me  vanity again  however think it reader vanity or not vanity or this or that or the other that has drawn me into this copious digression it is now high time to drop it  after playing the philosopher in this manner i shall now return to school again  a place where some of my witwoud enemies may say would be very proper for me but as i have forestalled their jest none but the dullest rogues will pretend to make it  chap ii he that writes of himself not easily tired boys may give men lessons  wrongly satirizd  on satire  wrote generally for bread  his thoughts and behavior when satirizd etc  as my pen is running over the paper to form this sentence i am smiling sir reader to think what an odly contented coxcomb i am to set myself down to write this apology for my life but you know nothing gives a coxcomb so much pleasure as to talk of himself which sweet liberty i am now enjoying  this pleasure none but authors as vain as myself can conceive  but to my story  however little worth notice the actions of a schoolboy may seem yet as they act on the same motives as men their consequences are worth observing because it is some kind of satisfaction to hehold in what degree the dawn of a genius first appeared for this reason mr colley cibber vide apology p  0 tells you that at school he made an oration on king charles the ii s death when all the boys in his form out of modesty thought such a performance above his capacity and was laughed at and jeered and haed as a pragmatical bastard for this reason he acquaints you that with the least restraint to modesty he did what would have frightened a boy of a meek spirit from attempting  he made an english ode on king jamess coronation and made it in half an hour  the very word ode then adds he makes you smile and so it does me not only because it still makes so many poor devils turn wits upon it but from a more agreeable motive from a reflection that for half a century afterward i should be called upon twice a year by my post to make the same kind of oblations here the reader sees in the puris naturalibus that dawn of genius which bashful modesty could never restrain from writing and who still makes such odes which all the poor devils of wits cannot put him out of conceit of but to myself  i cannot say that among my schoolfellows i made my great figure or raised their envy by any learned compositions yet i know not how it was i had then an innate kind of propensity to scribbling and without any partial flattery to myself i can affirm i chose or rather accidentally struck into one species of writing in which i was not only then without an equal but have remained so ever since  here perhaps i may again seem vain but if the facts are true how can i help it if i have a tolerable feature will not that as much belong to my picture as my imperfection in a word the story is this  while i was at winchester there came some prizefighters from the beargarden at london and as i was always fond of heroes and martial deeds i introduced myself into the company of these knighterrants of the blade it happened that however brave the heroes were they were not very learned in truth they could neither write nor read it was on this occasion that they desired me being a better scholard prizefighters language to pen their challenges which they instructed me to indite here i gave the first demonstration of my parts for having been used at london to read playhouse bills and hear tragedies my father being master of a playhouse i wrote their bills of challenge with such art and expressed the heroes thoughts in such magnanimous phraze that they alarmed the soul of the reader and roused up a greater desire for a gladiatorial spectacle than all the drums in christondom these challenges of my inditing had wonderful success the people were amazed at the swelling pompousness of the heroes language and consequently imagined that those who were terribly courageous with their pen must be very lions at the sword but alas it is one thing scribere and another agere their valor did not near equal the nobleness of my description for the battle they fought was a sham one however they returned their grateful acknowledgments to me and i was author of all their challenges which with much art i diversified during their whole stay  well says some grave annotator who has not heard some private anecdotes of my life what do you infer from this tale hear another and take the inference of them both together some space of time had elapsed since my heroes of the blade left winchester when a company of hireling actors arrived i soon made myself known to them and was accordingly admitted to their rehearsals one morning i casually took up a paper which was a written bill of the performance they were to exhibit in the evening i immediately found there was something deficient or at least something that might be altered to raise the expectation of the populace and bring a better audience to the house i communicated my thoughts very freely to the master of the company and showed such an uncommon genius for writing and composing a playhouse bill that with a complaisant bow he entreated me to write theirs i complied with his request and wrote them in such a promissory way a way which has been since called puffing that they engrossed the attention of the town and by an attractive quality brought them several good audiences i cannot pass by one thing the master of the company and his roxana were of an ambitious spirit to indulge which i ordered their names to be printed six times as large as any of the rest of the performers an article of stagevanity which i have since most frequently practiced with much glee of heart and pompmagnificent  now to apply these stories from such small beginnings my genius soared to an unequal height and i have had for this species of writing no one hardy enough to become my competitor in fame with a pleasant recordation of mind i think what praises were bestowed on the advertisements and the bills of the beargarden while i had for some years the honor of writing them they were attributed to my pen and the most partial witling that ever pretended to be arch upon me would allow that in this i was inimitable i shall not mention what degree of excellence i have arrived to in theatrical bills and advertisements and puffs and paragraphs my modesty will not suffer me to give to posterity in these memoirs what the present age says of them be it enough that there is that something in them which no one can hit but myself  from what i have mentioned i would observe this that wherever there is merit there is a heavy tax laid on it envy and malice will demand a considerable share of the praise which is due to you however great my success has been in the species of writing i have described above yet it has raised me many enemies persons who cannot bear to see any shining parts in another without endeavoring by a cloud of intervening darkness to eclipse them the little genius that i have and which hereditarily descends to me from a paternal source of wit has often occasioned me in the very springtime of my life to become the but of witless censure and invective and the same reason makes me frequently the object of raillery in public coffeehouses and public news papers but as the greater poll of mankind would rather vote for censure than commendation satire has a thousand readers where panegyric has one therefore when i see my name or characteristick for my name in a journal or pamphlet i look on it as an artifice of the author to get a dinner he considers that my face and name are more known than many thousands of more consequence in the kingdom that therefore right or wrong a lick at poor the or the young captain or ancient pistol or by what other name soever they please to dignify and distinguish me will be a sure bait ad captandum vulgus to catch little readers and gratify the unlearned in almost these very words the laureat apologist makes his complaint on being satirizd with his name at length by mr pope and i must add that as mr pope for let him be as great a satyrist as he will i am not afraid to speak out for the sake of the pence satyrizd the inculpable mr c cibber it was for that reason and that reason only that mr cibbers son must be mentioned in his rhymes what else could provoke him to say   shall cibbers son without rebuke outswear a lord  popes imitation of horace  well they may say what they will of the cibbers but it must be a proof they have something very singularly exquisite in their ways and manners when their very names carry a joke in them  but this detraction of these retailers of wit is most admirably compared to colley cibbers life p    dung thrown upon a meadow though it may at first seem to deform the prospect in a little time it will disappear of it self and leave an involuntary crop of praise behind itto cope with such antagonists would be ridiculous for as the same author wittily says would my bearing ill language from a chimneysweeper do me less harm than it would be to box him though i was sure to beat him  as no wit or criticism can make me worse than i am no serious reply i can offer will make me better i have indeed sometimes been induced to give public answers and public appeals but i think in my own judgment and by experimental knowledge that such a proceeding is wrong it is more eligible to be severely strict to the principle laid down by mr cibber sen which is to join in the laugh against myself and honestly say of myself all may be said against me what he says on writing an apology for his life vide motto  is the motto to mine nor can i add any thought of my own to so just and impartial a description  it may be said that this being before hand with the wits is all affectation in me and my giving myself airs of showing myself my fathers own son is too true to make a jest of  he quotes a line on such an occasion c cibbers life p    cinna or cibber vide pauper vult and est pauper  when humble cinna cries  i am poor and low yu may believe him  he is really so i shall give the latin line a different turn  the cibbers both themselves dull rogues declare but what they say in jest in truth they are yet after all what can all the squirts and popguns of jest and raillery avail against the sevenfold shield of confidence and contempt  my soul is like an ample shield can take in all and verge enough for more who can make me more ridiculous than nature has made me if then sir critic you attack this apology to expose me take care you dont expose yourself if you write to snew your parts and genius and all that why you are as errant a fool and coxcomb as me ditto  but perhaps you may want bread if that be the case even go to dinner in gods name whatever you intend me as a disfavour will fly back into your own face as it happens to children who squirt at their playfellows against the wind  when a person of any spirits and genius once gets into a differtation on himself he is a good while before he can get to the end of the chapter the pleasant subject steals imperceptibly upon him nor ever thinks he while he is not weary of writing any one else may be weary of reading i was saying to show a contempt for low wit and to laugh at it yourself was the readiest way to take the off the laugh  now reader if you are not tired i will tell you a story  if you are  lay aside the book and come again when you have a better appetite  in that year when the stage fell into great commotions and the drury lane company asserting the glorious cause of liberty and property made a stand against the oppressions in the patentees in that memorable year when the theatric dominions fell in labor of a revolution under the conduct of myself that revolt gave occasion to several pieces of wit and satirical flirts at the conductor of the enterprise i was attacked as my father had been before me in the public papers and journals and the burlesque character of pistol was attributed to me as a real one out came a print of jack laquerres representing in most vile designing this expedition of ours under the name of the stage mutiny in which gentle reader your humble servant in the pistol character was the principal figure this i laughed at knowing it only a proper embellishment for one of these necessary structures to which persons only out of necessity repair  but now comes the grand attack a summer company was at this juncture performing at covent garden theater and our transactions and my character were thought worthy to be represented on the stage accordingly a young spark who was just come from trinity college at cambridge to set up for an author in town and who had just before wrote a farce called the mocklawyer thought this a proper time to exercise his genius to work he went and pistol was to be his hero a farce was wrote and performed and the bent of it was to ridicule poor me tone of elocution my buskin tread my elevation of countenance my dignity of gesture and expressive rotation of eye balls in short all my manner was burlesqud and a mock pomp of words which were a parody of tragedy speeches and pistols bombast run through the character  this i will say the thing was so well timed and the person who mimickd me did it so well that it succeeded far beyond any the least intrinsic merit that was in it  but where am i again digressing  how do you think i behaved on this occasion i knew if there was any thing smart upon me the audience would very readily laugh at it and indeed at a rehearsal i thought some things smart enough  what then did i but placed myself in one of the sideboxes in the full front of the house and was resolved like cibbers self sblood to stand them all  epilogue to nonjuror well the scene opened and on pistols appearing there was a thundering clap and all the eyes in the house converted on me every sentence that hit at me the joke was heightened by looking at me who laughed as much at them and the poverty of the authors wit as the author or the audience could possibly do at me but seemed only to join the chorus and laugh for mere good humor toward the last scene the author had introduced a sale of theatric goods and one of the properties put up to be disposed of  was apollo s cracked harp and withered crown of bays  upon which a character on the stage replied  oh pray lay that aside for mr pistol he will claim that by hereditary right  this immediately put the whole house in a roar  and encore encore was all the cry  here the whole pit stood up and looked at me  i joined the laughing encore and in the repetition of the low witticism clapped heartily  this joining with the humor of the multitude could give them no pleasure and what signifies being a little severe on ones self to prevent other peoples being so  this was my way of thinking  insuevit pater optimus hoc me this art profound this happy thought my good my modest father taught i am always proud to show in what steps i trod read the next quoted paragraph   c cibbers apology p    in the year    0 there were many authors whose merit wanted nothing but interest to recommend them to the vacant laurel and who took it ill to see it conferred on a comedian insomuch that they were resolved at least to show specimens of their superior pretensions and accordingly enlivened the public papers with ingenious epigrams and satirical flirts at the unworthy successor these papers my friends put into my hands with a wicked smile and desired me to read them fairly in company this was a challenge i never declined and to do my doubty antagonists justice i always read them with as much impartial spirit as if i had writ them myself while i was thus beset on all sides out steps a poetical knight errant to my assistance who was hardy enough to publish some compassionate stanzas in my favor these you may be sure the raillery of my friends could say i had written to myself to deny it i knew would have confirmed their suspicion i therefore told them since it gave them such joy to believe them my own i would do my best to make the whole town think so too  as the odness of this reply was i knew what would not be easily comprehended i desired them to have a days patience and i would print an explanation to it to conclude in two days after i sent this letter with some doggerel rhimes at the bottom  to the author of the whitehalleveningpost sir the verses to the laureat in yours of saturday last have occasioned the following reply which i hope you will give a place in your next to show we can be quick as well as smart upon a proper occasion and as i think it the lowest mark of a scoundrel to make bold with any mans character in print without subscribing the true name of the author i therefore desire if the laureat is concerned enough to ask the question that you will tell him my name and where i live till then i beg leave to be known by no other name than that of  your servant francis fairplay monday january       0  these were the verses  i ah hah sir coll is that thy way thy own dull praise to write and would thou stand so sure a lay no that is too stale a bite ii nature and art in thee combine thy talents here excel all shining brass thou do outshine to play the cheat so well iii who sees thee in iagos part but thinks thee such a rogue and is not glad with all his heart to hang so sad a dog iv when bays thou playst thyself thou art for that by nature fit no blockhead better suits the part than such a coxcomb wit v in wronghead too thy brains we see who might do well at plough as fit for parliament was he as for the laurel thou vi bring thy protected verse from court and try it on the stage there it will make much better sport and set the town in rage vii there beaux and wits and cits and smarts where hissings not uncivil will show their parts to thy deserts and send it to the devil viii but ah in vain against thee we write in vain thy verse we maul our sharpest satires thy delight for  blood thou wilt stand them all ix thunder it is said the laurel spares naught but thy brows could blast it and yet  oh cursed provoking stars thy comfort is thou have it these doggrel verses i have quoted with the same design as the laureat published them in his apology to show you his particular cast of temper and consequently from what fountain i have derived mine i cannot lose this opportunity of mentioning another analogy between us as in our tempers there is a peculiar similitude so there is in our faculties in writing c cilbers life p       he has too bold a disregard for that correctness which others set so just a value on and when he speaks any thing that delights him he finds it difficult to keep his words within the bounds of common sense even when he writes the same failing gets the better of him and instances that wellknown expression of his that mrs oldfield outdid her usual outdoings now have not i in all my writings shown a thorough disregard for pedant correctness in all my speeches on the stage have not i in the fullness of my heart broke through all bounds of common sense yet i must confess though i have given many flat writers occasion to be brisk upon my general style i was never so floridly happy as to make one single expression a standard jest for ten years together i never hit on a verb with so pleasant an accusative after it as could have such an effect vide p     for wherever the verb out do could be brought in the pleasant accusative out doing was sure to follow it and deries repitita placeret says the apologist it has been said of this very sentence that the pleasant accusative outdoing is nonsense as it is not grammar but pray let me ask such pedants is there not a licentia of a quidlibet audendi which all great geniuss claim let cold phmatic writers like dull packhorses keep to the been path men of fire and spirit like nags that have blood in their veins will bounce out of the road start into full speed and show their mettle  again  is it not a characteristick of excellence to have a style so peculiarly singular that in the reading half a page you are sure of the author has not the great bntley gone on in this principle in all his most erudite castigations  cahing the style of the authors has he not said of horace and ternce  sic scripsi  thus he wrote  has he not said  aut sic scripsisse debuit  or so he should have wrote  has he not boldly asserted  sic lege meo periculo  read thus at my peril  the same method he has taken with milton  the amount of all this is if a singular style is a demonstration of a genius i will venture without any infringement on modesty to affirm that the cibberian style is a proof of very remarkable talents and i know not but some future critic will quote that to hit on a pleasant verb followed by a pleasant accustive is a mark of excellence nor am i without hopes but that there are some rhetorical boldnesses in my compontions which may be admired by late posterity   now the reader may think this is all said with seriosity  no mr cibber sen confesses that to outdo an outdoing is a vile jingle nor can i deny that there may be some few expressions in my writings which may perhaps raise a smile  but what then it is our happiness though we write such things seriously we can laugh at them jocosely  when others begin to laugh and if other good writers cannot do the same they want that good sense which some other people may be endowed with  if you write well your c cibbers life p    work wi go without crutches or would i vide ditto publicly put every agument to death that appears against me this were to be an executioner instead of a gentleman praise is a vluntary tax paid by the public they may choose whether they will pay it or not but in the end merit will compel them to it  to conclude the substance of all that i have said might as well been said at first in two lines of a great author and which in a great character i have often spoke with applause  two lines in the character of pistol in henry the  th si fortuna me tormento sperato me contento chap iii the authors several chances for the church the court and the army  designed for the university  took to the stage  political thoughts with many others which can be only known by the readers perusal etc etc etc  after the long digression which i made in the last chapter and the truant which i have so long played from school i am at a loss for an apology to address the reader i left myself at winchester school not making the greatest eclat in classical grammatical and such learning yet distinguishing myself by some puerile excellencies my father to be sure had some great designations of me of being a bishop or perhaps an archbishop he intending me for the church as he himself had been intended  but to neither of us  sic dii voluere  to introduce my story in this third chapter i must quote the introduction to his    vide c cibbers life p    i am now come to that crisis of my life when fortune seemed to be at a loss what she should do with me h she favored my fathers first designation of me he ight then perhaps have had as sanguine hopes of my being a bishop as i afterward conceived of being a general nay i had a third chance of becoming an underpropper of the state how i came to be none of these the sequel will inform you  my father as i before himed had conceived great designations of me but there was a concatenation of things which occasioned me to follow the same tract which he had trod in before i was not elected into winchester college all the reasons may not be altogether so proper to repeat i unfortunately mistook the sense of a line in virgil nisus amore pio pueri etc however to this day i cannot think the making a false comment on a passage in a heathen author should be a disqualification for ecclesiastic preferment  be that however as it will it was i think about the year    0 when a change of ministry was happening at london and the right honorable sir r  w  was about to make that illustrious figure in europe which we have since seen while the nation was in labor of such a production my affairs also were in labor of some event when i happened to be sent up to london to my father to be turned loose into the bustle of the world  at this juncture you cannot but observe that the fate of sir r w and t c were at the same time upon the anvil in what shape they would afterward appear was only guesswork what characters we have since attained all europe knows in regard to him all britain in regard to me  but a still more remarkable crisis happened to mr colley cibber on his return from being a candidate for winchester college take his own story  the nation now fell in labor of the revolution the prince of orange was landed in the west my father was in arms under the duke of devonshire but i jumped into his saddle and he returned to chatsworth where he was at work at this crisis king james and the prince of orange and that of so minute a being as myself were at once upon the anvil in what shape they would severally come out though a good guess might be made was not then demonstrable to the deepest foresight  but adds he if one month sooner i had been at the university who knows but by this time that purer fountain might have washed my imperfections into a capacity of writing instead of plays and annual odes sermons and pastoral letters  and who knows if i had attached myself to the order of priesthood what a figure i might by this time have made i might instead of writing country correspondents and daily gazetteers have penned characters of queens and spoke speeches from a reverend bench in defense of prime ministers  you must now consider me at a period of time which produced such a change in public affairs which as i can now judge of them were of great consequence to the nation when i think of this era being famous for a change that made sir r prime minister i naturally digress on prime ministers and the changes they are wished to meet with c cibbers lise p    while great men want great posts the nation will never want seeming patriots and no ministers but will be heartily railed at but i cannot forbear thinking that they who have been longest railed at must from that circumstance show in some sort the proof of a capacity if this circumstance of being long railed at is an undubitable characteristick of a wise and able minister the right honorable gentleman whose crisis of fortune was depending at the same time as mine has been the most able and wise minister that ever managed the affairs of this nation notwithstanding this proof of capacity he and his measures have been talked of much in the same manner as mr c cibber politically remarks people did of king james and his conduct  c cibbers life p    it is incredible says that historian with what freedom and contempt the common people in the open streets talked of his wild measures yet we of the vulgar had no farther notion of any remedy for this evil than a satisfied presumption that our numbers were too great to be mastered by his mere will and pleasure that though he might be too hard for our laws yet he could never get the better of our nature and to drive all england into slavery he would find would be teaching an old lion to dance  there are i say men malecontent and weak enough to talk in this manner of sir r  and to use the above elgnt and apt simile who think themselves too old lions to be taught to dance  but i dont see how they can help it for to compare this great man to what he has never yet been compared he is like another orpheus who can make these old lions move to the tun he plays and they must dance while he using another of the laureats expressions is the fiddle of the nation  these are a few of my political notions by which you may see what a sort of a partyman i am but if talking of the minister has drawn me at any time ever so far out of my depth i still flatter myself i have kept a simple honest head above water and it is a solid comfort how insignificant soever i may seem that i have made one among many others who have wrote papers and pamphlets to prove the happy effects of this present administration  thus may i be said to have become in reality an underpropper of the state which my father not getting a place in the vide c cibbers life secretarys office never arrived at  but to recover the clue of my history i was now come from winchester to london to turn out into the busle of the world in which according to my rank of life i have made more bustle than any one before me my father did not know well what to do with me for i had so remarkable a genius that i was fit for any thing and yet fit for nothing in this vacancy of his resolution being a forward youth i wanted to know something of the world which knowledge i soon attained and began to run into the heyday gallantries of a man of mode in short i thought myself a very pretty fellow the clear emannations of beauty struck me into a regard for the fair sex that had something softer than profound respect i could not resist its power which is efficacious on all for beauty like the sun shines into equal warmth the peasant and the courtier so good a taste my first hopeful entrance into manhood set out with  vide apology p    my father had the same kind of heart which was ready to be shone into warmth and he handsomely the same page apologizes that as he was waiting at table on the present duchess dowager of marlborough in the year of the revolution these two words litto for this relation and these phrases some wine and water  these two words only that very single sound struck upon his senses which were collected into his eyes by the clear emanation of her beauty  this gay spirit of mine gave some uneasiness to my good mother but my father laughed at it as a pleasing recordation of himself to hear of some of my youthful sallies which were the effects of great spirits and into which none but your great genii run to see an honest boldness or modest assurance in countenance and speech which none but men conscious of merit have this must give him a pleasing recordation of mind then he might truly cry out with ecstasy   motto to cibbers life hoc est vivere bis vita piss priore frui which he since translates thus  when years no more of active life retain it is youth renew a to laugh em over again but which i translate for i can translate as well as he thus  it is to live twice to see the life you led again lived over by the son you bred or thus  twas to live twice  twice the same acts enjoy to see the same still practiced by his boy after this interval of idleness some views of life were set before my eyes as the army or the city the army i liked tolerably nay so well that i partly took upon myself and was partly complimented by my companions with the news of captain  and it is with some pleasure i hear myself called the young captain to this day but a small commission however more honorable it might seem i began to know was not so profitable as the profession of an actor and though my father at the revolution had thoughts of being a generalofficer things were now changed and i have often blessed my stars for my preferring the theater to the camp on that i have been a hero strutted with a golden trunhon nodded command to roman legions and old british bands in the army i might have still traild a lieutenants halfpike and in some country quarters lived inglorious for years pacific rolled revolving round the spiritstirring drum the earpiercing fife all pride pomp circumstance of glorious war have longed been lot in peace which long farewell have told the soldiers occupation lost  twas n the sage alone i promised myself much pleasure much income and much reputation  nor is a heatric profession so contemptible as some affect to think was a little foolish prejudice laid aside c cibbers life p    mr c cibbr truly says that many a wellborn younger brothe and many a beauty of low fortune would gladly have adorned the theater who by their not being able to brook such dishonor to their birth have passed away lives decently unheeded and forgotten in short it is better to be this or that on the stage so you get handsomely by it than live in any degree of ignominy or not ignominy off from it that is there is no ignominy on the stage or if you will the stage is above ignominy  see this period i rememember says mr cibber c cibbers life p     a lady with a real title whose female indiscretions had occasioned her family to abandon her being willing to make an honest penny of what beauty she had left desired to be admitted an actress her relations opposed it for reasons easy to be guessed at it was not our interest to make an honorable family our enemies and she was refused here you find her honest endeavor to get bread from the stage i e to make an honest penny of her beauty was looked on as an additional scandal to her former dishonor so that i am afraid had the lady sold patches and pomatum in a bandbox from door to door she might have starved with less infamy than relieved her necessity by being famous on the stage  in short it is no ignominy to be la damoiselle de plasir in a theater   but notwithstanding all i have said and my father before me the profession of a player still continues as by his memoirs i find it has always done to be held by many gentlemen and people of quality in no great esteem and many outrageous insults have been committed by persons who would be thought gentlemen on actors whom they dared not have used so in any other place but a theater but these insulters of audiences as well as players are not to be ruled there is no contending with them they are all patriots liberty and property men who roar out to defend their magna charta of doing what they will in a theater this usage of players mr cibber says keeps young people of sense from coming on the stage they fear entering into a society whose institution if not abused is an excellent school of morality but alas as shakspear says  where is that place where into sometimes foul things intrude not and really the abuse of the stage by the actors be it as great as it will by acting indiscreetly in their private lives it is not greater than the abuse that those noisy rioters make of it by their public disturbances i cannot apprehend what rational authority this society for the reformation of theatrical manners can plead to call an actor to an account on the stage for what he has done off it would any judge pay less regard for a counsellors argument at the bar because he may be an indiscreet or even a bad man at home  but it is otherwise at our theatric bar of judgment our judges are also jury and likewise executioners and though you appear there not as your own person they make you the culprit put you immediately on your trial  and g  d send you a good deliverance  but i may say what i will against thse unjust unlimited insults yet the player who falls under such a caprice of public displeasure must be left adrift and ride out the storm as well as he is able  i would here speak of some storms which poor i have been adrift in and which i have outrode by that admirable stage apothegm sblood i will stand you all but that anecdote will fall under my pen in a subsequent chapter to conclude this the view of rising some time or other to live in that modish affluence jovial gaiety and seeming importance in which my father and some others i saw lived was the flattering light by which i steered my course such temptations were too strong for so warm a vanity as mine to resist on the stage i came being entered according to my merit at a very low salary and now gentle and most candid reader your curiosity is from thence to expect a farther account of me  chap iv the author follows mr colley cibbers method of history  a short history of the stage and actors from the restoration to the revolution  their characters  why given etc  as i have professed myself an humble imitator of mr c cibbers peculiar manner of historical narrations i hope the reader will not think frequent digressions from my own actions and life any way inconsistent for though i have only promised an account of the material occurrences of the theater during my own time yet a short history of the theater from the restoration to the revolution and from thence to the present year    0 may be worth more notice than giving the public an account of my youthful adventures for which little apology i am afraid can be made as in an account of this nature i cannot make use of my own knowledge and judgment i must claim the privilege of all historians of having recourse to those authors who have treated on the subject before nor shall i omit that part which modern history is much founded on oral tradition to these i shall add such intelligence as i could collate from such ancient records as still remain in the archives of the theater but though i may severally use all these aids the chief support which i shall rely on will be the memoirs which mr c cibber has with great authenticity and judgment collected and i shall also give a faithful abstract of his theatrical characters because they will lead you into a clearer view of some modern ones which i myself at a due time and place shall venture to pourtray  before i enter on this undertaking i must premise that many are the inimitable beauties in style in thought and manner of the great apologetial original which my compendium will not allow me to introduce however the reader may depend my abstract from it shall be so connected that i will give him the quinta pars sui nectaris the very quintessence of his nectar and this chapter shall be as it were ilias in nuce  the iliad in a nutshell  without farther preface or apology  the civil war which was begun between king charles the first in defense of his prerogative and his people in defense of their freedom introduced at length all the effects of anarchy every thing that was truly good and virtuous was no longer in esteem those pions schools of morality the playhuses were no longer suffered the stage fell with monarchy and the peers of the land with the actors of the theater but as it fell with monarchy it was with monarchy restored for at king charles the  ds restoration two patents were granted one to sir william davenant and the other to henry killegrew esquire according to mr cibbers account or to mr thomas killegrew according to the relation of that theatric annalist john downs the old prompter the company under sir william davenant says mr cibber were called the kings servants and acted at the theater royal in drury lane the other the dukes company who acted at the dukes theater in dorset garden  but mr downs wrote an account of the stage during his own time called rosius anglicanus downs says that on the restoration the scattered remnant of six playhouses which subsisted in king charles the firsts time upon the restoration framed a company and acted again at the bull playhouse built them a new theater in gibbons tenniscourt in claremarket in which two places they continued acting all    0           and part of      in this time they built them a new theater in drury lane mr thomas killegrew gaining a patent from the king in order to create them the kings servants and from that time they called themselves his majestys company of comedians in drury lane  as to the company acting under sir william davenant downs gives this particular account of its first rise and going to dorsetgarden  in the year one thousand six hundred and fiftynine general monk marching then his army out of scotland to london mr rhodes a bookseller being wardrobe keeper formerly as i am informed to king charles the firsts company of comedians in blackfryars geting a license from the then governing state fitted up a house for acting called the cookpit in drury lane and in a short time completed his company  in this interim sir william davenant gained a patent from the king and opened a house in lincolnsinnfields with new scenes and decorations being the first that were ever introduced into england where they continued to act till the year      when they opened a new theater in dorsetgarden and removed from lincolnsinnfields thither  the reader cannot but observe some difference in these two great historians to show my faithful attachment to truth i have given both accounts and gentle reader  utrum horum mavis accipe of the kings company about ten were put on the royal household establishment having each ten yards of scarlet cloth with a proper quantity of lace allowed them for liveries and in the warrants from the lord chamberlain they were styled gentlemen of the great chamber  both these companies were in high estimation the long interdiction of plays had given fresh appete to such representations besides before now no actresses had been seen on the stage the characters of women in theaters were performed by boys or young men of the most effeminate aspect and what grace or masterstroes of action can we conceive such ungain hydens to have been capable of these two theaters had another advantageous rule made by themselves which was that no play acted at one house should ever be attempted at the other this prevented a saiety of the same plays and kept up the pleasure which might otherwise grow languid  for what pleasure is not languid to satiety  the neglect which has been had for several years past to this management mr c cibber thinks is the occasion of the degradation of the present theaters by the entertainments they exhibit  c cibbers life p    for when plays are hackneyd out to the common people indifferently at any theater the best actors will soon feel the town hs enough of them hence he proves a plualy of playhouses detrimental to the stage unless a proportionable number of good authors could rise to give them all different employments but while good writers are so scarce and undaunted critics so plenty i am afraid a good play and a blazing star will be equal rarities this indulging the taste with several theaters will amount to the same variety as an oeconomist would show who would have two pldings and two legs of mutron for the same dinner  though this simile has been inserted in many a twopenny jestbook yet as it is admirably introduced i have again ventured to quote it but to resume the thread of this history  these two excellent companies were both prosperous for some time tll their variety of plays began to be exhausted then of course the better actors which the kings seem to have been allowed could not fail of drawing greater audiences sir william davenant therefore master of the dukes company introduced music to action and a new species of plays called dramatick operas  i must here observe mr cibber says sir william was master of the dukes company though in a page before he said they were the kings this inadvertance arises from his not rightly counting one two but he has too bold a disregard for correctness which others set a value on it is with a little compunction that i made this remark yet  amicus socrates amicus plato sed magis amica ventas  c cibbers life p   this sensual supply of sight and sound coming into the weaker party they grew too hard for sense and simple nature for more people can see and hear than think and judge this change of taste fell heavy on the kings company they had truth on their side and praise for their action but it is cold comfort  laudatur and alget  unprofitable praise can hardly give it a soup maigre  in this rivalship of the two houses mohun and heart growing old and the young actors impatient to get into their parts and intractable the audience likewise falling off at both houses the two companies were united into one exclusive of all others in the year      or according to downess chronology     this union says the apologist was however so much in favor of the dukes company that heart left the stage upon it  the old prompter says  downess roscius anglicanuus upon this union mr heart being the heart of the company under mr killegrews patent never acted more by reason of his malady being afflicted with the stone and gravel of which he died some time after having a salary of forty shillings a week to the day of his death  one theater was now in possession of the whole town and the united patentees imposed their own terms on the players the actors who have always as quick a sense of injuries and as high and glorious a love of freedom as any people whatever appealed for redress to the lord chamberlain who was then my lord dorset who finding their complaints just procured from king william in      a separate license for mr congreve mr betterton mrs barry mrs brgirdle and others to set up a new company calling it the new theater in lincolnsinnfields and they opened it the last day of april      with a nw comedy called love for love  mr colley cibber begins his account of the actors from his entering upon the stage    0 which were the remains of what was called the dukes company but is quite silent as to the kings company whom he allows to have been their superiors i shall therefore in this apology for my life be bold enough to supply that defect in the apology for his it may be said perhaps what is this apologizing for your lives  well sir critic suppose we call it so what then but to the purpose  the company acting under mr killegrew consisted of the following actors and actresses  men mr theophilus bird mr heart mr mohun mr lacy mr burt mr catwright mr chun mr shorterell mr kynaston mr wintersell mr griffin mr goodman mr lyddoll women mrs carey mrs marshall mrs uphill mrs knep mrs hughes and sometime after came into this company mrs boutll mrs ellen gwin mrs james mrs rutter mrs knight   these actors and actresses were professedly excellent and who could have been no imitators but all originals for which reason it may be much doubted if they have been since equaled it is impossible for me to give an account of their perfections after the elaborate manner mr cibber has of some others who succeeded them but if any regard is to be paid to the judgment of the audinces and authors of their time they must have excelled highly in parts which we see them cast to in the best plays of that time heart was the standard to which mountford and wilks endeavored and with great success to arrive at yet are said not thoroughly to attain it mohun was formed for an artful sterness in tragedy and had great talents in comedy he was the original ventidius in mr drydens all for love and was eminent for the volpone of ben johnson mrs marshall mrs ellen gwin and mrs boutell were equally admired in tragedy and comedy to give the reader who has any knowledge of theatric performances the best idea i am able of these actors i will transcribe the cast of two or three plays in which they peculiarly excelled and which still continue to be acted on the stage  the fox volpone major mohun mosca mr heart corbacchio mr cartwright voltore mr shatterell corvino mr burt sir politic woudbe mr lacy peregrine mr kynaston lady woudbe mrs corey celia mrs marshall othello othello mr heart brabantio mr cartwright cassio mr burt iago major mohun roderigo mr shatterell desdemona mrs hughes emilia mrs rutter earl of essex the earl of essex mr clark the e of southampton mr griffin lord burleig major moun queen elizabeth mrs gwin i come now to speak of in the same transitory manner sir william davenants company and of the persons who composed it mr rhodes as i mentioned before formed a company of which the following names is a complete list  men mr betterton sheppy lovil illison underhill turner dixn robert noes these six acted womens parts mr kynaston james nokes angel william berterton mosely floyd on sir william davenants getting a patent from the king and forming this odd band into a more regular manner he took in these following actors  mr harris mr pe mr richards mr blayden mr sith mr sandford mr medbourne mr tug mr norris to these he added the following actresses the four first of which he boarded in his own house  mrs dvnport mrs saunderson mrs gibbs mrs norris mrs davies mrs long mrs holden mrs jennings thus this company stood in the year      but having lost several of the actors by death and some by love it was recruited in the year      by mr anthony leigh mr jevon mr percival  and mr williams who came in a boy and served mr hrris and mr boman a boy likewise among the new women were mrs barry mrs currer mrs butler and others  though i may seem impertinently prolix yet by some this theatric chronology will be thought not unnecessary and it is in fact a proper introduction to that part of theatrical history which mr c cibber has very copiosly related and of which i shall here give a sort of an abstract for this with my own account will make a perfect compendium of stage history  thus he writes   in the year    0 when i first came into this company the principal actors then at the head of it were  of men mr betterton mr mountford mr kynaston mr sandford mr nokes mr underhill and mr leigh of women mrs betterton mrs barry mrs leigh mrs butler mrs mountford and mrs bracegirdle betterton was an actor as shakespeare was an author both without competitors formed for the mutual assistance and illustration of each others genius the one was born only to speak what the other only knew to write but to give a more clear idea of him you have seen a hamlet perhaps who on the first appearance of his fathers spirit has thrown himself into all the straining vociferations requisite to express rage and fury and the house has thundered with applause though the misguided actor was tearing a passion into rags now betterton threw this scene into another light he opened it with a pause of mute amusement then rising slowly to a solemn trembling voice he made the ghost equally terrible to the spectator as to himself and in the descriptive part of the natural emotions which the ghastly vision gave the boldness of his expostulations were still governed by decency manly but not braving his voice never rising into that seeming outrage or wild defiance of what he naturally revered  a farther excellence betterton had was that he could vary his spirit to the different characters he acted those wild impatient starts that fierce and flashing fire which he threw into hotspur never came from the unruffied temper of brutus for i have seen more than once a brutus as warm as hotspur when the betterton brutus was provoked in his dispute with cassius his spirit flew only to his eye his steady look alone supplied that terror which he disdained an intemperance of voice should rise to thus with a settled dignity of contempt like an unheeding rock he repelled upon himself the foam of cassius perhaps the words of shakespeare will better let you into my meaning  must i give way and room to your rash choler sall i be frighted when a madman stares and a little after  there is no terror cassius in your looks etc but with whatever strength of nature we see the poet show at once the philosopher and the hero yet the image of the actors excellence unless language could put colors into our words to paint the voice with et si vis similem pingere pinge sonumis an impossibility  besides these characters he showed an extraordinary power in blowing alexander into a blaze of almiation yet the furious fustian and turged rants in that character he was sensible gained a false applause only for he thought no applause equal to an attentive silence that there were many ways of deceiving an audience into a loud one but to keep them hud and quiet was an applause which only truth and merit could arrive at but if truth and merit were only applauded how many noisy actors would shake their plumes with shame who from an injudicious approbation of the multitude have strutted and bawled in the place of merit betterton had a voice of that kind which gave more spirit to terror than to the softer passions of more strength than melody the rage and jealousy of othello became him better than the sighs and tenderness of castalio for though in castalio he only excelled others in othello he excelled himself the person of this excellent actor was suitable to his voice more manly than sweet not exceeding the middle stature inclining to the corpulent of a serious penetrating aspect his limbs nearer the athletick than the delicate proportion yet however formed there rose from the harmony of the whole a commanding mein of majesty which the fairerfacd darlings of his time ever wanted something to be masters of the last part he acted was melantius in the maids tragedy for his own benefit when being suddenly seized with the gout he submitted by extraordinary applications to have his foot so far relieved that he might be able to walk on the stage in a slipper rather than wholly disappoint his audience he was observed that day to have exerted a more than ordinary spirit and met with a suitable applause but the unhappy consequence of tampering with his distemper was that it flew into his head and killed him in three days in the   th year of his age  this is the chief account which mr cibber gives of betterton he has indeed interspersed several theatric observations which amount to no more than they who write cannot read and they who read cannot act mr dryden could not read his own amphitrion yet not lee read his scenes so well that mohun cried out  unless i were able to play my part as well as you read it to what purpose should i take it  yet not lee attempted to be an actor but soon left the stage in despair of making a profitable figure there  i could on this head add several curious anecdotes of my own and from experience in the stage affairs prove that as some who write cannot read so there are others who read that cannot write and yet some who can both read act and write  how far indeed these reading writing acting qualifications may be conjoined in one and the same person this apologetical history as well as that of mr colley cibber will be some humble kind of demonstration of some indeed may think that by these memoirs we may blaze to pesterity in a ludicrou luster and that our observations and digressions signify roundly nthing yet to the drum of the ear will i as roundly rattle  a fico for thy criticism vile wight you say we print indeed yet cannot write i myself i and father print indeed but what we print we wrote and what we wrote you read  but hlt a little  i had something to say on the above description of betterton it may be in the greatest part or even in the whole just yet is it not carrying the elogium too far to think nor heart nor mohun nor any in their company nor some before them equaled him perhaps surpassed him mr cibber says none has since arrived at his perfections this very possily may be yet very likely every succeeding age will think in the same manner of other actors as mr heart and mohuns excellencies were forgot by degrees mr bettertons arose when his failed by his death mr booth was thought to be a very great successor in short they who remember betterton shake their heads at booth they that are in full memory of booth with pitiful scorn see some modern performers who half a century hence may be highly admired in their turn in prejudice to vide c cibbers apology new alpts in the profession this say what you will is a prejudice of nature the impressions we first receive are so deeply affecting that even having judgment afterward it imposes on it prejudices in theatrical affairs are as imperceptibly got and as obstinately maintained as those in religion and we may say of the first representation we see what  says of our first education  by education most men are misled we so believe because we so were bred the priest continues what the nurse began and thus the child imposes on the man but really betterton besides his excellencies of nature and judgment and other great advantages for though he is called an original he had seen all the old players who were very excellent and those were remembered who were originals of shakespeare  what aid such remembrance might be take from the following anecdotes   downss account of the stage in the tragedy of hamlet says old downs the part of hamlet was performed by mr betterton sir william davenant having seen mr tailor of the blackfryars company act it who was instructed by the author mr shakespeare taught mr betterton in every article of it which by his exact performance of it gained him esteem and reputation superlative to all other plays  thus again this ancient but faithful memoirist delivers himself concerning the play of henry the eighth  the part of the king was all new clothed in a proper habit and so right and justly done by mr betterton he being instructed in it by sir william davenant who had it from old mr lowen that had his instructions from mr shakespeare himself that i dare and will aver none can or will come near him in this age in the performance of that part  the reader will observe that in theatrical memoirists a simplicity of style in plain narration too often occurs but he will pardon this bold disregard for grammatical correctness if through our rapidity of thought he investigates the meaning he will see then how in hamlet mr betterton came by that judgment which mr cibber takes up some pages in extolling he will find those actors who have been originals in parts are thought to have excelled to the highest degree and mr betterton might have been as excellent in those parts in which he was an original as any other actor before him yet an actor after him who has an original part and consequently thereby becomes an originl may be thought so far to excel that few actors while he is remembered shall with any equal judicious approbation succeed in that part  on the whole original parts make an actor and they who have seen a perfect set of actors can only judge of succeeding ones by them the  laudator temporis acti is not merely confined to old men by natural prejudice we catch this apurtenance to old age when we have scarce passed the verge of youth but to conclude of mr betterton with a greater compliment than any other paid him though the epilogue to his last benefit wrote by mr row was a very good one take this description of him from a prologue of dryden  he like the setting sun still shoots a glimmry ray like ancient rome majestic in decay mr c cibbers long digression has led me into this but as in his account of betterton his sentiments on theatrical acion are chiefly expressed i have ventured to subjoin these sentiments of mine to his account that i may not be so tedious on this subject in another place i shall now introduce his other drawn characters and vide c cibbers apology p    ake use of the same vehicles which you will find waiting in the next chapter to carry you through the rest of your journey at leisure  for all know that  placida narratio pro vehiculo est chap v theatrical characters quotations dissertations annotations digressions expressions allusions collated imitated and related with a few words to critical auditors  it was before observed women were not admitted on the stage till after the restoration yet by the lists i have given you will find they were not so very easily supplied for in the company where betterton was engaged they were forced still to put young men into female characters and mr kynaston stands first in that motley cast nor indeed had they any till sir william davenant brought them to that company on the contrary the old or the kings company under killegrew had at first setting out some women who in the summer of king charles the seconds reign even when the companies were in their highest prosperity were thought inimitable how hard then is it to fix unlimited excellence to particular persons but of these male women kynaston was esteemed being very young and handsome and according to downess phrase downess roscius anglicanus  a complete female stagebeauty performing his parts so well especially arthiope and aglaura parts greatly moving compassion and pity that it is doubted whether any woman that succeeded him so sensibly touched the audience behold the doatage of servile partiality mr cibber speaks of his beauty and his performing evadne in the maids tragedy to which he subjoins a facetious incident which those shifts once occasioned vide c cibbers apology p    king charles coming to a tragedy sooner than usual and was impatient to have the performance begin and sent to know the meaning of their delay the master of the company came to the box and thinking the best excuse would be the truth fairly told his majesty the queen was not yet shaved the king laughed and staid till her majesty could be effeminated  but as for kynaston he was so beautiful that the ladies of quality prided themselves in taking him with them in their coaches in this theatrical habit after the play which in those days began at four of clock  such a custom of the ladies of carrying such a handsome young fellow though in petticoats in their coaches with them without any apprehension of censure is as strong an instance as possible to what height the modish gallantry of that time was carried  but even on mr kynastons changing sexes that is his petticoats to the buskin and his stays to the truncheon he still remained famous he had it seems a formal gravity in his mein which in some characters became him his eye was piercing and in characters of heroic life led in his tone of voice an imperious vivacity that truly depicted the tyrant in these two parts morat in aurengzebe and muley moloch in sebastian he had a fierce lyonlike majesty in his utterance that gave the spectator a kind of trembling admiration  in henry the fourth he was a master of a different majesty but of so true a kind that when he whispered the following line to hotspur  send us your prisoner or you will hear of it he conveyed more menace than the loudest intemperance of voice could swell to kynaston like betterton strictly followed the rules of truth and nature yet what seemed surprising they were as different in their manner of acting as in their personal form and features he stayed too long on the stage till his memory and spirits failed him his latter imperfections were not his own but those of decaying nature  vide c cibbers apology p    mountsord was a younger man tall wellmade of agreeable aspect fair his voice clear full and melodious in tragedy a most affecting lover his words had that softness that  like flakes of feathered snow they melted as they fell in comedy he gave the truest life to what we call the fine gentleman in scenes of gaiety he never broke into the regard that was due to the presence of equal or superior characters though inferior actors played them he filled the stage not by elbowing and crossing it before others or disconcerting their action but by surpassing them in time and masterly touches of nature he never laughed at his own jest unless the point of his raillery required it he had besides such a variety of genius that he could throw off the man of sense for the brisk vain rude lively coxcomb hence he excelled in sir courtly nice his whole man his voice mein and gesture was no longer mountsord but another person there the insipid soft civility the elegant and formal mein the drawling delicacy of voice the stately flatness of his address and the empty eminence of his attitudes were so nicely observed and guarded that had he not been an entire master of nature had he not kept his judgment as it were a sentinel upon himself not to admit the least likeness of what he used to be to enter into any part of his performance he could not possibly have so compleately finished it he was killed in the thirtythird year of his age the accidents that more particularly attended his fall are to be sound at large in the trial of the lord mohun printed among those of the state in folio  vide c cibbers apology p    sandsord was what mr cibber sen calls the spagnolet of the theater an excellent actor in disagreeable characters that is he was the stage villain but this happened not so much by his own choice as necessity for having a low crooked person such bodily defects were too strong to be admitted into great and amiable characters so that in any new or revived play if there was a hateful or mischievous one sandsord had no competitor for it this personating of bad characters required as much art and judgment as to have shone into the applause of the spectators by all the throws and swellings of ambition yet it was attended with this dilemma that an audience never expected to see him in any other nay so far was this prejudice carried which mr cibber has heard was fact a new play came on the stage in which sandford played an honest statesman the pit sat out three or four acts in a quiet expectation that the honesty of sandford should from his diffembling it for they thought him a rogue at the bottom animate the scenes to come with confusion but finding him in truth an honest statesman they fairly damned the play as if the author had imposed on them a most fruitless absurdity  this oral tradition has in it a proof as ali oral traditions have that much faith is required in the reader might not the last act in this play have some other catastrophe in it than sandfords proving an honest statesman  no so the story was heard and so it must be believed   credat judaeus apella non ego  from sandfords being so successful a stage villian the inferior actors thought his success owing to the defects of his person and from thence when they appeared as bravos and murderers made themselves as frightful and inhuman figures as possible  in king charless time says our anedoring apologist this low skill was carried to such extravagance that the king who was black browd and of a swarthy complexion passed a pleasant remark on observing the grim murderers in mcbeth when turning to his people in the box he said pray what is the meaning that we never see a rogue in a play but godsfish they clap him on a black periwig when it is well known one of the greatest rogues in the kingdom always wears a fair one  the kings observation says mr c cibber was just though the king had been as fair as adonis  what complexion that pretty fellow adonis had i will not determine yet i know not how it is or what ideas people conceive of black but it certainly has a very horrormoving aspect it may be a trick of the stage and as such laughed at for i allow very great rascals may have very black hearts who wear very fair perukes mr c cibber thinks his swarthy majesty alluded to some great man out of power and leave them to guess at him who remember the changing complexion of his ministers  this charming observation shows the folly of allusion for suppose somebody now living    0 had said the said sentence who among the present ministry would dare six on a man who wore a light wig their eyes might indeed naturally be converted to that great man who wore the greatest lightcolourd wig and so might guess at him  who was a very honest man  but though political ministerial inuendoes may be very justly proved to mean something yet theatrical inuendoes are a mere inanity of thought  but to digress from this digression  and to enter into another  many actors and actresses have made it a point to play a character flatly written because they stood in the favorable light of honor and virtu  a lady vide c cibbers apology p    mr cibber sen says who was a damoselle de plasir on the stage acted a part of impregnable chastity and bid the ladies  study to live the character i play yet this good creature made faut paux she had some illegitimate issue and her chastiry off the stage was not impregnable many are the same kind of theatric prudes now living who are like enough to think that to seem virtuous is sufficient for an audience and would make it a point to be for half an hour most pure virgins on the stage whatever kind coming dear consenting creatures they might prove after the curtain had dropped  i could enumerate some dainty modern proofs of this theatric prudery but give me leave to change an old apothegm  de vivis nil nisi bonum to return to c cibbers description of sandford his manner of speaking varied from those before described his voice was acute and had a piercing tone which scruck every syllable distinctly upon the ear and in his look he marked to an audience what he thought worth more thon their ordinary notice had he lived in shakespeares time i am confident his judgment must have chose him to have played richard ill for without considering his person he had an unouth stateliness in his motion a harsh sullen pride in his speech a meditating brow a stern aspect occasionally changing into an almost ldicrous triumph over goodness and virtue from thence falling into a most assuasive sullenness and soothing candoar of a designing heart  this actor mr c cibber inmated closely and hit his manner so true in richard the third that sir john vanbrugh said on his playing that part  you have his very look gait and speech and every motion of him and have borrowed them all only to serve you in that character  they who remember mr cibber in that part have a copy of sandsord   ex pede herculem  to describe the low comedians mr cibber makes a peculiar apology yet thus after it is over he goes on  vide c cibbers apology p    nkes had a genius different from any read heard of or seen since or before his time his excellence a plain palpable simplicity of nature that he was as unaccountably diverting in his common speech as on the the stage this simplicity so easy to nokes no one could ever catch leigh and underhill have been well copied though not equaled by others but not all the mimical skill of estcourt nor my own could reach the vis comica of nokes though i never saw an actor beside himself whom i could not at least so far imitate as to give a more than tolerable notion of his manner  the characters he shone in were sir martin marall gomez in the spanish friar sir nicholas cully in love in a tub sofia in the amphitrion etc etc etc  this was the effect of his action he never entered the stage but he was received with an involuntary applause not by hands for they might be prostituted and bespoken but by a laughter which if bespoken could not be prostituted which his sight provoked and nature could not resist  his person was of the middle size his voice clear his natural countenance grave and sober when he spoke that seriousness of joakery was discharged and a dry drolling levity took such full possession of him that i can only refer the idea of him to your imagination in his low characters that became it he had a shuffling shame in his gait with so contented an ignorance in his aspect and awkward absurdity in his gesture that had you not known him you could not have believed he had a grain of common sense in a word i am tempted to sum up the character of nokes as a comedian in a parody of what shakespeares mark antony says of brutus as a hero  his life was laughter and the ludicrous so mixed in him that nature might stand up and say to all the world  this was an actor leigh was of the mercurial kind not a strict imitator of nature yet not so wanton in his performance as to be wholly out of her sight in humor he loved to take a full career but was careful to stop short when just upon the precipice he so excelled in the spanish fyar that the duke of dorset had his picture drawn in a whole length in that character by kneller and the whole portrait is extremely like him he was much admired by king charles who used to call him his actor  he died of the fever a week after montford in december       underhill was a natural comedian whose excellence lay in characters of still life the stiff the heavy and the stupid in some of these he looked as if it were not in the power of human passions to alter a feature of them a countenance of wood could not be more fixed than his when the blockhead of a character required it his face was full and long from his crown to end of his nose was the shorter half of it so that the disproportion of his lower features when soberly composed with an unwandering eye hanging over them threw him into the most lumpish moping mortal that ever made beholders merry not but at other times he could be awakened into spirit equally ridiculous  in the coase rustic humor of justice clodpole in epsom wells he was a delightful brue his age obliged him to leave the stage some years before he died he appeared once indeed in a part he had been famous for the gravedigger in hamlet but ceasing to be what he had been his infirmities were dismissed with pity he soon after died a superannuated pensioner of the theater thus far mr c cibber  the characters of these actors are an extract from the apology of mr c cibber and were the impressions he received in his youth how far he may or may not entertain a prejudice from thence i shall not here examine they might be so very excellent as he says of betterion to excel themselves but might not as great descriptions be given of the chief performers in heart and mouns company by some other historian or might not some modern history give much such characters of our present actors who are most in vogue with the town surely such an attempt might not regret the present or the future reader i shall therefore in a future chapter undertake so bold a province though the flatness of my characters may be unequal to those of the great apologist which are said to be of the prosound sublime the same liberty which i have taken with mr cibbers gentlemen i shall take with his ladies and for the same reason i have before given after saying powell verbruggen and williams were not worth speaking of he comes to  mrs barry who was in possession of most of the chief parts of tragedy how she excelled in them you may judge from mr drydens saying in his preface to cleomenes she had gained a reputation beyond any woman he had seen on the stage which mr cibber corroborates with his own judgment mrs barry it seems did not arrive at this maturity of power and judgment till she was more than a little past her youth whence our apologist observes that the short life of beauty is not long enough to form a complete actress the fame mrs barry arrived to is a proof of the difficulty in judging with certainty whether any young people will ever make any great figure in a theater for mrs barry was discharged at the end of the year as an useless expense mrs oldfield had been above a year before she gave any hope of her being an actress so unlike to all manner of propriety was her speaking but however both made themselves complete mistresses of their art by the prevalence of their understanding  mrs barry in characters of greatness had a presence of elevated dignity her mein and motion superb and gracefully majestic her voice full clear and strong so that no violence of passion could be too much for her and when distress or tenderness possessed her she subsided into the most affecting melody and softness of the former of these excellencies she gave the most delightful prooss in all the heroic plays of dryden and lee and in the latter in the softer passions of otways monimia and belvidera in scenes of anger defiance and resentment while she was impetuous and terrible she poured out the sentiment with enchanting harmony she was the first person whose merit was distinguished by the indulgence of having an annual benefit play which was granted to her in king james the  ds time and became not in common to others till the division of the company after the death of king williams queen mary this great actress died toward the latter end of queen ann the year says our historian you may guess at by an expression which fell from her in blank verse when she was delirious  ha ha and so they make us lords by dozens mrs betterton was in the year    0 when mr cibber senior first came upon the stage far advanced in years yet so great a mistress of nature that even mrs barry who acted lady macbeth after her could not in that part with her superior strength and melody of voice throw out those quick and careful strokes of terror from the disorder of a guilty mind which the other gave us with a facility in her manner that rendered them at once tremendous and delightful time could not impair her skill though it had brought her person to decay she was to the last the admiration of all true judges of nature and shakespeare in whose plays she chiefly excelled without a rival she was a woman of an unblemished sober life and had the honor to teach queen anne when princess the part of semandra in mithidates which she acted at court in k  g charless time after the death of mr  her husband that princess when quen ordered her a pension for life but she lived not to receive but one half year of it  mrs leigh the wife of mr leigh the comedian beforementioned had a droll way of dressing the pretty folbles of superannuated beauties she had in herself a good deal of humor and knew how to infuse it into the affected mothers aunts and affected stae maids that had missed their market in these she was extremely entertaining and painted in a lively manner the blind side of nature  mrs butler was recommended to the stage by king charles she was the daughter of a decayed knight and proved a good actress and was besides in those days allowed to sing and dance in perfection in speaking her sweettond voice with her naturally genteel air and her sensible pronunciation rendered her wholly mistress of the amiable in many serious characters in parts of humor she had a manner of blending her assuasive softness even with the gay the lively and alluring as in the second constantia in the chances in which mrs oldfields lively performance did not equal ers she having only  0 shillings a week and being denied the addition of ten more she went with mr ashbury to dublin who offered her any conditions  mrs montford whose second marriage gave her the name of verbruggen was a mistress of more variety of humor than i ever knew in any one woman actress this variety was attended with equal vivacity which made her excellent in characters extremely different nothing though ever so barren if within the bounds of nature could be flat in her hands she was fond of humor in what low part sver found and would make no scruple of defacing her fair form to come heartily into it for when she was eminent in several desirable characters of wit and humor she would descend from high life into low characters with as much fancy as when triumphing in all the airs and vain grces of a fine lady in a play of durfeys called the western lass which part she acted she transformed her whole being body shape voice language look and features into almost another animal with a strong devonshire dialect a broad laughing voice a poking head round shoulders an unconceiving eye and the most bedizzning dowdy dress that ever covered the untraind limbs of a joan troit to have seen her here you would have thought it had been impossible the same creature could ever have been recovered to what was easy to her the gay the lively and desirable nor was her humor limited to her sex for while her shape permitted she was a more adroit she was thought so excellent in these characters and drss that mr southern wrote the comedy called sir anthony love which character she performed on purpose for her pretty fellow than is usually seen upon the stage her easy air action mein quite changed from the coif to the cocked hat and cavalier in fashion people were so fond of seeing her a man that when the part of bays in the rehearsal had for some time lain dormant she was desired to take it up which she acted with all true coxcombly spirit and humor that the sufficiency of the character required  after an apology which the apologist makes for describing mrs bracegirdle now living he introduces her into his apology which is sufficient authority for me to give an abstract of that paragraph in mine  mrs bracegirdle was now    0 blooming to her maturity her reputation as an actress gradually rising with that of her person never was any woman in such general favor which to the last scene of dramatick life she maintained by not being unguarded in her private character  this discretion made her the cara the darling of the theater she had indeed no greater claim to beauty than the most desirable brunette might pretend to but her youth and lively aspect threw out such a glow of health and cheerfulness that on the stage few spectators that were not past it could behold her without desire in all the chief parts she acted the desirable was so predminant that no judge could be cold enough to consider from what other particular excellence she became delightful  to speak critically of an actress extremely good were as hazardous as to be positive in ones opinion of the best opera singer we can only appeal to taste and of taste there can be no disputing i shall therefore only say that most eminent authors always chose her for their favorite character and shall leave that proof of her merit to its own value  she retired from the stage in the height of her favor when most of her cotemporaries she was bred up with were declining in the year    0 she played once after the part of angelica in love for love for the benefit of her old friend mrs betterton  here mr colley cibber closes his account of these memorable actors of which i have given a quotation of great fidelity as to the matter of fact chiefly contained but many are the prettinesses daintinesses rhetorical flowers vivisying images floods of fine language and rapidities of wit which are all like his clear emanation of beauty they strike you into a regard that has something different from respect as i am so greatly indebted to him for this chapter i shall follow my old way and till we settle accounts still run myself more into his books therefore what he says from his word to the critical auditors i will borrow a  or two and then again digress to myself  ths account may inform or assist the judgment of uture spectators it may be of service to their public entertainment for as their hearers are so will the actors be worse or better as true or false taste applauds or discommends them hence only can our theaters improve or must degenerate yet there is another point which i recommend to the consideration which is that the extreme severity with which they damn a bad play seems so terrible a warning to those whose untried genius might hereafter give them a good one but the vivacity of our modern critics is of late grown so riotous an unsuccessful author has no more mercy shown him than a notorious cheat in the pillory every fool the lowest member of the mob becomes a wit  this is the case while the theater is so turbulent a sea and so infested with pirates what poetical merchant of any substance would venture to trade in it in a word these critics seem to me like the lions whelps in the tower who are so boisterously gamesome at their meals they dash down their bowls of milk brought for their own breakfast  i have a word also to give to these critical auditors these lioncubs these pirates in our seas but that will fall more naturally in some subsequent chapter  chap vi a state of the stage continued having resolved to make these memoirs in some manner contain the utile dulci what by abstracts from mr cibbers history and what by my own history the readers will find a succinct account of the stage from the year    0 to    0 i shall not indeed prove so descanting an author as that great man yet my compendious breviary may be of some use and entertainment of his elaborate lucubrations mine are but an epitome let him be the trogus pompeius of the stage i am contented to be the justinus  i am now entering into that part of the history where the theater fell frequently in labor of revolutions in    0 the stage was under the government of united patentees who had under them so complete a set of actors as has been described yet they were weak enough or the taste of the public was so weak as to force them to it to exhibit spectacle and the expenses they were at in dioclesian and king arthur though seemingly successful were so great that they run into debt which found work for the court of chancery twenty years following these exhibitions of spectacle made plays of course neglected actors hold cheap and slightly dressed while singers and dancers were better paid and embroidered these measures of course created murmurings on one side and ill humor and contempt on the other when it became necessary to lessen the charge resolution was taken to begin with the players salaries nokes montford and leigh all died this same year yet they chose rather to distress the surviving actors than encourage them to bring this about some of bettertons parts were given to powell and some of mrs barrys to mrs bracegirdle  powell accepted bettertons but mrs bracegirdle denied barrys betterton on this formed one assciation and the patentees another during these contentions treaties of peace were offered by the actors but haughtily refused by the other the public naturally more bassd to the actors whom they see and are pleased by than patentees whom they never see supported their interest and persons of the highest distinction entertained the king in his circle about affairs of the theater about this time queen mary died and on such occasion all public diversions cease betterton and his adherents had now leisure to solicit redress and collected a company the patentees being forced to acept such actors as were the leavings of betterton on this the patentees engaged powell and verbrggn and raised them from two to four pounds a week and besides the other leavings were mr c cibber yet they were forced to recruit and beat up for volunteers in distant counties which brought johnson and bullck into the service of the theater royal forces thus raised they opened the campaign betterton by subscription at the lincolnsinnfields tenniscourt the panees at drury lane who took the field first mr ciber writing their opening prologue having no better poet that memorable day being as he says the day his muse brought forth her first fruit that was ever made public how good or how bad imports not but he received for it two guineas not being suffered to speak it himself the patentees went on but lamely against the new colony of actors who were like the commonwealth of holland divided from the tyranny of spain  but the simile according to the apologist is but very little farther a simile for they found in a short time they were never worse governed than when governed by themselves they began to consult private interest more than the general good and though some deserence was paid to betterton several wanted to govern in their turns  c cibbers apology but is not the same infirmity in states  dogget could not with patience look on the costly trains and plumes of tragedy in which knowing himself to be useless he though a vain extravagance which when he could not oppose he came over to drury lane  bettertons company began at last to lose ground nor was drury lane company in very great prosperity yet the patentees had found out a remedy against a thin house viz ditto p     never to pay their people when the money did not come in nor then neither but in such proportion as suited their convenience  such was the fortune of both companies when our mr r  b father of the present master of c  garden theater master who had practiced the law and therefore loved a storm better than fair weather thinking the quality rather preferred the other company than ours resolved to ingratiate himself with their domestics and opened a gallery for the footmen gratis who were never before admitted into it till the fourth act was over this he thought would get us a good word in their respective families and incite them to come all hands aloft into the crack of our applauses hence arose this custom which ripened into right and became the most disgraceful nuisance that ever depreciated a theater  about this time mr wilks came from the dubin company to drury lane theater he first commenced an actor by performing in a private play at dublin of which country he was a native he had been on drury lane stage before but qutted it to go to ireland not rising n parts there according to his ambition on his return in      montford was dead and powell in his chief parts and the only actor that stood in wilkss way they soon became avowed rivals and without quoting their every quarrel for parts be it sufficient to say that wilks by industry care and sobriety gained the favor of the public which powell with more merit by his neglect and intemperance forseited  on this narration the apologist observes that an actor is disesteemed or favored on the stage more or less according as he has or has not a due regard to his private life and reputation nay false reports shall affect him and become the cause or pretense of using him injuriously he gives this instance in regard to himself   c cibrs apology p     after the success of the beggars opera i was so stupid to attempt the following year something of the same kind on a quite different foundation to recommend virtue and innocence my newfangled performance was called love in a riddle and was as vilely damned and hooted at as so vain a presumption in the idle cause of virtue could deserve i will grant the beggars opera had more skilfully gratified the public taste than all the brightest authors before him the same author wrote a second part to his beggars opera and transported his hero beyond sea but this was forbid to come on the stage soon after this prohibition my performance was to come on the stage great umbrage was taken that i was permitted to have the whole town to mself by this absolute forbiddance of what they had more mind to be entertained with and some days before my bawble was acted i was informed a strong party would be made against it a report it seems had ran against me that to make success for my own play i had privately found means or interest that the second part of the beggars opera should be suppressed as if i a comedian had been of consequence enough to influence a great officer of state to rob the public of an innocent diversion if it were such that none but that cunning comedian might entertain them  but against blind malice and staring inhumanity whatever is upon the stage has no defense there they knew i stood helpless and exposed  i had not considered poor devil that from the security of a full pit dunces might become wits cowards valiant and prentices gentlemen whether such were concerned in the murder of my play i am not certain i never endeavored to discover any of my assassins i cannot afford them a better name from their unmanly manner of destroying it it faintly held up its wounded head till the second day and would have spoke for mercy but was not suffered the presence of the royal heir apparent could not protect it i therefore to stop their clamor quitted the actor for the author and told them that since they were not inclined this play should go farther i gave them my word that after this night it should never be acted again but that in the mean time i hoped they would consider in whose presence they were and for that reason at least would suspend what farther marks of displeasure they might think i had deserved  after a dead silence and some little pause some few hands signified their approbation  when the play went on i observed about a dozen persons of no extraordinary appearance sullenly walked out of the pit after which every scene of it met with applause  but it came too late peace to its manes now though this was the only tumult that i had known to have been so effectually appeased in fifty years by any thing that could be said to an audience in the same humor yet it was no merit in me because when like me you submit to their doing you all the mischief they can they will at any time be satisfied  i have been more particular in the length of this question as it contains a curious anecdote on damning love in a riddle and carries this moral that a suspicion of an actors doing a base action may lay him open to very severe and unjust punishments from an audience this unjust treatment not three seasons ago became a certain actors fortune to meet the affair was of a private nature and therefore was thought a public audience had no right to take it under their cognizance the affair was this  there was a certain lady  a very fine lady  to whom an actor was once so fatally allied that the law gave her a privilege to call him husband  husband  o fatal name this lady was young beautiful sensible and virtuous when this actor fell in love with her she had appeared on the stage as a singer and was esteemed an admirable one this actor who was at that time at the head of the theatric revolution which brought back the old drury lane actors to their old house at drury lane thought this young woman had so much of the amiable and virtuous in her that without any other consideration made her his wife what connubial love and harmony subsisted sometime between them those only can judge of whose hearts have felt the inexpressible delights of a sincere and mutual union  but alas how short is all human happiness  the lady began to grow more cool in her affections to her husband than her duty her honor or her interest ought to have suffered her  her heart was estranged and foreign inclinations contaminated her soul  what can be said when so much innocence should plunge suddenly and rashly into vice  but alas  frailty thy name is woman this domestic unhappiness of the actor brought on others negligent of every thing his affairs grew worse and he was at last compelled to banish himself to another kingdom till measures were taken to make his creditors easy during his absence this bad woman carried on a correspondence of the most criminal nature and spread every false report to injure him in the tenderest point his honor that witty malice could invent or the damnedst fiend perpetrate it was reported her husband was not only privy to but the willing procuring pandering promoter of her crimes and his own infamy  good god  what will not iniquity suggest and uncharitableness believe  although  vide motto to letters from a husband to a wife etc published by mr t c it is a kind of slander to trust rumor yet this vile notion too far prevailed as you will immediately see  the season of acting was now pretty far advanced and this actor as returned to his employment was to do his duty and get his livelihood at the theater the night came on he was to appear and though it had been bruited about the town that because he was a willing cuckold there was a very virtuous party formed to drive him off the stage and not suffer him to appear again he paid little regard to this rumor conscious of his innocence but the poor devil found himself mistaken the house was very early crowded and the harmonious discordant concert of catcals whistle etc etc began to play before the curtain drew up  well  though the actors were all frightened the play began with calmness and applause but this was only a prelude to the battle when the scene came in which he was to appear there was a dead silence till he poppd his poor head from behind the scenes then at once the hurleyburley began volleys of apples and potatoes and such vile trash flew about his ears he retired the storm subsided he advanced it began again  in the most humble gesture and address he made a motion to be heard it was all in vain and he was once more pelted off  but what can describe in those dreadful moments the anguish of his heart who can conceive the various agitations of his soul  grief rage resentment horror despair mixed with resolution were all at once fermenting in his bosom  but determined to go through the play he went through it amidst the greatest uproar that ever was heard so long a space in a theater and by a confident heart he surmounted what many of less resolution would have sunk under  for some time after every joke in a part he himself spoke or if when he was on the stage any thing was said that alluded to cuckoldom the joke was made allusive to him and the audience had their laugh this could be born and he knew it would die away of itself but on a trial in relation to his wifes infamy something gave offense to a noble c mret  n colonel in the army who to revenge a supposed affront raised a posse against the actor and from the boxes began a new attack and were determined he should appear no more on the stage till he had given the gentleman satisfaction by making a public recantation all attempts were made to get over this some of the royal family came but their presence was not thought of sanction enough to curb the insolence of some people and an obscure thing of an actor performing his part he was at last forced out of prudential reasons not from any conviction of his error to give the colonel the satisfaction of a public recantation and so that affair dropped  i could enumerate several other instances of my own where my private conduct and character have laid me under a public censure but as the two instances i have quoted are the most material and fresh in every ones memory they may be thought sufficient to prove that the public or rather some of the public will assume a liberty over a players private life and actions  but now reader let your memory return some page or two back and to carry on a connection remember the reason why wilks gained a superiority over powell c cibbers apology p     there are other instances says the apologetical historian of the reward and favor which in a theater diligence and sbriety seldom fail mills the elder grew into the friendship of wilks with not a great deal more than their useful qualities to recommend him with this assiduity and this friendship he was advanced to a larger salary than any manactor during my time on the stage the contempt and distresses of powel struck booth with such a terror of his example that though he had been a frank lover of his bottle he immediately reformed for which both in his fame and fortune he enjoyed the reward and benefit  i must here add a living instance of what care and indefatigable industry will do the younger mills not to take from him the merit he has is not equal to the late mr mills when he was a young actor he followed his fathers steps and being endowed with a prodigious memory would get parts of very great length which then he had not a distant view of ever performing this talent and his application to his business made him in a course of time become useful which in a theater is the best recommendation on his succeeding to many of mr wilkss parts the town looked on him in a very indifferent light but his being always thoroughly perfect and improving by encouragement and application many prejudices insensibly wore away and now he is seen in mr wilkss parts not without approbation  i must here speak of myself when i first came on the stage the town had very little hopes of me nor did i fling out the proffer of any great genius yet i was industrious and observant of my business on the stage and did all in my power to become any way useful i remember that for want of a better performer i undertook to be the harlequin and as few knew who it really was i was received with more applause than i could have imagined sufficient enough if i had not had an inborn contempt for such mummery to have raised my vanity nor was this my only success in pantomime every one who remembers doctor faustus at drury lane must remember the statue all the pantomimical motions of this magic statue had a good effect in that scene they surpised they elevated they pleased and were applauded i had the honor to animate that statue yet as the applause i received was false i received it not as a tribute to the merit of an actor but the tricks of a scaramouch or sadlers wells tumbler as i had set my father and other first rate actors for my exemplar before my eyes i had ambition enough to attempt their parts and say to posterity  exegi monumentum aere perennius i have from this principle all along pushed forward for the goal of theatric fame and throughout my character as an actor have kept to the sibi constet for what other failures and follies soever i might be guilty propria persona yet in my persona personata on the stage i have done every endeavor to please nor can my enemies say that i ever came before an audience imperfect or inebriated if i have sometimes mistook my talents and appeared in characters to which i was unequal i hope and believe the candor of the town will excuse that ambition if in some others i give them any pleasure  to digress from this apology to my theatric chronological history to understand which after so many intervening paragraphs see the succinct account from    0 to      the king and dukes companies had various fortunes till they united after that the actors characters in    0 are given a revolution happened again in      and after various changes of theatric ministers stage cabals patentee oppressions too numerous to be extracted from mr c cibbers history as they consist chiefly of chitchat and lamusements and gayete de ceur they united at the union c cibbers apology    hold let me see  ay it was so i am right in my chronology for the play of hamlet being played soon after estionst who then took upon him to say any thing added a fourth line to shakespeares prologue to the play in that play which originally consisted but of three but estionst made it run thus  for us and for our tragedy  thus stooping to your clemency  this being a year of unity we beg your hearing patiently the private policies lawsuits conversations etc etc etc i pass over and come to the patent which was granted to mr colley cibber mr wilks mr booth and sir richard steel after the accession of his late majesty not only for the reason i mentioned before but because i have much to say in my own history of the same kind on those subjects in which i was the vide c cibbers account of wilks bustle mastergeneral as wilks had been some few years before and if in my relations there are any close resemblances of passages to mr cibbers apology i shall continue to quote them to illustrate mine as i before promised  well then in the year      the patent was given whereby the stage came under the sole management of three actors and a gentleman who had long been acquainted with theatric affairs under this auspicious triumvirate a new theatric golden age arose  redeunt saturnia regna an acting author now was a judge of dramatic authors  tuus jam regnat apollo oh ye gods give me give me this great boon that i over bards may rule and rule alone then may i follow my great examplar   passibus aequis o mihi tam longae maneat pars ultima vitae spiritus and quantum sat erit mea dicere facta non me carminibus etc quo me bacche rapis tui plenus etc gentle reader you will excuse this rhapsody when i tell you i am writing it at one oclock this morning the  0th of may    0 after hearing something relating to drury lane of which you may hear more hereafter but to the patenteeactors let us turn our view they had now gained all they wished for as to their power and management at drury lane but at the same time the present mr richs house in lincolnsinnfields was opened which not only terrified the managers at drury lane but was in fact for a great time a drawback to their profits however both patents have since subsisted a company with various fortune i find nothing after of any consequence in the theatric history worthy of notice during the triumvirate they long went forward in a settled course of prosperity which mr cibber attributes to their  c cibbers apology visible errors of former managements from them they at last found the necessary means to bring our private laws and orders into a general observance and approbation of our society diligence and neglect were under an equal eye the one never failed of its reward and the other by being rarely excused was less frequently committed  yet sure there must be some partiality in these menagers and some jealousy of young actors for several whom they slighted became at the other stage good actors and were in high esteem with a great part of the town and several in their own house have since been thought excellent who in their menagement seldom or ever appeared but appearance as well as applause is the warm weather of a theatrical plant this observation and several others will show that i write as an historian ought without favor or affection  one reformation which the apologist and his corulers introduced deserves attention as the present stages stand in need of such another   ditto among other necessary reformations says he what not a little preserved to us the regard of our auditors was the decency of our clear stage from whence we had many years shut out those idle gentlemen who seemed more delighted to be pretty objects themselves than capable of any pleasure from the play who took their daily stands where they might best elbow the actor and come in for their share of the auditors attention in many a labored scene of the warmest humor and of the most affecting passion have i seen the best actors disconcerted while these buzzing muscatoes have been fluttering round their eyes and ears how was it possible an actor so embarrassd should keep his impatience from entering into that different temper which his personated character might require him to be master of  this nuisance of having crowds behind our scenes is now as intolerable as ever both to the judicious spectator and careful player and nothing but the auri sacra fames of the managers would induce them to indulge such an abuse of the stage they may say indeed it has been so long a custom that young gentlemen of distinction will not be denied nor is it their interest to deny them  pray good master manager let me ask you a question  will a dozen crowns compensate the affront given to a whole audience of a hundred or a hundred and fifty pounds will or can a few young men of quality support your interest like the ladies in the boxes the gentlemen of the inns of court in the pit or the more grave citizens in the first gallery  well but you answer if such a custom was now denied there would be uproars in the house which of late have been of such fatal consequence that it would be dangerous to hazard them again  that might be sirs as your conduct proved it has been experienced if you give proper notice to the town none will be admited behind the scenes and your servants execute those orders with the greatest complaisance yet determined resolution the evil might be soon remedied as it is an evil which no pretense can defend and all the town will support an alteration of the spectators would think themselves injured as well as you and the town very lately supported a manager in suppressing another nuisance the noisy insolence and impertinence of the footmen in short were they resolved to give up a few pecuniary pittances they might in a week keep the scenes as clear from these squirts and puffs of foplings as ever besides as ars est celare artem it would be politic not to let them see the backside of our tapestry for many an actor and actress may seem but ordinary stuff on strict examination who from a front prospect on the stage may seem very well mr rich indeed when his own important action is depending has some regard to this rule and the scenes are kept clear because persons then admitted might impede the scenery and the beaus and impertinents are satisfied with this reason  is not then the reason the same in relation to the actors and the scenery of a play as to a pantomime  res ipsa loquitur  this nuisance is besides a disencouragement to an actors performance for when all who appear well dressed are admitted behind the scenes may it not as it has sometimes happened give an opportunity to a monster dire hated by gods and men a catchpole called under this form to touch with magic spell the shoulder blade of some plumed buskined hero and  o vile shame  compulsive force him into durance base where by coercive power he is restrained till bail of manager shall set him free  such apprehensions must alarm an actor who may not be the best oeconomist and i am sure i have often seen faces that have given me the palpitation of the heart  mr cibber complains justly of another distress the managers of a theater are under which as i have myself experienced when i was the deputed manager for summer companies at drury lane and a real one at the theater in the haymarket i shall consider this particular there is no greater persecution in the government of a playhouse than the persecution of bad authors the managers think their case hard and the authors think so of theirs indeed it would move pity when an ingenious indigent has been laboring invita minerva to heap up a pile of stuff which he calls poetry and to depend on it for more months support than he has been scribbling it yet after all to find it rejected but though rejected in the mildest manner and for the justest cause yet the manager must fall under severe censure and can have no taste for good writing nor knows what is sense he must be a blockhead convict out comes an epigram or a satire and we are stigmatized as fools because we will not exhibit a piece which we are sure we must loose by but pray if we have pity for a gentlemans circumstances is our good nature to carry us such lengths as will injure ourselves no charity begins at home and i see no reason why a theatrical trader should not have the same privilege as his majestys other liege subjects in trade to buy or refuse what he pleases the managers ought to be allowed this liberty of judging plays etc before they are brought on the stage for when they are brought on the audience will claim the freedom of judging of them as they think proper they damn many which are brought on but they would have nothing else to do the year throughout were the managers of a theater to exhibit all the theatrical lumber which is brought to them to give a refusal to these sparks is difficult and practiced differently by different persons mr wilks would show the utmost complaisance on these occasions and by paying the author compliments on his piece that there were many pretty things in it but it would not do as it stood then or that it might be altered for the better by this i say he soothed the poets anger who though he went not away satisfied did not go away enraged mr c cibber was more short he returned a piece with it is not fit for our stage sir it is not theatrical  mr rich is more laconic still for he only says or writes  it will not do  mr fletewood took a different way from them all he being a gentleman of rank by birth piqud himself on treating authors as gentlemen he would see them excuse his not having had time to peruse their pieces treat them with great deference and desire them to call again  though this was a wrong method and gave him much unnecessay trouble yet courtierlike he was pleased with a great number of dependants to all of whom he gave as much favor as he could and when he had kept them in suspense sometimes too long he dismissed them with much complaisance and good nature  as for myself on such occasions i followed my fathers track if i read a piece and found it was not theatrical i returned it to the author and told him so roundly perhaps the spark with a mifty air walked off and wrote against me but what cared i   demens judicio vulgi sanus meo but the most pleasant way of returning an author a refused play was that of quins this anecdote is worth relating when mr james quin was a managing  under mr rich at lincolnsinnfields he had a  heap of plays brought him which he put in a drawer in his beauroe an author had given him a play behind the scenes which i suppose he might lose or mislay not troubling his head about it two or three days after mr bays waited on him to know how he liked his play quin told him some excuse for its not being received and the author desired to have it returned  there says quin there it lies on that table  the author took up a play that was lying on a table but on opning found it was a comedy and his was a tragdy and told quin the mistake  faith then sir said he i have lost your play  lost my play cries the bard  yes by g  d i have answered the tragedian but here is a drawer full of both comedies and tragedies take any two you will in the room of it  the poet left him in high dudgeon and the hero stalked across the room to his spaw water and rhenish with a negligent felicity  but to drop the cutrain of this chapter which shall close with mr cibbers last speech   c cibbers apology p     during our last four years there happened so very little like what has been said before that i shall conclude with barely mentioning those unavoidable accidents that drew on our dissolution the first that for some years had led me the way to greater was the continued ill state of health which rendered booth incapable of appearing on the stage the next was the death of mrs oldfield which happened on the   d of october    0 about the same time mrs porter then in her highest reputation for tragedy was lost to us by the misfortune of a dislocated limb from the overturning of a chaise and our last stroke was the death of wilks in september the year following       notwithstanding such irreparable losses whether when these favorite actors were no more to be had their successors might not be better born with than they could possibly have been while the other were in being or that the generality of spectators from their want of taste were easier to be pleased than the few that knew better or that at worst our actors were still preferable to any other company of the several then subsisting or to whatever cause it might be imputed our audiences were far less abated than our apprehensions had suggested so that though it began to grow late in life with me having still health and strength enough to have been as useful on the stage as ever i was under no visible necessity of quitting it but so it happened that our surviving fraternity having got some chimaerical and as i thought unjust notions into their heads which though i knew they were without much difficulty to be surmounted i chose not at my time of day to enter into new contentions and as i found an inclination in some of them to purchase the whole power of the patent into their own hands i did my best while i stayed with them to make it worth their while to come up to my price and then patiently sold out my share to the first bidder wishing the crew i had left in the vessel a good voyage  what commotions the stage sell into the year following or from what provocations the greatest part of the actors revolted and set up for themselves in the little theater in the haymarket lies not within the province of my title page to relate or as it might set some persons living in a light they might possibly not choose to be seen in i will be rather thankful for the involuntary favor they have done me than trouble the public with private complaints of fancied or real injuries  thus ends mr colley cibbers history of his own times and from this era i shall as a supplement to his apology continue mine the view of the stage for nine years past in which i have had a large share of action may seem a proper appendix to his more copious and laborious history  but before i conclude this chapter i must do justice to another compendiary historian old downs the prompter who has given the characters of the actors in   0  the year of the union there is a particuliarity in his style and manner and a turgid pompousness in his epithets yet it is not to be wondered at having been so many years conversant with theatric phrases and elevated elocution his style nor manner are not copious and digressive as that of mr colley cibber yet there is a something in it by which the judicious reader will discern some affinity of genius take his characters in their own order and orthography  mr wilks proper and comely in person of graceful port mein and air void of affectation his elevations and cadences just congruent to elocution especially in genteel comedy not inferior in tragedy the emission of his words free easy and natural attracting attentive silence in his audience i mean the judicious except were there are unnatural parts as   i will mount the sky and kick the gods like footbals as i fly as poet durfey has it which puts the voice to such obstraperous stretch requires the lungs of a smiths bellows to reach he is indeed the finished copy of his famous predecessor mr heart  mr cibber a gentleman of his time ha arrived to an exceeding perfection in hitting justly the humor of a starched bea or fop to the lord foppington sir fopling and sir courtly equaling in the last the late eminent mr mounford not much inferior in tragedy had nature given him lungs strenuous to his finished judgment  mr estcourt histrio natus he has the honor nature endowing him with an easy free unaffected mode of elocution in comedy always to laetificate his audience especially quality witness sergeant kyte he is not excellent only in that but a superlative mimick  mr booth a gentleman of liberal education of form venust of mellifluent pronunciation having proper gesticulations which are graceful attendants to true elocution of his time a most complete tragedian  mr johnson he is skilful in the art of painting which is a great adjument very promovent to the art of true elocution which is all requirable in him that bears the name of an actor he has the happiness to gain applause from court and city witness morose corbacchio mr hothead and several others he is a true copy of mr underhill whom sir william davenant judged  0 years ago in lincolnsinnfields the truest comedian in his company  mr dogget on the stage he is very aspectabund wearing a farce in his face his thoughts deliberately framing his utterance congruous to his looks he is the only comic original now extant  mr pinkethman he is the darling of fortunatus has gained more at the theaters and fairs in twelve years than those that has tugd at the oar of acting these  0  next mr mills mr powel mr bullock the two first excel in tragedy the other in comedy  i must not omit praises due to mr betterton the first and now only remain of the old stock of the company of sir william davenant in lincolnsinnfields he like an old stately spreading oak now stands fixed environed round with brave young growing flourishing plants  mr dryden a little before his death rendring him this praise he like the setting sun still shoots a glimmering ray like ancient rome majestic in decay having through this historic narrative rather made use of history already compiled than wrote my own the next scenes will open with great events in which i was a principal actor what a kind of a part i play or how well i performed it i must submit as i ever shall all my other theatrical actions to the censure or approbation of the public  chap vii the authors ambition in the remarkable year  0  his commencing author the reasons for it the author and alexander compared mr colley cibber privately takes away king john from drury lane theater  the authors speech as a theatrical patriot  the drury lane company rvolt from highmore and go to the haymarket the at of parlment for licensing the stage considered by the author a mr colley cibber  reflectins on the author  pasquin  a theatrical state secret  the theater has with humor and propriety been compared to a political state but the nature of its government has never been fixed some affirm the natural constitution of a theater is a republic some say it is a limited others an unlimited monarchy what is the best or what the original form of government was or what future kind of government it may have the most shrewd theatric politician cannot affirm whatever my notions may be as to national government yet as to a theatrical state i must ingenuously confess myself antimonarchical i am for a government by a few a triumvirate and i will tell you roundly reader my reason the stage never succeeded better than under the triumvirate and as i can never be a sole monarch this is the best form i can think of which would give me power equal to a monarch though not the titular honor for my copartners in empire should be little more than ciphers gnifying roundly nothing they might indeed be triumvirs but then like duke trincalo in the play i would triumvir over them this may seem too vain a conjecture of my own parts and too vain a contempt of the understanding of others but in the sequel of this story you will find that as i was the bustlemaster general i was also the commandergeneral and treatymaster general if with all these commissions i could not secure to myself as much or more power than most monarchs in fact have i ought to be stigmatized for the errantest dolt that ever pretended to machiavelism  but after this proaemium let me introduce matters of fact for which it will be necessary to premise some few things regarding myself before the triumvirate was dissolved and mr colley cibber sold his share in the patent as they will the better connect what relations observations contemplations ruminations quotations and argumentations which may ensue  from the little hopes which the public conceived of me as an actor who would make any figure by industry application and what joined to them is  the all in all genius i rose into a gradual esteem of the town but lest my significance as an actor should not be glaring enough i was resolved young as i was at a time when the whole nation was in a bustle to make my share in it in the year    0 when all men thought of raising estates and bubbling the world out of what money they could i had a violent ambition of getting much money and making much noise would you think it but i will confess the simplicity of my heart i thought then that were i a south sea director that i would do  ye gods  what i would do but as i was resolved i was to act something adventrous within my sphere and unlike the other projectors i built my scheme on a valuable foundation and according to city phrase i had the credit of the best man in england to make use of in short as all were commencing great men i was resolved to commence author and accordingly altered a play of shakespeares and had it brought on the stage nor was the success of it much unequal to my hopes this indeed was thought striking a bold stroke to alter shakespeare was a task that some persons merely bigoted to antiquity shudderd at the name they calling it sacrificing violating affronting and i dont know what the manes of that bard but sure all unprejudiced persons will not deny that some historical plays of shakespeare want what we now call jeau de theater that is a  a  something necessary to make shakespeare be more more in brief more jeu de theater my parental exemplar had altered richard the iiid before that is he had culled the flowers of two or three plays and had bunchd them up into a nosegay for the devil a line did he write himself some indeed he altered but some say for the worse in this manner i altered henry the sixth and that the present and future age might know that i had altered it i printed it with my own name in capital letters in the title page this is mentioned to show that i did patrassare in my first setting out in a theater but here i allow non passibus aequis from this instance however the public saw there was some spirit of audacity and the dawn of genius in me from this notable era i became more singularly remarkable both on and off the stage i had some few small parts given me in which i succeeded beyond expectation but as by this time i knew so much of a theater that i was sensible original parts made the strongest influence in the audience i endeavored to get all the little sprightly or humourous parts which i thought i could hit the first in which i was more particularly taken notice of was the country footboy in the conscious lovers the part was but a few lines yet i without affectation say that i struck in to the aukwardlypert cunning of such an unlickd cub so naturally that i had as many claps as speeches i valued not the length of a part so much as its humor and if i had applause when i was on the stage i was better satisfied than being on the stage longer and having no applause at all other young actors of the house thought in regard to me what wilks and powel did as to mr cibber sen  coiley cibbers apology p     they generally measured says he the goodness of a part by the length of it i thought none bad by being short that were closely natural nor any the better for being long without that quality but in this i doubt as to their interest they judged better than myself for i have generally observed that those who do a great deal not ill have been preferred to those who do but little though never so masterly as to the latter part of the sentence experience has proved equally that to act much tolerably and not so much masterly are the ways to rise to the top of a theater mr cibber was himself a master of a company and it is no very great odds but mr t c may succeed to the same post of honorable profit  as i rose into some degree of approbation i succeeded mr norris commonly called dicky norris in several of his parts which with several others which i was well received in put me a little upon my mettle and i began to think as i had heard my father say he was taken notice of most for being an author as well as an actor that i would pursue the same measures i soon came to a resolution for ambition in great souls acts with incredible rapidity  aut caesar aut nullus i thought an excellent apothegm nec mora nec requies pen ink paper a collection of plays etc being prepared to work went i when i had thought of a plot struck out hints for some characters and fixed in the name of a comedy i communicated at a proper opportunity my design to my father he heard me with an indolent air and gave me no answer but lolling back in his great chair took a pinch of snuff and fell asleep  it is impossible to conceive the tumultuous passions that then agitated my whole human frame quick beat my heart my pulse ran high and vengeance darted from my eye upon my brow sat lowering care and all the horror of despair  yet i waited till he awoke and repeated to him my design of writing a comedy  a comedy boy thou write a comedy  yes sir says i why not you wrote a comedy before you was my age  true child but my dear i hope you dont think of this affair seriously  yes sir i have thought on it and have begun it and half wrote it  well but harkye sir what has put you on this exploit fame fame i suppose and parnassian glory prythe stick to thy business as an actor and dont show yourself in a double capacity a moxcomb  saying this he took a pinch of snuff and walked off  reader you may believe i was not in a little confusion and you may equally credit me when i tell you i thought my father as errant a conceited pragmatical selfsufficient coxcomb as ever he represented however on i went with my play and when i had finished three acts i accidentally happened to be with him alone when he surpised me by saying well boy what is become of this comedy of thine have thou wrote a favorite scene yet i told him what progress i had made when taking a pinch and smiling prythe says he what dest thou mean what a gads name the inspires you in this attempt  that principle sir said i that most of the world act upon interest you know sir i have not been the most frugal oeconomist my finances low my debts high and my creditors impatient a comedy sir from me would set all right i am sure it will do my writing it would make it run the name would raise a curiosity yes sir answered he thy name for my namesake would secure your being damned however as this is the state of the case let me see your play when you have finished it and i will let you know more of my mind i like the reason you give for writing and therefore shall not oppose it now my heart bounded with joy and what will not the gratification of our desires work upon our heart i began to love my father i looked on him in another light and instead of thinking him a coxcomb thought he talked like a very sensible man in a fortnight my play was finished and i brought it him and read it he told me it was a rough pebble yet might do with a little polishing for it was a tolerable good first play in brief it pleased him so much that he licked the rude poetic cub into that form in which it afterward appeared on his consent it should be brought on the stage immediately i could not help ruminating on the happiness of my case as an author for there was not one author then living could have brought a performance on the stage without infinite trouble vexation charge and interest i took care it should get into rehearsal at the time the managers had appointed who were so civil as to compliment me with the prime part of the season it may smell pragmatical in the nostrils of gravity yet i cannot here help remarking what ideas the thirst of fame and interest will raise in a generous mind the reader will think alexander the great and i can have no analogy on this occasion but though my character is not parallel to him my soul may the minds of two men though they are placed at some distance if they think in a right way will and must meet in one and the same thought so every one knows two parallel lines the least inclining to one another in the progression must and will meet in one and the same point as then an analogy between me and alexander may be mathematically proved i will show it also by example the maccdonian when he had meditated in youth high exploits and noble feats of arms his breast all swelling with the heaves and throws of ambition he set before his eyes the acts of achilles inspired by these he shook his brandished falchion on conquest he resolved resolved and conquered so i ruminating on dramatic fame parnassian glory and three third crowded nights set before my eyes the writings of colley cibber inspired by those i brandished high my pen hurling defiance in vile criticks teeth on triumph i resolved resolved and triumphed now some smart theatrical woudbe will say this comparison proves me no more like alexander the great than that of fluellins i henry the fifth does him like alexander the pig this would give me no pain  odi profanum vulgus and arceo but as to my play when it began to mellow in rehearsal and was almost ripe enough for the stage a pestilential blast of envy had like to have destroyed it and with it all my fair hopes a rumor had gone abroad that truly this comedy was none of mine but my fathers and that he not willing to stand the bears any more brought it out under my name as ridiculous as this was it gained belief among many therefore it was thought necessary that i should make a previous apology to the town to set matters in a true light and to take off prejudice accordingly i wrote a letter to the town and printed it in one or more of the public papers in which i told them that upon my word and credit it was all my own doings and that my father never wrote a line of it or saw it notwithstanding this letter and the intrinsic value of the comedy there was great opposition made to the play and damned it had surely been if the epilogue spoke by my first wife jenny cibber and me had not saved it for my father knowing how it would be wrote an epilogue as a dialogue between me and jenny in which she told me i was a blochead to write and that i was my fathers own son all which were strong jokes with the audience i put on a pitiful face told her i wrote to pay my debts and that i would for the future prove a good and loving husband if she would save my play the audience being won by her entreaty to give us at least an honest chance to live the play lived nine nights  this being the chief incident of my life as an author i have been somewhat prolix in the account of it and have yet some more observations to make i mentioned that i wrote a letter to the town previous to the performance of my play now there is a parallel to this in the conduct of mr colley cibber which is not mentioned in his apology his apology not reaching to that time every one must remember that three years ago mr colley cibber brought to drury lane theater his play altered from shakespeare called king john it was no sooner in rehearsal but slap the critics were at him directly letters epigrams odes jokes and all the ribraldry of grubstreet flew about in the papers and it was said the templars and their posse legislatus were engaged to damn it on this mr cibber wrote a letter directed to the students of the inns of court and very handsomely and mighty civilly desired them to do no such thing this letter was new fuel to the flame they fell soul of the letter immediately from whence he might easily conjecture how they would use his play but what could he do the play was just ready to be performed the actors perfect scenes painted and much time had been spent which the master of the house would otherwise have been using to his interest therefore he could not fairly withdraw it however he was resolved it should not be damned and fearing the master might insist on its being played what does he but at a rehearsal seeing his play lying on the prompters table he takes up the copy and puts it up into his pocket snug and decently walked off with it resolving he would not run the risque of so precarious a fortune  i shall here while i think of it speak of a theatrical conduct lately practiced nor can i speak of it in any place more proper than in this i mean that of persons belonging to a theater addressing the town by letters  i must confess that i and my father first practiced this art with the same success it laid us open to the criticism of coffeehouse wits who thought soberly on what we wrote hastily there was such canvassing the style this was not grammar and that was not sense one thing was false english another a cibberism but besides the jokes which if nothing else are nothing at al they debated the point over and formed themselves into parties which we experienced were not to our advantage i have indeed since the time of my play addressed the town and with the same success for i find by our theatric squabbles and altercations we make as much amusement to the town in a morning as by our performance in an evening the contentions for the part of polly between mr clive and my late  i was going to say wife  but a late woman who was called by my name that contest i remark furnished a copious topic for conversation argument and publication and ended with noise and uproars in the playhouse there has been the same thing practiced by monsieur denoyer and mademoiselle roland and before by monsieur poitier and mademoiselle roland versus messieurs quin and fleetwood and yet another which made not a little noise between the two harlequins messieurs philips and woodward the consequence of all these addresses has been this the town is called into the playhouse as the dernier resort to judge of things which the master of the house is only judge of when the judges come to this mixed court of judicature where all present may pass sentence they are divided in opinion and then the question must be decided by noise and tumult and they who are the greatest rioters carry it i do not find that any of these epistolary addresses to the town from theatric performers have done them any service nor would i advise on any occasion to have recourse to such expedients however there is no rule without exception mr rich who has never suffered his people to make appeals nor ever made them himself was at last drawn in by mere necessity a little trifling pragmatical obscure pothecary that lives in some bye street or alley about covent garden one j  h  ll publishes a thing called the opera of orpheus and in a scurrilous preface to it abuses mr rich for having stole his entertainment of orpheus and eurydice from his orpheus and instigated the public to do justice for so notorious a fraud nor was this pamphlet his only attack he run about the town made parties and people from his representations thought him really injured now it became necessary for mr rich likewise to appeal to the town and to set the affair in a true light and plainly narrate downright matters of fact to this h  ll replied with all the scoundrel scurrility his little wit could afford and i also became an object of his malice there was a candid answer printed to his pamphlet the night before the entertainment came out this address to the public from mr rich was necessary and had the desired effects the first night the entertainment was crowded and was received with general applause and the world has never since heard of that j  h  ll who sunk into that obscurity from whence he emergd  but to return reader to that station in the theater from whence i digressd after having wrote my play called the lover i began to think myself every day of more and more consequence and having got an insight into the manner of managing i began to think i s equal to the management of a young company to play in the summer season accordingly i got leave from mr wilks and the other masters to form a young company and to play during the vacation this was no bad thing for the masters nor the inferior players for the first received a settled payment for the use of a few old scenes and clothes and the latter generally five or six days pay per week for two days performance besides i generally brought out some new pieces and farces which not only turned to our immediate account but to the good of the actors as actors and to the masters by becoming very gainful performances the winter or two following to instance this i need say no more than that george barnwell the devil to pay the mck doctor and the beggars opera the part of polly by mrs clive were first performed under my management of summer companies from these young companies see what performers have been chiefly sprung mrs clive mrs buttler and though last not least in love  myself this custom i continued till the revolution of the whole company under my conduct of which more hereafter this management of mine was an undoubted proof of my abilities and i did imagine i might become a manager in my own right but alas how frail are all human hopes on the death of mr wilks mr cibber sen sold out at a proper opportunity his share of the patent to mr highmore a gentleman who had a great liking to theatrical affairs and who had played some parts on the stage merely i suppose to show what a judge he was of acting and consequently of actors the parts he played were htspur and lthario this gentleman besides his liking to theatrical affairs had chiefly a liking to theatrical gain he had heard and partly seen what profits the managers had made for a long course of years and had a mind to purchase what he thought would prove so fine an income how his expectations were answered you will find related here i must disclose a secret when mr cibber sen sold out his share in the patent i was desperataly alarmed and looked on it as a piece of injustice done to myself for i thought his share or at least the major part of his share would have devolved upon me as an inheritance therefore i looked on myself as a disinberited son and that highmore had bought clandessinely my birthright or rather by sinister means deprived me of it this may serve for a reason why i so heartily entered into the measures i afterward prosecuted on mr booths death the patent became invested to the property of mr highmore the widow booth and the widow wilks the whole company began to murmur at being ruled by so motley a kind of government as they were now falling under viz a man who knew nothing of the business and two women unfit for such a province mr ellis was indeed deputed to act for mrs wilks bt i believe that did not much better the affairs mr ellis however became not only a deputy to mrs wilks but primeminister and factotum to highmore this could be no pleasant situation for the other actors who had been so many years laboring in the theater and boe the burden of the day such as the elder mills mr johnson miller griffin and some others who though younger had some claim as mills jun and self i found this an admirable time to put in execution a design i had pland which was at a proper opportunity to fling off the yoke and set up for masters and managers ourselves at one of our private meetings all were complaining yet no one proposed a method of redress when i got up from my chair and thus delivered myself  gentlemen my heart never beats with a stronger joy than when i have a power of thinking and acting right i think the glow that now warms my bosom is raised by truth and cherished by sobriety long have you complained of the tyranny you groan under and long have looked with indignation on your chains but what o ye gods can avail lugubrious lamentations of what force is such female rhetoric if you think you receive injuries deliver yourselves from them if you would not be slaves be free if you have a will to be so you have power under what bonds are you consined by what allegiance are you restrained you have a glorious cause you may be the asserters of the cause of liberty what though your enemies have got the patent you have your own talents your own endowments of nature and acquisitions of art what is the great seal to you you may say of that as was said by a great and bold man of magna charta it was a magna farta if you have spirits resolution and conduct a fair road invites to wealth fame and freedom you may take their house of some of the renters and get possession of it by artifice and set up yourselves a stratagem in war is no crime or failing in that you may pro tempore take the little haymarket house your company will be better than theirs and novelty of places will be changing the scene and give success perhaps it may be objected we have no exchequer no scenes no clothes with a long et caetera what then you may have credit enough though some among you have not much credit in a private capacity yet in a public capacity as a body corporate as it were much credit will be given there are monied men who will adventure sums on such a proceeding therefore sirs no longer show this inanity of complaint the means of freedom are in your own possession which if you refuse may you be perpetual slaves and be sold like a herd of sheep from one purchaser to another if you dare be otherwise by this honest heart i will risque my life and fortune with you and prove to you that i cannot only fari quae sentio sed agere quae sentio speak what i think but act accordingly  this harangue had all the success that i could wish they resolved no longer to bear the galling yoke of tyranny but assert that liberty and property which all true britons are so tenacious of when the season was quite over we thought it a proper time having gained some of the renters to our side to endeavor to gain possession of the theater but in this we failed though we attacked it vi and armis on this disappointment we all agreed that the only place we could pitch our tents at and open our theatrical campaign must be at the little house in the haymarket several objections were made to the situation of the place and the smallness of the theater but as i had the revolution strongly at heart i talked them and persuaded them out of all their objections at length it was resolved in a full council of war that we would encamp at the haymarket we accordingly took the house of one potter a carpenter who was the landlord bspoke all our dramatick equipages and furniture and held frequent councils to settle the operations of the ensuing campaign at the fair of bartholomew we gained some recruits but besides those advantages over the enemy i myself went there in person and publicly exposed myself this was done to fling defiance in the patentees teeth for on the booth where i exhibited i hung out the stagemutiny with pistol at the head of his troop our standard bearing this motto  we eat  in a few days after the patentees opened with aesop to which they added an occasional scene written formerly by sir john vanbrugh on a prior deertion of actors wherein they thought they did great service to the patentees and cast a severe roction on us they next attacked us by another old wornout rhpsodical affair of one feildings called the authors farce in which i and my father were daily ridiculed but all this i laughed at in my sleeve well considering that joking on the cibbers could not hurt us on the contrary we opened with love for love and got up all the strongest plays with a diligent expedition our company consisted of the old veterans who were allowed by the town to be greatly superior to our antagonists for excepting mrs clive and mrs horton there was not one in their company but was the contemptible refuse of the theater we had also received an additional force by receiving mr milward who having left mr rich on some disgust joined our forces the patentees imagined that much depended on the number of their troops and they had tried considerable reinforcements from strolling companies but being all awkward and undisciplined they were no more to compare to us than the county militia to the kings bodyguards vide c cibbers apology p       what rude riotous havoc was made of all the late dramatic honors of our theater all became at once the spoil of ignorance and selfconceit shakespeare was tortured and defaced in every single character hamlet and othello lost in one hour all their good sense their dignity and fame brutus and cassius became noisy blusterers with bold unmeaning eyes mistaken sentiments and turgid elocution not young lawyers in hired robes and plumes at a masquerade could be less what they could seem or more aukwardly personate the character they belonged to this exclamatory invective of mr colley cibber on the revolution which betterton made is so apropos to my revolution i could not forbear quoting it as we met with much success and the patentees with none at all they thought to effect by policy what they could not obtain by force they endeavored therefore to silence us not by the authority of the lord chamberlain but that of an act of parliament by which they would prove us vagabonds to effect this mr harper was taken up as a vagabond and was committed to bridewell but on the trial of the legality of his commitment it appeared that he was not within the description of the act of the twelfth of queen ann against vagabonds he being a housekeeper and having a vote for the members of parliament for westminster he was therefore discharged and conducted through the hall amidst the triumphant acclamations of his theatric friends having carried this important point we had nothing to fear from the patentees knowing now that our success depended solely on our own good conduct and the favor of the public i cannot but confess that we had dismal apprehensions of the force of the act which would have so fixed the power of the patent that we must invitis animis have returned to the dominions of our former masters we had indeed got a specious color of a license and put at the top of our bill by license of the master of the revels for which titular honor we paid him handsomely yet we did this rather to induce the public to think we played by a legal authority and under the sanction of the court than for any right which we thought it conferred on us we could not be ignorant that mr giffards company at goodmans fields was then playing against all the opposition that could be made to it against the power of the city of london and even their remonstrances to the court that it was a nuisance in short it was not then thought in the power of the crown to suppress a playhouse though acting without royal license and permission because it was not evidently an illegal thing but the case is now altered by a late act of parliament which has fixed all power in regard to theaters and theatrical affairs in the lord chamberlain for the time being as this act is of such importance to the theaters and the passing it caused great debates in both houses it may be proper to consider the cause and reasons given for having it enacted in relating which i may give some curious anecdotes and statesecrets which mr c cibber has omitted yet i shall open my narrative in his words as they are an invective against a certain person for whom also i have a word or two in petto   vide c cibbers apology p     these tolerated companies gave encouragement to a broken wit to collect a fourth company who for sometime acted plays in the hay market which house the united drury lane comedians had quited this enterprising person i say whom i do not choose to name unless it could be to his advantage or that it was of importance had sense enough to know that the best of plays with bad actors would turn but to a very poor account and therefore found it pecessary to give the public some pieces of an extraordinary kind the poetry of which he conceived ought to be so strong that the greatest dunce of an actor could not spoil it he knew too that as he was in haste to get money it would take up less time to be intrepidly abusive than decently entertaining that to draw the mob after him he must rake the chanel and pelt their superiors that to show himself somebody he must come up to juvenals advice and stand the consequence  aude aliquid brevibus gyaris and carcere dignum si vis esse aliquis  juv such then was the mettlesome modesty he set out with upon this principle he produced several frank and free farces that seemed to knock all distinctions of mankind on the head religion laws government priests judges and ministers were all laid flat at the feet of this this is to be taken in a double sense the person struck at having since called himself hercules vinegar and is the notorious author of the champion herculean satyrist this drawcansir in wit that spared neither friend nor foe who to make his fame immortal like another erostratus set fire to his stage by writing up to an act of parliament to demolish it i shall not give the particular strokes of his ingenuity a chance to be remembered by reciting them it may be enough to say in general terms they were so openly flagrant that the wisdom of the legislature thought it high time to take notice of them  the person of whom mr cibber only gives the outside lines of his pourtrait is at present well known by those only but that posterity may know this iniquitous son of wit who has fell under this heavy censure of the laureat for satirizing the just measures of the present alljust allwise and allpowerful minister i will subscribe the name of h  y f  d  g esquire author of pasquin the historical register eurydice hissed and others of the same political cast to these farces which were allegorical satires on the administration the town run with the utmost avidity of defamation and scandal he drew the mob after him from grovsor cavendish hanover and all the other fashionable squares as also from pall mall and the inns of court i call them as the apologist i quoted calls them mob for there may be your mobs of quality as well as mob of raggimuffins your magnum vulgus and imum  your great vulgar and the small  well  these mobs or multitudes or concourse or audiences call them what you will resorted nightly to hear these farces and were dull enough not only to think they contained wit and humor but truth also it could not but regret me to see some noble peers and gentlemen i had entertained a very good opinion of as to their parts and capacities sitting in the sideboxes and seemingly delighted with the performance but i have charity enough for these gentlemen to think they did all this more out of partyzeal and to bias the mob than from any conviction there was in those farces either sense humor or truth  but what will not men prostitute in a partycause  the successes of these dramatic pieces made the m  r not a little uneasy nor could the merry droll mortal his brother keep his temper for let some men be as facetions as they please and love a laugh as much as they will they dont like the laugh to be always on them i and my father who can bear as much laughing at and have had as much laughing at as any two persons in the kingdom not excepting the two honorable gentlemen i just now mentioned yet though we carry it off in company it stings it hurts our hearts to be the standing objects of raillery and i will not say but if we could as well avenge the insults on us as the m r could against him but we might perform it but to the point from these farcical satires a dainty opportunity offered itself to the great man not only to suppress those but to bring all stages and all stagewritings under such a restriction that nothing should be exhibited for the future that should give him the least uneasiness here was an admirable proof of deep policy and sagacity to make the satire of his enemies be the tools of his interest a scheme was laid to accomplish his design it was put in execution and it succeeded  i must here enter the verge of private history and by the following anecdote show that i have that great talent of an historian not to dare to speak false and not afraid to speak truth  mr giffard had removed about this time from goodmans fields to lincolns end fields house which he had hired of mr rich his removal had not answered his end and his affairs began to grow desperate he had never as yet given any prejudicial offense to the court yet was spposd not to have such obligations to it as to deny at this juncture the performing a farce which might bring him a large sum of money at this same time in a most vile paper called common sense there was a libellous production called the golden rump which the town and the mob were fools enough to think wit and humor now as the hitting in with the humor of the multitudinous mob is very advantageous to a theater a dramatick piece was wrote on the golden rump subject and called the golden rump which was given mr giffard to be performed but before it was rehearsed it so happened no matter how or why but so it happened that mr giffard went to downingstreet with this satirical farce in his pocket which was delivered to a great man for his perusal and it was found to be a scurrilous ignominious traitorous scandalous etc etc etc libel against majesty itself it was immediately carried to shown to explained to and remonstrated to that if there was not an immediate act of parliament to stop such abuses not regal dignity was safe from them  actum est  twas done  the point gained in a moment and a proper act ordered to be got  well now says some impatient reader what of all this what secret is this by what inference or inuendo does this show the ms policy or finesse prithee dont be so mifty and let me ask you a question by way of a suppose  suppose sir this same golden rump farce was wrote by a certain great mans own direction and as much scurrility and treason larded in it as possible  suppose giffard had a private hint how to act in this affair and was promised great things to play a particular part in this farce  suppose he was promised a separate license or an equivalent  you may then suppose the m a thorough politician who knew to manage bad things to the best advantage  o but say you i will not found my belief on supposes  truth may be supposed suppose this truth and you may be right  if you are so ungenteel to require proof demonstrative i have done with you and can only refer you to the author and negociators of the golden rump  this however is notoriously certain that the farce of the golden rump was carried to a great man and the master of the playhouse who carried it was promised something which he has been some time in a vain expectation of but will now in all probability end in nothing at all  but laying aside private anecdotes of the obtaining the late playhouse act i must mention what was known to all the masters of the two houses acting under the patent made no opposition to this bill they did all in their power to promote it because it would suppress for the present all theaters but their own they were so full of this prospect that they did not perceive they were at the same time becoming absolute dependants on a m  r for the bill contained a clause that the lord chamberlain should have a power of licensing other theaters if he so thought proper within the city and liberties of westminster the actors were indeed alarmed and imagined this act would lay them under oppressions from which they could gain no proper redress for the constant immemorial way of redressing grievances in the government of a theater is to raise a revolt and bring about a revolution but the security of the masters of the playhouses and the alarm of the actors were both illfounded as i shall in the subsequent narration make appear if the lord chamberlain can grant another license why then should not the actors who may be aggrieved by the present masters endeavor to gain one i only ask that question here i may explain it in another place  vide c cibbers apology p     mr c cibber has made a copious and florid dissertation as well political as theatrical on this law he proves satire on a minister when represented on the stage is stronger than any satire can be that is read in the closet therefore to license the stage could bear no analogy with licensing the press he lays it down also that a theatrical insult to the present minister is equal to the stab guiscard gave the late lord oxfordthen adds was it not as high time to take this dangerous weapon of mimical insolence and defamation out of the hands of a mad poet as to wrest the knife from the lifted hand of a murderer  in short the laureat has shown himself a profound politician by becoming a voluntary champion for that law he says he writes on this subject to show the true pourtrait of his mind and to show how far he is or is not a blockhead perhaps this was not the only motive if he had another design than merely to give his shallow reasons a little exercise and if it should succeed the world must admire at the depth of his speculations i shall illustrate this remark when i come to descant on some transactions of a very late date thinking it now time to return to that part of my history from whence i digressd  by the release of harper we gained a complete conquest over the pattentees they indeed carried on the campaign but with such losses and disadvantage that mr highmore the chief sharer and director began to think it the most prudent method to make the best retreat he could upon my soul though as an enemy in the field i could not be displeased with his distress yet as he paid so many thousand pounds to my father my honest heart could not but feel for his being plunged in an affair he knew nothing of i cannot blame my father for so advantageously selling out and was my hereditary claim laid aside he acted prudently and consequently honestly but let that go he made me some amends by giving highmore no assisting advice how to conduct his theater which if he had must have greatly injured us for no one knows that province but myself and him the new purchaser therefore being left to himself and his prime minister mr ells singers dancers tumblers and other exotic performers were hired at extraordinary rates this was but of very little service and the posture of his affairs grew daily into a worse and worse situation  i cannot but here observe to the reader how different our conduct was at the haymarket i must ingenuously confess though we kept our simple heads above water we had got out of our depth for after our first run of novelty and interest was over our audiences grew thin which deficiency we supplied by orders of our own for in the theaters as in shops the appearance of business brings customers nevertheless we found large deficiencies in the office and by the accounts in our books we had contracted a very considerable debt yet we concealed the state of our case as much as possible resolving to beat our antagonists our of the field and by such a conquest set every thing right if the patentees at drury lane had either known our condition or had prudence and courage enough to bear with their own for another season i know not what the consequences might have been i may say it now i believe we should have been forced to a cessation of arms and capitulated on the best terms we could have got  mr rich had either gained better intelligence of the state of our affairs or from the state of those at drury lane had found the patentees were heartily tired of their expensive instead of lucrative offices from one of these reasons or both he had formed a scheme which had it been carried into execution must have proved very gainful to the patentees and very agreeable to the town as it would have given them the best plays played by the best performers in england but as well concerted as it was for these intentions it was destructive of the natural and legal liberty of the actors they would have become mere servants to two cojoind patentees nor could have had on any disgust or affront any power to revolt the scheme was for to have drury lane patent purchased of the patentees who were tired of it at a cheap rate and then the patentees of covent garden and drury lane to enter into a joint partnership and engage the best actors who should act occasionally at both houses performing always a comedy at one house and a tragedy at the other there were several other conditions which would have proved beneficial to the masters which are needless to enumerate  this plan though it has been long thought a new finesse in theatric policy yet cibbers apology shows it is an old stagecunning practiced in some measure by mr r  hs father and mr owen swinney this design however could not be carried into execution by mr r  h alone there was wanting the primum mobile the sine qua non the purchase money on this occasion he applied to mr fl  t  d who was his friend and proposed his purchasing the patent and to enter into a sort of partnership this proposal was set in so advantageous a light and such fair hopes offered themselves that mr fl  t  d came into this scheme and purchased the patent of mr highmore and the other patentees on this turn in affairs we at the haymarket were under a most terrible consternation we looked on ourselves as persons who were never to enjoy that liberty we had so strenuously endeavored to obtain for this conjunction of the patentee masters must have compelled us to have returned under their management our affairs being in a very sad posture and daily growing worse but very happily for us a breach happened between mr r  h and mr fl  t  d at a time we could have least suspected it and that gave us all we wanted an opportunity to make the best terms with the latter get rid of our stockdebt and return to drury lane i shall not enter into the reasons for this breach of friendship between the two masters as that affair has been so differently represented but mr r  h has been chiefly censured as having drawn a gentleman into an affair which he would not otherwise have thought to have embarked in and then leaving him to conduct his new undertaking as he might but let their quarrel be what it would it was advantageous to us for mr fl  t  d being worked into the highest resentment was resolved to make up the best company and to hurt r  h by getting from him his chief actors and most necessary people mr quin was soon gained but on such terms as no hired actor had before received at the same time mr fl  t  d had entered into a treaty with us at the haymarket and agreed to allow all the managing actors two hundred pounds a year each and to some a clear benefit and to others a benefit at a lower rate than usual as in all the transactions of that affair i was treatymaster general and negociated that important peace with the patentee it may be expected i should enter into a long detail on that subject my conduct in this respect may be somewhat singular but i can give some reasons as an apology for it as this will be entering on a new scene i will halt a little as well to give my reader a little relief as myself for i dont know how it is but i begin to perceive myself somewhat dull and perhaps some people may have perceived it a great while ago if then sir reader your patience and good nature are worn out fling down the book that you may when you think proper begin the next chapter with a better temper and a spirit more alert and lively  and all that  chap viii of the nature of writing apologies the authors proof against scandal  his negociations and those of h  o w  e compared  his conduct and the duke of a  les paralleled  obligations received are no reason for gratitude  the company fixed at drury lane some remarks on it and a digression  well courteous reader you venture then to travel on maugre all the things i can say to my own dispraise if i like my father tell you about every sixth page i am a blockhead or a coxcomb yet you still away with my nonsense and as my vanity is not quite jaded you read on in hopes to meet with some fresh instances of it but perhaps those who may peruse this apology for my life may expect that i would enter into some very illustrious and renowned acts of my private conduct which have been very publicly talked of to such personages i shall answer they are not to imagine a man would set down in cool blood and write the devil of a satire against himself that would be dainty apologizing indeed no the thing is to say nothing harsh against your own dear self but as many severe things and reflections as possible against other people mr colley cibber whose apologetical talents are admirable has shown this species of writing in perfection a great many people on the publication of his apology cried an apology for the life of colley cibber well now we shall see what he can say in regard to this and that and the other  things which related to gaming or gallantry or a thousand things not so very proper to be mentioned but they were all out not a syllable of his private character not a word for excsing palliating or defending little foolish acts which merely related to religion or morality i can guess what may be expected from me what defense of particular conduct i may make but i shall relate only such things as may show my parts my theatrical character and in short what i think proper not what every impertinent person may want to know nor is this so unfair a proceeding as some may imagine no man can be obliged to accuse himself i write to put a gloss upon my acts and deeds not place them in the most odious light and erect myself in an historical pillory it would also be an endless work to vindicate all the simple accusations which have been brought against me and which no persons have any business to trouble their heads about should men say for instance i used my first dear and wellbeloved wife of ever blessed memory j  n  y c  with ill usage should they affirm that when her all pale and breathless corpse was in the coffin laid and i with sobs and tears and interjected sighs had moaned to many a witness my too unhappy fate yet that same night had a brace of drurian doxies vile in the same house  again should base defamation whisper in my ear i sold and bartered away my present most virtuous spouse and that i was a voluntary cuckold on record should scandal with her hundredtongud cursed mouth rumor it up and down that neither common honor nor common honesty were lodged within the center of my soul  should even all this be said calm and unruffed would i contemn it all and look on such reports in the cool light of mild philosophy there are indeed a set of people who will be busybodies to such i would answer very pithily sometimes what is that to me sometimes what is that to you to illustrate what a propriety there is in curbing such kind of impertinence by a laconic sentence i will tell you a short story  a great lawyer who now makes one of the most illustrious figures in westminster hall was as remarkable for his amors as his pleadings what was his gallantry to any body yet was he often censured and made the object of wit for this foible it happened his lady his chambermaid and cousin all layin at the same time a friend of his took an occasion to speak to him on this subject by way of raillery in this manner they say my l  d your lady is brought to bed  she is so  they say your cousin and chambermaid are also brought to bed  what is that to me  but they say you are the father  what is that to you  upon which turning on his heel my l  d left mr impertinent with a proper indignation  what is that to you is the sole answer i shall give to any defamatory scurrility and if any person is not satisfied with such a reply he may get a more satisfactory one if he knows how  after this observation it may be proper to resume my theatrical story which i left off at the treaty with mr fl  t  d to return to drury lane house and act under his patent  as i had been the chief person in raising our theatrical revolt and being of a daring pushing temper i was resolved to have the principal share in the restoration of the company to drury lane i accordingly got myself nominated as plenipo and began my negociations with mr fl  t  d how happy i was in my negociations the event proved and as i had to deal with a person of honor and generosity i managed the conduct of the whole affair in such a manner as to make it turn out to myself in short i got a good round sum of money out of him for why should i negociate and negociate and get nothing myself some people may smile to see me on this occasion compare myself to another great negociator and wonder how i and h  ce w  e can have any analogy but pray do you think that he for so many years has run from court to court now at the hague now at paris negociating here and negociating there and all for a joke only would any man do this without the pleasing recordation of place and pension in truth my friend h  as well as myself was a little moved by self interest besis our negociations have been some what alike for mine in sact was a patched up affair and i did not so much consult the interest of my master as to serve a turn for that time i botched up a peace but i knew it would not last many years if there is any preeminence in our talents i hope i shall not seem immodest when i frankly own i think the balance turns in my favor for i am now more for war than peace   c cibbers apology p     thus we see as mr c cibber truly observes let the degrees and ranks of men be ever so unequal nature throws out their passions from the same motives it is not the eminence or lowliness of either that makes us the difference if this familiar style of talking should in the nostrils of gravity and wisdom smell a little too much of the presumptuous or the pragmatical i will at least descend lower in my apology for it by calling to my assistance the old humble proverb viz it is an ill bird that etc why then should i debase my prosession by setting it in valgar lights when i may show it to more favorable advantages or why indeed may i not suppose that a sensible reader will rather laugh than look grave at the pomp of my parallels  when i had concluded this treaty with mr fl  t  d so advantageous for the company and more particularly in a private manner to myself we removed bag and bagage from the haymarket and returned to our old camp at drury lane our government was then thought to be fixed in a peaceable manner every thing went on with great success and i took care to be so much in the masters favor that in the direction of the theate i was a kind of prime minister i say a kind of prime minister for even then there was another person shared amply in his confidence and by whom he was chiefly advised when i found out this i was not a little nettled a jealousy raised various sentiments in my breast for like pompey the great my soul disdained the thought of an equal glory and power are the darling passions of my heart and not to enjoy either of them was to so jealous an ambition a mere shade to my laurels my competitor was the person who had been concerned for mrs wilks and who thought himself to have an admirable talent for theatric affairs this talent was to compose pantomimes furbish up old tricks and make what he called entertainments as a specimen of what notion he had of the dignity of the stage i must observe that his genius turned to the monstrous and the mavelous for which reason nothing could be brought to town to be exhibited to the vulgar but he was for having it exhibited on the stage there was a fellow of an enormous height came from germany to be shown for a sight called mynheer cajanus such a spectacle proper enough for a smithfield or moorfields booth was thought a proper personage to grace the theater royal accordingly negociations were begun but to my honor be it spoke i had no concern in them i was kept out of the secret nor was i much affected that i was so i and his grace the duke of a  le in this respect may be said to have the same notion of things his late speech on the state of the nation shows that he was out of the secret in regard to the conduct of affairs and as he thinks them wrong was proud that none of them could be laid to his charge though i and that illustrious person differ in other sentiments in regard to the present ministry yet i am proud that in this point he agrees with me  but to the history mynheer soon agreed to some very advantageous terms proposed to him was with all secrecy conveyed into drury lane theater and was soon shown arising from a trapdoor to the no small admiration of the spectators and the no small joy of my corival nothing could give me and my brethren both of the buskin and the sock who had any regard for that school of honor and virtue the stage more secret indignation than to see it prostituted in so ignominious a manner and what still added to our resentment was the consummate folly of the town who crowded to the house a great number of nights to see the tall man but i had yet other reasons to be no friend to this tall man it regretted my soul frequently and often when on buskins a foot and a half high i was to personate a great hero and had my wavy plume high over my brow nod ever and anon with tragic grace yet was i thought diminutively great and raised the audience to a mock laugh while he  that orion that polephemus of a man with an inanity of voice and gesture excited wonder and applause  pudet haec opprobria nobis et dici potuisse and non potuisse reselli after this tall man was gone we had a tall woman and after that sadlers wells tumbling it is true this pleased the mob and brought money nor was this custom new did not the late mr r  h act in the same manner by this humor  c cibbers apology p     in this notion says mr cibber he kept no medium for in my memory he carried it so far that he was some years before this time actually dealing for an extraordinary large elephant at a certain sum for every day he might think fit to show the tractable creatures genius of that vast quiet creature in any play or farce in the theater then standing in dorset garden but from the jealousy so formidable a rival had raised in the dancers and by his bricklayers assuring him that if the walls were opened wide enough for his entrance it might endanger the fall of the house he gave up his project but at the same time of being under this disappointment he put in practice another project of as new though not of so bold a nature which was introducing a set of rope dancers into the same theater for the first day of whose performance he had given out some play in which i had a material part but i was hardy enough to go into the pit and acquaint the spectators near me that i hoped they would not think it a disrespect to them if i declined acting upon any stage that was brought to so low a disgrace as ours was like to be by that days entertainment my excuse was so well taken that i never after found any ill consesequences or heard the least disapprobation of it and the whole body of actors protesting against such an abuse of their profession our cautious master was too much intimidated to repeat it  now i was not hardy enough to make any public remonstrances on this occasion for i had a point to carry which was to fix my wifes character as an actress whose first performance was to be closed with these sadlers wells tumblers on this account it was my business to be as well with the master as possible and though i from my soul abhorred such measures yet no one was more bustling and commendatory in the design than myself by this i not only showed an attachment to his interest but kept myself on good terms with the other minister but had i thought it would have been any gain to me to have distressed the master by making any remonstrances my fathers hardiness should not have come up to mine for i would not have gone sneaking into the pit in huggermugger not i truly but bounce upon the stage with blustering mood have stalked and made a speech which with pathetick air in words and action had represented our disasters dire and though they had hissed again and yet again i would have stood em all till they had heard me out  on this ingenuous confession of how i did act or how i would have acted some may say are these principles honorable is not this servile flattery and that scandalous injustice  are not favors received strong obligations for gratitude  well sir casuist what of all this honor and gratitude and this and that and the other are quite different things according to the received notions of different places for what is dishonorable and immoral in england may be thought quite otherwise among the hottentots a man in london may be thought odd if he offers his wife for his friends service yet it is well known several nations of negroes practice it even to strangers if morality is local as i have fully proved i have proved also there may be much difference between theatrical honor and common honor now my notion of theatrical honor is to act only for your own convenience and you can do no injustice if you serve yourself if i should now be pertly asked  what the where are thy morals have thou no conscience yes i have but what then that i have embraced the philosophy of mr colley cibber i told the reader in a prior chapter and what does that great and good man say in his three hundredth page  i did it against my conscience and had not virtue to starve by opposing a multitude that would have been too hard for me  had harry the fourth of france a better excuse for changing his religion i was still in my heart on the side of truth and sense but i had their leave to quit them when they could not support me for what equivalent could i have found for my falling a martyr to them  o most admirable doctrine the plea of convenience is a full answer for a breach of conscience  is not this a doctrine that machiavel himself might have boasted having here observed on what maxims i and my father act some of our late conduct which shall be considered in a subsequent chapter may now be easily accounted for though our notions may be exploded by some mr colley cibber has among mnkind more disciples than mr george whitfield and this i am sure of their zeal is stronger as there are many who die martyrs to his doctrine every sessions at the oldbailey having lived in a full faith that to do what they think convenient is to do right  there is a private anecdote of my life which is a proof how early i imbibed this convenient opinion i have indeed often related it to my theatrical acquaintance with much glee of heart and boastful satisfaction but as i would be by this apology toto notus in orb theophilus i cannot resist the temptation of inserting it in these my memoirs you must know reader that even by the time i had reached my eighth year my papa said i was a sad young dog and upon some prank i had played i was in some disgrace it happened i went into his chamber to endeavor a reconciliation one morning and as he had gone to bed in his cups over night he had i supposed dropped a couple of guineas out of his breeches be that how it will i saw the two pretty sparkling rogues lie at the edge of the carpet by his bedside what does i but slap runs to the happy spot fell on my knees and like a good and dutiful child cried out in a devout tone pray father bless me and pray to g  d to bless me and make me his true and faithful servant for ever and ever amen  he surprised at such a sudden strain of filial duty for i dont believe i ever asked him blessing twice before in my whole life stroakd me down the head and bid me rise by which time i had by slight of hand touched the spankers and conveyed them snug into my pocket  and he will never have heard of them since till he reads this apology for such an action that as i thought they would be a convenience to me my conscience was not too dainty to take them  e minimis majora   all this harangue on my philosophy is necessary though it may seem odd to many readers because it is an apologetical defense for every action of my life at once i may indeed illustrate it by more instances in the sequel of my story but shall now return where this digression began  the company went on under mr f  d with very great success equal to the greatest under cibber wilks and booth as for me i was occasionally more or less in his favor and interest as it suited my own convenience for he showed me many instances of his readiness to serve me and was on all occasions prompt and ready to do acts of friendship and good nature the stage was then as well ruled by my assistance as a gentleman not brought up to it could rule it yet as it was my opinion and several other players that no gentleman is proper for the master of a theater we were not absolutely contented and we did not want for grumbletonians in a theatric government we knew indeed that our master had redeemed us from a thousand inconveniences we had labored under gave us our own terms but yet we did not look upon him with an equal eye and thought that actors were the only proper and fit persons to rule over actors and receive all the profits of a theater these i say were maxims that the chiefest actors embraced and inculcated into others as the fundamental rights of our constitution on this the company became uneasy and formed themselves into little factions and cabals but which could not then have been attended with any ill consequences to the patentee but these little murmurings were greatly heightened by the following event on the late act for licensing the number of stages taking place mr giffards company acting then at lincolnsinnfields to whom mr rich had let it were obliged to break up and provide for themselves in the acting companies as well as they could mr f  d on this occasion took severa into drury lane and to make way for them dismissed several who had long been appertaining to that theater mrs giffard and mr giffard were themselves likewise afterward engaged this gave new uneasiness to the old stock for we looked on them in a contemptible light and when the season came on and parts were cast to these exotic actors still more and more murmuring taunts and jealousies arose the master favored several of these additional recruits in a particular manner and seemed to make them his confidents and favorites this still made more faction in our state till at last it was divided into two parties the riffraffs and the scabs the first were the masters party the latter mine his were as the present courtiers and mine as the patriots the titles may seem coarse to the ears of delicacy but why not as good and significant as the present names of distinction in sweden the hats and the nightcaps or indeed as our own whig and tory another notable mark of distinction was the masters party instituted a famous club of riffraffs called the oxcheekclub and this was erected on the ruins of a club which the old drury lane company had formerly erected these partydivisions are in a theatrical government as prejudicial to the public good as in a political one the business of the stage was not followed with that spirit and alacrity as when unanimity reigns in the hearts of the people i did i frankly confess what a theatrical patriot should do foment all the discord raise all the jealousies in order at a proper time and season to raise a rebellion and bring about a new revolution and these sentiments of patriotism have been since very serviceable to me in another respect for in my political essays which i had the honor to write in defense of the present administration i have charged all these maxims home upon the gentlemen in the countryparty for my father has proved the rules for the stage and state are the same in parallel so also must be those of patriotism about this time also i found the wings of my power clipped in relation of presiding over rehearsals and brought on one morning a round quarrel between q  n and me for i had long looked on him as a proud imperious blockhead and he on me as a vain impertinent coxcomb and perhaps we might both be somewhat right in our conjectures in this contest i valued nothing so much as his contempt of me for on my smart cutting repartees on him he cried with a laugh quarrelling with such a fellow is like sh  t  g on a t  d walking off as cool as a cucumber  and that was the sire of the rencounter we afterward had at the bedsord coffeehouse all these affairs happening and my trial not turning out to my favor my soul became chagrind both with the place and my master i was therefore resolved to leave that stage and for such reasons as you will meet with in the sequel of my story therefore as soon as my benefit was over i determined according to an old practice i had got of being of no more service to the master that season to appear no more that year and indeed no more at all while he was concerned there  retiring therefore from covent garden into the more agreeable and convenient air of charing cross i flung off the comedian and commenced politician but as by entering on that subject i shall begin a new farce it would be more proper to let the curtain of this chapter drop here  chap ix the author steps out of his way turns mnstrl writer  the reasons why some chimerical thoughts of making the stage useful  a quiet time in history says mr colley cibber like a calm in a voyage leaves us but in an indolent station to talk of our affairs when they were no longer ruffled by misfortunes would be a picture without a shade a flat performance at best this is his apology for the relation of his stepping out of the way and turning pleader at the bar nor can i make any better for telling how i became a m  al writer the affairs at drury lane went on too successful for me to carry some views i had into immediate execution therefore i thought it would be best to pave my way to my project by engaging the favors of the minister and becoming his advocate in print in this i thought to kill two birds with one stone as i could at the same time take an opportunity of revenging myself to the full on mr fl  t  d by satirizing him not only as to his theatrical affairs but with regard to his private economy accordingly i went to work and wrote a pamphlet called the country correspondent in which i have shown a specimen of my moral theatrical political and gallant character some people immediately knew the author for we great authors are soon found out let us take what care we will to conceal ourselves if i or mr pope or my father were to write any thing without setting our names to it we should be discovered in six lines reading the style the manner the thoughts would all glare out perfection and the inimitable ja ne scai quoy would distinguish the author on my publishing the country correspondent and being known for its sire many were the criticisms upon it some called me a coxcomb for writing so much upon myself some called me a base impudent fellow for publishing such invectives against mr fl  t  d who had been my friend others fell foul on me because i had openly boldly and strenuously espoused the cause of the minister as for being called a coxcomb i had been so long used to it that it seemed as natural to me as my own name nor did the accusations against me for libelling mr fl  t  d give me any pain they who had odd notions of honor and honesty said that i was an ungrateful rascal and this and that and the other but they might as well have sung psalms to a cow for my philosophy could away with it what i did was conveniently necessary and if from being an obliged friend i became a mortal enemy what more is it than what frequently happens among ministers of state and rulers of empires augustus and antony had their fierce contest for the world and what was the cause of the quarrel between sir r  t w  e and mr p  y but ambition in the one and a disregard of his claims in the other in all theatrical as well as political divisions to succeed in your design you must go through thick and thin the sword of defiance is drawn and the scabbard must be thrown away every one who has read machiavel knows these tenets are justifiable therefore whatever falsehood scandal infamy and ingratitude my country correspondent might have contained against mr fl  t  d yet it being consistent with my private views no one who knows men and things can blame me for i shall explain myself by giving some reasons which were then in embrio why i so acted i had determined to be as well with the m  st  y as possible and to merit something from them i undertook first to be a kind of an informer of what they called theatrical secrets our master had publicly espoused the party in opposition to the m  st  r and was firmly attached to the interest of the p  of w  this conduct i heard was resented by the m  st  r with whom he had once been on very good terms i thought therefore any private intelligence against the master if i could possibly make it a political concern would be an introduction to his favor and assist my future scheme an incident happened as favorable as i could wish a certain irish author was writing a tragedy which was by his friends who were reckoned the tiptop critics in town said to be a performance of such extraordinary merit that no tragedy since shakespeares time could equal it either for the sublimity of the ideas the dignity of the style the nobleness of the subject and the conduct of the scene that it was wrote in the defense of freedom and had such speeches that at that crisis of time it would run as long as cato had at another particular crisis this dainty tragedy was the much noised much subscribed for gustavus vasa written by henry brook esquire the master had great expectations from it and though it had been often read in private company before it was brought to the house yet i knew little of it till then as i was looked upon as a malecontent to the master and consequently out of the secrets of the ministry but as soon as it had been read in the greenroom and the parts delivered out to the actors and i was acquainted perfectly with the play i was determined i would take such measures that it should not be acted which would show to the minister what zeal i had for his service and at the same time indulge that spirit of revenge which i had against the master now what does i but represented to mr  no matter for his name  but it was the proper person to make such an information to that this same tragedy of gustavus vasa was a scandalous libel against the government and some lines in the praise of liberty were so introduced as to make strong inuendoes that the liberty of england was in danger this i represented with such a vehemence of words and action that it gained credit and before it was ready to be performed it was prohibited by my lord chamberlain the prohibition opened the mouths and hearts of the admirers of this tragedy and they talked roundly about the injustice and oppression the author and the master of the playhouse met with which they attributed to the fear the ministry had of its being performed on the stage now to give my own impartial thoughts on this affair i avow that i believe there was no harm in the play nor do i think it would have met with that great success as was expected from it for on the publication it was not judged near equal to the character that had been given it however i cannot but make this observation that from the action on the stage and the assistance of the scenes and actors it might have received such additional strength that it might by the further aid of a party have had a run of ten nights and here i must observe again that it was with great policy and prudence that the minister obtained the licensing act for though the liberty of the press allows a refused play to be printed yet the reading of it in the closet will not convey an adequate idea to the representation on a theater mr colley cibber who is a most strenuous champion for the licensing act has fully considered this difference between a performance printed only and when it is acted  thus he argues c cibbers apology p      it was said that this restraint upon the stage would not remedy the evil complained of that a play refused to be licensed would still be printed with double advantage when it should be insinuated that it was refused for some strokes of wit and would be more likely then to have its effect among the people however natural this consequence may seem i doubt it will be very difficult to give a printed satire or libel half the force or credit of an acted one the most artful or notorious lie or strained allusion that ever slandered a great man may be read by some people with a smile of contempt or at worst it can but impose on one person at once but when the words of the same plausible stuff shall be repeated on a theater the wit of it among a crowd of hearers is liable to be overvalued and may unite and warm a whole body of the malicious and ignorant into a plaudit nay the partial claps of only twenty illminded persons among several hundred of silent hearers shall and often have been mistaken for a general approbation and frequently draw into their party the indifferent or the inapprehensive who rather than not be thought to understand the conceit will laugh with the laughers and join in the triumph but alas the quiet reader of the same ingenious matter can only like for himself and the poison has a much slower operation upon the body of a people when it is so retaild out than when told to a full audience by wholesale the single reader too may happen to be a sensible unprejudiced person and then the merry dose meeting with the antidote of a sound judgment perhaps may have no operation at all with such a one the wit of the most ingenious satire will only by its intrinsic truth or value gain upon his approbation or if it be worth an answer a printed falsehood may positively be confounded by printed proofs against it but against contempt and scandal heightened by the skill of an actor ludicrously infusing it into a multitude there is no immediate defense to be made or equal reparation to be had for it would be but a poor satisfaction at last after lying long patient under the injury that time only is to show which would probably be the case that the author of it was a desperate indigent that did it for bread how much less dangerous and offensive then is the written than the acted scandal the impression the comedian gives it is a kind of double stamp in the poets paper that raises it ten times to the intrinsic value upon the whole if the stage ought ever to have been reformed if to place a power somewhere of restraining its immoralities was not inconsistent with the liberties of a civilized people neither of which any moral man of sense can dispute might it not have shown a spirit too poorly prejudiced to have rejected so rational a law only because the honor and office of a minister might happen in some small measure to be protected by it    i must annotate that all that is said here in reference to comic satire and the comedian is vice versa equally applicable to the tragedy and tragedian for when a mad brained tragic author has streamed into a patriotic style pompously rolling into vilifying periods signifying roundly nothing but invectives against a minister the pompous buskins and plumes of tragedy together with the aspect and elocution of the tragedian so speak and play with the imagination that they deceive the judgment and win over many spectators who might have thought them scandalous bombast had they been read soberly in the closet this as i observed was the fate of gustavus vasa esquire for after the prohibition the author published advertisements for a subscription aad in those advertisements made his cause the cause of the public insinuating it was refused for some strokes of liberty which were disagreeable to people in power this indeed answered his ends in point of profit for being the first play refused since the commencement of the act peoples curiosity were raised not only by wanting to see the prohibited play out of political reasons but because it was said by common rumor to be a most excellent tragedy the profit of the subscription was equal to what his most sanguine hopes might have promised him from the stage as this may be the most proper place for it i must insert another remark on refused plays after this success of the subscription of gustavus vasa all the tragic bards who were under the influence of mr l  tt  t  n prime minister at n  rf  k house threw into bombast scenes all the patriotliberty flights their own little geniuses could suggest or their patron and court of assistants could muster up some indeed say they did not on this occasion insert any thing new but that they had all from the first wrote according to their instructions and had filled their scenes with the wornout unfashionable notions of liberty and public spirit the next refused plays were the edward and eleonara of mr thompson at covent garden and a tragedy wrote by mr pattison at drury lane both of which were published by subscription and advertised that they fell the martyrs to freedom public spirit and the devil and all but as the homely proverb says enough is as good as a feast the public had been crammed by esquire gustavus to satiety and satiety from a natural effect it has on the generality of stomachs of mankind will not allow an avidity for more for as mr colley cibber philosophically and beautifully observes c cibbers apology p     what pleasure is not languid to satiety ditto p      satiety puts an end to all taste that the mind of man can delight in therefore their subscriptions fell short of mr brookss considerably and i believe the patriotpoets begin now to feel the ill consequences of an opposition to a certain great man as much as the merchants the merchants would have a war and they have had their hearts full of it the poets would write up to a refusal and i believe they begin heartily to repent it we of the court have i gad given them their bellies full i and sir r t play all the game and let us shuffle the cards theatrically or patriotically we still turn up knave but halt a little most gracious reader in the fullness of my heart i have digressd so long that i dont know where i digressd from but that is just my fathers way for as we write so we do but write on it is sufficient as for method and connection we leave them to your little geniuses our irregularity in writing like our irregularity in living is more beautiful from its deformity were we not singularly eminent we might die unnoted by fame but it is our extravaganzas in life which mark us out to the gaze and wonder of the present age and the inexpressible somewhat in our apologies will record us the most notable par nobile of the year    0 excepting with due submission that great par nobile fratrum who in a str n and negotiation have so eminently distinguished themselves to all europe  but seriously to recover the clue of my history from having given reasons why i abused mr f d in my ministerial essays i digressd to my turning informer about gustavus vasa and so deduced some historical anecdotes concerning that dainty piece and added some political remarks from cibbers apology in defense of the licensing act let me see ay it was so  i will now draw the back scene of my proceedings and still enlarge the prospect it was in the vacation of last summer when having retreated from covent garden i retired to charing cross my enemies gave out that i went there for some trifling sums i had run in debt for at mrs st  w  ds and some other fashionable reputable bawdyhouses in covent garden piazzas vile insinuation how weak the understanding of man to account for conduct of great men when they are ignorant upon what principles they move  what reflective witticisms and inuendoes have been flung at sir  about this secret expedition which has been so long fitting out what things have been said about a suspension or cessation of arms and i dont know what when at the same time the great man acts upon other measures than they guess and intends to proceed on other motives than they imagine  i was used in the same manner as to my secret expedition to charing cross and as it is now over and to put such fruitless revilers to the blush i will tell them my motives to it imprimis as i was going to commence m  al writer it was proper i should live near the m  r not only for more easily attending his levees but to be more readily sent for to attend a private conference and receive instructions whom i was to lash what i was to defend what gainsay when to give the evasive and when the downright lie all which things are necessary for a writer to know who has such a patron to defend  as for the frequency of my private conferences and the nature of my instruction i shall prudently be silent instructions given to ambassadors though moved for by members of the house of c  s to be laid before them are not to be revealed in such a manner but as to my frequenting a levee in downingstreet that is notoriously known and i can say with some elevation of heart few in his circle were more distinguished for their sense learning virtue honor policy ability and eloquence than your little humble servant t c  but besides these reasons my printer and publisher lived at that place and it is best for an author to confer with his printer very often as how the sale goes on and whether any cash is become due without mentioning the necessity of correcting the sheets from the press for what a sad figure an author makes in print who dont know how to make his stops i therefore always stop my works myself though as for the spelling i leave that to the printers boy sure then these are sufficient reasons to take off the obloquy that was cast on me that vile catchpoles drove me to a place which i out of mere policy retired to  well there it was i composed my country correspondents in all which i continued my attack on mr fl  t  d and in a miscellaneous rhapsodical way defended the p  m  r tooth and nail in taverns i eat for him drank for him talked for him and when i went home about four oclock in the morning i wrote for him  aurora musis amica then would i write about it and about it i continued this zealous and satirical fury for the whole summer nor did i write county correspondents only but sometimes occasional gazetteers in both which kinds of writing i equally succeeded  this strenuous attachment of mine to the administration drew on me the abuse of the country party and i was libelled under the character of pistol in a scandalous paper called common sense the author of that journal is a profligate forging fellow for he inserted letters from pistol with an insinuation as i go by the name of pistol that they came from me which was as notorious a fib as his predecessor mist told of colley cibber and i take this opportunity to avow to the whole world that i never had any thing to do with common sense nor ever will fron my soul i heartily despise it and from this moment till atropos with fatal shears shall snip the spinning thread of vital life common sense and i are enemies and so mr common sense your humble servant  but it seems my great apologist himself was drolld upon for his statewritings i mean the comedy of the nonjuror and myner keyber was a standing joke till at last mist fairly killed him  take the story in his own words  soon after the nonjuror had received the favor of the town i read in one of mists journals the following short paragraph yesterday died mr colley cibber late comedian of the theater royal notorious for writing the nonjuror the compliment in the latter part i confess i did not dislike because it came from so impartial a judge and it really so happened that the former part was very near true for i had just that very day crawled out after having been some weeks laid up with a fever however i saw no use in being thought to be thoroughly dead before my time and therefore had a mind to see whether the town cared to have me alive again so the play of the orphan being to be acted that day i quickly stole myself into the part of the chaplain which i had not been seen in for many years before the surprise of the audience at my unexpected appearance on the very day i had been dead in the news and the paleness of my looks seemed to make it a doubt whether i was not the ghost of my real self departed but when i spoke their wonder eased itself by applause which convinced me they were then satisfied that my friend mist had told a fib of me now if simply to have shown myself in broad life and about my business after he had notoriously reported me dead can be called a reply it was the only one which his paper while alive ever drew from me but my particular offense of writing the nonjuror has made me more honorable friends than enemies the latter of which i am not unwilling should know that that part of the bread i now eat was given me for having writ the nonjuror  this shows that though we state writers are jokd upon yet reward makes up for these squibs of drollery i may be asked why i was so voluntary a champion for the m  r and why i relate this account of state writing and intersperse political memoirs and remarks in this apology as they do not immediately relate to the history of the stage some john trot may sagely reply that i write in this manner merely to imitate the manner of colley cibber  but mr trot you are mistaken colley cibber interspersed defenses of lord chamberlains power and licensing act for the same reason that i wrote country correspondents and gazetteers to create merit with the m  y which we at a proper time migh make use of the private reason of writing these and abusing mr fl  t  d all tended to the same point i have often promised to tell them to the reader and the secret shall lie no longer a burden to me but out it shall  mr colley cibber retired from the stage having patiently sold his share of the patent to mr highmore when he had managed him so that he had got his own price and then he wished the crew he left in the vessel a good voyage yet says he though it began to grow late in life with me having health and strength enough to have been as useful on the stage as ever i i was under no visible necessity of quitting of it as an undoubted proof of that he has several seasons since on very valuable considerations from mr f  d performed occasionally on the stage but though he had quitted the theater and sold his share in it when he had staid with new patent and made them think it worth their while to come up to his price yet the sweet profits of the management of a theater remained strongly in his mind and notwithstanding all his professions of the love of retirement he would gladly have been reinstated in the government of a theater could he have obtained such an office and not to have cost him any thing now as he knew that i was a strong malecontent at drury lane and was sensible what torrents of ambition rolled tumultuously over my soul having derived their source from his own spring he was assured that i would come into any scheme that would sooth my ambition and put me at the head of a company ver which i was to have any profitable share of the management for ambition will be but an inglorious passion if not founded upon interest it is the utile dulci should govern the thoughts and actions of the rational part of mankind acquainted with my principles and having seen what an achitophel i was in theatric policy how adroit in raising commotions stirring up revolts heading rebellions and bringing about revolutions he thought proper to communicate to me a design of gaining over to his interest some principal players of drury lane company and then setting up a new company under a license which he did not doubt for his great merit and services he could easily obtain  this scheme jumped with my own way of thinking and i came into it with heart and hand nor did he omit hinting to me that his only motive to such a design when it began to grow late in life with him was purely to retrieve the honor of the british theater and leave me handsomely provided for now though i knew he did not care a rush for me nor would out of pure love give me a farthing to keep me from the gallows yet i had learned art enough to disguise my real opinion and give his proposal the turn he would have it take having resolved on this design we did secretly all we could to bring it about for your important schemes cannot be executed as soon as pland and therefore we were obliged to wait a proper opportunity which was while the articles of some of the principal actors under mr fl  t  d were expired in the mean time last summer to deserve something from the m  y when i should petition for any favor more paterno i took up my pen wrote country correspondents and gazetteers in defiance of common sense and all its adherents  so mr reader you now know for what reason i commenced politician  well methinks i hear some john trot object and say  is writing country correspondents and gazetteers of such consequence  yes sir to write as i did and lay about me like a drawcansir and all that sir is looked on as meritorious and merit is to be rewarded  all that summer was chiefly spent in politics and amors for i as well as sir  or  must have my relaxations and divertisements after the concerns of a nation have been pothering in my brain  i remember the old maxim  interpone tuis interdum gaudia curis which i thus render  sometimes the cares of empire to remove retreating to your miss indulge your love a maxim i always follow when fatigued either with the affairs of the state or the stage and the example of my betters keep me in countenance when i make this public confession of it  to return  that my politics would not support me i soon found out though had a particular right honorable gentleman taken me more particularly under his patronage it might have been worth his while as well as mine i might have been of great service to him for i could have made as good a bustlemastergeneral in st st  ss chapel as behind the scenes of this i gave him a hint in one of my pamphlets and told him with what an air the young captain could ioll in his chariot while it rolled down to the house and that he could make speeches to a senate as well as to an audience  but if people cannot take a hint whose fault is that perhaps he wanted more explicit explanation but my consummate modesty not suffering me to make such an attempt it may have been my disappointment  however i have this consolation i am not the first man of merit who have suffered by that simple virtue  as i was not taken such notice of as my vanity had suggested i deserved i retreated from the service  the practice of all great men on such occasions  scipio and others have done it  as i was resolved not to act with mr f  d again and he equally resolved not to let me i engaged with mr rich and appeared on covent garden theater  i so managed matters that i soon became bustlemastergeneral there and made the underactors and underservants of the theater know who they had got among them as my enemies will allow i am a clever fellow in my way i must here mention the success i met with in my theatrical way i had long sighed to perform the character of bays in the rehearsal but my own fears and my fathers inimitable action still so fresh in every memory clipped the wings of my ambition however i was resolved to make a push at it and proposed to my new master the getting up the rehearsal  rehearsal said he  umph and who can do bays o sir says i you need not have asked that question when you have taken me into your company  umph says he  and took a pinch of snuff and remained silent  i urged the thing and what houses it would bring if i had the management of getting it up his answer came from him by half sentences and inuendoes and pinches of snuff as no twont do snuff the character the character of bays supported it twas a hazard twoud be an expense would advise me not to think of it snuff my father indeed to have played it might do something the town would make comparisons perhaps not for my advantage the expenses in short would be too considerable here it was easy to understand him i therefore proposed to him to add such a ludicrous spectacle as by his advice and assistance might bring great audiences though a thing of a trivial nature here i knew i should tickle him in short i proposed to reinforce bayess troops and with a new set of hobby horses raise two new regiments who should exercise in martial order upon the stage and by their capering and prancing like menagd warhorses divert the multitude and that the captandum vulgus he knew was the sine qua non in the theater this did all i wanted he came into my scheme and was so very full of the additional troops that he undertook to raise them himself which he not only did but attended at all their exercises and musters and reviews was ridingmaster adjutantgeneral and generalissimo when it was performed i met with an applause might satisfy the greatest vanity and my hobbyhorse regiments had as great applause as myself the remaining part of the season went on with great success to the master by my rehearsal and my additional troops had as many spectators at covent garden as his m  s household troops at a review in hydepark this continued till the master brought his orpheus and eurydice on the stage after which there was no occasion for mr bays the twinkum twankum of mr orpheus and the metamorphoses of monsieur harlequin put my troops to the rout however at the close of the season i made a rally and brought myself and my army for one night more into the field to explain i prevailed with mr rich to let me have another benefit the last night but one of performing on the theater for this last season i say another having had about four others within the year  the frequency of my having benefits demands some consideration in this apology as some persons have given themselves airs to censure me for it and besides it may bring out some theatrical anecdotes and rules necessary for future and less experienced actors as the having benefits is supposed to raise a sum of money to reward an actor and as it is raising it in an honest way what crime is it if an actor could get a benefitplay every week o but cries mr oeconomist who will buy but one pitticket in a season this is an imposition on the public and severe tax on your tradesmen your acquaintance and your acquaintences acquaintance ay it might seem so indeed if they were all as for myself but i have more modesty to make unreasonable requests in short sir wisacre there is an art to conduct such things with a gloss and an art of which i am the original inventor i shall illustrate this by matters of fact as i practiced them when i engaged in that notorious trial of my cuckoldom i stood in need of the essence of law for money is the sinews of law as well as war and to raise it the easiest and only way was by having a benefit i asked mr f d this as a favor and a good natured office to enable me to obtain justice for my heartwracking injuries though this was at a very good part of the season he compassionating my necessities complied now comes the thing i thought at that crisis having a benefit in my own name might be not so proper and without it you will say how could you get a full house why i found out a way to have a benefit and a full house and nobody know it not to keep you in suspense i got my father to play for me and mr f d to let me have the house so it was done at once you will say this was very friendly of the master but that is allover two months after i had a benefit in my own name that was mine by right and i need say no more on it but about three months after i wanted another benefit which was in the summerseason then i was engaged to mr rich and got leave for the house and some brotheractors to play gratis but i did not tell the public it was my benefit no i knew better i touched them in a tender point and told them it was to support my dear infant children which i had left by my first wife jenny and so put at the top of the bills for the benefit of miss betty and miss molly etc some indeed saw through this artifice but it passed current enough with the majority at christmas i was to have had another but the weather prevented it i have had another in my course among the actors and another after them because i did not get enough by the former i must observe that on these occasions i always find some topic to display my oratory on which i print at the bottom of my bills either as advertisements or remonstrances or petitions or something or other and circulate them among the gentry and nobility tradesmen acquaintance and strangers besides which i generally speak an epilogue of jo hayness riding on an ass and to show how i can laugh at persons calling me by mocknames i advertised it to be spoke by the young captain in his regimentals riding on an ass this may seem a trifling story to the untheatrical reader but i write this to instruct posterity who are engaged in a theater by what means they may manage their affairs and i hope from these hints some future genius may find much profit and emolument  the season being closed i again retired to charing cross but not to write politics if the reader has any curiosity to know what important affair i went thither for that i might safely negociate it let him peruse the beginning of the subsequent chapter  chap x the situation of affairs at drury lane theater  the scheme to get a new license explained  the reason for the publication of mr c cibbers apology given  the scheme miscarries  a most heroic rhapsody  a dissertation on property  an apology for writing another chapter  i am now entering on a theme which will surprise the public because it is such a piece of secret history as will be a key to several elaborate digressions in the apology of mr colley cibber i must previously observe that in his historical part of the stage he was very well versed in the rebellions revolts and revolutions of his time till he had fixed the government of the stage under a triumvirate of which he himself was one and from the time of his quiting his share in the patent no one is better versed in rebellions revolts revolutions factions oppositions etc etc than myself two persons of such experience might bring about great things in a theatrical state more especially if the people were divided and heats and animosities were fomented among them i have acquainted the reader of some great design which was in embrio and which we only wanted an opportunity to execute this was for my father after having raised uneasinesses and jealousies among mr f  ds company to obtain a license for a new company  some private affairs of mr f  ds gave us the opportunity we so much desired  for as through the confusion things were at drury lane theater and through a violent distemper he could not appear himself and a report prevailing which we industriously rumored as truth that he would never return to the management of his theater again we could not only the better solicit the actors but even the chamberlain and with less opposition to work we went and indeed we at first met with such hopeful success that i was not a little elate and formed much imaginary triumph in my heart however mr f  d took such measures as to the actors that he thought maugre all our projects he should be able to retain a good company at drury lane to traverse this design and with a specious view of acting justly mr c y c r represented to the l d ch n that there was an absolute necessity for having another company formed as mr f d had very injuriously treated his chief actors and that there were very large arrears due to them to impose still the more on the ch n there were some actors waited on the l d ch n introduced by mr c c and made such remonstrances as were thought proper thus we carried on the solicitation which occasioned an order to be sent to mr c d prompter of the theater that none of the company should engage in any other company or elsewhere without his knowledge and permission this we looked in a point gained in our favor to prevent any actors making fresh agreements which mr f  d thought some persons viewed it in another light and imagined it was to prevent any actors going from him when these negociations were thus carrying on we had we thought another favorable incident mr f  d was taken extremely ill of the gout and he was in such danger that his life was despaired of nay it was reported one night that he was dead and it was inserted as truth in the public papers of next day i first heard it at the tavern and that was the occasion of my bacchinalian transports quo me bacche rapis etc in a prior chapter but though this report was false yet so dangerous an illness prevented his bstling about as he might otherwise have done yet he managed so well that our representation of the affairs of drury lane theater lost considerably of their weight as great part was on examination found not to be strictly true and that mr c c had notoriously uttered several fibs both of the state of drury lane and the menager of it  it may be objected that mr c c and myself and others were very great scoundrels to take such an advantage of a gentleman being in a desperate illness and who had at a vast expense purchased the patent and had redeemed the haymarket company from the desperate state they labored under some added that not only taking such an advantage was unjust but that telling fibs were more so  but pray let me answer all objectors is not in the transacting all state affairs between kings and potentates all advantageous opportunities to be taken does not policy require when any thing offers which may prove beneficial that without any qualm of conscience the prime m r of any kingdom is to make use of it be it never so unjust or detrimental to a rival power suppose the taking of carthagena or even the island of cuba would break the haughty heart of the queen of spain is our ministry to desist gaining part of her dominions for fear of being the death of her not many people would think so though perhaps that tenderheartedness of the m r may be the reason why admiral vernon was not supported with landforces but ne suitor ultra crepidam then sir as for telling a few fibs what mighty matter is there in that when the fibs may go a great way to carry the cause in all caballing theatrical or political fibs are the most essential requisite and moreover it is known in fibbing you must fib roundly if it is not discovered you ten to one impose on those you represent the state of the case to and carry your views and if you are discovered it is only pleading that you yourself have been imposed on by    others were all the fibbers in a court to take shame to themselves for practicing such an art we might soon see some very great men in disgrace then why may not the fibbers or ibbers of a theater take the same scheme without any reflection of scandal i am so far from my thinking an excellence in this practice is any reproach that as for my part i value myself on it mightily and intend for the public good to write an essay on the art of fibbing which i design to publish next winter by subscription but a thorough answer to all moral objections is mine and mr colley cibbers philosophy if our conscience can away with it we may lay our hands to our honest hearts and vow we have acted like men of honor and who can gainsay us  the reader now acquainted with these anecdotes concerning mr colley cibber may if they have read his apology account not only for his political essays on the stage his chimaerical thoughts for the improvement of it but also for so true a publication of it at the time he was soliciting a new license as i am a candid historian i will not conceal some remarks which i have heard made when his history and his conduct have been compared as if they were inconsistent with one another he is said throughout his apology to have endeavored to prove that the multiplicity of theaters is contrary to the useful consequences which may accrue from a wellgovernd stage true i know it is a common opinion says he that the more play houses the more emulation i grant it but what has this emulation ended in why a daily contention who shall surfeit you with the best plays so that when what ought to please can no longer please your appetite is again to be raised by such monstrous presentations as dishonor the taste of a civilized people if indeed to our several theaters we could raise a proportionable number of good authors to give them all different employment then perhaps the public might profit from their emulation but while good writers are so scarce and undaunted critics so plenty i am afraid a good play and a blazing star will be equal rarities  vide c cibbers apology p     this has been urged as a reason why mr colley cibber should not have solicited a license to have set up a new company and that it was against his own maxims but pray not so fast he remains in this opinion still against the multiplicity of play houses in the main and if he had set up another it would have been only in ordine ad to have ruined mr f ds company and to have reduced the number to two again to effect this he is such a judge of taste he would have given no monstrous presentations but such as might have done an honor to a civilized people but then say you this he says himself could not be done without good authors and good writers are very scarce they are so but would there not have been himself and myself to have entertained the town so that all these sutile objectios fall to the ground again says mr objector after mr colley has entered himself a voluntary champion for restraining the number of playhouses and given the public a pourtrait of his mind to let them see how far he is or is not a blockhead when he pretends to talk of serious matters above his capacity he thus strengthens his arguments and now we have seen the consequence of what many people contend for variety of play houses how was it possible so many could subsist on what was to be seen how could the same stock of plays supply four theaters which not well support two had this law been made seven years ago i should not have parted with my share in the patent under a thousand pounds more than i received for it  so that as far as i am able to judge both the public as spectators and the patentees as undertakers are or might be in a way of being better entertained and more considerable gainers by it all this amounts to no more than as this law prohibits an unlicensd number of playhouses the value of the direction of a theater may increase and that mr colley cibber might have been a very considerable gainer if he obtained a license to have been an undertaker of another we had such sanguine hopes of success that we had fixed on the place to have encamped in and have opened our campaign it was the operahouse in the haymarket where the revolters of his own time fixed but which he would have had altered to the plan of drury lane this is hinted at in several parts of the apology but in page     he proves it a proper spot and the hopes that such a project might succeed from the vast increase of the buildings grosvenorsquare etc i have mentioned the situation of that theater has received considerable advantages a new world of people of condition are nearer to it than formerly and i am of opinion that if the auditory part were reduced a little more to that of the model of drury lane an excellent company of actors would now find a better account in it than in any other house in this populous city let me not be mistaken i say an excellent company and such as might be able to do justice to the best plays and throw those latent beauties in them which only excellent authors can discover or give life to if such a company were now there they would meet with a quite different set of auditors than other theaters have been lately used to  here in his own words you have the groundwork of our scheme and who is there can doubt but under his direction and mine the morals of a theater must have been reformed for what by our known virtues and experienced knowledge of goodbreeding we should have made our theater the school of manners virtue and politeness for has he not in his chap ii chimaerical thoughts of making the stage useful built a theater in the air to prove apology p    k   his concern that the theaters have not a better pretense to the care and further consideration of those governments where they are tolerated  there was a time adds he and not yet out of many peoples memory when it subsisted upon its own rational labors when even success attended an attempt to reduce it to decency and when actors themselves were hardy enough to hazard their interest in the pursuit of so dangerous a reformation  now as all know what was may be again we flattered ourselves that we should have brought about a theatric reformation and more especially from the publication of the apology having laboriously and zealously shown in it what  c cibbers apology p  0  regard was always paid to the power of a lord chamberlain and what influence and operation that power must naturally have in all theatric revolutions  but oh thou cursed inconstant fickle  b  ch thou strumpet deity fortuna hight thou thou with painted looks and eyes alluring who smiled delusive on my fairest hopes just just upon the brink of full enjoyment with jilting mein thou turnst thy backside on me and smilst indignant at my aimed embrace curse on my wayward fate  curse on my stars  under what star theatric was i born  ye gods why gave ye to me such a soul that swells and pants with such ambitious throws yet torture it with disapointments vile fl  ds superior genius has undone me he eagle like over me  a mere tomtit  towers yond my sight and mocks my aching view   but it is well  anon and yet anon the goddess fair occasion called may smile and i will catch her by her forelock fast for so the fair is gained  and so i sink into the calmer thoughts of mild philosophy   oh gentle reader excuse this heroic agitation of my soul the thoughts of what i am going to tell you hit the cause that touched my brain and threw me into this passionate rhapsody after all our hopes after all our negociations solicitations representations lucubrations and apologies the theater colle cibber built in the air must still remain in nubibus though ditto p  0  it was in a much better taste than any he had seen and we have only now leave to play with the project in fancy  in plain english my lord chamberlain denied us a license on so foolish a reason begging my lords pardon for the expression as he would not consent without any foundation of reason for us to invade a gentlemans property but my lord has another way of thinking as to moral obligations than c y c r and however he may approve of him as an entertaining companion he has no opinion of him as a moral philosopher it is not becoming in me to call his graces parts into question nor do i they are above the description of my pen though that can sometimes soar such heights as may be beyond the ken of common understanding but i may ask this digressive question what is property  it is merely having the possession of a thing which possession gives a just right to it till dispossessed thereof for as possession is universally allowed to be nine parts of the law out of ten it is to be supposed it is nine parts of justice out of ten and consequently should be the balance of every mans actions  as for instance if a tradesman viz a woollen draper haberdasher if a tradesman viz a woollen draper haberdasher mercer laceman etc had particular goods in their shops their goods during that time are their properties they are so well the tailor purchases some of them from the several shops and they become his now if i order the tailor from those goods to make me a handsome suit of clothes and he makes them and delivers them to me will any one say they are the property of the woollendraper haberdasher laceman etc or tailor no they are mine  ay says sir sneerer if you have paid for them  ay sir if i have not paid for them too  the clothes durante possessione are legally mine and as my property i wear them  the tailor indeed may bring his action at law and then i play least in sight but still wear the clothes  he forces me to the verge of the law i still wear the clothes and till he is able to beat me out of all my strong holds i make no consideration of his claim to them or an equivalent for them  property fluctuates and changes masters it is a quick inheritance haees haeredem velut unda supervenit undam forgive the lowness of my illustration and making myself an example but truth is truth however mean the object may be that demonstrates it if you would have a more elevated idea behold the fluctuating property of the greatest empires and kingdoms of the world your medes and your persians are no longer governed by their cyruss and dariuss  alexanders family are not in possession of the territorial property which he himself took from others  but why need i be prodigal of my historical learning  does not the illustrious kouli kan at this very day make the dominions of the sophi of persia his property and has he not made the vast riches and provinces of the great mogul his property and is he not meditating to make other provinces of the ottoman empire his property  but you say this is injustice and that he in fact is an usurper  a fico for distinction of names while he is in possession of his territories and at the head of his armies he is a prince  i only wish i could be the kouli kan of the theater and the mobile might give me whatever name or title they pleased besides to distinguish me by  but do not our european potentates act on the same principle if they can once gain possession by fraud or force of a convenient island or tract of land or dominion do they not think they have a just right to it and that it becomes their property  would any good englishman doubt our indisputable right to gibraltar minorca jamaica  or hispaniola and all the american world if we could take them from the spaniards and afterward keep them  if therefore i either vi or fraud could get any part of the theatric dominions am i to blame  or if i the young captain at land meeting with a rich trading tailor should plunder him of a laced suit of cloath why am i to be censured more than another captain at sea who plunders a caracca sp o but says my opponent i suppose  the public property of nations and the private property of subjects are differently to be considered  i am your humbe servant for that my dear by my philosophy i look upon the state of nature as a state of war all is sair play in this scramble for the goods of the world and i think myself in this respect acting in as just principle as any potentate living why was not i the twentieth by descent from a long restive race of droaning kings ye gods why gave ye me a monarchs soul and crusted it with base plebeian clay drydens spanish friar what a bustlemaster general would i have made among the princes of the world and elbowd all the monarchs round about me  but non sic dii voluere  therefore in mimic parallel among the plumes of tragedy and struts of ambition i show a dawn of what had i been a prince i should have acted   but to return from this digression on property  our hopes were frustrated as to forming a new company by the sanction of a license from the lord chamberlain and mr colley cibbers ambition and private views have the same fare as mine  he indeed may please himself with his follies having a plentiful provision for life and still have the joy he took in the end of an old song  my mind my mind is a kingdom to me he like a loose philosopher may again say me while my laughing follies can deceive blessed in the dear delirium let me live rather than wisely know my wants and grieve but for my part i must again submit to return to the stage a servant instead of a manager which had i known some weeks ago this apology had not as yet have been wrote nor my fathers would not as yet have been published but as i am drawn into this historical narration of the stage which is in fact a true and necessary appendix to his i will make it as complete as possible for which reason i shall enter on another chapter that i may give the theatrical characters of the principal actors now living not only as it will be in mr colley cibbers manner which i promised to follow in my title page but in fact as this apology will not be an historical view of the stage during my own time without them the drawing characters is the most difficult province of a historian and very few either ancient or modern have succeeded in them they who sneer at cibbers apology in general approve of his characterizing his cotemporaries they own the draught is masterly and the coloring entertaining i am sensible therefore how hard the task must be to give the pourtrait of living players when all the town is acquainted with the originals however as i am of a strong opinion this apology as well as the other may live to late posterity i am not willing my cotemporaries should be buried in oblivion and perhaps there may be no apologist theatrical hardy enough to succeed me my friends of the stage will therefore excuse my manner partiality and expressions and what they may not approve as being too free pass over with a smile of contempt for to conclude i shall be as free with mr c cibber and myself as any of them whose characters i shall draw up as parallels to one another as i have given you reader the bill of fare of the next chapter it is in your own option whether you will set down to the meal  chap xi and last the several theatrical characters of some of the present actors  a parallel between the author and mr colley cibber  the conclusion  as i am now entering on a province which is esteemed the most difficult for an historian to succeed in i am under some apprehensions that this chapter may not only be the least entertaining but may give offense when i have no manner of design that it should to draw characters requires not only a great judgment but great art though you describe persons that have lived some years or centuries before you write but to draw the characters of persons living  hic labor hoc opus est  equally to avoid flattery or censure and to keep strictly to a judicious narration is what few historians have succeeded in at all but to characterize your cotemporaries then living requires such an honest impartiality that still sewer have attempted it  on these considerations i would have waved giving any characters of my theatrical brethren but on the remonstration of some friends that my history would not be complete without them i must in part enter on this arduous undertaking jacta est alea as caesar said  the die is cast  well pass the rubicon proceed i must and will therefore in the conclusion of this prefatory paragraph i shall choose the motto of another great man fari que sentiat and so mr reader and sir actor i hope you will peruse the rest of this history with candor if my pictures are such as you in truth know them to be for as the gazetteer says most writers seem to have it more in view to display their own parts or make their court to the person uncharacterized to his relations friends and dependants than to draw him truly such as he was and of many such it may be said as was said of the painter who excelled in coloring and proportion that his pictures had every excellence but likeness  it may be wondered why i quote this author but i am willing to pay all deference to an author who has been engaged in the same cause with myself and perhaps my individual self i only wish my pictures may have some likeness which will i believe atone for the want of other excellencies presuming this attempt may be neither disagreable to the curious or the frequenters of a theater take it without any farther preface  in the year    0 the principal actors or whom i think the principal actors may be thus impartially and concisely portrayed  as tragedians claim from their costly plumes and trappings a superiority of merit over the comedians i shall begin with them and taking the liberty of deviating from cicero salust clarendon and all other historians except colley cibber shall describe them just as i think proper  q  n at drury lane house and dlne at covent garden are the personae dramatis which are without competitors they both play the chief characters in the same cast therefore i shall consider their different characters together q  n has been many years on the stage and has gradually rose up to that height of reputation he at present enjoys when drury lane theater was under the direction of the late mr rich he was in the inferior class and the lieutenant of the tower in cibbers alteration of richard the third was one of the principal parts he performed the cast of several plays in print fully prove his abilities were then thought but very insignificant however on a new company setting up at lincolnsinnfields he was engaged in it and has ever since but more especially on the death of boheme gradually rose to a great degree of favor with the public mr booths quitting the stage still set him in a fairer light and indeed left him without a rival he had for some time appeared without any competitor when all on a sudden there appeared at goodmansfields a young tragedian from dublin this was d l ne novelty youth a handsome figure etc took off from any severe criticism on his elocution and action in short though so far from the polite end of the town he drew to him several polite audiences and became in such a degree of repute that comparisons were made between him and q  n nor was he without admirers of both sexes who gave him the preference he was not insensible of this and determined to leave goodmansfields and indulge his ambition at one of the theaters royal q n just at that time left covent garden for drury lane and he engaged with mr rich at covent garden and in two or three years on the stage gained that station on it which most of the other actors could not in many years attain to q n has the character of a just speaker but then it is confined to the solemn declamatory way he either cannot work himself into the emotions of a violent passion or he will not take the fatigue of doing it the partiality of his friends says he can touch the passions with great delicacy if he will but general opinion affirms he has neither power of voice or sensation to give love or pity grief or remorse their proper tone and variation of features d l ne is also esteemed a just player and though he has often a more loud violence of voice yet either from an imitation of q n or his own natural manner he has a sameness of tone and expression and drawls out his lines to a displeasing length but that loud violence of voice is useful to him when anger indignation or such enraged passions are to be expressed for the shrill loudness marks the passion which the sweet cadence of q ns natural voice is unequal to in such parts especially alexander d l ne pleases many for the million as c c says are apt to be transported when the drum of the ear is soundly rattled but on the contrary q ns solemn sameness of pronunciation which conveys an awful dignity is charmingly affecting in caio d l ne is young enough to rise to greater perfection q n may be said now to be at the height of his if d l ne has the more pleasing person q n has he more affecting action both might soon appear with more advantage if they were on the same stage the rivalship of d l ne would give a spirited jealousy to q n and force him to exert himself and q ns judgment would improve the unfinished action of d l ne but they are the caesar and pompey of the theaters and one stage would be incompatible with their ambition q n could bear no one on the footing as an equal d l ne no one as a superior  m lw d is an actor with all the happiness of voice that can be imagined and a personage very well turned for the lover or the hero nor when he is not indolently negligent does he often betray a want of judgment his voice is sweet with an uncommon strength and in the decadence of it there is a softness which adapts it to touch the passions of grief love pity or despair in comedy the easiness of his dialogue in the genteel characters seems very amiable and though in his action and speech he does not imitate that quick snipsnap catch of the late mr wilks to express spirit and vigor yet his voice and gesture show such a vivacity as are the just effects of nature in low comedy he has been seen to succeed beyond expectation and to speak all in a word according to mr cibbers description of mountford he is or might be the true representative of him  of mr william m ls i have said something in a preceding chapter all i shall add here is that he is not excellent in tragedy the inanity of his voice being unequal to the swellings and throws of the sublime in comedy he succeeded to mr wilkss parts has caught something of his catch in the voice is always very busy on the stage and what all actors ought to value themselves upon very perfect  griffin and joe miller being dead i shall give no descriptions of them nor of those who have succeeded to their parts for if i should speak of their excellencies i should be tempted to mention the comparative inequality of their successors  like the great apologists method of treating verbruggen keen boheme etc etc etc i shall pass over the rest of the present players as princes of pett fame i shall therefore only speak of two actresses and myself and colley cibber in parallel  mrs cl e is esteemed by all an excellent comic actress and as she has a prodigious fund of natural spirit and humor off the stage she makes the most of the poets on it nothing though ever so barren even though it exceeds the limits of nature can be at in her hands she heightens all characters of humor she attempts nor is she confined only to the hyden miss or pert chambermaid but in spiritous gay characters of high life she always appears with such air mein and action as speak the gay the lively and the desirable she has been by persons who remember both compared to mrs mountsord and by their natural talents for the stage i am apt to believe the comparison not unjust i must however observe mrs mountford appeared with great success en cavalier and made an adroit pretty fellow mrs cl e does not appear in these characters the concealing petticoat better suiting with her turn of make than the breeches it is not from want of spirit or judgment to hit off the fop or the coxcomb as she has evidently proved in the ballad she sings called the life of a beau in which her action and gesture is as pleasing as in any part she performs i could wish she would never attempt serious characters in comedy and to resign the part of ophelia in hamlet in which she is very unequal to herself  yet all will allow that take her all in all she has such talents as make her an excellent actress  though mrs cl e is by far the most excellent actress of the drury lane company and to speak out the severe judgment of experienced critics the only actress who has any excellence in it yet she has a competitor in fame at covent garden mrs h t n stands in the same degree of superiority on this latter stage as mrs cl e does on the former but i must observe that their talents manner air gesture and cast of parts are very different  mrs h t n though past the heyday of her beauty yet betrays so little decay of youth that an inexpressible somewhat in her air face and mein throws out such a glow of health and cheerfulness that on the stage few spectators that are not past it can behold her without desire and in the fullness of my heart i may venture to confess that the desirable is so predominant in her that my soul has a taste or tender for mrs h t n to speak critically of her as an actress in all parts of a gay impertinent or the coquette she has all the female foppery that a giddy lively fantastic creature can be affected with  the language dress motion and manners of a millamant seem naturally her own and i may say of her what the great apologist said of mrs bracegirdle in that part that  c cibbers apology p  0  when she acts millamant all the faults follies and affectation of that agreeable tyrant were venially melted down into so many charms and attractions of a conscious beauty  but besides these foibles of the fair sex she can rise into the decent dignity of a fine lady and charm with the innocent reserve of an indiana as by the fluttering je ne scai quoy of a millamant in tragedy since the death of mrs hallam she stands without any equal competitor for she has that grace in her presence that clear melody in her voice with strength enough to express the violence of some passions and softness to subside into the harmony of others that no actress now performing on either stage can in this light be compared to her  there are some indeed at both houses who throw out some proffers of a genius yet cannot be ranked in any degree of perfection for either they heavily drag the sentiment along with a longtond voice absent eye and inanity of gesture or else with an impetuous velocity of voice staring eye and unmeaning superfluity of action make the performance come out odly disguised or somewhere defectively unsurprising to the hearer  as i mention no particular persons no particular persons can take offense in justice to my own judgment i must acknowledge that i unwillingly acquiesce in the observation of many judges that the two theaters never had at any time so indifferent a set of actresses as at present and among the younger actresses i have not seen one who has shown the least genius for the stage which may ever make its way toward perfection it may seem a matter of wonder to some why they who have been excellent in a theater as cibber wilks and booth did not bring up young actors to succeed them and this was indeed objected to their administration   c cibbers apology p     and this says the apologist was a matter as easy as planting so many cabbages  true it is indeed good actors and good cabbages are not with equal plenty produced however if there is a natural materia in the actor as there is in the cabbage i can see no reason why he should not sprout as well as the cabbage indeed he will afterward require some care to bring him to perfection so does the cabbage this cannot do without the enlivening warmth of the sun and the young actor requires to be cheered by such little parts as may gain him some little applause for c cibbers apology p     public approbation is the warm weather of a theatrical plant  but it seems this would be too much trouble for our theatrical gardiners they were not for turning nursery men of dramatick cabbages but to have bought them at market for says the metaphorical apologist  ditto p     let it be our excuse then for that mistaken charge against us that since there was no garden or market where accomplished actors grew or were to be sold we could only pick them up by chance  as for myself i was a young sprout from so admirable a stem that nature threw out in me several perfections which i may rather call hereditary than acquired and whether i am considered in a theatrical poetical political or moral capacity the reader will observe through the course of this history there is some truth in my motto  scquiturque patrem  though through modesty i am forced to add non passibus aequis which give me leave to render into a paraphrastick couplet   his fathers steps he follows to be great but not with equal pace or equal fate some future historian may thus write of us the father indeed had more of the sal atticum in his genius but then the son excelled him in an open hardy confidence of behavior colleys conduct in life was more on the reserve than thes but by thes making a bustle in the world he showed a superior greatness of soul colley had the cool calmness of a designing courtier the the frank rash spirit of a young captain the father was the greater hypocrite the son was the greater madman  colley rendered himself remarkable by his fopperies the by his extravagancies yet their private virtues public modesty and sentiments of morality were in fact in the one and the other the same though their public conduct was extremely different  colley had rather be immoral than be esteemed so the thought it more glory the more he acquired the character of being so  the reputation of the one was only founded on private rumor but that of the other is on public record in short the father had few equals the son not one  having brought the history of the stage down from the time my father left it to the present vacation    0 i can only add after my exploits hopes and ambition i must return to mr rich as an hired actor and wait in dudgeon some more favorable opportunity to make my attempts on the theatric dominions more successful however those attempts occasioned this apology which will transmit my name and character to late posterity and i may conclude as ovid does  jamque opus exegi quod nee jovis ira nec ignes terram nec poterit nee edax ablere vetustas etc and now i have done a work which neither jove ner all his wrath nor thunderbolts above nor ruthful steel nor alldevouring time shall ever destroy this history sublime finis erratum i pge   for liionst read escourt
