zobeide a tragedy as it is acted at the theater royal in covent garden   deserta per ardua dulcis raptat amor virg the third edition  london printed for t cadell in the strand mdcclxii  to the right honorable lady scarsdale madam i know not whether mankind can be said to have less vanity  but of this i am certain that they have infinitely more delicacy  formerly dedicators met with few difficulties in addressing their patrons  they made them every thing that was wise and good and their patrons in return though they might not approve the production yet gave their authors an entire credit for a clear insight into human nature but contraband traffic brings many a good trade into disrepute and a fair dealer has now often only a limited opportunity of vending his just merchandise how hard then is the condition of us modern dedicators to lavish encomiums where they are not due is not the fashion of the times and now when the subject demands and there is the fairest opportunity of expatiating on the most exemplary character i have your ladyships express prohibition  but public disorders frequently bring the seeds of remedy along with them  if i had spoken as i ought it had been called an universal opinion and your ladyship perceives by this address that i affect singularity but should i in the least have failed the world would have loudly exclaimed that i had said too little and your ladyship still more unjustly have censured me for having said too much  i have the honor to be with the greatest regard  your ladyships sincere friend and obliged servant j cradock  prologue written by dr goldsmith spoken by mr quick in these bold times when learnings sons explore the distant climate and the savage shore when wise astronomers to india steer and quit for venus

our bard into the general spirit enters and fits his little frigate for adventures with scythian stores and trinkets deeply laden he this way steers his course in hopes of trading  yet ere he lands heas ordered me before to make an observation on the shore where are we driven our reckoning sure is lost this seems a barren and a dangerous coast lord what a sultry climate am i under yon illforeboding cloud seems big with thunder upper gallery there mangroves spread and larger than i have seen em  pit here trees of stately size  and turtles in em  balconies here illconditiond oranges abound  stage and apples takes up one and tastes it bitter apples strew the ground the place is uninhabited i fear i heard a hissing  there are serpents here o there the natives are  a dreadful race the men have tails the women paint the face no doubt they are all barbarians  yes it is so i will try to make palaver with them though making signs it is best however keeping at a distance good savages our captain craves assistance our ships well stored  in yonder creek we have laid her his honor is no mercenary trader this is his first adventure lend him aid or you may chance to spoil a

indater scythians hermodon whence this daring insult what strangers these who with intrusive march have passed the summits of high imaus rocks mean they to ravage on the banks of oxus or spoil the plains of innocence and peace  indater our troops whose minds no dangers can appal observing from afar some hasty steps advance with eager speed  the persians meet us when straight a martial youth with haughty mien demanded of us parley with our master  hermodon what master know we here where all are free no kings no subjects but all friends and brothers  indater he said that visiting the persian frontier he wished to see a people far renowned for ancient manners and bleak liberty we offer them safe conduct and protection whilst they present to our astonished sight rich trappings blazing shields gold diamonds pearls the guilty spoils of desolating war but we reject these specious toys of grandeur for poverty is chiefest grandeur here not wealth corrupter of simplicity in short

persians  indater the sun which rises over yon eastern hill and which each morn we gratefully adore shines not on us alone  it shines on persia then may not persia boast its ray divine  hermodon thou little know the secrets of my heart since after four long years in friendship past i still am stranger to her fathers story  what fate mysterious lured him to these climes why persecution still attends his exile for ever as i would sooth him into converse he answers but with tributary tears  indater to this fair countrys maxims and her laws he cheerfully submits  and wayworn age can rarely change the bent of early nature but fairest zobeide   hermodon is worthy of thee and yet i cannot guess the cause her father blushes to speak of whom he is descended his rank his fortunes and his fame unknown  indater whoever he be i am sure he is just and valiant he loves me  he is father to my zobeide  hermodon as no vile aims debase a scythians mind we will not meanly stoop to ask a prize the brightest fairest prize whilst covert fears or foul distrust sit lowering on our motives seek him my son  if no unworthy thoughts shall harbor in his breast  i will consent but see he comes   enter seyfel indater o generous old man thou dear companion of our happy shepherds this day some gallant youths will soon arrive and view with joy the festive rites that wait us i from thy hand this happy day receive a gift more precious than the throne of cyrus what age of service can repay such goodness i cannot speak the feelings of my heart witness ye gods  not hermodon more shares my duty or my

remain  for blessings often recall to mind the evils we have suffered  indater o speak the fatal source of each misfortune if not redress we may at least infuse the sacred balm of sympathizing pity

hermodon  these rocks these trees to me seem nobler than the persian court  hermodon thou once wast great  seyfel i was  hermodon too long my friend thy griefs pent up have preyed upon thy heart i do not hate the great  i love the persians their laws and noble manners i admire though all mankind at first were equal born i strictly hold that subjects should obey those whom their gods make delegates of power simplicitys soft charms in this republic are no fit lessons for monarchic states could thou suppose that i was less attached because in scythia   seyfel if i have long concealed the source of my misfortunes  pardon me pardon a parents doubts  i would lost my all my child here wandered friendless  unprotected  i feared the foul disgraces of her father would fall on her and stain her rising

chains which gall the stubborn neck of liberty  seyfel oppressions arts unworthy of the brave to be the princes slave to enslave his people to crouch or cruelly exact obedience dazzled a while  but

impious man unworthy successor of such a father ecbatan as yet the abode of medias prince at her new court concealed my hoary head till smerdis governing the median realm smerdis who sought the ruin of the virtuous gave a decisive blow to all my hopes the unbridled athamand his sisters son in firm alliance with a noble princess whom persias court had destined to his love his tyrant passions brooking no control demanded zobeide as despotic master  hermodon and did his life repay the glaring outrage  seyfel thrice armed with innocence the undaunted fair compelled our flight into this distant land by me alone she was delivered from him the monsters who surround the impious smerdis more than their common arts employed against us with fairest colors hid the worst designs and couched the dagger laboring to destroy us in media it is treason as at babylon to brand the prince who next must fill the throne  hermodon o dire effects of hellborn servitude is then complaint a crime in persias court can you regret the loss of basest grandeur  seyfel there you awake the thought which wrings my heart smerdis proscribed my life  they seized  they shared employments  wealth  the price

toils  thanks to the pitying gods in these fair climes we found unhopdfor peace would i had here been born all my regret is to have run a desperate mad career in courts and camps attendant upon kings but i perceive my child shut up in deserts regrets the pleasures of her former life and much i fear that reason filial duty combat too weakly each delusive vision courts and their pomp will fascinate our eyes ere bitter ills annoy the sickening soul  hermodon what ills await you here ah what regret with us she is free applauded  honored  no lurking dangers taint this hallowed soil here liberty has fixed her blessed abode and looks with pity down upon the great  seyfel oh i should die content if my dear child hated like me the perfidy of courts but let not my inquietudes repress the dawning joys

haste scythian as late i watched my flocks on yonder hills a splendid troop passed by  their chief i find whose turban glittered on his cloudy brow is bound to search an aged warrior out who formerly was known in medias camps demands of us the place where he is concealed  the unfortunate old man he long has sought for  hermodon o heavens let him pursue him to these arms  indater he there is sheltered whilst i live to guard him  scythian the generous persian comes not to defy a race of shepherds innocent as brave his breast seems laboring with some weighty grief perhaps a banished man some hardy warrior who flies a court unmindful of his service perhaps   second scythian it is said that half worn out with cares he only seeks a safe retreat from danger weeps the past horrors of malignant fate and grateful hails the dawn of rising freedom  hermodon his tears are more suspicious than his presents pardon my anxious doubts  i fear the persians these brilliant slaves are willing to betray us thee my best friend perhaps they seek for here perhaps the tyrant at thy flight enraged demands thy rated life  a spotless chief must sometimes bleed to save the guilty prince  seyfel forgetting princes in these happier climes i am forgotten too  i fear them not  indater well perish all ere this indignant stranger shall offer insult to my more than father  hermodon whoever he be i shall not shun his walks if bold chastise if exiled well protect him  indater let him come on  he shall not cloud our joys a scythians heart is steeled against panic terrors prepare the altar for the approaching nuptials place round it every gift of bounteous nature and there present the hand that combats for thee to seyfel no cares intrude and may the immortal gods bending from high to hear our plighted vows propitious smile on this important hour that gilds or darkens all my future days  end of the first act act ii zobeide sulma sulma but what are your resolves  zobeide here to remain and pass my days in this wild savage desert they shall not see me wearied with an effort to wait the death of a determined father not irritate a power which condemns him when to these climes our flight was first proposed a thousand horrid fears besieged my fancy but time has reconciled these drear abodes it is no more zobeide at a court adored no more the persians jealous of my smiles pursue the footsteps of declining beauty i have sworn a total change of life and manners my only pride to emulate a father  sulma your virtue far surpasses your misfortunes in your abasement i behold your grandeur i must admire you all  is your heart fixed to shun the climes where nature gave you birth when dangers threaten or when ills impend we shun the country which disturbs our quiet but soon the clouds dispersed we feel regret we feel for pleasures which we never knew and nature triumphs over our vanquished fears  zobeide from the loud raging of a vengeful storm heaven grants this gloomy shelter  here my friend now allresignd awhile i will endure nor shall you longer share my adverse fortunes among those friends who have abandoned me you will find some mind compassionate enough to recompense the gratitude i owe you go my dear sulma leave me to my fate  review proud ecbatans most happy people and in these deserts leave your faithful zobeide  sulma rather let sudden death pursue such perfidy if ever i conceive the base design remote from you to court ignoble grandeur i forfeit all for you  your destiny even to the tomb is closely linked with mine but yet i own with horror and surprise i see those charms which monarchs should adore ignobly lavished on a scythian peasant  zobeide when i reflect on the indignant outrage done to my youth my family and name a fatal offspring of the immortal cyrus banished for ever from the persian court for ever bound to curse the faithless athamand when these fell woes are summoned to my view all human things are equal to my eyes all are indifferent  sulma useless constraint do those deep sighs betray a tranquil mind  zobeide cease to disturb the vows i have sworn to heaven i never will review my native land if my frail heart would swerve from dutys path it must be bound in chains which cannot be broken  sulma the unhappy fathers voluntary victim with what reproaches can you load your mind  zobeide with none  gods i renew my vows  never  ye never shall behold the guilt of zobeide  sulma your choice is made then  zobeide all is fixed  my father prefers the son of his most faithful friend  sulma can zobeide   zobeide behold

rites await  impatience chides the tardiness of age whose frozen foot imprints the rocky soil o let me hear thee speak  read in those eyes that i am the happy object of thy choice marriage with us is as a link of nature formed between souls most liberal and pure a warlike youth entreats a warriors daughter will she partake his travels and his fortunes attend his combats or avenge his death shall scythia rival persia in her pride and i receive the worlds best gift in zobeide  zobeide i know thy virtues and esteem thy valor thy open candor and thy generous heart i promise thee i have promised too my father  his choice and mine are sureties for the treaty  indater you speak a language foreign to my soul and whilst you make me blessed destroy the blessing it is said within the walls of ecbatan those eyes have spread a luster through the court but tell me zobeide  is it my misfortune did heaven ordain thee to adorn a throne  zobeide it is not thy misfortune  it is mine  my memory retraces not my glory  i have forgotten all  indater still more adored forget it if thou can  it lives with me can thou contented view this rustic shrine the sacred monument of ancient worship here do our fathers pay their grateful offerings not such as useless smoke in prouder climes but natures gifts fair emblems of their hearts  zobeide that mind must surely err whose narrow scope confines religion to a place or clime a power unknown that actuates the world whose eye is just whose every thought is wisdom regards alone the tribute of the heart pride in his awful sight shrinks back appalled humility is eldest born of virtue and claims her birthright at the throne of heaven  indater some persians newly landed on our shores wish to partake our sports  they will wondering view a people all united but by virtue  zobeide persians what say thou persians   indater thou tremblest can zobeide fear to view a race of slaves  zobeide oh my dear sulma  sulma see your father comes

die with holy freedom  lead on my friends  the ties shall be redoubled that unite us ex hermodon seyfel and scythians athamand i stand immovable  o heaven o destiny o fatal passion bent on my destruction gone is he fled  would he not stay to hear the fiercest demon of infernal vengeance might glut his rage to see a monarch humbled but say my hasan why yon altar burns those lights those garlands  why the nuptial torch a woman too was dragged in haste away at our approach  ye powers what have i seen remorse will change to an avenging fury gods steel my injured heart  hasan think where you are your grandeur serves but to inflame their fierceness they know how to defend  vengeance they adore  they pardon not if once they are offended  athamand i scorn them all  i have seen them in our camps their stoutest warriors and their ablest men a lifeless race compared with persian troops  hasan but sovereigns among themselves   athamand why will thou thwart my stern resolves  the transports that inflame me my passions bear me on and reason not  had i used reason i had never been here zobeide might drag me to earths utmost verge her loaded slave now brings again his chains to

soften here is  hasan hear but a moment   athamand i will not hear  hasan stay  athamand why stay this vile this ignominious rival insults my woes and outrages my honor to make him master of all earthly blessings i cannot take alarm too soon my friend a peasant here is poised against a monarch can any parent force a choice so vile  she is possessed of nobleness of soul nor can demean herself to wed a slave  hasan pride is inconstant  she   athamand raise no foul doubts if pity cannot move her wretched father  my tears despised he trembles at my anger a prince is but a man and man may err

husband who  hasan the valiant indater the hope and glory of this famed republic to zobeide here he swore eternal ardor beneath the cypress shade  at this rude altar as you advanced she sunk overwhelmed with terrors but then a fair attendant crowd pressed on and bore her weeping to yon rustic roofs  athamand no more my friend i can endure no more  my griefs pour in so fast i cannot pause to separate the tortures that surround me why should she tremble when she touched the altar ah why indeed  she knew my glaring crimes she knew an altar could not yield protection she saw her father most unjustly banished herself too driven to these inhuman deserts the sum of all her woes was present to her and i the fatal hated cause of all  hasan her father   athamand had the proud exile read

ancestors have bled  athamand here too i will bleed flourish what martial sounds are those whence are these rustic troops who high in air brandish their threatening spears  hasan such are their sports it is thus they celebrate the festive day by nature fond of valorous exploit but o retire at distance i descry the lingering bride  as yet we are unobserved  let prudence guide you now  the times at

what would athamand  athamand by love conducted from the persian throne i come to cast an empire at thy feet by smerdis death i am lord of half the world i am lord of all if zobeide smiles upon me  zobeide what have thou said too cruel why from afar come thou to plant new troubles in my breast when first i listened to the soothing tale no king enforcing hymens awful rites had doomed thy hand to one more worthy of thee but now  without a crime thou can not share my heart without a crime i cannot listen to thee those hallowed rites have bound my humbler choice take pity and respect the gentle indater   athamand a scythian  so low  so vile   zobeide despise him not he far surpasses athamand in virtue  athamand who could surpass me had i power to charm thee thy love alone would stamp

athamand in these vile haunts can zobeide waste her days  zobeide my days were all beset with hideous terrors till indater became my kind protector if then i live a prey to sullen grief or wan despair  twas athamands decree for he alone condemned me to the desert  athamand i sue to snatch thee hence thy hand as yet has not confirmed this most dishonored union  zobeide i have made my vows to heaven  athamand heaven heard them not kind heaven was deaf in pity to my love  zobeide think on the ills your faithless love has caused think i was driven from a parent soil where every joy pressed onward to my wishes think what i suffered when over trackless wastes i wandered all exposed  when north winds raged and hideous monsters howled their fell complainings where can the wretched find a peaceful shelter ah where indeed when he her only hope forsook despised abandoned and betrayed her  athamand no more my love at this important hour but melt thy fathers heart with soft persuasion  say to him

seyfel it is true he was  a gentle noble youth most generous and humane  and yet reflect there is a harshness in the scythian manners no faults when known escape their punishment  zobeide why should you seek to terrify my mind if i have patient borne for four sad years a weight of woes why am i now suspected i have made a sacrifice of love to duty if i in aught have failed i will atone but will not fear a father or a husband  seyfel think not thy father labored to reproach thee  thy husband was thy choice  he sure is dear o may thy peace be henceforth undisturbed give up this day to merriment and joy forget thy ills  i hasten to the festival exit seyfel sulma ah cruel festival  you then resolve to suffer joyless life in these abodes  zobeide gods gods  sulma your native country

afflicted there are all stored the checkered ills of fortune and greater far those ills ourselves create but when with exile shame disgrace they gather and crowd so fast  after the happiest days  when all these fierce assaults at once unite a heart  a feeble heart can not support them  sulma ecbatan  a great prince   zobeide ah fatal athamand what demon led thee here why to discover this dagger long concealed which must destroy me ah why renewing my disgrace  thy injuries  must all my former wounds now bleed afresh  sulma no longer yield to those inhuman laws by which a cruel parent would enslave you if youre his comfort ought he to oppress you protect his age but never be his victim the bravest troops which persias pride can boast even to these forests have pursued your steps led on

your prince and persia what think you o return with athamand if you have long accompanied the flight of an old parent  lead him back to glory let him renounce his hatred to a court let not his stern destructive rage prevail to draw down vengeance on a guiltless head  zobeide i scorn thy erring counsel  such resolves would cause much bloodshed  plunge us all in ruin my father would expire with grief or rage in short my fate is fixed  i am doomed to slavery  time may alleviate many weighty ills or custom fortify the mind to bear them  sulma meanwhile you weep  with horror you review these barbarous wilds where from the pomp of courts i see you shrink a prey to want and misery repentance then may come too late to aid you what will remain alas to you  zobeide despair  sulma weighed down

add new terrors to my soul what means this dreadful solemn preparation  seyfel my child  i scarce can speak  behold the altar which i this morn adorned with nuptial wreaths with mournful emblems strewn ere set of sun  hermodon the inviolable law which rules our country demands the widowed fair to sacrifice in presence of the gods the murderers blood that hymens flame may be the flame of vengeance that the loved manes of her injured husband the shade that hovers over this mournful land to purer air may take its happier flight replume its wing and waft its way to bliss  zobeide am i to

stranger to those harsh laws which bind these ruder climes athamand is valiant  a valiant chief would never stoop to murder  scythians ye know the worth of godlike courage my husband bled beneath a conquerors arm justice ye surely prize as well as vengeance weigh and resolve  say is it mine to strike to plunge my guilty hands in sacred blood and kill a warrior who is still my king  hermodon and kill a warrior  if thy too timid hand rejecting every claim of rightful marriage the holy ties of gratitude and love shall hesitate to make this expiation  dread the rough maxims of an injured state  zobeide but if the weakness of my sex prevail and i overcome with terror should refuse   scythian he shall expire beneath the sharpest tortures  zobeide you then demand a victim slain by me  hermodon reject not scythias law  zobeide after a pause i accept it takes the dagger hermodon dare thou in presence of the immortal gods confirm this oath  zobeide i swear it cruel men i swear it hermodon ye thirst for blood be sure ye have enough but till the hour ye lead a monarch to your barbarous altars in mercy keep him from my tortured sight meanwhile i would some counsel from my father then act your wills i patiently resign  scythian let us retire my friends  hermodon the widowed fair one declares herself submissive to our law my deepfelt grief will somewhat be appeased if hands like those submit to give us vengeance ex hermodon and scythians seyfel there was a time when through the daring prince i would have stabbed a guilty monarchs heart now pity pleads aloud for the unfortunate and fierce resentments languish in regret  zobeide how could you dive into my inmost thoughts and read each varying struggle of my soul  seyfel i fain would weep thy generous husbands fate but now alas i feel alone for thee this rash detested oath  zobeide you see the altar  should i refuse you know what torments wait him after this fatal blow  and all our sufferings o say  will you too sink upon his tomb  seyfel i there would die  zobeide no live  i charge you live the gallant persians will revenge this outrage the youths of ecbatan to scythias wilds from taurus will descend with winged speed will like a torrent pour their rapid force and drive these monsters from their rocky fastness  seyfel alas i greatly fear   zobeide talk not of fear it is allied to guilt  we will not fear it is true the gross inhabitants of scythia are savage cruel  not invincible but oh meanwhile by every awful tie secure the pardon of our captive friends even as the victim bleeds let all be free and pass the mountains under faith of treaty  seyfel assure thyself my child i will obtain it  and yet this treaty serves but to confound me the prince no less will perish at the altar  the persians will not rouse but to avenge him  zobeide i have weighed my destiny and all is resolved  seyfel i freeze with horror  zobeide go i partake it all the time is precious leave me to summon strength in solemn suit invoke each conscious being to bear eternal record to the vow you firmly urge not scythians dare renounce this dread recognizance from earth to heaven  seyfel i go but sore oppressed with ills like these whateers decreed my doom is fixed despair exit zobeide how long must i restrain this storm of grief  nor greater sure inflicted by the gods my sulma comes  and i unload my heart  enter sulma sulma and do we meet again what scenes of blood since last we parted o let us part no more till fate has finished its last cruel edict  zobeide thou yet must see a far more piteous sight  sulma more piteous sight  zobeide will never submit to satiate savage minds with guilty slaughter  zobeide think thou that i will complain to scythian monsters complain to seas to rocks to steel or adamant  for them i left a people most renowned sometimes unjust  but polished great and generous shall i complain to scythians  nations earth o kings what outrage gods masters of thunder unite with me  let death stalk uncontrolled till taurus high he heap on heap piles mountains of the slain what means this frantic rage vain vain regrets these imprecations serve but to distract me o rage what art thou flatterer of a moment a shortlived passion preying on thyself i sink thy slave  i feel thy deadly power thou fixed eternal foe to steady virtue  sulma let reasons balmy breath assuage your griefs youre not reduced to serve their cruel purpose  zobeide then athamand must share the bitterest tortures  sulma but oh that secret love which ardent pleads   zobeide shall ever plead  how can i then resolve to plunge a dagger in a monarchs heart who came to lay his empire at my feet  sulma it is so abhorred a crime  the guilty scythians whose barbarous altars reek with human blood ah did they know your love  would stay your hand armed to destroy him  zobeide no they would urge the deed such are their cruel hearts  such such is man by simple nature kind nay often times good but if provoked his vengeance is unbounded  sulma the wretched seyfel to these scythians bound in closest leagues of amity  linked with them let him bear out the ills he solely caused  zobeide too much for me he suffers  i only wish to weed each rankling poison from his breast not add new troubles to his reverend age but o ye powers attend his last request bend the stern purpose of this rustic senate confirm the important oath  heal persias woes nor force me act a deed yourselves abhor  sulma you now give life to my affrighted sense solemn music at a distance zobeide those solemn sounds proclaim the eventful hour and summon me to more than death  trembling i stand the shock  revisit mortal clime spirits of good if when in fleshly mould something ye knew of what i now endure aid my firm labors  in a righteous cause it is yours to succor  and if your suppliant acts obedient to your wills  reward the deed  twine round my brow the wreaths of brightest fame laurels which fade not gems which cannot decay dead march scene the last hermodon seyfel zobeide scythians first scythian hail to the shadowy grove whose deepfelt gloom still adds new horrors to this awful scene guard round the rustic altar worthy friends lest footsteps rude invade these hallowed haunts or brawling noise profane the solemn hour  hermodon sure here some secret unknown power resides whose eye pervades and well approves this offering at this dread hour he sits in mystic state and chills the soul with awe and veneration  zobeide what power can here reside of good to man these are the favored haunts of dim despair of fireeyd madness or sunk melancholy here murder prowls  here when that witch the night high poised in air performs her secret rites and spreads her baneful mantle over the skies  hermodon misdeem us not if when stern justice calls we rigidly obey its awful summons a murdered son demands this expiation it is due to us to him to heaven and vengeance  first scythian nor vengeance dearer than our countrys law  zobeide enough enough  swear but by every power the blood of all my countrymen is sacred and this fell hand submits to give you vengeance  scythian all shall be spared we swear  the immortal gods never saw a scythian violate his oath now lead him to the altar  zobeide a moment stay  yet why should terror more pervade my heart i scorn the woman in me  lead him on  i will firmly brave this thunderbolt of heaven  seyfel and do i live to this  o teeming earth open thy wide jaws in mercy to receive me  sulma inexorable fortune  enter athamand guarded athamand dear zobeide take  take the steel let thy uplifted hand pierce a fond heart devote to thee alone preserve the honored lives of all my friends give me my death i unrepining fall i kiss the trembling hand which fearful strikes nor think it ruin to be so destroyed to bleed for zobeide and my orphand country  zobeide o stop this torrent of oerwhelming goodness my generous cruel prince  words armed like these unnerve my feeble hand and quite subdue me breathe sharpest curses sting me to my purpose distract me not with tender protestations nor vanquish courage with such kind endearments  athamand yet hear me speak the source of each misfortune and though too late assert my injured honor smerdis to add new firmness to his throne urged me to wed the daughter of a king nearest allied in empire and dominion but oh my heart was fixed on thee alone not daring openly to thwart his will i seemingly consented  but determined instant with previous nuptials to prevent it i seemingly consented  accursed hour twas then report bore on its rapid wing the shameful tale of my illseeming purpose and ere my trusty friends could search thee out and tell each fearful oath i would sworn to heaven thy fears betrayed thee to believe me false thy fears alas had driven thee from thyself and borne thee far from me from peace and persia  zobeide and was thy purpose just  what then am i thy truth to me has dragged thee to thy ruin thou fixed aloft triumphant on a throne loved by the people savored by the gods wide as the sun had spread thy blessings round thee but oh i have hurled thee from the giddy height and plunged thee deep in guilt and endless misries the groans of all my country plead against me illomend visions fright my madning brain and furies ring a knell of dire presages  hermodon the impatient hour reproves our long delay  seyfel o let me kneel before my honored prince   scythian away do thou too   hermodon we will not pause proceed   zobeide insatiate monsters stay  ye know not sure the guilt ye would enforce  athamand is my prince nay more for i adore him  i here avow my secret love  i here declare my passion  i here abjure those nuptials which have bound me  athamand i die content  hermodon what means this frantic woe nature herself is sick at thy lamentings  zobeide when scythians fall no stars withdraw their blaze an atom sinks unheeded  unregarded  but o thy fate drinks dry a nations eyes all persia sinks one great stupendous ruin and i become the murderer of a world  athamand this kind embrace oerpays whole years of anguish blessed in thy love i leave the world to fate  zobeide long has the captive worn the galling chain but now to hail the dawn of rising joys to view some holier land where mercy reigns where peace shall bloom with blessings ever new hail happy land  there there again to rest where man can not oppress or i offend him spare but his life and thus to finish mine stabs herself o live my prince thus dying i entreat thee  hermodon zobeide  seyfel my child  sulma my ever honored friend  hermodon take off his chains we grant his rated life  athamand talk thou of life to one all gashd with wounds torn on the wheel or struggling in his tortures his limbs all mangled or his heart destroyed no no this reeking steel from zobeides wound prevents the greater curse kills himself zobeide then all is lost  nor even my death can expiate these disasters thou who alone can judge the feeble heart at length look pitying on me  whilst these faint accents languish on my tongue whilst life stands trembling on the brink of fate i fain would plead  but thou art just  though i am  dies athamand the struggles past and the world sinks before me extend your mercy to my sole request let one small spot enclose our last remains it is all i ask and persia will requite you what now is all the baseless dream of power ambitions fire the lust of wealth or empire the scene once closed each glittering prospect fails  the dreary mansions of the peaceful grave receive alike the scythian and the monarch now now i sink  my zobeide  mercy heaven dies hermodon bear off my wretched friend  woes great as these press heavy on his years  submit we to our fate

epilogue by mr murphy spoken by mrs yates well fare the man peace to his gentle shade the bard who first made epilogues a trade else what a life an actress must pursue  to weep and rave is all she would have to do upon the stage with warring passions sore to fret her hour and then be heard no more now after poison daggers rage and death we come again to take a little breath rally the pit set belles and beaux at odds and be a mere freethinker to the gods to the upper gallery chat in familiar strain the boxes maul  an epilogue like gaming  levels all not even poor bays within must hope to be free from the lash  his play he writ for me it is true  and now my gratitude you will see why ramble with voltaire to eastern climes to scythian laws and antiquated times change but the names his tragedy at best slides into comedy and turns to jest as thus  a statesman old and out of place sour discontented malice in his face in these blessed days we but suppose the case flies from st jamess to his own estate to chew the wisdom of each past debate how in the house he made a glorious stir with sir i move  and mr speaker sir zobeides his daughter sophy  oh farewell for her each haunt that charms a modern belle adieu almacks cornellys masquerade sweet ranelagh vauxhalls enchanting shade squire groom makes love rich yes a vast domain wellbred  the savage scythian of the plain the match

of life what not elope is that a modish wife poor fool she doubts says no the husband dies now stab yourself says bays but nature cries how sacrifice myself for vain renown john put the horses to and drive to town that would be life the manners painted high but our bard makes  to moisten every eye a widow with a prince refuse to fly yet after all excuse him ladies pray for sure there is some nature in his play a first attempt let no keen censure blight hereafter he may soar a nobler flight drop one kind tear give him that slender token and hither come till the pantheon open finis
