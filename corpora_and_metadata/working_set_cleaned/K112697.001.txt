patrons of this work the following historical collections are most respectfully inscribed by their very obliged and most devoted faithful humble servant  the author london march  st      preface every work on the subject of topography founded on authentic records and executed with accuracy and fidelity has a natural claim upon the patronage of that particular place or district of which it treats the following may in some degree boast of more extensive pretensions two considerations making an history of newcastle upon tyne of general and national importance its situation not far from the borders of scotland which rendered it one of the principal frontier towns during the hostilities with the sister kingdom and since that unhappy time its extensive coal trade  the oldest printed account of that place is a small book in quarto consisting of thirtyfour pages and entitled chorographia or a survey of newcastle upon tyne etc newcastle printed by s b      s p d dilectis burgensibus et probis hominibus novi castri super tinam w g  the last letters stand for the initials of william gray of whom i have not been able to recover any particulars  the greys of backworth in northumberland are said to be of the same family this work an imperfect outline but which is extremely scarce was reprinted in the harleian miscellanies vol iii in      with some additional remarks  another small quarto volume on the same subject very rarely to be met with is entitled englands greivance discovered in relation to the coal trade with the map of the river of tyne and situation of the town and corporation of newcastle etc by ralph gardener of chriton chirton in the county of northumberland gent london      it is dedicated to the lord protector cromwell consists of two hundred and eleven pages and is ornamented with the heads of several kings and queens of england the author appears to have been a most pointed enemy to the magistrates of newcastle the mayor and corporation of newcastle upon tyne in their answer to the complaint of ralph gardener to the committee appointed for trade etc      a ms which i have read expressly say that that writer broke the goal of newcastle last summer being there imprisoned for diverse great sums of money and again imprisoned at the suit of the sheriff of the said town and to this they attribute his malicious charge  the ms life of alderman barnes which i shall often have occasion to cite in a note p   0 informs us that upon some methods agreed on for reformation of manners in the town according to that clause in the charter which impowers them to make be laws there was one gardener writ a malicious invective against the government of newcastle but he got his reward being afterward at york hanged for coining  chirton where he lived is a village east of newcastle near the town of sheilds he was says bourne a bitter enemy to this town and did all the mischief to it that lay in his power as appears in every page of his book in which are numbers of falsities    from each of these curious tracts i have adopted in the subsequent collections whatever i thought worthy of being preserved  with regard to ms authorities i shall constantly refer my readers to the great national repositories  the heralds and augmentation offices the british museum the rolls chapel and the tower of london  the bodleian library at oxford the public library and those of trinity and bennet colleges in the university of cambridge were open to my inspection  i found a very copious source of unedited materials in the archives of the corporation of newcastle upon tyne permission was granted to me in the most liberal manner by the late john baker esquire alderman of that town during his last mayoralty to inspect all the records with liberty at the same time to make what extracts i thought proper   my honored patron the duke of northumberland condescended to allow me the liberty of perusing and extracting whatever i found to my purpose from many of the valuable records of his illustrious house  i was indulged with the free use of a ms collection entitled an abstract in order of time of the charters and other records concerning the town of newcastle upon tyne  it appears to have belonged to some former recorder or town clerk but comes no lower down than the fifth year of the reign of king charles the first  i cite this under the name of the aubone ms it having belonged to the late mr aubone secretary to the trinityhouse a copy of it taken by mr aubones permission is preserved in the library of john erasmus blackett esquire alderman of newcastle that gentleman used his utmost endeavors but without success to obtain for me a sight of the milbank ms so often quoted by bourne   i have derived very considerable information from a ms in folio which i call the murray ms having received the loan of it from a gentleman mr george parker to whom it was bequeathed by the late mr james murray attorney at law mr murray served his clerkship to mr ord attorney at law in newcastle  he was afterward in the townclerks office  the ms devolved to him on the death of mr ord i have some reasons for thinking that the greatest part of this collection was made by sir robert shaftoe on recorder of newcastle mr murray died in      see inscriptions in st andrews churchyard in the following work  it is written in various hands and evidently at different periods so that probably it has also been the property of some former recorder or town clerk  i was favored with the perusal of a curious ms by the present possessor john medley esquire alderman of newcastle upon tyne it is entitled a catalogue of all the mayors and sheriffs of his majestys town and countye of newcastle upon tyne with their coats of arms and the reigns of the several kings and queens of this land with certain briefs of chronicles that happened in their several reigns since anno domini      i call this throughout the following work the

family arms viz gules on a chevron argent three mullets fable this is doubtless the identical ms mentioned by bourne in page     of his history of newcastle in the introduction to the first volume of the archaeologia p    notes it is said that mr elstob son of ralph elstob merchant at newcastle upon tyne who was born in      fellow of university college oxford and died rector of the united parishes of st swithin and st mary botham in london      collected for an history of newcastle but what is become of the ms is not known  for this collection i made every inquiry but in vain     i have occasionally made considerable use of a ms life of ambrose barnes merchant and sometime alderman of newcastle it is in folio closely written with a dedication to sir theodore talbot it contains several curious anecdotes but the writer whoever he was appears to have been deeply tinctured both with religious and political fanaticism  the dedication signed with the initials m r is dated june   th       from bournes history of newcastle upon tyne a thin folio volume which was published three years after the death of the author a d      a circumstance which both apologizes and accounts for the various contradictions with which it abounds i have selected whatever i thought authentic and interesting to my subject in the newcastle courant for november  0th      are inserted mr bournes proposals for publishing this work by subscription he had advertised for materials in the same courant for september   th       the posthumous work was advertised ibid april   th      to be delivered to the subscribers on the  d of may following  mr bourne after a very lingering illness died about four oclock in the afternoon of february   th          george allan esquire f s a of darlington in the county of durham favored me in the most liberal and polite manner with the loan of several volumes of mss copied from original records remaining in the church of durham and which had been bequeathed to him by the indefatigable transcriber the rev mr randall late of that city with liberty of making such extracts as i should think proper i cite these passim by the title of randalls mss dr hunter of durham often mentioned with respect by the learned mr horsley in his britannia romana transcribed a great number of records relating to newcastle upon tyne from the archives of the church of durham as i gather from randalls mss and sold a copy of bournes history aforesaid with these transcripts interleaved to mr akenhead bookseller at newcastle for five guineas in    0 this collection was the groundwork of mr akenheads engaging in the design to publish an history of newcastle for which he gave out proposals not long after the above purchase this intended work was however never published nor could i by any means procure a sight of the interleaved copy of bournes history but i have every reason to think that i found transcripts of the same records in randalls mss mr akenheads proposals for printing by subscription a history of newcastle upon tyne in two volumes in quarto were published in the newcastle journal some time in the year    0     i selected some very interesting materials from the ms collections of the late george gray of newcastle upon tyne esquire barrister at law all of which together with his library had been sold by his executors to mr robert harrison formerly of that town of whom they were purchased with several notes extracts and references to books concerning the same place which he himself had made and collected in the course of his very extensive reading for the use of the following work  vicinity and other circumstances once tempted me to hope that in the course of my progress in it i should have profited much by his judicious observations but from the circumstance of his removing to the south of england and of my leaving the north before his return my expectations on that head were entirely frustrated  sir matthew white ridley bart governor of the merchants company indulged me in the politest manner with the liberty of inspecting the records of that society  alexander adams esquire steward of the hostmens company did me a similar favor with respect to those of that fraternity  i am indebted to john erasmus blackett esquire for the loan of a curious ms collection of pedigrees etc which formerly belonged to the calverley family and to their late most respectable representative sir walter blackett bart  i owe the perusal of dr ellisons ms collections with many other attentions to the kindness of his grandson the rev nathaniel ellison m a vicar of bolam in northumberland and lecturer of st andrews in newcastle upon tyne  the late george stephenson esquire procured me leave to inspect the old books and other records of the trinityhouse of that town  liberty to examine and collect notes from the parish registers was granted me in the most friendly manner by the several clergy and keepers of the registers in newcastle and gateshead i must not omit to mention that a collection of neat drawings of monuments arms etc in the several churches of newcastle was purchased of mr lambert formerly clerk to the recorder of newcastle for the use of this work and had the copies of the inscriptions on the monuments been as accurate as they ought to have been they would have anticipated a great deal of my most ungrateful labor   i owe acknowledgments for permission to inspect several ancient mss curious deeds etc to thomas astle esquire f r s and s a keeper of the records in the tower of london to john

other ancient writings i shall just barely mention that the late rev mr james murray a dissenting minister in newcastle undertook some time before his death to compile a history of that town but having no means of procuring any other information on the subject than was to be obtained from printed books his design came to nothing  from motives of delicacy i contented myself with this account of his ms from those who perused it declining for very obvious reason to read a line of it myself  there is a brief history of newcastle included in walliss history of northumberland and in hutchinsons view of the same county     after pleading in excuse for the rough and unpolished style of the following collections the rudeness of my materials deduced from the records of barbarous ages corrupted in many places by the ignorance and inattention of former transcribers i shall conclude in the language of the learned prelate dr white kennet  if the present age be too much immersed in pleasures to take any relish or to make any use of these discoveries i then appeal to posterity for i believe the times will come when persons of better inclination will arise who will be glad to find any collections of this nature and to supply the defects and carry on the continuation of it  i am under no concern to vindicate it from the slights and ridicule that may be cast upon it by idle witty

speaking of the towers on the walls of newcastle informs us on the authority of the milbank ms that between every one of these towers there were for the most part two watch towers made square with the effigies of men cut in stone upon the tops of them as though they were watching and they were called garret which had square holes over the walls to throw stones down    the distance is two hundred

their common history under st mary magdalens hospital  from st thomas chapel we enter upon  tynebridge the proofs that a roman bridge bourne tells us the bridge is of great antiquity undoubtedly as old as the times of the romans there must have been a communication between this and the other side of the river and therefore there was a necessity for it  the ingenious mr horsley p  0  says i think there are some certain and visible remains of a military way on gatesheadfell pointing directly toward the part where i suppose the station has been at newcastle and coming as i apprehend from chesterlestreet dr hunter assured me he had also observed visible remains of such a way and it is the common opinion that there has been a military way from chesterlestreet to newcastle this way tends toward the place where the bridge now is there must then have been a bridge in the roman times over the river tyne near the place where the present bridge stands thus far from bourne  horsleys words are p     romana britannia  that dr hunter informed him that he had observed a military way going off from watlingstreet near binchester which he dr h supposed went to chesteronthestreet between durham and newcastle he traced it to branspethpark but could find it no farther he adds p     that the name of chesteronthestreet does not a little confirm the opinion that there has been a roman settlement there of some kind or other and that a military way has passed from newcastle to it  he adds farther on this subject p     the gardener at cousinshouse told me that he had observed when he wrought thereabouts the military way from newcastle to chesterlestreet and that it lay to the west of the present highway through the fell and dr hunter was positive that he had observed the same way upon this fell as also some remaining tracks of a via vicinalis beyond chester between binchester and brancepethcastle as i remember pointing toward chester which he therefore concluded must have gone that way  dr stukeley in his iter boreale p    speaking of gateshead says the roman road here which is the true hermenstreet coming from suffex coming down gatesheadfell passes in a strait line to the bridge   occupied either the same or nearly the same site with the present bridge at newcastle appear stronger than those generally are which are brought in confirmation of truths of such remote antiquity  two eminent antiquaries mr horsley author of the britannia romana and dr hunter of durham of this country to one of whom we owe the greatest part of our intelligence concerning roman britain were persuaded from visible remains existing in their time that there was a roman road from binchester through chesterinthestreet to the site of the present newcastle upon tyne  an ancient itinerary discovered since they wrote seems to confirm their account beyond the possibility of a doubt the itinerary of richard of cirencester discovered and first printed by mr bertram in sweden we trace on the ancient map delineated in this very valuable acquisition to english antiquartes the roman great road leading straight from cataract in yorkshire to binchester in the county of durham where it branches out into two different iters one of which stretches toward falkirk in scotland by way of ebchester corbridge etc while the other passing through chesterinthestreet terminates at the roman wall at newcastle upon tyne  at corbridge the remains of a roman bridge are still visible  the very high antiquity of this itinerary is said by dr stukeley to be marked out by such names as ad murum  ad tesam  ad alaunam  ad tuedam etc showing that the roads were generally made or marked out but that towns cities and castles were not then built only some inns for present convenience  he adds that we may reasonably judge from hence that the original itinerary and map which this richard of cirencester copied was constructed in agricolas time  though afterward additions were made to it some have supposed that there was one of those inns at gateshead called at that time from the sign of a goats head caprae caput  but see account of gateshead     the emperor aelius hadrian who connected the forts erected by agricola by raising the great vallum that in this part of the island extended nearly from sea to sea was probably the first that built a bridge at this place from which circumstance the station it led to from the roman road was afterward called pons aelii an appellation plainly derived as were those of others of his public works from the name of his own family thus says pennant jerusalem was styled aelia capitolina and the games he instituted at pincum in maesia aeliana pincensia it may be added that the bridge which hadrian throw over the tyber at rome is called to this hour ponte elio adriano see piranesis views  two coins appear to have been struck upon the building of two bridges by this emperor one is doubtless to be referred to that at rome may not the other have been intended to commemorate the work we are now considering one of the bridges marked on these coins has seven the other five arches the tyber being a very inconsiderable river when compared with the tyne we must therefore claim that with seven arches  especially as we find a view of the pons aelius at rome in piranesis collection without the modern ornaments where it is represented as consisting of exactly five arches see vaillant tom i p    where speaking of the coins of hadrian he thus describes one of them sine epigraphe pons aelius cum septem fornicibus sub eo plurimae figurae  and the other p     as follows sine epigraphe pons aelius cum quinque fornicibus  edition of paris      quarto  see also numismatum antiquorum in musaeo pembrochiano sylloges pars       many roman coins i cannot help thinking says pennant tour vol iii p     that part of the roman bridge remained there till very lately for from the observation of workmen upon the old piers they seem originally to have been formed without any springs for arches this was a manner of building used by the romans witness the bridge built over the danube by trajan at severin twenty hungarian miles from belgrade whose piers i believe still exist of the coins that were found mr pennant describes the following  coins posterior to the time of adrian probably deposited there in some later repairs one is a beautiful faustina the elder after her deification  her forehead is bound with a small tiara  her hair full twisted and dressed a la modern  round is inscribed diva faustina on the reverse is a ceres with a torch in one hand and ears of corn in the other the inscription augusta s c  the next has the laureated head of antoninus pius  on the reverse apollo with a patera in one hand a plectrum in the other  the legend defaced  the third is of lucius verus after consecration  reverse a magnificent funeral pile and the word consecratio s c  the originals of these are in the possession of the bishop of durham  i have one of trajan found here also  it is the same as that described in thoresbys leeds p     no      as also one of antoninus of the larger size  i have caused one of the emperor hadrian though much defaced to be engraved it was found in the same ruins and communicated by john erasmus blackett esquire alderman of newcastle upon tyne see plate of coins   were discovered in the ruins of the piers of this bridge after the fall thereof a d      proving it should seem that some of the original roman structure remained here till every part of the ancient building was cleared away on the erection of the new bridge  bournes reasoning his words are these it has been a query whether the bridge was originally of wood or stone but i think it is altogether needless all the bridges in england were originally of wood  in the reign of richard i philip bishop of durham sent to the burgesses of gateside a grant of forestage in which are these words and it shall be lawful for every burgess to give wood to whomsoever he will to be spent about the river of tyne without any license this i imagine has been for the building of keys and especially for the repairing of the bishops part of the bridge which is a further proof that the bridge which was the original one was wood see afterward under gateshead on the bishop of durhams charter to the burgesses of gateshead in the reign of richard i is founded on an error in translating the passage he selected from the original latin  the clause which he has either found wrong or made so ought to be rendered as follows any burgess  i e of gateshead may give his wood to whom he pleases provided they live on this side of the tyne that is on the durham side of that river  in a charter of king henry ii to the town of newcastle cited in one of king john the existence of a bridge here at that period is implied in his exempting the burgesses from the duty of pontage for their own goods see under that reign history of newcastle as a corporate town   in the year      the greatest part of the town of newcastle upon tyne together with the bridge there was destroyed by fire in anglia etsi de aliis sileamus maxima pars burgi qui novum castrum super thinam appellatur cum ponte igne quasi suriosa consumpta est matthew paris watts edit p       bourne tells us without subjoining on what authority that after this event the town of newcastle joined with the bishop of durham in erecting a bridge of stone from his liber cartarum  laurentius was then the master of the bridge  the archdeacon of northumberland wrote to the clergy of his archdeaconry and desired them to assist the work of the bridge enforcing the command of the bishop of durham to set about the affair of indulgencies preferring the episcopal ones to others  in like manner the official of carlisle promised an indulgence of ten days to any one that would assist the repairing of tyne bridge  and that the business was effected by a method common at that time i e by sending indulgencies to all persons who would assist them either with money or labor to rebuild it here he first mentions that the bishops of durham were bound to repair a

related in the english morery or colliers dictionary in verbo kentigern  fuller in his worthies takes notice of this event referring in the margin to the vox piscis  bourne tells us p     this gentleman from whose finger the ring fell was mayor of newcastle and was ancestor of the present mr abraham anderson merchant on the sandhill the said francis anderson made over his estate to his son henry anderson who was the father of the said abrahams grandfather he adds on the inside of the ring just under the signet is the picture of a salmon in commemoration of the fish and the transaction

like of it but the whole world beside  this ring is at present a d      in the possession of mr edward anderson merchant who permitted me to take a drawing of it with an impression on wax of the

parson of benton   the words above super terram meam fundavi seem plainly to infer that he raised the structure from the ground although bourne on the authority of the ms he so often cites and which he calls liber cartarum styles aselack the second founder having found in cambdens britannia a lord walter de bolbeck conveying lands to the church of winchester a d      and one of the same name among the first benefactors to this place he thinks them one and the same person adding that it is a strong reason that this hospital was founded in king henry is reign yet we find in tanners notitia monastica p     a walter de bolbeck founding the abbey of blnchland a d      at or near the time it may be supposed of the first foundation of this house and to which that baron may have been a benefactor before he was sixty years of age it may be added that what he has cited from the charter of henry ii to the mns of newcastle favors out hypothesis as does also the confirmation charter to this house by richard i mentioned afterward in which aselack the founder  poken of as then alive what tanner in his notitia monastica has recorded concerning the different foundations of this house being only a transcript of bournes very confused account must necessarily follow the fortune of its original    who not only raised the fabric but gave the ground also upon which it was erected and placed therein two friars regular and a chaplain to serve god and the poor farther intending it to be a place of entertainment for the indigent clergy and such pilgrims as were passing this way this house has been called at different periods the hospital of newcastle see bishop pudseys charter to it and that of henry ii to the nuns  of st mary the blessed virgin of westgate see afterward various

following occasion  the monastic orders in consequence of their ample revenues had degenerated from their primitive austerity and long before the thirteenth century were totally abandoned to luxury and indolence hence a new order of religious was introduced who being destitute of fixed possessions and of consequence obliged to rely on their own merits with the people might restore respect to the monastic institution and recover the honor of the church  this order one and the first of the four is said to have been founded by st dominic a native of cologna in spain a d      pope innocent iii approved it in      and it was confirmed by a bull of pope honorius the third in      by some they are reported to have come into england a d      but according to others not till the year       their first residence was at oxford  they boast of having produced a great number of martyrs and confessors  three popes sixty cardinals an hundred and fifty archbishops and eight hundred bishops and to have furnished in this kingdom no less than eighty writers of eminence  their habit was a white cassock with a white hood over it and abroad they wore a black cloak and hood over all  at the

certainly mistakes in saying this was called in old time the gray friars adds that they were called also bennetchessiefriars a corruption some have thought of benoists chausses i e shod bennets from their having adopted in a certain measure the rule of st bennet or benedict the only real evidence for this supposed title for i do not think they were ever called so occurs in the common council books of newcastle june  st      in the account of a parcel of ground called bennychessesclose in fenkellstreet which was doubtless part of the possessions of this monastery but i cannot help being of

also to leave the city for shame yet among the doctors then assembled the dispute continued about the pater for some would have it said to god formaliter and to the saints materialiter others to god principaliter to the saints minus principaliter others primario to god secundario to the saint others would have it said to god taking it stricte and to the saints taking it late notwithstanding all their distinctions the doctors could not agree upon the business a fellow called tom servant to the subprior of st andrews one day perceiving his master much troubled with some business and as he conceived weighty said to him sir what is the matter of this your trouble the master answered we cannot agree about the saying of the pater the fellow replied to whom should it be said but to god

sheephead alley  before i enter upon the history of the castle of newcastle i shall take occasion to give a brief account of the famous wall of the emperor hadrian which ended at the castrum of the roman station of pons aelii and that of the emperor severus which passed through the site of the present newcastle and ended at walls end  hadrians wall or vallum made a d   0 was a wall of turf with a deep fosse or ditch accompanying it on the north side the original height of it is not known  severus wall was built a d  0  of square stones and every where also except on the edges of precipices was accompanied by a deep ditch or fosse the original height thereof was    feet and the breadth   between the village of walker i e the town by the wall and bykerhill the wall of severus with its fosse are still plainly distinguishable the site of the wall at present is covered with brushwood and stunted trees dr stukeley has preserved in his iter boreale a view of the appearance of the roman wall between bykerhill mill and newcastle when he wrote from this mill to the smiths shop near the first milestone on the shields road the site of the wall and hollow of the fosse running parallel with the present turnpike way are yet clearly discernible  at the head of the bank overlooking ouseburn was a castellum or exploratory tower out of the foundations of which i saw many roman stones taken not many years ago to build an adjoining house  coing down the hill from thence to the rivulet of ouseburn the fosse on the north side of the hedge is still very deep and forms what is here called a little gill  severus wall must have formed a small angle at the arch by which it has crossed ouseburn  on the rise of the hill between this streamlet and redbarns i found april  d      many of the square stones which had evidently been the plunder of the wall  about redbarns the garden grounds have destroyed every vestige both of the wall and the fosse but when we are past the gardens the remains of the wall seem again to appear and having crossed the field proceed in a straight line behind the keelmans hospital to the sallyport or shipcarpenters tower there was a ropewalk here upon the foundation of the wall not many years ago  near the present sallyport gate stood a turret or roman castlellum from hence the wall as the foundations thereof which were discovered some years ago thomasin scott an old woman about  0 years of age living on the wallknoll informed me april  d      that several years ago some workmen in building a coachhouse there for alderman sowerby discovered plainly the foundations of the roman wall coming over the top of the hill and bearing to the north side of the present sallyport gate and that a great many curious gentlemen came to view it  the passage of virgil lib vii may be strictly applied to the etymon of wallknoll from the roman wall    ab illo dicitur aeternumque tenet per saecula nomen   plainly evinced passed over the top of the hill to which it gave the name of wallknoll and must have crossed pandonburn by an arch near stockbridge as it is said to have been the ancient boundary and defense of the royal mansion of pandonhall on the north gray in his chorographia speaking of pandonhall calls it a safe bulwark having the picts wall on the north side and the river tyne on the south   from pandonhall the roman wall must have climbed over another hill toward lortburn which it has spanned by an arch near the present lowbridge in order to form the northern rampart of the station of pons aelii where it has the milbank ms cited so often by bourne tells us that about charles is time the roman wall might be traced down the hill by mr leonard carrs house which stood in pilgrimstreet on the west side a little before you come to silverstreet  gray in his chorographia p   says the picts wall came over netherdean bridge and so along unto pandon  horseley britannia romana p     tells us that in laving the foundation of a building in the groatmarket about    or    years since the masons struck upon the roman wall at each of the side walls so that the building stands cross the roman wall  dr davel master of st marys hospital when leland visited newcastle in the nge of hen viii told him that st nicholas church  upon the  wall  leland  vol vii p    in laing the foundation of the new assembly hour the wor  said to have discovered the fosse of several wall  but mr george and master  of a contrary opinion  the north side of the wall of the great wall  the chancel of the  all saints church was plainly built with roman stones the plunder of this wall  the north wall of a stable in the spread  denton che  dently composed of roman stones  the followin occurs among dr ellisons mss notes the picts wall goes through the  of newcastle   run a little to the north of that part of st nicholas church which is called st georges porch stretching from thence through the gardens of the vicarage house it has afterward intersected the line of the townwall a little to the north of the westgate where horseley supposes a very small turn has been made in it in order to come up to the north rampart of the station horseley thus determines the boundaries and situation of the station of pons aelii i hinted before that there was a traditionary account of the walls passing through st georges porch near the northwest corner of st nicholas church but it is certain that the line of the wall lies a little to the north of this end of the church and i think has not touched this porch though it comes near it and therefore i conjecture that the wall which has passed through this porch must have been the east rampart of the station for the supposition will reconcile these seemingly different accounts and if a line be erected perpendicular to that of severus wall so as to pass through that porch and be continued along the brow of the hill at the head of the side till it meet the line of hadrians vallum near the cast end of belygate and not far from the castle this line seems to answer so well in all respects that i cannot much doubt its having been the eastern limits of the ancient station for this brings the station near to the castle which probably has been built a little more to the southeast in order to bring it nearer to the top of a steep hill and fixing the eastern boundary of the station here leaves a plain and level area for the station itself and without it a descent toward the south and the river for the town to stand upon which might extend itself to the bridge supposing the ancient bridge to have been near the same place where the present one stands from which bridge the ancient town and station might probably take the name of pons aelii this eastern boundary of the station must at that time have been nearer the river than it is now since it is certain that the river formerly flowed farther up toward this part of the town the position of the eastern rampart of the station being thus determined the other boundaries may be also defined for the distance here between the lines of the walls seems to be about   charms and it is not much to be questioned but the two walls here as in other cases they frequently did have fallen in with the northern and southern ramparts of the station so that these   chains have been the breadth of the station and if we suppose the station to have been of a middle size we must make it a square and allow   chains for the length of it if at this distance another line be drawn equal and parallel to the former and between the lines of the wall it will be the western boundary of the station as the two respective parts of the two walls make the northern and southern limits and upon this supposition a line drawn from the scot of the flesh market to barley gate near the east end of it will be the eastern limits of the ancient station that part of the vallum which reaches from bailygate to mr ords house will be the southern limit and a line drawn from hence to that part of the line of severus wall which is about  0 yards east from the end of rosemarylane must be the western boundary and the part of severus wall included between this and the foot of the fleshmarket remains for the line of the northern rampart page     at newcastle and to get to a sufficient distance from hadrians vallum  horseley with great probability supposes that one of the extremities of hadrians vallum was on the bank of the tyne beyond the castle perhaps near the present half moon battery covered now with modern buildings where there may have been a circular turret in the time of the romans to command the pass of the bridge  this vallum passing the north corner of the castle went in a straight line it crossed westgate we collect from that writer between the part or conluit  stood in his time not far from the end of dentonchare and barley gate but  to bailygate and passing near the free school intersected the line of the town well but  westgate and the smaller gate that leads to the earth  that  before he wrote a coin of vespasian was found  he was told by the person that found it i am of opinion that the inscriptions belonging to the state  of pons  all built up in the old keep of the castle and that ch  of this  or other be discovered lurking in its almost impregnable walls by future  to the place where in horseleys time it became distinguishable without the westgate and so onwards to that rising which still is so remarkable in a field without the turnpikegate along which are ranged a set of boundary stones where it certainly has passed  hadrians vallum is with extreme probability supposed to have formed the southern rampart of the station of pons aelii as severus wall at the distance of about six chains may be naturally thought to have been the northern one this station most likely has been square  the brow of the hill at the head of the side easily directs us where to draw the line of the eastern rampart running from st georges porch till intercepted by hadrians vallum near bailygate and a line drawn from what was in horseleys time mr ords house lately mr gibsons the townclerks to that part of the line of severus wall which was about  0 yards east from the present rosemarylane shows as what must have been the western boundary of this fortification  from that part of the line of the townwall where we left severus work the track of it running westward has entirely been destroyed by buildings and gardens till near the turnpikegate where it was thought distinguishable in horseleys time in a small field between quarryhouse and newcastle that writer was of opinion that it passed through the site of this quarryhouse just beyond which on the west an immense quarry has eradicated every vestige both of the wall and fosse of severus but mounting to the top of the rising ground beyond it westward the hollow of the fosse begins to reappear running along pretty close to the north side of the turnpike road to benwall called in the notitia the station of condercum  hadrians vallum which we left running up a field west of the turnpikegate and marked by a range of

stones disappears through the next field where it has been destroyed by the working of pits dr stukeley in his  boteale      says that out at westgate many shafts of the coal mins are  upon the roman wall  a part of the fosse of severus wall very dp and observable yet remains near the first ril stone at the west end of the farmhouse as do also some remains of hadrians wo a field opposite to it on the south  in the deep hollow below benwall hill near the bridge over dentonburn and a few  south of the tumpikeond is preserved a curious fragment of severus wall it meares about nine feet in breadth five courses of the facingstones on both sides of it are observed a small apple tree at present grows out of the middle of it see appendix    but rises again into obvious notice after we pass the old

preface to his antiquities p   found the ruins of an ancient building on the site of their intended structure they either endeavored to incorporate it into their work or made use of the materials as may be seen by many buildings of known norman construction wherein are fragments of saxon architecture or large quantities of roman bricks which has caused them often to be mistaken for roman or saxon

entitled the harmony of english historians till that appear we may perhaps do something toward reconciling the various and clashing accounts of the building of this castle by supposing that the earliest relate to the year when it was begun and the others to the time of its final completion  however that may be the greater part of our historians agree that this work was undertaken during the reign and at the command of william the conqueror under the direction of robert curthose his eldest son on his return from an unsuccessful enterprise against malcolm king of scotland who presuming on the absence of william on the continent where he was likely to have been a long while detained by the revolt of the normans and the diversion of his french enemies had passed the borders of the two kingdoms and wasted the northern provinces of england  its having been called on its erection the new castle seems strongly to imply that it arose from the site of some older fortress from which by way of contradistinction it derived a name extended afterward to the adjoining town and which is still retained in its present appellation see bourne  the milbank ms he says tells us that this new castle may be distinguished from the old one i e the round tower since called the half moon battery which is supposed to have been a roman fortress to command the pass of the bridge over the river

this castle sat down before that of tinmouth on the taking of which also he was a second time disappointed for earl mowbray was found to have taken refuge in the fortress of bambrough after a tedious and fruitless siege of that castle rendered by its natural situation almost impregnable the king returned southward but not till he had erected a castle before it to cut off all hopes of throwing in succors and filled it with his army whom he directed to continue the blockade  driven perhaps to great straits through want of provisions mowbray closed with an offer of some of his faithful adherents of whose loyalty the king had however entertained no suspicions as he had appointed them the guards of this newcastle upon tyne these had traitorously and with secrecy invited the earl to take shelter in it the unfortunate nobleman escaped from bambrough but was discovered during his flight to this castle on which he suddenly changed his route and took sanctuary in the church of st oswin at

concerning moothall there is an ancient building within the innerwall of the castlegarth which is commonly called or known by the name of the mootehall which is now in the state and is used by the justices of assize sessions and jail delivery for the keeping of their assize and sessions for the county of northumberland therefore we do not value the same conceiving it is excepted in the act  in

that exercise or arguing of cases which young barristers and students perform at certain times for the better enabling them for practice and defense of clients causes the place where moot cases were argued was anciently called a moothall  blounts law dictionary in verbo  i am not satisfied with this etymology for the moothall in the castle of newcastle see before a note under      where mota is used in the original record for the castle itself  may not therefore moothall mean no more than the hall of the castle see blount also for this sense of the word mota    and other conveniences for keeping the assizes and sessions for the use of the county of northumberland were excepted in this grant at the time of the date of which the castleward rent amounted to   l per annum extracted from a grant of mrs langstons interest in the castlegarth to the mayor and burgesses of newcastle upon tyne preserved in their archives  we gather from it also that the grant of king james to stevenson fell into the possession of barbara black widow of patrick black from whom about november   th      it was conveyed jane langston of st martins in the fields in the county of middlesex london this jane langston in consideration of the sum of  00l made over her right and title to the castlegarth to william maddison of westminster who was an agent and in trust for the corporation of newcastle see

also one of his principal creditors  this censorious writer goes on to charge the magistrates of newcastle with greatly abusing their authority in this place adding that an information thereupon was exhibited against the mayor and burgesses of that town by sir henry yelverton knt attorney general in the   th year of the reign of king james i     august   th    0 an inquisition was taken concerning the bounds of this castle and the lands thereto belonging and there was an information thereupon in the exchequer chamber it appeared says bourne by this inquisition that the ancient castle belonging to the king situated within the walls of newcastle upon tyne belongs to the county of northumberland and is surrounded with a great stonewall  that below the castle there is a great hall where the county of northumberland hold their assizes  there is also a great tower full of chinks under which are two vaults which are the places where the prisoners of the said county of northumberland are kept which are within the circuit of the castle itself  and that there is in being the exterior wall of the castle he goes on to describe the boundaries of it which from the change of owners of the different tenements etc surrounding it is unintelligible at this distance of time which contains by measure   acres of ground and one rood  complaint was made of an enormous dunghill in length    yards and    in breadth and  0 yards deep which imposed so prodigious a weight upon the wall on the west side of the castle in length  0 yards  0 yards in height and two yards broad as to have thrown down a great part thereof to the great detriment of the strength of the castle the damage of which was computed at   0l  it was also complained of that the great square tower was full of chinks and crannies and that onethird of it was almost taken away that all the lead and covering which it had of old was embezzled and carried off insomuch that the prisoners of the county of northumberland were most miserably lodged by reason of the showers of rain falling upon them  they computed that the charge of repairing it would amount to  0 l   s  he adds in a note that the above

arose whether a grant thereof were not more proper for the county of northumberland than for the town because it was alleged though the said castle and garth stand in newcastle yet they belong to the

present remains of this once famous and important fortress were made july  th       the keep or great tower measured    yards and a quarter in height it appears anciently to have been somewhat higher and had no doubt a kernelled battlement  the ichnography of this keep would describe nearly a square the lines of two sides of which bear to the northwest that front however which properly speaking ought to be called the southwest front is generally styled the south one the others are named the west north and east sides with the same little impropriety  the grand entrance originally no doubt the only one is at a great height from the ground mr king in his ingenious essay on ancient castles archaeologia vol iv speaking of canterbury castle says p   0 whoever looks at that ancient structure attentively will easily perceive that the present entrances have been forced and could never have been there originally  two portals as it were must be passed before we can arrive at it the entrance was not in any ancient castle that i have seen in the lower story or upon the ground or near it but at a considerable height and was by means of a grand staircase  there was also a strong gate about the middle of the staircase  ibid p       from the first of these which is on the south and in a great wall there were two great strong walls says bourne which surrounded the castle the interior wall was of no great distance from the castle itself as may be still seen in several places the exterior wall surrounds the verge of the castle bounders from this outer wall were four gates the great gate and three posterns on the north side of the castle is the main gate now called the blackgate it has had two portcullises one without the gate as may be still seen and another within it at a little distance from it the ruins of which were to be seen a few years ago on the east side of the castle there was a postern which led down to the street called the side which is still to be seen  on the south side of the castle is another gate which leads down the castle stairs to the street called the close this was called the southpostern there is an old building upon it which was the countygaolers house on the west side was the postern facing bailiffgate  there is an house in the yard  i e castlegarth or yard where they say was the chapel of the garrison which is called the chapelhouse to this day it stands northeast from the chapel he means the chapel of the castle or keep its common name now is the three bulls heads  i e an inn with that sign  since bournes time in digging cellars for this inn human bones as also a large stone coffin were found  dr stukeley who visited this castle in      seems to have mistaken a part of its outerwall for what he calls a bit of the true old roman wall see iter boreale p    et seq  there is a place still called the mount on the south side of this keep and within the outer wall of the fortification  large mounts says gross ut supra p   were also often thrown up in this place these served like modern cavaliers to command the adjacent country    which at a few yards distance has enclosed the whole keep we mount by eleven steps to the second one which is of prodigious strength and from the top of it the besieged appear to have had great power to annoy the assailants  from this second portal to the grand entrance are eighteen steps part leading from south to north and part from east to west no grooves for portcullises the hearse or portcullis was a strong grating of timber fenced with iron made to slide up and down in a groove of solid stonework within the arch of the portal just as a sashwindow does in its frame and its bottom was furnished with sharp iron spikes designed both to strike into the ground or floor for the sake of greater firmness and solidity and also to destroy and break whatever should be under it at the time of its being let fall and its groove was always contrived to deep in the stonework that it could not be injured or removed without pulling down the whole wall  king ut supra p   0 are discoverable in either of the portals but so much appears to have been demolished that one cannot from thence infer that there have never been any  the grand entrance which is toward the east has had its arch adorned in a superb manner with zigzag and other saxon or semisaxon ornaments  the wall here measured four yards and a quarter in thickness pennant in his tour in scotland vol m p  0  speaking of the place tells us the walls of roberts tower are thirteen feet thick with galleries gaed out of them he adds the height of this tower was eightytwo feet the square on the outside sixtytwo by fifty four   near this grand entrance and in front as you ascend to it from south to north is a doorway leading into a little apartment which has been richly adorned on the inside  it stands over a crypt or vault of considerable height on two great arches that intersect each other of beautiful gothic masonry  this had a distinct roof and the whole forms a projection eastward at the northeast angle against the east end of which a modern house has been built from the garret of this house there is at present an entrance into it through an arched passage where there must have been anciently a window at present it is a curriers shop from the richness of its interior ornaments i suspected it to have been the chapel to which supposition its direction from east to west is not unfavourable it must however have been but a very small one bourne supposes the chapel to have been within the walls of this keep on the ground floor in a place which at present composes a part of mr fifes very curious and extensive cellar  the great entrance seems to have led immediately into the state apartments the room says bourne this grand entrance leads into has its floor broken down close to the castlewall as indeed all the other floors are to the top of the castles so that excepting the floor above the countygaol there is not one left though there have been five divisions or stories of the castle besides this this floored room flagged by william ellison esquire mayor of newcastle in      seems to me without any doubt to have been the common hall of the castle  because on the north side of the same room there is an entrance by a descent of some steps into one where is the largest fireplace i saw in the castle which plainly speaks it to have been the kitchen  near this kitchen bourne supposed he could also trace the pantry and cellar  on the south of this room says bourne also there is an entrance into a sort of a parlour or withdrawingroom which has a fireplace in it which has been a piece of curious workmanship as is visible to this day and this place has no communication with any part of the castle but this room  which have been lighted from the east by the most magnificent window in the whole great tower near this and in the body of the wall is an apartment with a curious drawwell in it  at sixteen yards depth the water was two yards lower in bournes time we reached the water the depth in all is thirtyone yards and a quarter the water is hard and very cold there are square cavities in the wall on each side of this well in which are round holes for pipes used anciently to convey the water to the several apartments it measures eleven yards to the ground from the window of the apartment that contains the well  there is no way at present to the top of this keep where one is surprised to find a little artificial garden producing apple trees rosebushes etc except by one great winding staircase about two yards wide in the northeast angle there is another staircase thus king ut supra p   0  speaking of canterbury castle he tells us there are two circular staircases in the corners in the southeast angle but it is now built up at the top it has come down to the ground floor at which place also the communication is now closed up  by the rows of square holes in which the beams have rested there must have been five stories of apartments of which the great hall and state rooms were the lowest from the present flagged floor to the top of this tower  there is a gallery of communication in the center or thickness of the wall and on all four sides of it about five yards and a half thus king ut supra p      within the thickness of the wall  a gallery  that orders might be speedily communicated to all parts  and there was besides another smaller and narrower gallery within the thichness of the wall in the floor above  speaking also of guildford castle he says there are also galleries in the thickness of the wall as at rochester   from the top this passage is about two yards and a half high and has three or four loup holes on each side all widening gradually inwards  below this in the south front is a gallery in the center of the wall about fifteen yards and three quarters from the ground in which there have been two large ornamented windows  nearly on a level with which on the north front is another window of the like sort  two great windows have let in light to the great hall these great rooms says king ut supra p         were undoubtedly hung with arras of this keep that in the south front near the southwest angle having had the pillar or division in it broken away has now the appearance of a doorway a door hardly half its size is at present hung in it the other window is very observable it is on the west side near the southwest angle  the kitchen of this great tower has been in the north wall it contains a much larger fireplace than any other of the apartments the chimney appears on the outside of the wall by a square projection ending abruptly and yet i know not with any degree of certainty whether ever it has been carried up any higher one of its windows has been enlarged with great labor to give more light to a joiners shop into which it has been converted  the northwest angle of this tower is of an hexagonal form neither do they seem to have confined themselves to any particular figure in their towers square round and polygonal oftentimes occurring in the original parts of the same building gross ut supra p    and projects in a manner different from any of the others thus king ut supra p      the outlets to the sinks and other conveyances of filth were nearly in the same manner as the chimneys only reversed and going downwards  in the wall of the western front have been several necessaryhouses communicating with the great drains  all the apartments of the groundfloor and the countyprison itself except when used at the assizes have been converted into cellars a purpose for which their great coolness renders them very fit  there is a place here into which if water be poured in the largest quantities it immediately disappears  it probably communicates with one of the large drains  in the center of the present county prison is a remarkable pillar from which arches branch out very beautifully on all sides this column is hollow and a pipe has having a hollow in the middle says bourne of a foot wide with a lead spout in the side of it conducted water down through it from the well beforementioned there is a very observable window windows says he were so contrived that it was almost impossible for any weapon to be shot into the room so as to do any hurt for if it went at all ascending it would strike against a low arch purposely contrived over every window and could not enter the room at all king ut supra p      i know not which is the house which bourne says was anciently the countygaol and underneath which he adds it is reported there is a vault which leads to the castle  there is indeed a large door he continues still to be seen which was perhaps the entrance into it and mr george gray the present possessor told me that it was certainly so because he had put down through his own sloot a bailiffs rod to the very end and could find no bottom  i know not on what authority bourne rests his information when he tells us that the castlegate i suppose he means the blackgate was begun to be built by one george hayroy but was finished by one john pickle who kept a tavern in it   in this place with an arch turned in the inside to repel missile weapons etc see an account of many similar ones in kings ingenious account of ancient castles ut supra  great alterations must have been made in the appearance of the low parts of the south front when the temporary prison of the county was made in this keep the present entrance to which we descend by four or five steps must have been first made on that occasion for there is no arch over it in the wall another similar kind of entrance on the eastern side of the southeast angle which is now built up with a swinestye before it is also without doubt of a date much posterior to that of the original building   if there has been a dungeon in this keep as there probably was i mean that dreary kind of mansion to which the only entrance was by a square hole in the top it must have been filled up as no traces thereof can be discovered at present  newgatestreet newgatestreet has plainly had its name from the newgate which bounds it on the north  bourne mentions a tenement on the east side of this street given by mrs alice belaysis to universitycollege in oxford on the east side of this street near the newgate is a tenement which was given by mrs alice belaysis to universitycollege in oxford a d      the site of it is thus described situatum est infra predictam villam juxta novam portam ejusdem ville inquo

writing goes farther  ac tria tenementa et duo tofta inde insimul situantur in eodem vico ducente a dicta ecclesia sancti andree usque fratres predictos etc bourne p      the same writer tells us that a tradition remained in his time that there had been anciently several markets between newgate and the whitecross in an inrolment in the archives of newcastle upon tyne dated    car ii the noltmarket occurs as near the whitecrosse  ibid may  d      the great inns in the noltmarket occur  a mutilated deed preserved in st andrews vestry mentions a message in this street called horsemarketgate inter terram abbatis de novo monasterio etc dated       in the harleian mss  0  eschaets    ric ii a message occurs in horsemarketgate  there are four fairs kept in this street in the year one at lammas and another at st lukesmass both for horses  the other two are for black cattle the one on all souls day and the other at martinmas  bourne     an ancient street called darnecrook runs westward to the townwall at the bottom of st andrews churchyard in this says bourne were some wastes and houses that belonged to the nuns of st bartholomew  almost contiguous to newgate stands st andrews church  st andrews church this building appears to have retained more of its original masonry than the other churches and from the style of its architecture has been generally thought to be the oldest in the town see bournes account david king of scots it is unknown for what reason is mentioned in the ms de rebus novo castr which he often cites as its founder  the arch that separates the chancel from the body of the church is of the semi saxon style with zigzag ornaments which proves it to have been built not long after the conquest  in the columns that support this arch there are proofs hewn out in stone that some of the romish exhibitions in churches were comparatively speaking no more than innovations these plainly appear to have been cut away in parallel directions to gain supports for the

the excellence of the doctrines of this new faith which were warmly recommended to him on the occasion by his friend alchfrid the natural son of oswy who had married cyniburga his sister he declared himself a convert by conviction and having been baptized together with his retinue by finan bishop of lindisfarn obtained a bride with whom he may be said to have received a truly royal dower and who

provided as had before been done at york where king aidun was baptized on easter day a d     in a church of wood which he himself had hastily erected for the occasion  to the ancient name of our town ad murum succeeded the appellation of monkchester it is uncertain at what period this new title took place which has generally been interpreted the fortified residence of persons of the monastic order sir robert shastoe a former recorder of newcastle was of opinion that monkchester had its name from the neighboring monks retiring to it for occasional protection in times of danger and devastation dr ellisons ms notes  who may have crowded into it for reasons impossible to be known at this very distant period of time  on the introduction of monastic orders with whom not only the relics of saints but also the scenes of events of great consequence to religion were held in the highest estimation it seems no very improbable conjecture that a place consecrated to the warm imaginations of these wellmeaning zealots by circumstances so remarkable as have been just related should be accounted sacred in more than a common degree if we farther unite the idea of personal safety expected in what had been so recently a roman fortification and so often wanted in the times of the danish invasions with that of sanctity affixed to it by something not unlike superstition it seems natural to suppose that those ancient devotees would prefer it on both accounts however this may have been we are certain from the clearest testimony of historians that monks in more than ordinary numbers resided at it and learn farther that neither the idea of local sanctity with which we have presumed its then inhabitants to have been impressed nor the military works left in it by former owners could preserve it from destruction in the predatory incursions of foreign or neighboring barbarians matthew of westminster informs us that in the year of grace  00 an army of danish pagans ravaged and spoiled the church of tinmouth carrying off the spoil instantly to their ships  that sixtyseven years afterward the same cruel victors dpopulated the whole province of northumberland to the mouth of the river tyne and subjugated the whole country  as also that three years afterward the noble monasteries on our coast those of lindisfarn tynmouth gyrway jarrow and weremouth were utterly plundered and destroyed   the monasteries of monkchester having fallen almost with every memorial of them in the common destruction of sacred edifices by the infidel danes the ruins of that place seem to have been unnoticed till about the middle of the eleventh century when they were visited on motives of religious zeal similar to those by which we have supposed the town had before been rendered famous but when

i p        monk and prior of the monastery of winchelsea having gathered from ancient monuments which he appears to have studied both from motives of christian piety and literary curiosity that northumberland had been particularly distinguished for its sacred edifices formed a resolution of visiting their remains he was accompanied in what was then a perilous journey by elfwius and reinfridus two monks of evesham the holy travelers performed it on foot in all the plainness of pristine simplicity leading a little ass carrying some books and sacred vestments necessary for the performance of divine service this happened a d  0   on their arrival at northumberland their residence was for some time at monkchester but finding there no vestige of the former monastic orders and having been invited by walcher then bishop of durham to place themselves under the jurisdiction of the church rather than accept an habitation under the power of secular persons they removed from thence a little way down the river to jarrow which before that time had been a famous monastery and though then in ruins also was fitted up a second time for the reception of these devout strangers

walter blackett     the exact site of this nunnery is now unknown two great houses are marked out hereabouts in speeds plan of newcastle    0  one is called kings lodgings  the other the manor a part of the nuns  i should think it stood near the spot where a playhouse has since been erected indeed the playhouse seems supported by part of the northwall of st bartholomews church in which the north doorway built up with stone is still observable so that where once these daughters of celibacy and retirement heard their masses thalia and melpomene now laugh and weep by turns and farces of another kind have succeeded to the superstitious rites of papal rome  the above playhouse erected by mr william parker master of the turks head inn was finished in the latter end of the year       on a view of the nuns in      i discovered that part of the meadow which bourne tells us was filled up to make the ground level  part seems to have been left in its original state in order to preserve a very fine well  this has occasioned a remarkable artificial hollow i found also the issues of the two great conduits where lamborn and lorkburn unite in the deen  one of them points up toward ficketttower where it passes through the townwall and the other toward executiondock    bourne as i think erroneously supposes that the passage still called nungate was not the grand entrance to it here very lately remained part of a great arch that once formed a gateway very unlike that of a back passage especially when we consider the general poverty of style in building that prevailed at the time when this was erected  the popular tradition of a subterraneous communication with a neighboring monastery prevailed here also see groses account of godstow nunnery in oxfordshire there is a similar tradition of a subterraneous passage under the thames from syon nunnery to the friary of sheen now called richmond in surry  this was said to have been made for purposes that we shall but hint at and to have ended at the house of blackfriars some large vaulted drain has probably given rise to the charge against our fair and as it should seem by this account frail sisterhood and it has owed its support to the ill nature of religious party than which no species of rancour has been found to be more malignant  among fairfaxs views published in the time of the civil wars and now extremely rare there occurs a small one of the then remains of this nunnery inscribed at bottom the nunns newcastle i have caused a fac simile of this to be engraved see plate of miscellaneous antiquities no     nearly at the end of the puddingchare the street called bigg or oatmarket is separated into three divisions of which that next to westgate is called the meal or groatmarket an order of common council

wool in the common council books august  0th      the woolmarket is mentioned as having been removed from the pullenmarkett to the lane betwixt groatemarkett and middlestreet adjacent to mr lewins house there  near the woolmarket and opposite the shop of w charnley bookseller a house stood in my remembrance on the top of which a reservoir was built for the water that came from gatesheadfell  it has lately been taken down and rebuilt     the continuation of this street beyond the east end of dentonchare was the ancient ironmarket in the book of inrolments in the archives of the corporation of

nicholas church this very capacious and superb structure dedicated to st nicholas st nicholas was bishop of myra a city in lycia a province of asia minor he lived about the beginning of the fourth century and during the persecution of licinius the roman emperor was sent into banishment but after the death of that tyrant he revisited his diocese and threw out all the idols which he found in it he is said to have assisted at the general council of nice where he strenuously opposed the arians he commemorated on the sixth of december  bourne says that in his time a large flag which was the first step into the church at the north door was cut all along the surface with uneven lines in imitation of the waves of the sea as a silent remembrancer of this saint so famous among some for his miracles and apparitions by sea that he has merited the title of the patron of the sailors  there is a perspective view of st nicholas church in newcastle upon tyne inscribed to lord crew bishop of durham w horseley del    is styled in the earliest accounts of it the church of newcastle upon tyne see afterward under henry i  yet perhaps it was so called by way of eminence for we find that although in the ordering of the vicarage by hugh pudsey bishop of durham a d      it is called the church of st nicholas of newcastle upon tyne yet afterward in the year      it is simply styled the church of newcastle when that of st andrew appears to have been built by unquestionable evidence  however that may have been it was certainly the mother or parish church to which the other three were no more than parochial chapels built it is probable at different periods as the town was enlarged or became more populous  the respective limits of the four parishes or parochial districts in newcastle upon tyne are said to have been settled in the year    0 if we may credit an account in warburtons ms collections remaining in the archives of the duke of northumberland    a circumstance which seems to prove it to be the oldest as having been at that time the only church of the town  to john sons of redley hall in the county of northumberland esquire this view of the elegant steeple etc of the church of st nicholas  newcastle and tyne  south east    bourne supposes it was built by king henry i but on the authority of a book remaining in the vestry of this church in his time it is said to have been founded in the year  0   and as it farther appears by osmund bishop of salisbury dr ellisons mss inform us that a d  0   in the fourth year of william rufus the church of st nicholas was founded by osmund bishop of salisbury adding that their authority is a book doubtless a ms of this church i was truly sorry to find that not only this book but almost all the other ancient writings and evidences of this church are now lost   this osmund who was canonized after his death which happened in  0   was a norman by birth came over with william the conqueror was created earl of

had for its first founder laurentius prior of durham a d      bournes history  it boasts says he still an higher antiquity and is said to have been founded by laurence of durham who was prior of durham in the year      which by the way is a farther proof of our conjecture of this chapels being founded by king henry i in that reign at latest  according to dr ellisons mss this chantry was founded by laurentius prior of durham    it was refounded in the year      by richard de emeldon richard de emeldon who had been above twelve times mayor of newcastle was permitted by letters patent from king edward iii to build upon a piece of vacant ground over against the chapel of st thomas the martyr that he might present it to three chaplains to procure their prayers for him whilst he was living and after he was dead and also for the souls of his wives and his father and mother etc every day at the altar in st nicholas which was dedicated to john the baptist and john the apostle and evangelist this gentleman died about the  th or  th of the reign now mentioned as is clearly gathered from the authority above and the letters in which this chantry is mentioned beat date the sixth of this reign and therefore it is a mistake to suppose this chantry founded in the reign of henry vi which was almost an hundred years after  the priests set apart to attend this altar were every day to pray for his soul and the others above mentioned and by an order from the then richard lord bishop of durham the chaplains for the time being were obliged on the anniversary of his death every year for ever to celebrate his memory with a solemn tolling of the bells and devoutly singing by note in the evening of the anniversary and on the anniversary itself and solemnly to sing mass for the soul of richard himself and the souls abovementioned and the souls of all the faithful departed and after mass one of the chaplains was to distribute among   0 poor people the sum of  s  d and this annually for ever this together with several other things was ordered by richard bishop of durham in the third year of his consecration a d      which was with all other things mentioned in the charter confirmed by edward iii in the  0th year of his reign thus it appears that this chantry is of a much older date than the reign of henry vi  bournes history  see vllis northumberland vol ii p

p    quarto  dr stukeley speaking of it in his iter boreale p    says it is of a very ingenious model the original of one near london bridge  wallis in his history of northumberland vol ii p     describes it as follows four stone images at full length adorn each corner of a square tower out of which rises a curious steeple in height    yards   foot and   quarters decorated with thirteen pinnacles two bold stone arches supporting a large and beautiful lanthorn on which is a tall and stately spire the whole much admired   steeple of st nicholas church most respectfully inscribed to john medley esquire alderman of newcastle upon tyne allows it to be very justly the boast of the inhabitants being a subject truly worthy of the pencil of a sandby or the burin of a rooker it is generally thought to be a superstructure it is probable that the body of the church was new roofed at the same time as there remain at present on the roof timbers the arms of several families the chiefs of whom were magistrates of the town about that time  such as those of harding carlell lawson baxter lockwood etc  the shape of this pinnacle which some have thought resembled that of an imperial crown others have supposed to be an imitation of the ornamented cover of the box in which the consecrated host was preserved    and to have been raised upon the original tower in the time of henry the sixth  the original tower appears to have had a battlement of open stone work and embrasures like those still remaining on the top of durham abbey at present this part is built up with bricks which probably was done at the erection of the upper structure however that may be it is plainly an afterwork which whatever it may have added to the strength most certainly in some degree impairs the general beauty of the fabric some have ascribed the building of this steeple to david the author of a book entitled a journey through scotland published in      speaking of st giless church in edinburgh says a top of this church is erected a large open cupola in the shape of an imperial crown that is a great ornament to the city and seen at a great distance king david erected a copy after this over st nicholas church in newcastle but it does not near come up to it p        the first king of scots of that name but i think very erroneously and that those have much more

deliver up the town they would direct their cannon so as to demolish this beautiful steeple  the mayor upon this instantly ordered the chief of the scottish prisoners to be taken up to the top of the tower below the lanthorn and returned him an answer that if that structure fell it should not fall alone as their countrymen were placed in it with a view either to preserve it from ruin or be destroyed with it  this spirited reply is said to have had the desired effect in preventing its demolition ibid  there is an order of common council dated september  th      for repairing this steeple

bretagne which fell heavy on the people and put the whole country in a flame  the good earl then lord lieutenant wrote to inform the king of the discontent and prayed an abatement  the kings answer was that not a penny should be abated this message being delivered by the earl with too little caution to the populace who had come in a tumultuous manner to complain of the grievance they supposed him to be the promoter of their calamity and instantly breaking into his house at cockslodge near thirske in yorkshire murdered him and several of his attendants he was buried in beverly minster where

that from our saviors was quaeso pater fac quod rogat mea matter then followed some latin verses done in the rhyming way of the monks but they are so dark and obscure that little can be made of them

large as life bearing a resemblance of the features and person of the late mr ridley at the period to which the medallion and inscription allude is represented in a roman habit sitting in the curule chair the seat of magistracy with a serious but placid countenance as considering of the general welfare of the people over whom he presided under the chair are placed the scales and fasces as emblems of justice and authority beneath this is the entablature containing the following inscription to the memory of matthew ridley esquire of blagdon and heaton in the county of northumberland senior alderman of the corporation of this town and governor of the company of merchantadventurers he four times served the office of mayor in which station in the year      he rendered essential service to his country averting by his prudence and activity the attack meditated against this town by the enemies of the house of brunswick and thereby materially checking the progress of their arms he was unanimously elected by his fellow burgesses to represent them in five successive parliaments and retired from that situation when the declining state of his health rendered him incapable of conscientiously fulfilling the duties of it he lived respected and beloved and died unfeignedly lamented april        aged     the base of the monument is formed by a medallion on which the town of newcastle is represented by a female figure crowned with turrets having a shield by her bearing the arms of the town near her is an urn from which are seen issuing salmon the peculiar attribute of the river tyne attacked by rebellion who treading on the crown and scepter ensigns of royalty bears in one hand the torch of sedition in the other the sword of destruction in an attitude of supplication she inclines herself toward an armed figure who protects her with his shield and with a sword in his right hand resists the figure of rebellion on the shield are represented the arms of the family of ridley the helmet is ornamented with a bull which is the crest as a finishing under the medallion two cornucopias are introduced representing the general effect of plenty attendant on the care of active magistrates connected by a civic crown the reward amongst the romans of civil virtue the figure is placed against an obelisk of white marble eight feet high on the top of which is a very elegant urn bearing the family arms emblazoned and on the foot of it is engraved the motto constans fidei the whole is relieved by a ground of dovecoloured marble  we feel it a justice we owe to the superior abilities of the artist to add that this elegant monument was executed by john bacon esquire of the royal academy whose natural genius unassisted by foreign travel has raised him decidedly to the first rank in his profession and has enabled the present day to vie with the most celebrated ages of antiquity in works of sculpture the many invaluable proofs of excellence with which this artist has enriched his native country as well as foreign lands it is unnecessary here to enumerate until the magnificent monument in westminsterabbey designed and executed by him to the memory of the late

one and the same but added and increased as the town thought fit upon this first settlement they had those salaries out of the town for preaching in the forenoon and the parish did contribute for their preaching in the afternoons some time after the town of newcastle made an addition to the former salaries and gave them an allowance for preaching both forenoon and afternoon upon which augmentation the parishes gave no farther contribution in this state have the lectureships continued ever since with an alteration still of salaries more or less as there was occasion and at the will

stead and the bishop of durham for the time being did always hitherto allow and approve of by license such person so chosen being duly qualified  note the lecturers of st nicholas and all saints have

street stood the house of greyfriars or minors called also franciscanfriars  they were one of the most eminent of the four orders of mendicants before persons could be admitted into this order they were obliged to give a convincing proof of the disinterestedness of their motives by selling all they had and giving it to the poor  st francis their founder gave them one of their names  they were called gray friars from the color of their habit and minors through humility minor i e less inferior  their habit was a loose garment reaching to the ancles with a cowl and a cloak over it when they went abroad  they girded themselves with cords and went barefooted  yet it should seem from the prints in crecceliuss collectanea that the observants only a rigid branch of the order had their feet uncovered    their house in newcastle is said to have been founded by the carliols their great estate according to leland went by marriage to the family of the thurgills of the wolds in yorkshire

was again made conventual about the year   00 a reformation was made in this order by saint bernard of sienna and such as accepted it were called observants or recollects who had two or three houses

convent of the conventuals resigned to them by his majestys command i do not find but believe it was the latter and that the said conventuals again took possession of it when the observants were turned out of this as well as out of all their other houses by king henry viii and that which confirms me in this opinion is that burnet says this house was surrendered  0 hen viii by the warden

nether or low bridge conducts from the foot of the biggmarket to pilgrimstreet the corporation of newcastle have lately made on the south side of part of it a covered place for a poultry market which is held there accordingly every saturday  a meeting house for dissenters was erected not many years ago in this street of which mr james murray was minister  he published sermons to asses the history of the american war etc  died january   th      and was buried in st andrews churchyard  the low or nether deanbridge conducted from st nicholas churchyard into pilgrimstreet and has plainly had its name from its situation lower down in the town than the upper or highbridge there was preserved in the towns butch among other writings preserved there a d      a grant by one king richard for the building of netherdeanbridge  in the harleian mss  0     ric ii mention occurs of five cottages juxta le denebrigge    the roman wall it is said went along it  formerly there was a small descent by stone steps from the churchyard into the lowbridge and at the foot of these steps was an almshouse for two or three poor women which lately remained but has at present no allowance nor is the founder known  dr ellisons mss call it an hospital in the netherdeenbridge it often is mentioned in st nicholas old registers               0 etc  the painterhugh by a steep descent conducted from the bottom of pilgrimstreet to the middle of the side  there is a flight of stone steps on one side for the convenience of foot passengers bourne derives the name of it from painter a rope by which boats are moored and hugh a steep hill or bank  the latter is clear but i should suspect the former to have been the surname of the owner of the property in a deed preserved in all saints vestry dated      payntor hugh occurs also in another ibid dated   0  there is a strange derivation of the name of this place given by dr stukeley in his iter boreale p    he says it is probably from the old name panna corrupted this panna the doctor supposes but it is a mere supposition was the ancient name of the station at newcastle   pilgrimstreet this street appears to have been called vicus peregrinorum as early as the year      it is mentioned in the copy of a grant of a house to brinkburn priory in northumberland of that date preserved in the ledgerbook of that priory from whence this note was extracted by mr robert harrison  on i know not what authority is said to have had its name on account of pilgrims who came from all parts of the kingdom to worship at our ladys chapel at jesmond in the vicinity of newcastle  there was an inn perhaps there have been more pilgrims inns in this street than one there seems reason also for supposing from the following extract that pilgrims came hither too to visit certain relics of st francis that were preserved in the house of gray friars near the head of this street  it is from bales life of hugh of newcastle a famous franciscan of that

and exactly     yards from the southermost corner of upperdeanbridge he adds it is holden of the dean and chapter of durham and belongs at present to mr james hargrave  this appears to have been

pulling down the old building  in the summer of      i saw at canterbury a place for similar purposes where the shoals of pilgrims that went thither to visit the shrine of st thomas a becket were

which the pilgrims in their journey were wont to call at which occasioned their constant coming up this street and so it got its name of pilgrimstreet as the inn did that of pilgrims inn  the meeting

is added that part of it which faces the street is thrown into walks and grassplots beautified with image and beset with trees which afford a very pleasing shade the other part of the ground on the west side of it is all a garden exceedingly neat and curiously adorned with statues and several other curiosities but this house is not more remarkable or memorable upon any account than for its having been the lodgings of king charles i whilst he was a prisoner at this town  it appears from corbridges plan      that the meeting house of the company of spurriers was in an apartment in an old

years ago no more could be read than hic tumulatus dono dei datus mitis clero  promotor ecclesiarum my authority imagines this to be the burial place of robert rhodes he says the picture upon the stone was very like that of roger thornton all the difference is that the gown of this picture is not so deep as that of thorntons  he conjectures it to be the burial place of robert rhodes because of the words promotor ecclesiarum lib all hall the words promotor ecclesiarum are not now to be found however continues bourne had they been there still i think they are but a weak argument to prove that robert rhodes was buried here when it is considered that he founded a chantry in st nicholas that his own soul and his wifes might be prayed for for people were generally buried in the same church and near the very place where they erected a chantry or an altar but whoever it is this i think may be safely concluded from the grandeur of the gravestone that he was some wealthy person and from his being promotor ecclesiarum that he was also religious  the effigies is very tall and is surrounded with very curious pictures of the saints and some other things but the brass is now tearing off and going very fast into ruin it is a pity he adds there should not be more care taken of it as it is an ornament to the church and the monument of its benefactor the promotors of churches should be always remembered with the most grateful respect that they may be shining lights to the most distant ages  bourne gives an epitaph said to have been made upon robert wallas formerly clerk of this

history of newcastle as a corporate town   horseley the learned author of the britannia romana britannia romana p      this place of pandon says gray in his chorographia p    is of such antiquity that if a man would express any ancient thing it is a common proverb as old as pandon  since greys time the proverb has been corrupted into as old as pandon gate    has conjectured with great probability that the latter syllable of pandon was deen a hollow or a brook no one has hazarded a probable etymon of the first syllable that the romans called it pampedon or pantheon from some building like the pantheon at rome having stood in it is an assertion too ridiculous to deserve refutation i shall mention in a note some other conjectures which have been made on this subject with equal felicity bourne says that there is some doubt about the reason of the name some imagining it came from pandana one of the gates of rome which was so called quia semper pateret because it stood always open but i dare say this could never give name to the town of pandon which being in all probability a roman place of defense was rather obliged to be always shut  others have imagined that it came from one pandara a scottish virgin saint but for what reason they know best  in a deed preserved in all saints vestry dated      the name is spelled pampdene and in another ibid dat   ed vi pampden     the kings of northumberland after the departure of the romans are said to have had one of their palaces in pandon a very ancient house now almost entirely rebuilt but which retained till very lately the name of pandonhall bourne tells us that in his time this was rebuilt in some measure but he adds there are still remaining many ancient walls and parts of this building it was of considerable bigness having been according to tradition on its north front in length from stock bridge to cowgate and on its west front in length from its west corner beyond that lane that leads into blyths nook it was built in the times of the he pahy  in a probate of the will of henry brandling of newcastle merchant preserved in the archives of the corporation of that town and dated july  th      there i mentioned a great house called pandonhall  in st andrews register of burial      a person is mentioned a having lived in pandon hall  i have some suspicion that pandonhall was anciently called king johns house

building at wanford archaeologia vol v p     so many ancient edifices came to be attributed to king john and to bear his name i am more disposed to wonder at than to attempt to investigate    has been

alveys island a place bourne tells us which was formerly called the island as says tradition because in former times when the tide flowed up to the stockbridge there was thereabout a hill of sand which at the tides leaving it appeared like an island they call it at present alveys island because it belonged to one of that name it is the very place in which stand the house cellars and malting of mr george hinkster which are bounded on the west north and south by the kings street and on the east by a waste piece of ground of the lady goldsburgh which was formerly called the stones  these buildings the site of which was anciently a hill of sand were situated between the foot of manorchare the foot of silverstreet and stockbridge  the street near this place extending from the foot of silverstreet to the head of the broadchare still retains the name of cowgate the ancient appellation of manorchare see before account of manorchare bourne informs us that some eminent men lived

in bournes plan duckhill in broadchare is that passage of communication between broadchare and spicerlane  near the foot of the manorchare alias cowgate was a street or place called ewgate as appears

to wallknoll was anciently called fishergate bourne tells us that in a writing drawn when henry le scott was mayor of newcastle about the year      some land is described as extending itself in longitudine a commum via super le wallknoll in australem partem domus fratrum de monte carmel usque ad communem viam que solebat ducere versus fishergate this monastery was at the top of wallknoll he supposes the common way here spoken of to have been those stairs beside mr greens house at the stockbridge which lead up to the gardens there and which were it not for a wall would directly lead from

regis inde salvationem     a street that winds up an high hill from the ancient fishergate still retains the name of wallknoll which it has no doubt derived from the circumstance of the roman walls having gone over the top of it knoll signiies hill  it seems to me says bourne to have this name from the roman wall going along it for the word knoll signifies an hill or eminence as i gather from the lord bishop of londons note in cambden upon sevenoke in kent who says on the east side of it stands knowlle so called because it is seated upon a hill and gray says also positively that it was part of the picts wall     a few years ago a meeting house for protestant dissenters was erected on the wallknoll of which mr richardson was minister  not far from this in the descent toward lovelane is a place of worship used by the sect of dissenters called independents of which mr william leighton was minister  upon wallknoll stood anciently the house of the carmelites or whitefriars which was deserted by that order and afterward inhabited by the trinitarians  the trinitarians or maturines styled of the order of the holy trinity for the redemption of captives also of the order of ingham from their house at a place of that name in the county of norfolk were brought into england a d      and had the lands etc of the canons of the holy sepulcher allotted them  their rule was that of st austin with some peculiar constitutions and they wore white robes with a red and blue cross upon their breasts their revenues were divided into three parts the first was for their own maintenance the second for that of the poor and the third for the redemption of christians taken captives by the infidels there were ten or twelve houses of this order in england and wales  the foundation charter of

some conjectures concerning the etymon of the name which perhaps will not be thought very satisfactory  the word forth or frith says he citing blounts law dictionary in verbo frith as it is anciently called comes from the saxon word frith which signifies peace for the english saxons held several woods to be sacred and made them sanctuaries from this definition of the word it may be no improbable conjecture that the ancient saxons inhabiting about the parts of the wall roman wall where the town now is gave the name of frith to this place as it was perhaps endowed with gloomier shades and darker recesses the awful exciters of heathen superstition than other places about the town were  which is said to have been anciently a fort belonging to the castle bourne  yet he adds without any

gray tells us it seems to be called the wardens close for says he gray tells us the warden of tinmouth had his house garden fishpond etc here and adds this indeed is not improbable for the monastery of the blackfriars was dependant upon the priory of tinmouth and there are still the seeming remains of fish ponds gardens etc  i have to observe upon the above that at the entrance to wardens close one may easily discover the remains of a small fort  the other inequalities seem to have been formed by throwing up earth for breastworks by the scots at the siege of the town in      yet there occurs in madoxs formulare anglicanum a record dated july   th      which mentions fish ponds at that time in this place  it is a lease from john rokesburgh prior of the blackfriars in newcastle and the brethren thereof to william hays of a certain great close of theirs built round with a stone wall for the term of his life at the yearly rent of    shillings and allowing him to fix a small leaden pipe of a bore large enough to admit a wheaten straw to their aqueduct running in and through that close to their monastery in order to supply his fish ponds with water etc  it appears by the common council books july  th      that certain referees for bringing water to sandgate were appointed to view the conduit at wardens close and take some washers with them to view the water and report there is an order ibid dated july  0th      to bring water into the town of newcastle from the wardens close there having been formerly time out of the memory of man a conduit of water at the north end of the wardens close which water had its course and passage into the wardens close and from thence through the blackfriars and so came into this town   of late years the free passage and conduit has been stopped   bourne speaking of shoulder of mutton close which he supposes anciently to have been part of the wardens close says there is in it a cistern of water which a friend of his imagined supplied the black friars and adds the well belonging to this monastery may proceed from it  mr bertram anderson and mr fawcus senior informed me that they remembered a reservoir in the shoulder of mutton close from whence a pipe conducted through the townwall to the friars etc  the public fountains which at newcastle are of a particular construction having each a small square reservoir before them for retaining the water for the use of horses or for common domestic purposes are called pants  dr thomas henshaw in skinners etymology in verbo tells us that pond was anciently pronounced pand which skinner derives with great probability from the anglosaxon pyndan to enclose or shut up i am inclined to suppose that pant is no more than pand by a very small corruption meaning a little reservoir or pond in a deed dated    0 relative to the public fountain in the marketplace of durham which is of construction similar to those at newcastle i find this word used ejusdem fontis caput vulgariter

one allowing toward it a penny a tide he said that he had heard of and seen many hospitals the works of rich men but that was the first he ever saw or heard of which had been built by the poor it is a pity that the design of its building is not thoroughly answered but there are some miscreants who would rather starve in sickness or old age than not guzzle a penny in their health and youth   january

them as were past their labor unless it were under due regulation or the government thereof in proper hands with sufficient power rightly to manage and apply the same would be an entire ruin not only to them the hostmen but also to the corporation of newcastle and to the coal trade in general hostmens books   january   th      the hostmen repealed their former order of the   th of may      because

committee was chosen to inquire into the matter  this committee on their report did not admit that the increase of the rate was owing chiefly to those poor for that since the   th of may      no collections had been made among the keelmen for the support of their own poor except some occasional ones in their societies and boxmeetings  this committee farther gave it as their opinion that if the former practice of collecting fourpence a tide for every keel in the river obtained by the consent of the skippers and keelmen were revised and put under proper regulations justly divided and consigned to honest hands a constant and sufficient provision might be raised hostmens books   december   th      the hostmen recommended it to the keelmen to make some agreement for the better

sense of the greatest part of the skippers and keelmen on the subject  nothing however appears to have been finally agreed upon on this occasion  february   th      the above matter was revived and

of the property of the town of newcastle are two distinct considerations it is observable that round the moor the marchstones i e boundarystones are placed a little within the hedge that separates the grounds of other proprietors from those of the town of newcastle  gateshead in the county of durham bid in his church history mentions a place which he calls caprae caput which has generally been supposed to mean gateshead  quasi the goats head from the romans having an inn hearne in the preface to his collection of curious discourses p       speaking of antoninus ad ansam has these words though this place grew to be eminent and large at last yet at first it was only one diversorium or inn on which there was the sign of the ansa by which name for that reason the whole station itself was called afterward a thing not uncommon to several other places both in ancient as well as more modern times  dr stukeley in his iter boreale p    speaking of gateshead says i guess this was a fortified town in the times of the romans where a ferry was for passage northward but by reason of the buildings no traces of it are left i saw several roman stones here the recipient parts of their handmills  the doctor supposed that gateshead was the gabrocentum of the notitia where the second cohort of the thracians were in garrison as its name in british imports goats head i suppose from the sign of some inn he adds a goats head still stands upon the sign of the golden lion  caput loci according to kennets glossary to his parochial antiquities signifies the end of a place  ad caput villae at the end of the town quaere may not gatesheved mean barely the end of the road there having been discovered no traces of a roman road carried northwards from newcastle  if bid confounded gate via with goat capra which was anciently and is still in the vulgar language of the north pronounced gate he would naturally latinize it by caprae caput instead of viae caput it is observable that in the dialect of the common people in the north of england the way leading through a town is still called the towngate   at this place with such a sign one of the great military roads ending here before the emperor hadrian had erected his bridge and connected it with the station of pons aelii on the opposite bank of the tyne  in the year  0   a battle was fought between william the conqueror in person and edgar etheling heir to the crown of scotland in conjunction with malcolm king of scots and some danish pirates upon the common adjoining to this place called gateshead fell in this conflict the latter were overthrown the conqueror having afterward recovered the town now called newcastle laid it almost level with the ground to prevent in future its becoming a place of refuge to his enemies historical events  from warburtons ms collections in the possession of his grace the duke of northumberland  in a charter of confirmation by king henry the second to the nuns of newcastle they occur as having two shillings of annual rent out of gateshead     hugh pudsey bishop of durham appears to have granted in the year      liberty of forestage to the burgesses of gateshead the substance of this grant is that from whitsunday to martinmas they shall pay  d for each cart that shall go to the forest and  d for each horse and for a man fishing one farthing forbidden things to be reserved  no forester within the limits appointed between the bishops forest and the borough to lay hands upon any burgess or inhabitant or upon his cart or cattle to stop him whether with wood timber or any other thing contentions between the forester and burgesses to be determined if possible in the borough if not to be referred to the bishop the cattle of a burgess not to be taken out of the borough but to be replevied there if the owners choose the burgesses to have grass rushes fellger i suppose gear or stuff from the fell and heath for their own use but not to sell any to others any burgess digging turf for his own fire if he have no cart of his own to pay  d for each borrowed one any burgess to give his wood to whom he pleases provided the person to whom he gives it lives on this the durham side of tyne and it be done with no unfair view but he is not to sell any without the foresters license the goods of none coming within the limits aforesaid are to be disturbed by the forester each burgess of gateshead to have the same liberty of his burgage that the burgesses of newcastle have a burgess of gateshead or his goods going into any part of the bishops land to have the peace of god and st cuthbert and all persons are forbidden to hurt or exact any thing of them there was granted to them at the same time common pasturage common portory to their houses and all the usual customs

vix inveneris the place which dr smith alludes to and which still remains i take to have been the chapel of the hospital of the trinity if it was not the original chapel of that of st edmund the present chapel of st edmunds hospital see plate entitled statues of the  charles ii and jame   which is situated half a mile farther to the south is of the very poorest style of architecture and probably was erected after the obtaining of king jamess charter to refound the hospital st edmunds hospital as shown before was among the possessions of the nuns of newcastle and thence the tradition mentioned by doctor smith may have had its rise this beautiful old chapel from the style of its architecture cannot i should suppose be older than the reign of king henry the third and it is observable that the long lips of windows are similar to those at the end of the church of tinmouth monastery and those in the temple church in london  it stands says gross who has given view of it on the east or right hand side of the high street leading to newcastlebridge from which it is distant about half a mile the west end of it is handsomely ornamented with a number of pointed arche and niches though the inside seems remarkably plain it consists of a single aisle    paces broad by    long some steps at the east end leading to the altar are still remaining near them is a grave stone on which is cut a cross similar to that in the jamb of the church door at jarrow it has also the marks of an inlaid border about it but the brass is gone the arches of the windows except those of the east and west ends which are entirely pointed are round within and pointed on the outside a remarkable ornament is mounted on its east end on a slender rod being a small circle chequered by several bars crossing each other at right angles  this author is mistaken in the account he gives of this place having been set on fire the catholic chapel which out of a misguided zeal was set on fire on that occasion was in a mansion house adjoining to this ruinous chapel the ruins of which mansion house are seen in his view  he very justly observes that the entrance which is through a low square stone gate decorated with pilasters is seemingly of modern construction  the site of the house he adds with its offices and gardens occupied about two acres and a half of land  toward the east end of it are the ruins of a mansion which from the style of its architecture seems to have been built since the dissolution of the monastery perhaps out of its materials this probably was mr riddles house alluded to by bourne  the gateway is probably of the same age gross also confounds the very ancient monastery of uttan and st edmunds hospital with this ruin the former undoubtedly perished in those depredations of the barbarians when all the religious houses in northumberland were destroyed   at gateshead dedicated to the holy trinity for the maintenance of a chaplain and three poor men to which

of tynebridge as belongs to the sea of durham whereas the right reverend father in god john lord bishop of durham is entitled in right of his see to onethird part of an ancient bridge extending across the river tyne between the town of gateshead in the county palatine of durham and the town and county of the town of newcastle upon tyne and whereas by the violence and rapidity of a most extraordinary flood which happened on the seventeenth day of november one thousand seven hundred and seventy one in the river of tyne the said bridge was very much damaged broken down in several places and rendered utterly impassable and whereas in order to restore an easy and safe communication between the counties of durham and northumberland it is highly expedient that the said bridge should be rebuilt or effectually repaired with all possible expedition and inasmuch as the necessary repairs of the onethird part of the said bridge belonging to the said lord bishop of durham in right of his see and extending from two blue marble or boundary stones on the south side of the said bridge to the said town of gateshead will be attended with a great expense and however reasonable or proper it may be that the entire sum necessary to be appropriated for and employed in that useful and necessary work ought to be raised out of or secured upon the revenues and possessions of the said see of durham and that the lord bishop of durham for the time being ought not to bear any greater burden than shall arise from the interest or annual charge to be paid in respect of the principal money to be raised for the purpose aforesaid yet the said john lord bishop of durham is consenting that a reasonable and adequate sum of money may be raised by the authority of parliament by granting annuities for lives which will not only be speedy and effectual but may be a method less burdensome to the successors in the said see than to the said john now lord bishop of durham by the eventual dropping of lives and the decrease of such temporary charge wherefore may it therefore please your majesty that it may be enacted and be it enacted by the kings most excellent majesty by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and temporal and commons in this present parliament assembled and by the authority of the same that the chancellor of the bishopric and county palatine of

purposes aforesaid  and forasmuch as the raising an adequate sum of money upon the credit of this act by granting annuities for lives will be a speedy and effectual method of carrying the intentions of the said john lord bishop of durham into complete execution be it therefore further enacted by the authority aforesaid that it shall and may be lawful to and for any person or persons to contribute advance and pay to such treasurer or treasurers as the said john lord bishop of durham or his successors shall in manner hereinafter mentioned authorize and empower to receive the same for the uses

majestys reign for building a temporary bridge over the river tyne between the town of new castle upon tyne and gateshead in the county of durham for completing the new stone bridge over the said river and for making the avenues to and the passage over the same more commodious whereas the ancient stone bridge extending across the river tyne between the town and county of the town of newcastle upon tyne and the town of gateshead in the county of durham wa in november one thousand seven hundred and seventyone by the violence and rapidity of a most extraordinary stood very much damaged broken down in several places and rendered utterly impassable and there one third part of the bridge between the said towns belong to the se of durham and the other two third parts to the corporation of necastle and whereas in the twelfth year of the reign of his present  n act was passed for building a temporary bridge over the said river and  newcastle having proposed to expnd the sum of two thousand four hundred pounds of their own money toward the expense of building such temporary bridge and purchasing houses and ground in newcastle and gateshead aforesaid for making a road to such temporary bridge power was given to the mayor aldermen and common council of the said town and county to build the said bridge and maintain and support the same when built and for that purpose to appoint a committee to transact such matters as they might find necessary and whereas by the said act it was enacted that the said temporary bridge should continue only for the term of seven years from the twentyfourth day of june one thousand seven hundred and seventytwo and that for reimbursing the said mayor aldermen and common council all such sums as by them should be laid out for the purposes in the said act mentioned over and above the said sum of two thousand four hundred pounds it should be lawful for them to take certain tolls for passage over the said temporary bridge and whereas it was apprehended at the time of passing the said act that a new stone bridge might be built or the old stone bridge effectually repaired in less time than seven years from the said twentyfourth day of june but it having since been sound necessary to take down four arches of that part of the said bridge which belongs to the said corporation which at the time of passing the said act were deemed sit to be left standing the building of the new stone bridge has been retarded and the same cannot be completed in less than three years from this time and whereas when the old stone bridge was destroyed by a flood as before mentioned there were standing on that part thereof which belongs to the corporation of newcastle diverse houses shops and other buildings which greatly incommoded the passage along the said bridge all which have been purchased by the said corporation at a very considerable expense in order to prevent the public being incommoded thereby and whereas the lord bishop of durham and the said corporation have respectively proceeded to build a new stone bridge in the place where the old bridge stood and the said corporation had on the twentyninth day of december one thousand seven hundred and seventyeight expended of their own proper money in building their part of the same the sum of twentyone thousand and fortytwo pounds sixteen shillings and elevenpence including one thousand eight hundred and thirtyeight pounds nine shillings and eightpence the price of the buildings on the old bridge and have since that time incurred further expenses in carrying on the same and whereas upon a moderate computation the said corporation must expend the further sum of ten thousand pounds in completing that part of the said bridge which belongs to them and whereas the said corporation had expended on the said twentyninth day of december one thousand seven hundred and seventyeight over and above the said sum of two thousand four hundred pounds in and about the purposes of the said recited act for building a temporary bridge the sum of three hundred and twentyone pounds eighteen shillings and ninepence more than the tolls taken upon the said temporary bridge had produced and it is apprehended that the tolls taken and to be taken thereupon from the twentyseventh day of december one thousand seven hundred and seventy eight to the twentyfourth day of june one thousand seven hundred and seventynine and not produce so much money a will be sufficient to reimburse the said corporation the said sum of three hundred and twentyone pounds eighteen shillings and ninepence and the necessary expenses of repairing preserving and supporting the said temporary bridge to the said twentyfourth day of june and whereas the said temporary bridge is liable to great damage from floods and ice in the river and also from keels loaded with coals passing through the same and it will be of public utility that the same temporary bridge should be supported till the said new stone bridge shall be built and whereas at the time the said bridge was destroyed by a flood there were standing on that part thereof which belong to the sea of durham diverse houses shops and other buildings which greatly incommoded the passage over the same and whereas the avenue and passage to the said new bridge at both ends thereof are the same as were to the old bridge and are very narrow and it would be of public utility to open more convenient avenues and passages thereto and also if the sea of durham was restrained from erecting or permitting to be erected any houses shops or other buildings on that part of the said newbridge which belongs to the said see may it therefore please your majesty that it may be enacted and be it enacted by the kings most excellent majesty by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and temporal and commons in this present parliament assembled and by the authority of the same that from and after the

urbs olim inclyta bello et muri disjecti et propugnacula lapsa ibid p  0 draiton in the   th song of his polyolbion thus introduces a poetical description of the roman wall but pictswall all this while as though he had been lost not mentioned by the muse began to fret and fume that every petty brook thus proudly should presume to talk and he whom first the romans did invent and of their greatness yet the longstlivd monument should thus be overtrod wherefore his wrong to wreake in their proud presence thus does aged pictswall speak he thinks that offas ditch in cambria should not dare to think himself my match who with such cost and care the romans did erect and for my safeguard set their legions from my spoil the proling pict to let that often inroads made our earth from them to win by adrian beaten back so he to keep them in to sea from east to west begun me first a wall of eighty miles in length twixt tyne and edens fall long making me they were and long did me maintain nor yet that trench which tracts the western wiltshire plain of woden wansdyke called should parallel with me comparing our descents which shall appear to be mere upstarts basely borne for when i was in hand the saxon had not then set foot upon the land till my declining age and after many a year of whose poor petty kings those the small labors were that on newmarket heath made up as though but now who for the devils work the vulgar dare avow tradition telling none who truly it began where many a reverent book can tell you of my man and when i first decayed severus going on what adrian built of turfe he builded new of stone and after many a time the britans me repayrd to keep me still in plight nor cost they ever spared towns stood upon my length where garrisons were laid their limits to defend and for my greater aid with turrets i was built where sentinels were placed to watch upon the pict so me my makers graced with hollow pipes of brass along me still they went by which they in one fort still to another sent by speaking in the same to tell them what to do and so from sea to sea could i be whispered through upon my thickness three marched easily breast to breast twelve foot was i in height such glory i possessed old pictswall with much pride thus finishing his plea had in his utmost course attained the eastern sea   during my residence at newcastle upon tyne prompted by an ardour of curiosity bordering on enthusiasm i occasionally made several excursions to examine the still remaining vestiges of those stupendous works raised here by a people who were justly styled the conquerors of the world for the great purpose of protecting in their possessions their civilized subjects and to ward off the attacks of the more northern and unconquered barbarians  agricola appears to have suggested the first idea of building these by erecting a d    see horsleys britannia romana a row of sorts across the island from tinmouth the late discovery of a roman altar and tablet in the foundations of the ancient christian church there seems clearly to evince that tinmouth has been one of their stations  see vol ii p    of this work  and ibid p  0 that there has been anothr at east chirton called blake chestres in the year   0  it is still however certain that neithr of the walls extended as far as tinmouth hadrians having terminated at newcastle upon tyne and that of severu at the old village of walls end about three miles to the east of newcastle on the german ocean to the irish sea  to connect these the emperor hadrian that hadrian was the first that built a wal here we have the express testimony of a roman historian in the following words britanniam petrit in qua multa correxit mru que per o toginta millia passuum  qui barbaros romanosque divideret  spartiani vita hadriani script hist august p     hadrians vallum as it is also called appears to have been a turf wall with a deep fosse or ditch accompanying it on the north side there was another called by horsley the south agger at the distance of about five paces to the south of it as also another and larger agger on the north side of the ditch which the same writer supposes to have been the military way to this work as it had been before to the pretentura of stations these four works it is very observable keep all the way a constant regular parallelism one to another the same writer acknowledges that there is no determining with certainty what was the original height of this mud wall and its aggers of which he conjectures the southern one to have been for an inner defense in case they should be beaten from the principal work or to protect the soldiers against any sudden attack from the provincial britons  see britannia romana p      though arus and vallum are sometimes promiscuously used yet vallum rather signifies an agger of earth in which sense it plainly occurs in caesars comm in the following passage  valio pedum    et fossa pedum    hiberna cin runt  de blio gallico lib v c      first in the year   0 and afterward severus severus wall built of square stones and every where expon the edges of precipices accompanied by a deep ditch or fosse was according to

original height  to this work belongs a paved military way which every where has attended this wll on the south side though not alwys parallel to it for in soe placs it mkes a short ble the sing to a bow  mr hory pposed too that there was a smaller military way  the wall for the convenience of parties of soldier ing from one turret to another there was no north agger though the earth thrown out of

wallis of segedunum from the roman seges corn and the british dunum a hill i e the fort or station on a high ground furnished with magazines of corn brought by sea from the more southern provinces and landed here is i think erroneous for seges signifies cornland soil where corn grows may not the first syllable be derived with greater probability from sedge a narrow flag so called i e the hill of sedge  segedunum where the notitia stations the first cohort of the lergi is supposed to have stood at a small distance from the present an old woman still living remembers when the site of the present walls end was an empty field village of walls end and a little to the east of a gentlemans seat house called at present carville but in horsleys time cousins house in two fields or closes known by the name of welllawes perhaps by corruption for walllawes the fire engines and workings of a new colliery adjoining to segedunum the area of this station is described by horsley as having been on a plain the south rampart has run along the brow of the hill or at the head of the descent toward the rver and the outbuildings or town as appears by the hillocks of stones and rubbish has stood upon the descent open to the southern sun and reached to the side of the river all which is exactly agreeable to the rules the romans seem to have almost inviolably observed in building their stations  britan romans p      i have in my possession the original stones found here and marked no     and   in horsleys britannia romana northumberland what that writer calls far on one of them is plainly flor for florus a common name on a close inspection of the stone  the altar no   the inscription of which is now wholly defaced has a remarkable focus and has been of elegant design and execution  the following which i suspected at first sight to be an imposition was published in the newcastle journal august  th      to the printer some workmen digging near wallsend have this morning

than what it is too soft an appellation to call his folly    will soon it is probable deface every vestige of this station so that future antiquaries will search for the foundations of it in vain the house built for the viewer of the colliery stands parallel to the west rampart of the station and near the southwest angle  the present the engine stands about six yards to the north of the wall the foundations of which were found here six feet beneath the level of the ground  in sinking the shaft of a pit very large teeth were found and a conduit discovered which has no doubt remained there since it was a roman town the viewer crept a good way along it and described  built of great stones of course wokanship  january   th      i found two new waggonways in the field where the easternmost

representation no   of a beautiful  pottery found here and in my possession whereon is delineated a roman horseman striking at a naked part     it has been a fort about six chains square from the south end of the eastern rampart of which gordon supposed that the wall itself formed almost a right angle and then was continued down to the side of the river  mr horsley says p     that it is the western rampart of the station which makes that angle with the wall on the contrary i traced the eastern rampart of this station to the very edge of the tyne april  d      in company with the ingenious mr chapman where we caused many square stones bedded in lime to be dug out in several parts of it and close to the brink of that river  the old or original village of walsend stood close to this station and is thus described by leland walsend pagul inquens a fine   there i thought to have been anciently a cross in the village for a stone marked for a sundial wa discovered on the site of

it than can be conveyed by any verbal description the above mr shafto discovered a roman hypocaust or sudatory at the distance of about three hundred yards southwest of the station of this also he has left an accurate plan illustrated with written descriptions the annexed copperplate representation is a fac simile of mr shaftos plan this station was on the top of the first eminence beyond fenham

in them wherein iron rivets have been fixed but catch away by rust many ages ago still lie bedded on the spot and defy the violence of the rapid stoods it was a remarkably dry summer when i visited this place and the water was so low and clear that on wading into it i discovered the foundation of one of the piers one end of it was defaced but it seemed to have originally resembled the modern

very observable about the fort of carrawbrugh at carraw a little farther west in the gable end of a stable in the inside there is built up a roman stone on which the figure of a man is sculptured in something like the same attitude in which the river gods are usually depicted  from carrawbrugh to housesteeds called by dr stukeley with great propriety the tadmor of britain the distance is somewhat

side of a gateway at the adjoining mill a little to the south of it where there are some remarkable barrows  i was shown the graves in some of these that had been opened out  in one of them was found a skull they consisted of side stones set down into the earth and covered at top with other larger stones i suppose these to have been very early christian sepulchers  this no doubt has been the

who while living were thought to have the gift of prophecy and after their death seem to have been worshipped as a sort of genii or tutelar deities of the places where they resided the germans paid
