a plan for a town and township to be laid out within the compass of one square mile or   0 acres containing  0 town lots for planters or farmers having large out lots beyond the township also town lots for   public officers and for     troulesmen clerks artificers fishermen seamen or laborers in all     town lots with small outlots of a quarter of a square furlong or   acres each for the said officers laborers and within    of a mile from each side of the town    a general plan for laying out towns and townships on the newacquired lands in the east indies america or elsewhere in order to promote cultivation and raise the value of all the adjoining land at the price of giving gratis the townlots and in some cases as in new colonies also the small outlots to the first settlers and their heirs so long as they possess no other land and on other equitable conditions        explanation of the annexed plan the town distinguished by being colored red is contained in a square each side of which is   furlongs or half a mile having a square furlong or  0 acres in the center appropriated to public offices  viz a church town hall guardhouse separate penitentiary lots or prisons for males and females also schools for each sex and a public caravansera for strangers and travelers under the control of the constable on guard by rotation the breadth of the streets and highways is proposed to be the  th part of a furlong or    feet   inches which will allow room for aquaducts wherever streams of water can be introduced from superior levels and also room for planting ranges of spreading trees to shelter the footpaths and as the bounds of each square furlong meet in the center of the streets measured from the   external edges or sides of the town colored red which are distant each from its opposite side   complete furlongs or half a mile   inches by the scale these external edges or lines of the town and the streets must be first laid out that the remaining space in each square furlong of the town may be divided into townlots in equal proportions viz   opposite sides of the town are appropriated to large townlots of nearly one acre each for planters or farmers and as these large townlots commence from the external edge of the town and not from the center of the streets like the small townlots their length will be a complete half furlong or   0 feet in their breadth there will be some variation the uppermost and undermost divisions of square furlongs being measured from the external edges or red lines at the top and bottom of the town as represented in this plan have a deduction of    feet   inches for half the width of the street on one side only which subtracted from   0 feet the breadth of the furlong leaves a space of     feet   inches for the breadth of   lots which space divided by   allows the breadth of each planters townlot in the uppermost and lowermost divisions to be     feet   inches including the fences and the planters townlots in the   central divisions as the central divisions have a street on   sides must lose    feet   inches from the width of each furlong which being first deducted from the   0 feet leave a breadth of only     feet   inches to be divided into   equal parts whereby the width of the planters lots in the   central divisions is reduced to     feet   inches each including the fences  the size of the small townlots will also unavoidably vary and be of two different dimensions as to their breadth though all are of equal length for as they are measured from the center of each square furlong to the center of the streets a deduction of    feet   inches half the width of the streets must be made from the length of half a furlong or   0 feet which reduces the length of each lot to     feet   inches and    feet   inches being also deducted from the breadth of the uppermost and lowest ranges of square furlongs for half the width of the street on one side of each furlong the space for the width of   lots is thereby reduced to     feet   inches which divided by   gives  0  feet   inch and half for the width of each lot including the fences and    feet   inches being deducted from the central divisions for half the width of the streets on   sides of each division or square furlong reduce the space for   lots to     feet   inches which divided by   gives only    feet   inches for the width of the small townlots in the central divisions including their respective fences  n b in old settled countries where land is already of considerable value it is not to be supposed that the proprietors of land can be induced to give gratis more than the small townlots of half an acre and a few poles each which with the roads and streets will amount to about   0 acres to be given gratis out of    0 acres or less than   per cent and the improved value of the remaining estate most certainly will amply repay the donation as the value of land is generally doubled by the proximity of a town  and as even this last proposed donation of   0 acres will be much too large a venture for landholders in general to risque in such an experiment it is necessary to remark that they may proceed on the half of this plan quite as effectually by dividing the town and township in the center whereby the land to be given gratis or granted in freehold to the settlers will not exceed  0 acres and even with this large reduction of the plan space will be reserved for the families of  0 farmers or planters and of    artificers or laborers and as the line of division in this latter mode will pass through the center square of the present plan   additional small townlots may be formed in the space of half the square and half of the public lots around it which will enable the town upon the whole to contain    households and if   cottages for laborers be added at the outer gates or avenues of the estate the community will form a complete hundred of householders which is a very respectable body of people for maintaining peace and good order according to the common law of england  whenever only one half of the plan is adopted the side where the central line of division is made must be placed next to the water whether the sea or river creek or canal and care must be taken that a sufficient strand or space of common land be reserved between the town and the water that all the inhabitants may have

conditions on which the grants of land should be made for the peaceable regulation of the several towns or communities  the proprietors of the land should give gratis to each male settler of good moral character and of ability to labor one small townlot and in new settlements where few laborers can be procured also one of the small outlots of   acres gratis so long as they possess no other land but no longer for strict provision should be made in the grants that no man shall hold   lots in the same town even if an additional lot should fall to him by inheritance or be acquired in any other way for that would destroy the safety of the town by decreasing the number of inhabitants and that no lot which had once been given gratis should ever afterward be either sold or let at rent to any undertenant or be added to any other lot on the penalty of forfeiture to the first granter or granters or to their heirs or successors to be by them once more bestowed for the same benevolent purpose on some other industrious tradesman or labourer who has no other land already in possession that the number and strength of the little community may be maintained and if the first granter etc should neglect such disposal of any forfeited or vacant lot more than    months the right of disposal as above should lapse and be vested in the householders of the town where the forfeiture is incurred according to the election of the majority of them in common council assembled  but though the settlers may not sell let or enlarge their lots when they acquire other lands either by inheritance or otherwise yet they may nevertheless be allowed to present in free gift the possession of their lots when so vacated by additional landed property elsewhere on the same limited terms to any person whom they shall think proper to elect provided such person has not already any other land in possession  but with respect to the larger townlots for planters or farmers marked a b c d etc they may be as appendages or homesteds to the farms or large outlots extending beyond the lesser township and of course they may be let or sold with those farms as the proprietors or granters of the land may think best for their own advantage and so likewise with respect to the small outlots in the lesser township whenever the proprietors of the land shall have reserved to themselves that power in their original grants  and for the safety and happiness of each community the land should be granted on the farther especial condition that the settlers shall promise to keep watch and ward by rotation of militia service under their own elected chiefs that they may duly maintain peace justice and common right in their respective communities and folkmotes according to the common law of england in frankpledge which is the only effectual mode of obtaining law peace and good government without expense  a description of frankpledge frankpledge is an ancient patriarchal mode of arranging the families or rather households of a nation in numerical divisions of tens or tythings fifties hundreds or wappentacs and thousands see deuteronomy i      take ye or rather according to the hebrew choose ye to yourselves wise men and understanding and known among your tribes which necessarily implies that the tribes were to nominate and i said moses will make them rulers over you i e the returns of the elections were to be made to moses and he was to invest the elected with public authority and ye said moses answered me and said the thing which thou have spoken is good for us to do thus moses like a good politician and faithful public minister under god declared the free assent of the people whereby the important measure he himself had proposed of establishing frankpledge by the advice of jethro was enacted and became a public law or statute of that nation israel as much as it has been enacted to englishmen by magna charta so i took said moses the chief of your tribes wise men and known that is known among the tribes as expressed in the   th verse which necessary qualification could not fairly be ascertained unless the known men were really returned or named to moses as such by the tribes themselves and made them heads over you captains or heads over thousands and captains over hundreds what we call hundreders or high constables and captains over fifties and captains over tens or tythingmen and officers among your tribes  thus it appears that the officers in general from the colonel or captain of a thousand whether of individuals or families down to the sergeant constable or tythingman were recommended or rather nominated by the people before they were invested with authority by moses  and i said moses charged your judges at that time whereby it must of course be understood that the judges also had been previously nominated by the people as wise men and understanding and known among the tribes agreeable to the preceding enacted proposal saying hear the causes between your brethren and judge righteously between every man and his brother and the stranger that is with him ye shall not respect persons in judgment deuteronomy i       compare this with deuteronomy xvi    judges and officers shall thou give to thyself in all thy gates throughout thy tribes and they shall judge the people with just judgment etc and the rule for just judgment is not to respect persons in judgment but the colonial legislators in all the european settlements of america and the west indies in order to favor and tolerate slavery have suppressed this indispensable rule for just judgment for otherwise that abominable pagan oppression slavery which had been gradually abolished through the happy influence of christianity could not have been renewed under governments which still call themselves christian but this hateful mark of reprobacy and delinquency of the nations or rather of the fullness of the gentiles i mean the baneful renewal of pagan slavery will surely draw down upon the guilty nations a severe retribution from that supreme judge who i no respecter of persons in judgment if they cannot find leisure from their bloody wars and destructive oppressions for repentance for the divine retribution is clearly revealed in the scriptures that it will be measure for measure that  that leads into captivity shall be led into captivity he that kills with the sword must be killed with the sword for the almighty has promised to destroy them who desthoy the earth   of householders or masters of families including all that either rent a house by the year on which the right of burgage tenure in england is founded or live in their own houses and pay their due proportion of public expenses  all such by this most ancient and salutary system were required to pledge each other and to pledge or be responsible for every other individual living under their respective roofs whereby all persons were rendered most completely and readily amenable to just laws an indispensable condition of liberty because neither liberty nor justice can walk upright and secure unless they go hand in hand for every breach of the public peace or for any breach even of common morality or decency that could be deemed hurtful or inconvenient to others in the judgment of an impartial jury of neighbors subject to the previous challenge of the persons accused or indicted in so full and effectual a manner as to exclude all suspicion of partiality and this under magistrates and public officers freely elected by the householders of every district for short probationary terms of power never exceeding    months without reelection by a majority of the householders over whom respectively their delegated power extended  it was a just and wise principle of the ancient constitution of england to vest all electionrights in the householders paying scot and lot or the ordinary public rates but a farther extension of the franchise to every individual of the community which some wellmeaning friends to reformation have proposed would be a vain innovation that might perhaps prove as dangerous as it is certainly inexpedient and needless because the ancient constitution of frankpledge which vested the right of election in the householders alone is distinguished in the law books see lambards archionomia inter leges edwardi regis  0 de ibergis where frankpledge is more particularly exed y the peculiar style of summa et maxima secuitas  the chief and greatest security a title justly unded on the practical experience of ages and erefore though the first plants to be cultivated in  colonies and communities are most certainly the sacred plants of righteousness peace and liberty yet even these indispensable plants cannot so effectually take root and flourish as when the happy soil of their cultivation is previously fenced by the establishment of frankpledge with a due practical knowledge of natural and revealed religion the two first foundations of english law contrary to which no custom maxim or even statute can be legal according to the common law of england which is only common sense improved by the written revelation of gods laws in the holy scriptures  so indispensable to the constitution of england was frankpledge deemed by our ancestors that they justly required the view of frankpledge by an express article of their great charter chap    to be at the feast of st michael without occasion i e without waiting for any other circumstance to authorize the view than the mere annual return of michaelmas the usual season of holding it and the trything by the same high authority is required to be wholly kept or maintained entire as it used to be  trithing a teneatur integra sicut esse consuevit because the efficacy of frankpledge in the ready administration o justice without expense depends chiefly on holding the trything which is the monthly cour leet of three or more hundreds joined together or more generally the court leet of a third pa of a shire or riding derived from trything see camdens britannia bishop gibsons edition p   as the word riding is allowed to be derived from trything i very probable that ruding has also the same etymology see also leges edwardi regis cap    de trithingis and ledis and as both frankpledge and the trything are thus expressly required by magna charta they may lawfully be established wherever a legal english government is maintained without any farther authority than the vote or agreement of a majority of the householders in each district  granville sharp  extract of a letter from the author to a gentleman in the east indies from some late determinations in the courts of bengal against slave dealers and oppressors of the poor laboring natives accounts of which have been published in our english newspapers the public here in general are well satisfied that the poor natives in india are free and receive wages for their labor and consequently all the most steady friends to the measure of abolishing the slave trade are solicitous to promote the use and sale of east india sugar in preference to that which is cultivated by slaves elsewhere so that you may be assured that the sugar trade from india may be immensely increased and the value of the newacquired lands in india may be amply advanced for the benefit of the hon east india company or of the proprietors of east indian lands in general if due care be taken by the companys agents and servants to satisfy europeans that the east india sugar continues to be really the produce of free labor and care must also be taken to prevent west indian adventurers or others from forming plantations in any of the newacquired indian lands now become british territory on any other plan than that of free labor that the baneful and iniquitous practice of exacting labor without wages may be effectually prevented and be duly deemed as detestable among men as it is certainly abominable in the sight of god all imposing contracts for labor should also be vigilantly guarded against by the administrators of government in the several indian departments for next after the abolition of the slave trade and slavery the most important consideration certainly is how to place the poor laboring natives of india in such a happy state of permanent establishment as may insure to them a general subsistence independent of the caprice and injustice of monopolizers and the grasping speculations of mercenary adventures and yet with such moderation in this little elevation of their condition that they may still feel sufficient inducement to prompt their industry for the public good to this point i have lately turned my thoughts and have reason to think that it may easily be effected not only to the advantage and security of the industrious poor and to the general promotion of trade in the numerous articles which the laborers by  little elevation of their condition will be enabled to purchase but also at the same time to the very great advantage and profit of the rich i mean those that have much landed property and have thereby the power of carrying such a plan into execution for by granting a very small proportion of their lands to industrious laborers upon the conditions i have proposed in the enclosed paper they will be enabled to raise the value of all the rest of their lands for by this means they will never be at a loss either for free laborers to cultivate whatever parts of their estates they shall choose to continue in their own hands or for a sufficient number of wellknown people among them of approved industry that may be trusted to contract as renters for the cultivation of the remainder of their estates in small portions or farms suited to their respective abilities and at their own risque and by the same means i am persuaded the value of the newacquired lands in india may be exceedingly enhanced as well for the advantage of the natives as for the hon east india company and of all their agents and servants in case the latter should be permitted to realize their fortunes acquired in india by investments of landed property purchased either of the company or of the native proprietors especially as the increasing demand for east indian sugar affords great encouragement for cultivating lands in india and there are many other branches of husbandry hitherto neglected in india as the planting of sago trees and a variety of other valuable productive vegetables which would enrich the occupiers of land and amply assord a due compence to the industrious laborers  i am aware however that my proposal in the nclosed paper of establishing frankpledge among the indian nations will be charged with objections too commonly deemed insuperable by europeans that have dwelt among them and who therefore ought to be best acquainted with their dispositions the inveterate prejudices of the gentoos concerning the imaginary inscrutable antiquity of the braminical traditions and their supposed unalienable attachment to their religion will be alleged but how shall we venture to rely on the experience and consequent opinions of most of the europeans that have lived among them in a point which they are so far from having attempted to investigate with candor that many of them through a lamentable neglect or ignorance of christianity and ancient history have rather been inclined blindly to adopt than to confute the absurdities of gentooism  one english gentleman though he is neither deficient in understanding nor in experience and knowledge of the manners and dispositions of the gentoos has very gravely informed us of a great similarity between the mosaical laws and those of the gentoos but this gentleman whose benevolent intentions i do not at all question or even suspect has not been sufficiently aware o the mystery of iniquity and the working of satan the great deceiver of the nations for all tru religion is uniform in righteousness and in justice whereas the code of laws which he has commended abounds with injustice falsehood and cruel opprssion of the poor though some faint traces of justice an morality may seem to be dispersed among these laws for the more easy seduction of indiscriminate people as satan will always endeavor to appear as an angel of light and all his votaries wear a mask of very opposite features from those that are hid by it but some even of the very laws which are included in this gentlemans publication and which are thereby exposed to the light of truth and common sense afford ample confutation of his own remark for by these it appears that the gentoo laws proceed by a sevenfold proportion of inequity i e a numerical perfection of iniquity extorting from the poor sooders fines of seven times the value that are required of the bramins for the very same offenses though the laws of god declared by moses to which they have been very injudiciously compared absolutely prohibit any respect of persons in judgment and notwithstanding the pretended mildness of these laws yet the cloven foot is apparent for the sooder is doomed to be burned alive for fornication with a bramin woman even though she should have been proved the first seducer whereas the bramin for the abominable and irreparable injury to a female sooder even of a violent rape is let off for a small fine and this detestable and enormous iniquity is even established by an acknowledged law nay there is an express law to insure to the bramins the gross privilege which they claim for the indulgence of their lust that it is lawful for a bramin to tell a lie to deceive a woman and yet with all these abominable privileges bad as they are their iniquity is still aggravated by the blasphemous falsehood that their deceitful cast proceeded from the mouth of the creator other casts from inferior parts of his body and the sooders from the soles of his fect satan could not suggest a more malicious calumny against the divine justice it is so evident a token of the mystery of iniquity and working of satan that we need not search farther in the gentoo laws for the declared doctrines of demons the two revealed marks of the mystery of iniquity by which christians are warned to know the man of sin or  the lawless one that was to prevail in the roman empire in the latter times viz forbidding to marry and commanding to abstain from meats etc  though the poor gentoos are also grievously injured and deluded by the last of these marks for as the interposition of deluding spirits is manifested in the apostate church of the roman empire by the open assumption of a pagan title of priesthood pontifex and still more especially by that most presumptuous title of pretended infallibility and universal dominion pontifex maximus through which this dangerous usurper of unlimited power under the masque of religion became the true image of the beast the former imperial pontifices or heathen emperors who did not more haughtily suppress the natural rights of mankind than did their successors the papal pontifices in proclaiming crusades and in exciting lawless princes to wage bloody and destructive wars against all persons that opposed their image worship and other antichristian corruptions and in establishing bloody inquisitions to maintain this horrible tyranny so the same unnatural interposition may as evidently be traced to its spiritual source by the baneful fruits and bloody track of inquisitorial cruelty and tyranny manifested in the laws of the bramins lately published as the cutting off the buttock of a sooder for sitting on the carpet of a bramin the cramming a redhot iron into their mouths for repeating any words of the beads or shaster and the pouring hot wax into their ears for sitting to hear them read if the beads contained any good it would be consummate popery thus to prohibit the communication of what is good from the vulgar like the universal prohibition of the scriptures in the vernacular tongues wherever the beast prevails but there can be no doubt if the sooders were duly protected by government from the fear of such frightful penalties that they would not be backward to acknowledge their just and equal claims to all the rights of mankind and i need only mention these severe laws as ample and sufficient proofs to confute the prejudices of gentlemen infallibly experienced as they suppose by their residence in india respecting the imaginary unalienable attachment of the hindoos to their false religion for unless the bramins themselves had known that the other hindoos were much inclined to think themselves equally men with the bramins and to be thereby entitled to all equal rights and natural justice they would not have disgraced their code of laws with such enormities frankpledge is the only safe mode of restoring these poor people to their just rights and it was necessary for me thus far to guard against the obvious objections that would be made by many gentlemen who presume much on their own experimental knowledge of the gentoos  i remain with sincere esteem dear sir your affectionate friend and obliged humble servant g s
