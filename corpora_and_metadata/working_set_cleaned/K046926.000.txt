a treatise concerning the smallpox  in which a plain and easy method of curing that disease under its most direful symptoms is discovered  and  the case of women with child at that time particularly considered and so stated as to be rendered even safer than that of other women  the whole made apparent from reason and the natural disposition of the parts exemplified by several instances of fact  in a letter written in the year      to the learned dr john bateman then president of the royal college of physicians by f bellinger of the college of physicians  london printed for the author and sold by w and j innys in st pauls churchyard and j roberts in warwick lane mdccxxi  to his grace john duke of montague these few pages are most humbly offered by his graces most obedient and most humble servant  f bellinger  the preface it is now upwards of four years since the following sheets were finished and just going to the press when a tedious sickness of a dear relation which at last ended in death interposed and not only for that time suspended my thoughts of publishing them then but even extinguished my intentions of ever doing it at all this i thought necessary to premise that what may be found either in the body or historical accounts of the following discourse may not be supposed in any way to relate to the contentions which have arisen between some eminent practisers concerning purging in the declension of the small pox but whatever is there i look upon my self to be answerable for whither bad or good  for as on one hand it would be an inexcusable partiality and peevishness to find fault with any discovery that may be made in practice upon so difficult a disease as the smallpox frequently proves to be in as much as by such suggestion sick persons or those about them may be deterred from making use of such things as may be serviceable and instrumental toward the saving their lives so would it be as unpardonable a levity on the other hand for any one to depart from a method he had found successful with very little interruption in a disease under its general designation and without any at all when so particularly circumstantiated as the smallpox is in women with child which has been always looked on as a singular disadvantage to persons laboring under it at that time  one of the first instances the learned dr friend gives in his treatise de purgatione in secunda fiber etc is of a person that miscarried upon which account he consulted with the celebrated dr chamberlen whose peculiar business must frequently lead him into observations of that kind more than any others and as the case is very extraordinary in all its particulars dr friend closes the relation after this manner that the learned gentleman he consulted with assured surd him that twas one of the first patients he ever knew recover under those disadvantages and indeed instances of such success have been very rare which very observation well reflected on sufficiently justifies and vindicates any regular and rational attempt and such i hope the following will appear to be that may be made to prevent if possible the tender sex being reduced to such an unhappy condition and dilemma for by abortion the life of the child is certainly destroyed and at the same time and on the same account let others say what they please that of the mother is brought into the utmost jeopardy and as the first can be saved by no other means than by preventing the miscarriage so is the last in the most probable way of being preserved by the same measures  when i first laid these few observations before the very learned dr bateman the then president of the college of physicians he was pleased to encourage my publishing them in the following terms  your treatise of the smallpox deserves highly to be published not only for the histories you give of the good success of your powder but especially for the cases of the women which is quite new i thank you also for the rare use of blisters in case of haemorrhages which i never heard of before etc  so kind an approbation and from so great a hand is sufficient to encourage my publishing it at this time had i no other but when i have through gods blessing met with the same success here in london as in the country and at the same time look back upon the two last years bills of mortality and see so vast a number of persons carried off by the smallpox and the weekly bills still continuing in that article not low i need make no excuse surely if i endeavor to give a helping hand in so great a calamity  the manner of treating women with child in the smallpox is as the forementioned learned gentleman does me the honor to assure the world quite new and yet i will take the liberty at the same time to affirm that the practice is founded upon reason and truth in the natural disposition administration and function of the parts during the time of their being so which is indeed undeniable by this test all former practice ought to be examined and upon this foundation all new discoveries in medicine ought to be laid and if upon such principles and considerations success has constantly attended the practice what more can be desired and it will not certainly be taken for a precarious way of proceeding to presume that some of the thousands that were swept away by the smallpox the two last years might be women with child and the being instrumental in the saving but one life will abundantly justify the present work which common humanity obliges every one to confess  as to the powder here proposed i must freely acknowledge that it chiefly consists of such parts as are well and commonly known in use and practice but the manner of its composition is somewhat new and then as to the salt of amber being directed as an alexipharmick and it is certainly the noblest and most generous one in the whole pharmaceutick kind that i think is also something new but that i might neither impose upon my self nor my readers i have again and again reviewed the whole materia of dr sydenham dr morton and others and cannot once find it administered as such which has been matter of greater wonder than pleasure to observe i could willingly enter into a long account of its excellency and a rationale of its operation but i shall abridge my self of that pleasure and in few words only say that though it be reckoned among the volatile salts yet as it vastly excells any of them in its effects it greatly differs from them in its very nature most if not all the other have a burning canstick quality in them as is evident in sal volat corn cerv cranij vel ossium humanorum and all sorts of volatile salts of bones and bonelike substances or those sublimed from other saline bodies as sal salis armon sal urinae etc and even sal viperarum is not much cooler this any one may satisfy himself in who will but venture to taste them naked as they are and must consequently create a thirst and are hardly in any vehicle possible to be reconciled to the taste or stomach but sal succini is really almost as cool as the most natural elemental salt and even extinguishes feverish heats in short it is alexipharmick as it is an excellent counterpoison it is cephalic greatly relieving the head and the whole nervous kind and wonderfully reviving the spirits at the same time it is diuretic and diaphoretick in its provoking and that gently both sweat and urine nay it prevents the other warm alexipharmicks from acting in too inflamatory a manner and yet gives them energy and action and further still it guards and defends the brain from the deliriums stupors or any comatose affections which the opium might cause so that thus taken there is seldom any more than a gentle and refreshing sleep produced so absolutely necessary through all the stages of the smallpox i could here proceed to place it in opposition to all the theriacalia and bezoardica whatever but it would carry me too far once for all i will say that it is the best i ever made use of neither have i in some hundreds found it disagreeable to the stomach or head of any one  the proportion of the laudanum may be observed to be about one grain to jj and thus it may be adapted to the smallest infant for if jj be mixed with a julep of six ounces or that may consist of about twelve spoonfuls one spoonful at a time will contain so little laudanum that not the least of any danger can be apprehended from it and with truth confidence and experience i can attest that as an anodyne it far exceeds diacodium or any the mildest opiats besides it may be prepared without the laudanum but all this must be left to the discretion of the attending physician  whether it may be of use in the time of the plague should the almighty for our sins visit us with that dreadful scourge i must submit to the learned of the faculty however this in the mean time may be said that it is conformable to what we find in books written on that subject by physicians who lived and practiced in such times when this and other nations were afflicted with the plague and is agreeable to the measures now taken in france by the french physicians as they have communicated their way of proceeding to the world in the succinct account of the plague at marseilles etc besides the smallpox is truly accounted amongst pestilential fevers and portus with some others stick not to call it pestis minoris gradus a pestilence of a lower degree and very properly they think since from its manner of being communicated by contagion its too frequently fatal event the visible malignity with which it sometimes in some persons appears together with many particular analogical symptoms it resembles the plague not a little but this only by the by  to proceed a little farther the inventing of good efficacious medicines is the duty and business of every physician and the interest of the public that he should make it so and is well recommended by a late ingenious author in the following words by study and practice says he the materia medica is improved and enlarged by the addition of efficacious medicines as well simple as compound not known before or not applied to such uses for which they have been found to serve better than others in use for by every useful new medicine so added the faculty is so much enlarged and something contributed toward the common benefit of mankind which is a general and i think a sufficient defense for the present attempt in offering after this manner what with some confidence i hope may be serviceable to the public in a dangerous disease and such an one from which this great place is seldom if ever totally free and which proves too generally fatal  to conclude these are the measures i have taken this is the method i have constantly of late years observed and followed upon which i have had very great i may say unusual success and i can see no reason why the same fairly and honestly applied may not be as successful in the hands of another as my own for which reason i make them public  let me throw one word more into the mouths of the critics before they devour me and i have done it may be said that what is contained in the regimen is mean common or trifling to which i answer that if what is there is truly useful as i am sure it is the more common they are the more practicable and intelligible they will certainly be which i reckon as an excellency whatever others may do and if a mans endeavors are but successful he need not much care who acts in the more pompous manner but let us in this hear what our great master the divine hippocrates says on that head  ne pigeat ex plebiis sciscitari si quid ad curationem utile hippocrat in libro de praeceptis  a treatise of the smallpox addressed in a letter to the very learned dr john bateman fellow and elect and late president of the royal college of physicians honored sir i take the liberty at last of publishing these few pages and giving them the ornament of prefixing your name to them if there be any thing that is valuable in them in my own estimation it is contained in these two particulars the kind opinion you are pleased to have of them and the good i hope they may be instrumental of in the disease of which they treat  te cernimus albi nostrorum candide judex curantem quidquid dignum sapiente bonoque est with all submission i proceed to speak of the following disease viz the smallpox that is of the method i have taken in the curing of it in which i shall be very short as to the definitions signs diognosticks or other  such parts having been very copiously treated of by many great authors and in almost every bodies hands the chief stress of what i humbly propose depending upon historical instances and matters of fact not but it will be allowed and it frequently happens that the success of medicines and their various and multiform manner of use and application has given light into the nature and indoles of diseases as the effect of several parts of an animal in food or medicine has been made use of to explain their nature and even exemplify the parts of which they may consist which may be seen in our two famous professors dr glisson and dr willis the first in his anatomia cap vi the other in many places of his anima brutorum as also in sir george ent dr morton and several others so that physiology and practice thus attended to may be observed to illustrate each other and here sir i must again beg your pardon that i shall be forced to place before you cramben recoctam having already troubled you very much with many of the particulars i must here recount but before i can come to them i must speak to a general or two the first of which is as to the general regimen to be used the cold or the hot as they are generally and vulgarly distinguished  for the first dr sydenham and his followers strenously appear against the universal practice of those that preceded him as well as his contemporaries and i may say against nature her self for though we may find interspersed in their reciting the pharmaceutica sometimes what will seem to countenance the cold regimen in which the countries and climates where they practiced might probably be a great inducement yet it is very plain that they chiefly depended on alexipharmicks and the warm method amatus lusitanus who was as bold i think as any one in the use of the refrigeria yet has in a scholium these words quod variolarum and morbillorum ad cutem eruptio quaedam a natura non solum constituta sed destinata crisis sit consequens erit cum hippocrate and galeno asseverare quod quando natura eam conficere tentat tunc medicus materiam fluere dispositam condensare aut a via sua cohilere non debet sed magis ipsam disponere ut per eam viam incedat per quam natura expellere conatur juxta illud hippoc quo natura maxim vergit per loca conferentia eo ducere i must confess this scholium is hardly to be reconciled with his practice either in the precedent or following curatio in this last he tells us that being sent for to a boy blind for three days of the smallpox which he mentions as an extraordinary occurrence he immediately fell to washing and other applications to his eyes and with great pleasure acquaints his reader ex tenebris puer ipse revocatus this would be mad practice in england whatever it was in tuscany but this i mention to show how little as i said before is to be depended on cases historically only related and that in different climates it is not the discordant opinions physicians maintain against each other but there is a necessity for that very reason to take measures somewhat different reverius declares for the alexipharmicks and the warm regimen primo ut aeger in loco calidiusculo detineatur quo pori cutis aperiantur and variolarum eruptio adjuvetur etc i forbear quoting that celebrated practiser at length that i may be as little troublesome as possible and being of no great consequence to the readers i chiefly intend this for the same thing might be repeated out of all the authors of any consideration or antiquity which would be as nauseous as it would be endless the mischief which has arisen is this that in practice while there have been endeavors used toward an inprovement some have advanced from a genial necessary warmth to almost actual fire and instead of keeping the cold destructive air out have perfectly suffocated the poor patients by letting them have none at all making at the same time such vast fires whatever be the temper of the air or of the sick person which cause faintings with other irregularities coincident with it and on the other hand i shall take the liberty to say that the reformers have started so far out of that method in order to distinguish themselves by their new discoveries in disavowing the warm regimen that one would think there is no being cool or refreshing for the patient without freezing let me therefore beg leave to follow the celebrated dr morton whose practice is regular and rational and whose success was answerable he positively declares for the warm and both throughout his precedent rationale as well as in the subsequent histories reprehends the contrary proceeding which he deliberately confutes and descends even to mention the materia made use of in the cold regimen such as spiritus vitrioli decoctum album diacodium and the like nay he says that he was informed dr sydenham himself had toward the latter part of his life gone off from that opinion be that as it will he was in the wrong as dr morton thought and will appear more to be so if we take but very little pains to consider the aetiology of the disease it self or the operations of nature under it for what is it that nature is doing or how can she perform that visible diaploresis if i may so call the eruption but by a warmth somewhat higher than her constant tenor so that she acts her self in the alexipharmick way and that must beyond contradiction be the right could we either substitute any other discharge to carry off by it with safety the repelled morbid humors or if ever a sudorifick or expulsive operation of that kind could be performed without the constitution being somewhat more than commonly warm there would be room to say something but when this can never be which must be confessed by all there will need but very little argument or persuasion to direct us which of the two regimens ought to be chosen and yet notwithstanding the apparency of the case there are still some so blindly devoted to the following that otherwise great man and even notwithstanding their own ill success they go on in a supine fatal bigotry and dependence on his word and think that sydenhams name is sufficient to shelter and justify their own inattention to nature herself insomuch that i have heard it with some pain affirmed that diacodium was the panacea which would do every thing and that nothing could be done well without it that it was in the smallpox like the cortex in intermitting fevers etc and however diversified the disease might be it has been upon the ill success of the first doubled and trebled and given the patient without the least guard diacodium is questionless sometimes a proper as it is a pacifick medicine but suppose we meet with a comatose sleepy disposition in the beginning and it should attend the distemper in the other stages which in phlegmatic pituitose habits is very frequent must we still proceed to give this roapy opiat why yes if we believe the sophistry above and which i have known pursued as long as nature has lasted but enough of this unwelcome subject  the next general i shall trouble you with is bloodletting though indeed i think it ought not to be termed a general it being impossible but that it must be destructive in many cases and i believe very dubious in its success in any there is a question sir i have wanted long to be resolved and is as difficult to state i believe as to resolve i have in debating occasionally whether bleeding were generally good in the smallpox heard it affirmed that it certainly was if timely administered the same affirmation i have under the hands of some men eminent in practice we find it likewise in many celebrated authors already extant among us as to the time it is agreed as soon as possible at least before the eruption is in any measure performed the reasons alleged are that it gives some remission to the excruciating pains and even diminishes the morbid matter so that the enemy being weakened nature must be the better enabled to withstand the remaining force before i come to expostualte on the particulars give me leave to suggest first that it may be frequently observed that the smallpox in some families is very signally and as it were hereditarily fatal this we find both dr sydenham and dr morton have observed and granted suppose then secondly that in one family three children of the same father and mother should be treated in the sydenhamian way the first is blooded has the benign distinct sort of the smallpox and does well the next after the same manner is blooded has the confluent malign sort and dies the third under the same administration of bleeding upon which appear the maculae nigrae lividae purpureae etc and nature under so miserable a prostration of spirits that she quite gives up the contention and yet for any thing that could be seen or apprehended this last might have been the distinct kind which as histories are two to one such events as these ought certainly to put us to a stand and for the truth of the facts i can produce undeniable evidence but wave it here because i would not revive the grief of those who make but too severe remarks upon the proceeding what measures therefore good sir must we take will the taking of blood away alter the indoles of the disease from the malignant or confluent kind to the benign and discreet sort if so it ought in all subjects and on all occasions to be used and this is what they mean by saying it will lessen the quantity or for my part i know not what to make on it but if this be difficult and uncertain nay i will say impossible to make apparent then they put persons on a very great hazard who make use of such dangerous methods by weakening nature and in no respect lessening the disease which charge however severe and heavy must in the general be confessed to be true for here by the way i must take so much liberty strongly to presume that the kind of the disease in respect to its degree is determined upon the first imparting of the contagion though out of doubt the disposition the blood and other juices of the body are in at that time does strongly dispose to one or the other such as was before said the inherent crasis of the blood and spirits in respect to the parents we are descendants of violent exercise hard drinking or other crapulous disorders and the like which not only expose us the sooner to the receiving the infection as is vulgarly and truly expressed but the poisonous miasmata of the disease are immediately imparted to every particle of the fluids being thus made susceptible of them and thus the confluent kind of the smallpox is formed and as i said determined before it is possible to adminster any remedy so that except by bleeding we can undertake to change the very indoles of the disease even after it is formed though not rendered visible which i believe is impossible we shall be in danger of adding to the disease and abstracting from the strength of the patient for twill hardly ever be found that the taking of blood away can restore it from a fusion to its natural crasis that is the sphaerical red parts to their just magnitude and the rest of what denomination soever to their natural size figure and cohesion see dr morton s eleventh hist  by the loss of blood it is well known that the mass is attenuated and for that very reason is phlebotomy administered in many instances as in pleurisies the malacia etc that so there may be more room for the heart in its pulses to dash and toss as it were the blood by which action the lentor or too cohaesive parts may be divided into smaller portions to this i must add that haemorrhages from whatever part they flow are not occasioned at least very rarely from a plethora simply so called or from the strength and force of the pulse for then the most robust animals and those that use the most violent exercise would be most liable to them either man or beast which is hardly ever observable but most frequently from the prava diathesis of the blood it self in the loosening of its texture so that in passing the capillaries it is as it were percolated through em or rendered so keen that it breaks and as it were eats through for a confirmation of which i appeal to dr lowers book de cord and where such symptoms attend the beginning of the smallpox bleeding is seldom i believe i might say never of any service but blisters are of excellent use which is the next general  two questions therefore i think arise from these few last periods  first whether the indoles that is the sort or kind of the smallpox be determined in each individual person upon the very first attack of the infection secondly whether it be possible by any administration especially bleeding to make any alteration or mutation from bad to good from the confluent to the discrete kind you see sir my opinion by what has been already said which i very humbly submit to better judgments  at the end of the precedent paragraph i have said that blisters are good in removing or putting a stop to that mischievous symptom namely the haemorrhages that frequently attend the beginnings of the smallpox these sometimes appear even before any other signs and prevent the struggle nature generally makes to throw off the disease from the center to the peripheria dr morton s seventh hist  sometimes bleeding at the nose spitting of blood or an immoderate flux of the menses appear just at the eruption by which nature in that necessary effort is so debilitated that she cannot perform nor go through that task and then the enemy again retires to the vitals and acts all imaginable mischief i am well aware what botallus and many others say that the loss of blood will not produce the effect here charged but i must desire to be excused from resigning my sense and reason both which i must do should i make any doubt of the retiring of the poisonous particles of this disease when upon the loss of blood i see the humors secreted from the blood disappear and a visible paleness spread in its stead both on the face and all over the body which no one can deny who has made any number of regular observations but to return to blisters these bleedings as i said before being occasioned by the dissolvent pestilential particles in the serum of the blood breaking and dividing the red globules into a preternatural smalness and by that putting the blood into a fusion forces it through the capillary branches of the blood vessels but the blisters drawing off part of this saline deleterious serum by abating its quantity the globules aforesaid are at liberty to attract each other and by that means to form themselves into their genial and natural size and so the symptom ceases for i have had frequent occasion to observe in persons that have been seized with the most violent effusion of blood that as soon as the serum has begun to fill the blisterbladder the bleeding has constantly ceased and thus even the quantity of the peccant matter may be said to be diminished but where persons are averse to blisters as too frequently they are we need not be entirely at a loss nor have recourse to that desperate expedient of phlebotomy for i do assure you the powder does it as certainly and after a manner as i suppose much like the blisters for by very soon procuring a diaphoresis the morbid matter is brought to the exteriors and by sweat the deleterious serum lessened  and here by the way give me leave to say with great submission that i take the blood to be the first nidus of the contagious particles and not the spirits as dr morton asserts for as the matter which fills the blisters and also what fills the pustles of the smallpox are secretions directly from the blood it is but reasonable i think to conclude that the fomes or pena is there for both besides as the spirits are formed from the finer parts of the blood and constantly receive their supply and restoration from that magazine so it is but natural to conclude till the contrary can be demonstrated that what detriment labefaction or pollution soever they receive must be communicated the same way as to the quickness of its communication that can be no objection to any one that considers the pulse of the heart and arteries and the motion of the blood in them so that it requires but a very few minutes after the receiving of the infectious lentor into the blood before it may by stopping in the fine capillaries of the meninges brain and spinal marrow give occasion to all those violent orgasms exercised and communicated through the whole systasis nervosa and which while loosely carried in the rivus of the blood has little opportunity of exerting those excruciating and dolorous sensations and farther still it may be made almost a daily observation that persons having been conversant in places infected have removed to others free of the disease yet after many days the insults of the disease have begun upon the nerves which is a pretty plain instance but this by the by however when we come to consider the distemper once formed as physicians the spirits have their share and suffer violently and except we consider the blood and spirits in this complex view we shall never discover the true curative indications which is what i come now to speak of and shall do it in a very few words  without repeating what has been already said the oppression of the spirits the diathesis the blood is then in and the nature of the disease show i think the necessity of proceeding in the alexipharmick way by promoting a general diapheresis in a gentle manner by such medicines as will invigorate the nerves and spirits by fitting them for as well as putting them upon action and at the same time promote a sudoriferous perspiration over the whole body so that neurotick volatile cephalic medicines mixed with anodines and such as will cause sweat without an inflammation all which is to be obtained by a right proceeding and the alexipharmacon here proposed is and must surely be acknowledged to be the regular way and means of assisting nature in this exigency i have often wondered to find so few of that class of medicines called cephalicks in the materia of dr morton who proceeds on such principles in affirming the first attacks to be made upon the nerves and their propagines for want of which many of the noblest alexipharmicks are rendered not only ineffectual but hurtful by doing nothing else than inflaming the blood and scorching the vitals such as saffron rad serpent etc the like mischief may be charged upon opiates simply given without the guard of volatile medicines to attend them which stop and impede nature in the discharge and instead of procuring that gentle requies and refreshment of sleep so absolutely necessary in the smallpox cause horrible deliriums convulsions etc but that i may give you no farther trouble i proceed now to lay before you the series of the cure a method i have by gods blessing found more than commonly successful  as soon as there is any suspicion of the smallpox let the person attacked go immediately to bed and endeavor if possible to get some sleep toward the attaining of which let there be kept the profoundest silence which is a rule to be observed through the whole course of the disease for it is hardly to be imagined what inexpressible disadvantages sick persons labor under and what symptomatick mischiefs they heap upon themselves by striving as they call it against the disease by going into the air they sometimes repel the morbid humors to the vitals which may be done even before there be any visible appearance of them upon the surface of the body others by exercise diversion hard drinking and the like thinking to divert greatly increase the disease which can be of no advantage in the beginning of any fever but in this does often prove pernicious let the patient be covered with as many clothes as may reasonably be supposed will produce such a warmth as is natural acceptable and pleasant in the winter and no farther if the pains and unquiet tossings be such that no rest can be obtained without help at the end of twelve hours from the first attack and not sooner without apparent necessity let the following draught be taken  aq lactis alexit germ querc a j theriacal vj pulv alex nostri ss vel ij sir de aurantiis ss ms f haust and let it be repeated every eight hours but if there be violent symptoms such as bleeding at the nose or mouth fluxus mensium immodicus vel praematurus excruciating pains watching or the like it may be repeated every six or every four hours the precedent dose is fitted for adult persons but for children of one two or three years old five grains is sufficient and to be repeated according to the age and strength of the patient or the quantity each time given the vehicle abovementioned is what i generally make use of but the powder may be given in a little syrup small sackwhey or any thing else except diacodium if the sick persons are able let them be helped out of bed once every day but in this let their own desires joined with common prudence be the rule for no other can be set  the next thing to be considered is the quantity of liquids to be allowed i am not for such large quantities of malted liquors i mean small beer as is generally in present practice admitted neither am i totally for denying them but a decoction of figs with some cochineel and inspirited with some small portion of right good canary i permit in good plenty almost to the patients choice as ficuum pinginum lbss cochinel ss coqr in aq fontan s q ad lbij sub finem addendo vini canarij iiij plus minusve bulliant semel tum add sir de rubo ideo ss fiat apozema and refrigeratum libat ad libitum this liquor exceeds any that i have known made use of for it keeps the throat and passages of the lungs free and open gently promotes the eruption at the same time that it exhilerates the spirits and abates the thirst and i have not among some hundreds met with any one person but was pleased with it for in small beer there is generally in fevers a most unwelcome clamminess succeeding the drinking of it  when the eurption is perfected so that the first symptoms are abated the draught abovementioned need be repeated but every night at the hour of rest nor even then if there be a natural propensity to sleep and the smallpox be of the mild distinct kind yet i always advise to have it in promptu but in the confluent kind i think it ought to be taken every twentyfour hours at least through the whole course of the disease when the time of maturation or according to the vulgar idiom the filling and ripening of the pustles commences which according to dr morton may be reckoned to begin about three days after the total eruption the foresaid draught is certainly necessary to be taken twice every twentyfour hours and then i do very much recommend the drinking of large quantities of what we call milkporridge made after this manner the oatmeal being finely fifted may be boiled in a due quantity of water for half an hour or very little more then add a third part of new milk and just give it one boil so as to mix it well together and it is enough this i order sometimes to be taken hot as tea or coffee thus taken it will keep the passages of the throat clear and frequently as i have observed will make the scabs of the smallpox which are engaged in the passages scale off and come away at other times to drink a good draught of the same very near cold and sometimes to be taken warm as food this smooth mild pabulum clothes and indeed does as it were digest the ichorous serum of the blood to which diathesis in the confluent kind it is very much disposed and supplies it with a soft chylose matter wherewith to fill the pustles it likewise supplies the salivation where it happens with a proper fluid gently raises it when it abates and keeps up the necessary tumesactions of the extremities it may be also a reasonable means to prevent any tabid or consumptive dispositions which are here frequently founded and i have always observed the patients very soon recover their strength who have plentifully taken of this simple innocent food in the mean time the decoction of the figs is not to be omitted being sometimes taken  thus sir am i come to the last stage the crisis and declination of the disease which is attended with less or more difficulty according as the precedent have been treated and in which i have found little trouble where i have had the opportunity of directing its setting out and even still are the alexipharmicks to be used though at greater distances so that i recommend the same draught every night then every other night and so to be left off i confess at this time too frequently appears the direful symptons in the confluent kind and require the utmost penetration to find out means to assist nature that she may defend her self against this last assault as for bleeding i hope such adventrous undertakings are quite out of thought and really sir i have not been able to collect any great advantage even from blisters as commonly directed that is on any other part of the body except the head for at this time the chief intention is to stimulate nature in her several offices to act the remaining part with some vigor neither have i found there has been any reason to boast of the good consequences though the blisters have had their common effect for there having been so vast an expense of juices already there is apt to follow deliquiums and a great prostration of spirits upon this second additional discharge but blisters on the head from whose office we expect little more than to excite and stir up the remaining force are and have been of excellent use nay sir i have made use i do assure you of actual fire upon the head and visibly under god delivered two persons who were in the very article when all was thrown up and others had withdrawn themselves and nothing but death expected every moment but where the use of this by reason of its seeming severity should be denied the physician instead of it i advise that after as much hair of the head can be taken off as the present urgency will admit of though i always order that to be done at the beginning of the disease then to fill a broad thin linen bag with bruised cantharides and having dipped it into boiling vinegar to lay it almost scalding hot upon the head this i confess i never had occasion to make trial of but once and then twas with evident success the person being now living but especial care must be taken to see the bag keeps warm for if it turn cold it may prove mischievous  having thus far spoken of the small pox in regard to persons that may be patients under it in an indifferent and general manner i now entreat your permission good sir to speak of women with child who are afflicted with that disease singularly and in a place by themselves their condition having been always looked on as full of hazard upon many accounts and for whose sake chiefly you have all this trouble and the present publication if it may be so is made to the world not but that the distemper is the same in every respect that regards it self and must be generally so treated but the sad fatality which so commonly attends these poor people at that time the considering that two lives are included in one individual and therefore that one fate must attend them and both be saved or lost together with other circumstances which too often go along with it that it most frequently happens on a womans first pregnancy so that the expectations of a family on one side are certainly extinct and sometimes it has fallen out that both have been  these and other moving incidents put me upon the utmost stress of considering their cases with the greatest and most heedful attention i was master of and i do here and ever must with all the gratitude of my soul acknowledge and adore the divine goodness on these poor endeavors and which i hope are agreeable to the proceedure of nature and the ars medica by what follows  here i must again inculcate as i must on all occasions that the strict enquiry into the animal economy is and has been the just regular and only means for discovering useful remedies at least the proper way of rendering any of the particulars of the materia medica rationally and therefore as constantly successful as the strength of the disease or the weakness of humanity will admit of thus dr herman grabe puts it into a kind of exemplary method and in distinct chapters tells us what ways we are to take if ever we intend or desire to make any commendable discoveries in surgery or pharmacy and therefore proposes to our imitation the examples of the most considerable physiologists of the time he lived in or a little before it beginning at our great countryman dr harvey and instances in many particulars what light the knowledge of the circulation of the blood has given to the pathology of diseases and the secrets that may be disclosed from the observations thereon he proceeds afterward to the discoveries made by bartholine wharton steno sylvius and willis and severally hinting what useful inventions have been and still may be made for the good of mankind by following their pattern which he presses very earnestly to all the practisers in that noble art and here i beg you will indulge me so far to affirm to you that if there be any thing valuable in what i now lay before you it is owing to the considering the parts of a gravid female more intimately than ordinary at the time when these parts of the kingdom were  with the smallpox and finding so little encouragement and on the contrary so much forbiddance in the success of the common procedure either in books or observation there seemed to me to be a kind of tacit demand made by the tender sex upon all the practisers in the science to have their case peculiarly considered  to speak first in general and to consider that nature is then intent upon the great work of propagating and perpetuating herself in the species and that this is a task the most arduous in its performance of all natural functions is sufficiently observable from the great turn and as it were revolution made in the constitution not to entertain you with the shocking expressions of the act of generation though really observable enough but the consequences of it upon the first setting out of the primordia of conception the menses are intercepted so that the blood spirits lymph and the whole genus fluidum of the system take a new turn and this not purely for the nutrition of the but just conceived faetus which it does not nor is it possible it should receive the thousandth part but for many other uses and reasons and for this general one amongst the rest because she would not admit of any avocation or interruption in this so great an undertaking and we almost always see that miscarriages not to speak of the loss of the embryo which however ought to be considered and seems to be a duty implied in our oaths are incomparably more full of danger and ruinous even to the health of the mother than natural and timely births and this i suppose no one will put me upon proving when nature and every days experience manifests it to the most superficial observation but when to this is added the violent insults of a little less than pestilential fever when she is forced from this her grand intention called off and diverted to contend with what is so frequently too strong of it self and which god in his merciful administration and providence has so ordered that human nature is rarely if ever more than once in each individual subjected to it when to these general disadvantages so considerable a part of the mother as the foetus when of any magnitude must be accounted is in danger if not timely prevented of being torn from her by which so great an effusion of blood and other fluids such an exhaustion of spirits must immediately follow what intenseness of thought and sedulity must these considerations raise in every one that desires or intends to make himself serviceable in his employ to which he has assigned himself and is as it were elected upon such like observations as these i thought my self excusable if i took a method somewhat peculiar to prevent if possible that which might be otherwise destructive of the mother and offspring and without this being done every days sad experience sufficiently shows that both must generally be lost together to detain you therefore no longer as soon as ever i have been called to a woman with child and there has been reason to believe she would be seized with the smallpox as by the usual symptoms in the person her self or the place where she lives being visited together with her own fears and apprehensions being strongly employed or affected in such a case without staying for the appearing of any other sign to make the diagnostick certain i always give something to prevent miscarriage and in this i dare presume you sir will agree with me that i am regularly discharging my duty because such administration can have no maletendency besides the lucta is so great the convulsion frequently so violent at the same time that the poisonous miasmata are making their insults upon the internals before the eruption that the placenta is in great danger of being very much loosened if not immediately torn and divided from the mother upon which all the symptoms before recited and many more must be exasperated and under this oppression while nature is held in this unhappy dilemma of attending one or the other either to expel the disease or preserve the embryo and is not able to perform both during the hesitation both mother and child are in the most eminent danger of being lost immediately therefore i order the following bolus and draught  pulv rad tormentil ss bistort gr x cort cinnamon gr vij cons cynosbat ij sir de rosis siccis q s f bolus quem capiat aegra quamprimum and superbibat haustum sequentem  aq cinnamon hordeat iss theriacal vj pulv e chel cancror simp j sachar alb q s f haust  after this has been taken about two hours i then order the alexipharmick draught beforementioned in which you see i regard both the pregnancy of the mother as well as endeavor to get the enemy at the same time removed to that convenient distance from the vitals that we may with some tolerable safety parley with him the bolus and draught against abortion i certainly repeat at the end of four hours after taking the first but then omit it for twelve hours except some peculiar reasons from the patient oblige me to repeat it sooner the signs of an approaching miscarriage and that of the natural birth being so very like and women being so abundantly sensible of the particularities in that case i need not take up any room here in reciting them upon which occasions and informations i repeat the bolus and draught every three four or five hours as need shall require the persen herself being kept in bed in the most quiet disposition and posture that is possible till these threatening signs abate for at this time i am so intent on tying as it were all things fast in the communication between the mother and foetus that in truth i think nothing safe or like to be so till that great point is secured and that the forementioned bolus or the rad tormentil in what form the physician shall think fit or the prtient can best take it will do at least i never yet knew it fail but still i would have the decoction of figs before spoken of in proper intervals freely used and likewise the alexipharmick draught sometimes as being what will dilute the fervency of the blood and help to break and divide the morbid and peccant matter from it and is a good diaphoretick besides after this i generally repeat the two medicines against abortion once every twenty four hours as there is opportunity so as not to interfere with the medicines necessary to bring forward the general disease but however when that is near the state and grows toward a crisis i never omit giving it twice at least in twenty four hours after that is over i withdraw those restringent medicines to once in that time then to once in two natural days and then to once in three or four days but if the disease be of the mildest kind then neither this nor any other medicine directed to what intention soever need be so frequently repeated but if it be of the confluent or even of the cohaerent kind if we keep not upon the guard we shall be in danger of being surprised for in such kind of fevers that are or are near like pestilential there is such relaxation or may i not call it a dissolution in all the juices and also in the internal membranes that they too frequently fall as it were in sunder and thus sometimes disappoint us in our most confident and sanguine expectation when the crisis is passed and all the symptoms much abated and nature under a sensible alleviation and refreshment we may with reason believe the patient out of danger considered singly in the mother so that the embryo ought now to be our peculiar regard as soon therefore as it is manifest that it may be done without hazard i would have the inferior intestines emptied of the faeces by the common domestic clister of milk and sugar the same may be repeated the next day and then intermitting a day it may be again made use of if the strength of the patient will admit of it but i do positively declare against any purging medicine being taken at the mouth by women with child because it puts the child into the utmost danger of being expelled before its time of which with permission i shall give you two pretty plain instances  a gentlewoman of this town who had the smallpox in the mildest manner imaginable so that there was little or no occasion for any assistance on any respect whatever was though with child treated at the latter end as in common cases with purging medicines by which in her own opinion and also in that of most about her she miscarried again  mrs snow a gentlewoman who was most severely handled as by her case hereafter recited appears upon her recovery from the utmost danger was so prepossessed with the necessity of being purged after such a disease that notwithstanding all i could say would not be prevailed with but purged she would be i ordered her nothing else but  mannae sal cathartic glauberaa ss to be taken in gruel by which she had five moderate stools yet even this caused in the child such tremulous fluttering and disordered motions and in her self such parturient pains that without waiting to know whether the purge had finished its full operation i was necessitated to give the draught and bolus against abortion upon which she was abundantly convinced and desired she might have no more purges neither indeed had she any more nor any one else with whom i was concerned who were with child any thing of that kind but the clister beforementioned till after the time of their delivery they and their children are all alive and in perfect health mrs dove being long since safely delivered and more i think i need not urge i only therefore beg your patience for one word more of comfort to women with child and pardon i entreat you good sir any seeming vanity in it as i have laid their case as well as i can before you i may with some assurance as well as pleasure say that thus considered their condition is even not so dangerous as other women for it is observed by authors and may be so very often in our own practice that the proceeding and advance of the disease and its cure is interrupted by the menstruation of female patients even in their timely and regular manner and is enumerated marton cap   p  0  as one singular disadvantage in their case and is much worse when as it frequently happens it appears before its time for a confirmation of what i now say i refer my self to dr mortons historical observations in the  th   th   th   th   st   d histories of puretology and for the unhappy events subsequent on abortions the   d and   th histories of the same author are sufficient testimonies i shall add but this one general observation more on which it cannot but be imagined i must reflect with some satisfaction that during the continuance of the smallpox in these parts there was not one person with child for whom i was consulted whom i treated not in the method above described and not one of them but is now alive and so are their children except mrs withnoes which lived above a fortnight and then i believe died on the first insults of the smallpox there being a necessity by reason of the weak condition of the mother and other disorders of the family to keep it constantly in a room where three others lay miserably afflicted of the confluent sort of smallpox and i cannot learn from the strictest enquiry i have made that any escaped that were not thus dealt withal but both miscarried and died except the gentlewoman before hinted at who only miscarried upon her being purged after the disease  after what has been said i shall take leave to lay before you some historical cases which i hope sir will not only seem excusable but necessary and even incumbent on me that so any person may be satisfied that shall think fit to enquire into the truth of the relations from the persons themselves  the first case a servantmaid of mrs blythe at the red lion in stamford was seized on the   th of april      with vomiting a racking pain in her head back and loins which after about four hours remitted and she was able though very weakly to attend the business of the house on the   th her pains returned when i was sent for and enquiring whether she had had the smallpox before and being answered in the negative i told them there was great reason to believe she now would presently after the menses broke somewhat before the natural time in a pretty large manner at which the patient was greatly terrified at night they removed her with great care to another part of the town and showing a great disinclination to the taking of any medicine from a covetous fear as i perceived of the charge i left her without any on the   th very early in the morning mrs blythe came to me told me that her maid was dying and that the menses flowed from her like the floodings of a woman after delivery i found her indeed in a very weak condition her pulse quick and low her self very short breathing and in frequent deliquiums i ordered her to take the alexipharmick draught immediately and to be repeated every four hours for three times for she had got no sleep and at the same time a large blister to be laid to her neck at night i found her much refreshed and the smallpox beginning to appear in large spots on several parts as the confluent kind generally does the fluxus catmeniorum was somewhat restrained i ordered the same draught to be repeated at the hour of rest and the blister which had been neglected to be applied on the   th in the morning i found the eruption general the patient had taken pretty good rest and the delirium which had before at intermitting times tormented her gone off the menstrua still continued and this day more than that before but the blister through the stupid conceitedness of a poor ignorant nurse was not yet applied and finding there was no dependence on her i laid it on with my own hands and repeated the same draught as before at night i found all things much amended the menses stopped the eruption come much forward the blister having taken a full effect and the patient after a good sleep much refreshed i continued the use of the draught every night only till near the crisis and then repeated it night and morning for three or four days all this time she took plentifully of the decoction of figs and toward the time of ripening very freely of milkporridge and thus by gods blessing under many disadvantages she perfectly recovered  the second case in august      the wife of william weight of uffington near stamford was seized with the smallpox on the fifth day of the disease and second of the eruption i was sent for by which time it sufficiently appeared to be the confluent kind she had for twelve hours been tormented with a violent looseness and griping before i came to her and was now at every stool fainting and swooning upon her breast arms and many other parts appeared black and livid spots which i showed her sister who expressed a most tender care and concern for her at the same time telling her how little hopes there was of the patient this was the   st of the month and about noon i ordered her the draught with ij of the alexipharmick powder to be presently taken and stayed by her to see the event in about an hour an half the lax seemed to be stopped and she fell into a sleep for almost an hour she had no delirium but at the first attack of the disease and she now awaked much refreshed and was her self sensible of it so that she told me she could not but conceive some hopes of her recovery i encouraged her in that good disposition in order to keep up her spirits and desired she would observe the rules that should be set her which she promised to the best of her power and knowledge i then enjoined her sister to let no one person come near her on any account whatever that so she might take all the occasions of reposing that could offer she took near a quart of the decoctum ficuum every    hours i visited her twice every day and every night and morning she took the draught till toward the state of the disease i ordered her sister to withdraw the draught in the morning this was the   th day of the month and the ninth or tenth of the disease
