present your grace with the following trifle as a nuptual offering sensible that you have always shown a tender regard wherever you have perceived the least ray of genius and i shall be extremely happy if your grace should find the least appearance of it in what i have sent you as it is from so obscure a bard you will be pleased to accept of it as one of the meanest flowers among the many that form the wreath upon your graces brow placed there by virtue and humility if i should be so happy as to have it prove acceptable it will confer the highest honor on  your graces most humble and obedient servant george saville carey  an evenings walk one summers eve when every swain was housed when sol had scarce one glimmer left behind each little star faint glittering cast a ray and spangled over the dusky robe of night fond of the scene i wandered far from home over leafless lawns and flowerbreeding vales till weary nature slackened in my steps and made me halt upon a friendly bank calm through a bridge there ran a peerless stream that scarcely moved the oziers slender wand here i took my stand and viewed the solemn scene the bat had been an hour on the wing chasing the nightfly and the buzzing gnat the purblind owl had left the ancient tower prowling with flossy wing along the mead anon as out of chaos shot a ray of chearing light quivering over the hills as yet too weak to struggle with the dark or as the egyptian queen far off beheld shot her first beams on the italian shore her brilliant train reflecting on the waves making the tybur like a golden sea clouds that oerhung the horizon unseen appeared in view like silverskirted troops waiting the uprise of the queen of night slow she approached and smiled upon the world opening fresh landscapes to my wondering eyes philomel now cheered the embowring grove the woodlark too mistaking it for day joined her sweet notes with emulating strains near to my left there stood an ancient pile by wasting time and savage war defaced like a reduced and hoaryheaded chief commanding awe even in destruction on its slinty sides deepdyd ivy clung its roof was capt with velvetgrounded moss and round its base wild weeds and flowers grew the stinging nettle with the briars blend the secret haunt of adders and of toads through the wide breaches of the rockbuilt walls pale cynthia beamed her lucid columns down upon the verdant slope in lines direct and clear reflecting on a dimpled brook below a solemn silence now overspread the globe save when the minnew wantoned on the stream and left a circle spreading to the brink anon as wind from out some hollow cave a deepfelt sigh from out the ruins came as from a heart just bursting with its load which straight was answered with a voice of woe like sorrow soothing the more sad despair a while i stood in doubt to know the cause or to retreat lest some deluding fiend aping the voice of grief meant to destroy at length resolved with caution i approached o melting sight my wounded heart ran over and emptied at my eyes  a mournful pair the woeful part ners of affliction sat on the low basis of a mouldering urn and opened to my view a tragic scene concealed i stood observing their distress she in her lap an infant cherub held a lovely boy the offspring of their loves her eyes were bent with sorrow on the babe while in her face the little dear one smiled and then with tears of misery and love she clung him eager to her throbbing breast the wretched husband on her neck reclined striving to cheer his melancholy dame feigned a hope though foreign to his heart but when he found despair had seized her soul his tears burst forth and bath d his manly cheeks and on his bended knees he trembling fell lifting his eyes with anguish against the sky with invocations loud and agonizing sighs imploring heaven for a ray of peace till his loud accents shook the vaulted roof and reft his tortured breast  i could no more but flying to his aid with heart distressed he fixed his eyes with furious glare upon me and threatened me with death if i advanced like the fierce tiger assailed by hunters in his dreary den he stood defensive over his young shielding em from danger with humble voice and friendly tears i moved him to attend and listen patient to the voice of pity joy then with fear and admiration mixed overspread each face and as i spoke they blessed hope like the sun that clouds had long oerveild flushed on their cheeks extinguishing despair ye woeful pair let your suspicions cease if the base world has put ye out of door if friends forsake and creditors pursue if you once more can trust a thought to hope and think it possible to meet a friend tell me your story and you yet shall find that fate relents and ceases to afflict though here to you a stranger i appear to mercy i am none to see another wretched makes me wretched too by serving others i still myself oblige and meet reward ample reward a tranquil happiness seeing others so by me made happy i would rather wipe the tear of grief away than add a ruby to a monarchs crown and win a princes promise for my pains if fates not given you over to despair and you will accept of friendship once again cheer your sad hearts  let every fear subside nor doubt a stranger yet may prove a friend if you would be happy tell me but in what i will try my every means to make ye so thou gracious being if thou art human for thou speak with a celestial tongue let me embrace thee  o pardon me too that i assailed thee with the threat of death when thou but meant to save me from his shaft for o thy words were welcome to my soul as mollient dews that fall upon the mead when parching sol has curled each verdant blade thou have preserved to me the dearest rose that ever scented gale the sweetest bud that ever eye beheld or tempted death to kill this drooping fair one and her smiling boy for they have suffered more than i dare tell and to repeat is more than i can bear she once alas was fortunes favorite and minervas pride the tender fondling of a wealthy pair  o sad remembrance provoking tears when will ye cease to flow these eyes have long been strangers to a smile excuse me friend if they disgust thee we sing of others woe but cry our own my heart has gushed at a thousand veins to see the sufferings of a matchless wife  there was a time when this forsaken held at such an hour would have given delight when solitude and night would give a scope to thought and yield a pleasing melancholy to the jaded mind oerchargd with pleasure and variety but now how dreary and sorlorn it seems and as we tell our mournful tale with double horror echoes back each word mocking adversity in hollow sounds  telling us over what is death to hear  such tale as mine good friend i often have read such woeful scenes have often been played with sympathizing heart i have heard and seen and dropped a tear for the oppressed and brave but ere i would slept the fiction fled my breast and time would leave no traces on the mind when we become the objects of distress remembrance stamps it with an iron seal upon our hearts and every thought is death but to my story it is my friends desire  i am no stranger to this gloomy pile i often have paid a visit to these walls and often admired the romantic form when the fair morn invited me abroad when fertile nature dasyd every hill and every meadow blushed a purple hue when thrushes sang and linnet charmed the grove my heart then drank in pleasure at my eyes and felt no interrupter by the way no wretched thought to dash it back again  my father was a man of wealth and note and held a mansion in a village by a better never gave being to a son  i having read of mighty things abroad of ancient rome and grand cairos court the wealth of india and egyptian wilds with thirst for novelty and desire i urged my father and at length prevailed that he would let me venture on a tour and prove the truth of history and report  it is six years since i left my native home since when so many wonders i have seen that curiosity at last grew sick returning home i crossed the mighty alps a deadly sickness seized me on the way and made me seek for succor and a friend a greater rarity than all i would met an ample dwelling opened to my view to which i bent my way and shelter asked and was received at once a welcome guest with mild compassion they beheld my state and strove to cheer me with a friendly voice dismounting here i would have entered in but that my feet their wonted use denied my limbs gave way and let me to the ground when this dear fair came running to my aid she raised me up and led me careful in and every day a true attendance paid when i was struggling with the pangs of death and with consoling hope she would drop a tear imploring heaven to preserve my life her supplications did at length prevail no sooner had i conquered one compeer but found my heart was with another taken love to whom i soon submitted and embraced and made my hostess partner of my life but here partaker in affliction too  her father was a briton once of wealth and held a mansion in that happy isle till revolution and domestic broils destroyed his lands and plundered all he had save a few stores in secret he had saved putting himself and family to flight to seek for refuge in a foreign land  the action robbed the good man of his life and in distress the mournful widow left with this fair comforter to buffet life and shield her from a base ensnaring world here eighteen months i lived in social joy and in the desert found the dearest wife the kindest mother ever man could boast her better spirits so outworn by grief that made her frame like frozen lillies fade recline and droop unto the earth again not having heard one tiding from my friends for many a day we for england made and ere we reached the shore the wind blew high and frowning neptune on the surface foamed throwing up watry muntains in our way and in his anger dashed us on a rock some twenty perished in the yawning deep but we escaped to meet a harder fate we saved our lives but saw our cargo sink no sooner had i stepped with pleasure on the shore but met the tidings of my fathers death from one misfortune often comes a crowd for some malignant enemy of mine informed the good man i had long been dead and ere he died he chose another heir and left him all his fortune and estate here each glaring circumstance arose and filled me with surprise i asked his name landore he cried a wealthy neighbor here landore ye mighty gods how just i am that heir thy worthy father chose and for his friendship and his love to me i will give his son his fortune back again i had enough before to make me happy and but resign that superflux to him which fate had chosen me steward to a while to quit my claim upon a just demand the peasant and ant a fable the fields were ripened all around and ceres head with corn was crowned pomona with her fruits arrayed and plenty coy muchenvied maid her horn of bounty careless held and dropped a gift in every field a peasant walking through the grain was heard to murmur and complain his face was wan and meagre grown and hunger stamped him with a frown a laden ant was passing by and with her small insectic eye she looked upon the abject man and with revilings thus began art not ashamed ungrateful clown amongst such crops thy wants to own whilst smiling plenty round thee stands inviting thy unwilling hands thou poor incorrigible knave thy sloth will bring thee to the grave benevolence is thrown away on such as thou art every day how can thou ever think to thrive except with industry thou wilt strive to help thyself when there is given before thine eyes such stores from heaven had i one opportunity like this i would lay such plenty by in such a season i would provide enough for all my days beside but i am obliged each day to roam many a furlong from my home and cry good luck whenever i pick from off the ground a single stick or in some long and rutty lane i find by chance a single grain had i the art and strength like you to reap to thresh to bake and brew i would not murmur or complain at winters snow or summers rain which heaven in each season sends to answer all its wiser ends thou boasting thing the clown replied thou little crawling piece of pride or stop thy foul reproaching breath this moment else shall be thy death for all thy counsels mere pretense to show thy mighty share of sense thy industry and insolence thou would not in this manner prate were thou like me of human state were what i have reaped and what i have sown like what thou gatherst all my own my barns should every one be stored and i as well as thee would hoard  i own the seasons plenty send were men like ants each others friend i would not now come murmuring here were food and raiment not so dear those times you sure must own are bad when there is no victuals to be had when nature sends her stores at large and earth does all her gifts discharge  it is not by god but man denied who feasts in luxury and pride for see yon infant starving dies with all this bounty before his eyes the apology there is no reason to comment the moral is most evident sunday a poem hail holy day by heavenly laws designed a consolation to all human kind to man and brutes a day of peace and rest would man but own his duty and be blessed as when the harp in jesses golden days tuned every sabbath to jehovahs praise by holy prophets and by virgins strung when truth and faith inspired every tongue or when his son with eloquence divine the greatest favorite of the sacred nine made the proud saul whenever he touched his strings bow his stiff neck and own the king of kings observe the present age  how vain how strange how true sang he who told us all things change a puny race of infidels and fools true slaves to vice and fashions gaudy tools strangers to virtue enemies to fame except in foreign dress or foreign name my lord sends forth his hopeful heir to roam to foreign climes to bring new fashions home caught with their manners and their taste he burns and after six years travel he returns a flimsy fop a coxcomb and a fool  a greater dunce than when he left the school quick at intrigue to gamble or to sight a debauchee if not a s  te britain and france with emulation try to outdo each other in absurdity for here at home what vast excess we see in city fops and city quality is there a folly introduced at court but straight on swiftest pinions of report it through the city in a trice is fanned and introduced  for taste at second hand with cards and routs their sunday is employed and every christian virtue is destroyed mode will bewitch all eyes may plainly see and nothing charms like flimsy gaiety in all degrees at every age we find there is naught like fashion captivates the mind do but observe the rich sir trafficks wife old and deformed upon the verge of life with fulsome art she rolls her faded eyes and thinks to make a conquest ere she dies while in their dress there is no distinction seen tween sixtysix and she of gay sixteen but to my theme my muse at random strays and with a tedious prelude she delays my better meaning and perverts my plan i will tack about and to it like a man  we raise subscriptions and new churches build but heaven knows how seldom they are filled should sunday shine a summers day and fair behold what legions round the town repair what flocks to richmond and to windsor drive and buz and sip like drones about a hive at every welcome tavern which they meet affecting bucks and asses prove complete on hackneyd steeds the giddy blockheads fly who kindly drag em home perhaps and die of all the slaves dame natures given us here there is none so noble treated so severe as the kind steed that is ever yet been cursed to have his last load greater than his first when worn with hunger slavery and age finds still a harder journey to engage than when in youth and vigor he would bear my lord a mile or two to take the air but such is fate when useless and grown old to some unfeeling monster he is sold each needy wretch his thirst for taste declares whenever he speaks but more by what he wears often is the fancy of some brainless prig couched in the choice of his enormous wig and often we learn the tenor of the fair by the sly glance or belleaffected air is there a nymph that fortune will not own that beauty might indeed have stamped have shown behold her sailing in the pink of taste trumpd up with powder frippery and paste resolved against fortune beautys force to try the greatest powers now beneath the sky rather than fate her conquest should impede she will not retreat though virtues sure to bleed behold what droves to bagnigge wells repair crowding together for the sake of air and strictly keeping sundays weekly fair sunk in a vale this fair retreat is placed and with two mountains on each side is graced that has for ages there in loads been thrown receiving all the rubbish of the town smooth through its flat a muddy rivlet streams and down its sides a wholesome churchyard teems here close pent up by thousands we repair and praise the water liquor and the air here lovesick couples every sunday run they marry next and find themselves undone soon shifts the scene the passion next is cloyed and all their promised happiness destroyed behold a pair that but two years ago she a coquette and he a city beau now look with sorrow at their former state and curse the burden of their present fate married they walk indifferent and grave whilst worldly cares their every thought enslave he at a distance from the crowd retires she at a distance leaves her gay desires see selfadmird miss of four feet high display her charms and with an ogle try to captivate some dull unwary spark she often shoots but seldom hits the mark for should the rogue some imperfection spy her crooked legs or bolsterd shape awry if the high shoulder which she would fain conceal some thoughtless turn should cruelly reveal no new device how well soever it is dressed will win the lover to her strutting breast if such a wretch would deal in hymens laws let her throw off her frippery and gauze nor vainly try with selfimagind charms to win the lover to her stunted arms to charm with person never make pretense but try to please with gravity and sense plain be your dress seem conscious of defect let love subside and try to win respect should some grave friend of sixty seek a wife a needful helpmate at the verge of life who is with your virtues not your person moved its better far by such to be approved than try with such a form to make a prize or hope in vain to charm a lovers eyes who will but rally flatter and despise devote no more your sunday to intrigue nor longer keep your vanity in league for where the person and the minds awry we seldom find it catch a lovers eye let not white conduit bagnigge or the spaw one sunday more your vain attention draw where swarms of fools of coxcombs bucks and beaux adore themselves and next themselves their clothes where belles repair to catch and to be caught that never yet gave being to a thought you on whom fortune has been pleased to smile lay by your giddy pleasures for a while regard the cries of nature in distress confine awhile your appetite and dress where fortunes given enough and some to spare let the remainder be the poor mans share epigram on lord g  my lord has often said he scorns the wretch whod fain conceal his horns and from his heart quite full of glee he wished all cuckolds in the sea a merry wag pleased with the whim replied my lord pray can you swim an elegy on the death of mr richard cross farewell kind youth my friend farewell since fate will have it so cease cease the solemn passing bell nor aggravate my woe in plaintive notes my muse shall sing thy merits and thy name and on her weak but grateful wing she will bear thee up to fame what though obscure thou spent thy days a friend to virtues cause thy merits still demand my lays to whisper thy applause the lonely bud that blows obscure beneath the spreading thorn often preserves a scent more pure than what the top adorn i little thought my dearest friend to see thee dead so soon for who could think the day would end before it well was noon thy noon of life an evening proved thy sun ran quickly down thy morning was by all beloved thine eve without a frown through life with even pace thou steered without one single foe by friends beloved by truth revered lest envy made them so but who could be a foe to thee a friend to all mankind whose breast was all tranquillity with harmony combined how often have i at peep of dawn thy friendly summons heard and with thee trod the verdant lawn before the sun appeared from richmond hill to twicknham dale how often have we strayed charmed with the thrush and nightingale that sang in dysarts shade when cloudy mists from off the brooks proclaimed a summers day with glee we talked of men and books and argued time away whenever a wild romantic scene has struck our wandering eyes and where the magic circles been great shakespeare would arise where gentle zephyrs blew serene as through the copse we steered or when some garden we have seen great milton has appeared when nature dasyd over the lawn and blossomed every tree the humble thompsons muse would dawn like pure simplicity when over the hill we have chanced to stray and viewed some mansion by often with a smile i have heard thee say its wealthy lord must die thou envied not the proud his wealth his luxury and pride thy only boon a little health but that the fates denied thy honest ear would never attend the vile detractors lie but with a manly zeal defend both friend and enemy often when the lark had closed her wings the moon began her reign i have heard thee touch thy magic strings and play thy usual strain scarce had the thames sent up a breeze or dews fallen on the ground but through the gentle waving trees i heard the pleasing sound enraptured have i stood alone beneath a cooling shade with extacy i have caught each tone in soft pianos played but now the evening charms no more no more the morn delights since morn nor evening can restore thee back again to sight no more shall i at break of day thy friendly summons hear nor with thee over the woodlands stray before the sun appear in sad remembrance over thy tomb thy requiem will i sing when night with dull and awful gloom shall spread her raven wing a poor mans queries addressed to his friend our betters seem to make a rout to find the cause of famine out pretend the mystery is too great to tell us why we have no meat nor can our ablest st  s  ns head find out the cause we have no bread the reasons plain i tell you why i dont believe they ever try but should they want to lay a tax upon our heavyladen backs there is not one but knows the way to do it for us any day like dog in the fair they shift about today in place tomorrow out nor shall you find the best resign without some motive or design to wriggle into better bread  then can you think he will plague his head about such things as you or i who were but born to starve and die query i were they like you and i to feel an appetite without a meal say would they not soon find the way to move this obstacle away ii would forestallers and regrators until now have scapd their betters if some great rogue tween you and i had not given them authority thieves are seldom hanged for stealing where my lords a fellow feeling iii if one knave should chance to swing o that would be a happy thing in such a case it is ten to four but he would impeach a hundred more and then i would lay you nine to ten that half of them were n  n or such to whom we give the name for they by birth assume the claim and have not in reality the smallest claim to quality titles that once were bravely won that have through generations run may grace at last a worthless fool perhaps some haughty favrites tool in some base office exercised and by his countrymen despised the fatal incident it is full six months cried aladin since emina i have seen say was it not a sorry sin to leave my fairy queen say was it not a sorry sin to force me so away and make me plod through thick and thin over hills and far away to make me soldier against my will and go the lud knows where and what is alas more cruel still to force me from my dear it is fourteen days since last i heard or had one single line and she is forsaen me i am afraid but sure the faults not mine we parted at this very style i thought i should have died i took my leave and all the while the lovely creature cried plague on the man be who he will that first the wars began but may he be more plagued still that schemd the militia plan why should they fix on me forsooth that never got drunk and swore there is ralph and hal aye and in truth i could name twenty more there is thomas now as great a rake as ever trod the lea he got with barn at our last wake poor sally mapletree our joe got drunk and beat his wife until she scarce could see and yet for all upon my life they needs must fix on me but i will no longer time delay with thinking what is past i am glad i have got so safe away to see my love at last o how my heart with fancy throbs to think we soon shall meet from her the rose its color robs the hyacinth its sweet i shall be shamd to see her too in this strange soldiers dress but if her heart like mine be true she will not love me the less i will even across the churchyard now and see my emina she lives at foot of yonder brow where yon white lambkins play here stands the church where she and i together often have been and hope once more yet ere i die to go with her again when she some morning by my side o would it were today shall go a maid but turn a bride dressed like the queen of may then luck attend i will even away in this same soldiers trim desire will not let me stay to make myself more prim ah me what names on yonder stone that meets my tortured sight it is eminas it is here is alone  then to the world good night for like the barbedshafted dart it plunges through my breast fast bleeds within my wounded heart but here i will give em rest o cruel fate i cannot bear to look upon her grave strike me to earth nor longer spare a lovedestracted slave alas i feel my blood retire my eyes grow dim apace the fates have heard my last desire well in the grave embrace a pastoral written on the death of
