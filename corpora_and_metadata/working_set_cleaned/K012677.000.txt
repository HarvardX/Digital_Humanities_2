mr addison    poems on several occasions  with a dissertation upon the roman poets  by mr addison  london printed for e curll in fleet street       preface now the translations of mr addisons poems appear together it may not be improper to make a few observations on modern latin poetry and in particular the following compositions  since the general disuse and corruption of the latin tongue there are not many attempts in poetry in that language that retain the purity and graces of the augustanage the italians by the encouragement of the house of medicis first began the study and imitation of the best roman poets and about the time of leo the xth there appeared a great number of fine geniuss who endeavored to shake off the barbarity and polish the rust of an ignorant age the event very near answered their expectations and the muses seemed to be reinstated in their old land of inheritance the reader may see a collection of their best pieces in a volume intituld poetae italici but among all of them vida is the most pure and elegant though some are offended at the perpetual imitation of his darling virgil the french have nothing considerable that i have seen in this way but rapin whose poems every where discover a roman coloring and as he does not follow virgils expression so nearly as vida he is more agreeable to the judicious vida with an easy felicity adapts virgils words to every subject rapin chooses rather to imitate his manner of expression than borrow his very phrases so that we may say of these two as mr dryden does of fletchers and johnsons copying shakespeare one imitates him most and the other best the dutch themselves have some no mean latin poems as is evident from the works of grotius and heinsius buchanan is the just boast of the scots nation he was a perfect master of the latin tongue knew all its strength and beauties and very happily transfused them into his own poems that neglected piece of his de sphaera is upon so nice and difficult a subject as fine and noble a poem as ever was wrote though i dont know by what fate the modern critics are never pleased to mention it to his honor i beg their pardons for calling them critics a name too glorious for these borrowers of others opinions who live upon the plunder of scaliger and rapin without consulting the originals where if they have happened to praise any thing these gentlemen take all upon trust and are strangers to every fault and excellence they have omitted to blame or commend  as to our own nation the occasional copies in the university collections are the best poems we have the chief of which are published in the musae anglicanae though i have read a great many more which deserve an equal honor out of these we have singled the poems of mr addison as the most shining ornaments of that work and given the unlearned reader the pleasure of admiring them in his native language i will not say that it is absolutely necessary to be a good latin poet in order to become a good english one but i am sure that he who imitates the ancients in their own language will slide more easily into their way of thinking adapt their graces by degrees and beautifully transplant them into his mother tongue and these are no vulgar beauties in an english poem i could mention how successfully this was done by milton formerly and in our times by mr addison if it did not draw me into too great a length of preface which more properly belongs to the following pieces  most of these though very perfect in their kinds i am apt to believe were designed as trials of a great genius after the modest manner of the ancients who began to sport and play in essays of their poetical strength before they attempted subjects of a greater dignity to speak of them in general i observe that the language is pure elegant and sounding the versification easy and numerous happily adapted to the different subjects it describes free from the affected turns puerile levities and other flatnesses which betray a false taste and defect of judgment the critic every where accompanies the poet and even here a discerning eye might have seen the promises of a campaign and a cato  the battle of the pygmies and cranes the puppetshow and the bowlinggreen are of the mockheroic kind the subjects mean and trivial seemingly incapable of poetical ornaments but are raised to the heroic by a splendid boldness of expression a pomp of verse by metaphors allusions and similitudes drawn from things of a higher class and such as are suited by nature to convey ideas of greatness and magnificence to the mind virgil in his georgicks is the great master in this way with this difference only that his is a serious geandeur this a mimic one his produces admiration this laughter  the resurrection is a noble piece drawn after the painter with a masterly hand as it has been spoken to by the translator i leave the reader to his observations  the barometer is a fine philosophical poem describing the effects of the air on that wonderful instrument with great exactness as well as in the most beautiful poetry the odes to dr burnett and dr hannes are written in the true spirit of horace and are only equaled among the moderns by those excellent ones of the latter  the peace of reswick is here placed last but first in the original in which the author seems to have exerted all his powers to make it shine above his other compositions it is indeed a masterpiece the images are chosen with a nice judgment worked up with a delicacy of imagination and placed in the strongest light every thing strikes at the first view and yet will bear the strictest eye to reexamine it the descriptions being both just and surprising put the mind upon the full stretch as they are preparing and exceed the boldest expectations when finished upon this occasion i cannot help remarking that the art of war being so much changed since the roman times it must be a difficult task to find words in that language to express even the common ideas of a modern battle but to do it in all its terrible scenes of new inventions was reserved for the pen of mr addison  the translators i hope need not make any excuse to the reader though they will want an apology to the author whose excellencies their copies but faintly imitate all that i can say in our defense is that some of them have fell into much worse hands before who have mangled his sense and debased his poetry by a cold unspirited translation thus if he does some kindness in a moral way who takes off part of an injury though he cannot redress the whole we may hope at least to be forgiven who have corrected many abuses cast on mr addison by former authors though we could not in all things do him the justice he deserves   inv e

disgrace to think and reason singly wise each tale reject by time allowed and nobly leave the erring crowd iv hark from her weak foundations tore the bursting earth asunder flies and propd by yielding

waves admire and gliding through the enlightned main gaze at each stars diminished fire well pleased the moons bright orb survey trembling along their azure way vii how strong each line each thought how great with what an energy you rise how shines each fancy with what heat does every glowing page surprise while spouting oceans upward flow or sink again to caves below viii as natures doom you thus impart the moving scene we scarce endure but shrinking ask our anxious heart if on our earth we tread secure whose fate unmoved as you pursue we start and tremble but to view ix yet these remains we now behold which towering once in hills arose shall from a new and fairer mould a new and fairer earth compose which to her fate shall owe her bloom and rise more lovely from her tomb x yet see this beauteous fabric end this second pride of fate expire while gushing from the clouds descend the burning storm the liquid fire where worlds and men consuming lie and in one bright confusion die xi their naked tops the hills admire no longer white with fleecy dew and as they moan the spreading fire add to the flames dissolving too while rocks from melting mountains flow and roll in streams through vales below xii and now the kindling orbs on high all natures mournful end proclaim when thy great work alas must die and feed the rich victorious flame give vigor to the wasting fire and with the world too soon expire xiii once more her bloom the earth renews smoothed into green eternal vales her glebe still moist with fragrant dews her air still rich with balmy gales no change her flowery

tender as when orpheus sings with softer sounds the harp inspire sad fleeting ghosts with art constrain back to a kinder life again ii whether in graceful lays you shine and verse your easy hours employ or give the soul her mouldring shrine decayed a fairer to enjoy the body cold in death explore thy skill could only not restore iii awhile thy learned toil decline nor anxious more in smiles

give vi in vain the bloods tumultuous tide and circling stream your hand restrains taught over the pulses to preside and well explore the bubbling veins that with the fevers swelling heat glow more inflamed more fiercely beat vii in vain you try each chymic power trace to its spring the sanguine wave and kindly search each healing flower for helps to guard us from the grave in endless bloom to bid us live which thou nor they alas can give viii one certain fate by heaven decreed in spite of thee we all must try when from her bursting prison freed the mounting soul shall claim the sky our sons must once lament our doom and shed their sorrows round our tomb ix thou too shall with pale horror see the fabled ghosts which glare below which to the shades restrained by thee in thinner shoals descending flow and death whose power you now defy shall boast her conqueror can die x his life alone is greatly blessed whom no intruding griefs annoy who smiles each happy day possessed of cheerful ease and harmless joy nor sadly soothing his own cares augments himself the weight he bears xi pleased with a few selected friends he views each smiling evening close while each succeeding morn

the pigmystate record oh muse their battles and their fate sing their great wars and as their troops engage guide the low heroes and direct their rage here swords all flaming for the fight display there beaks as vengeful and as keen as they dreadfully mingling in one lofty strain the pygmies courage and the foes disdain while birds and men in dire dread conflicts try the earths command and empire of the sky already fair in verse each warriors name the muse has greatly sung and paid with fame his hardy toil with transport each admires the poet rising as the chief inspires to distant time the muse has handed down the grecian valor and her youths renown how sternly brave in fight great theseus glows how swift achilles drives upon his foes aeneas fame with wonder we peruse and williams wreaths are green in every muse while theban chiefs and pompeys mournful name weary each eye and tire us with their fame my bolder muse unsung in ancient lays new battles ranges and new camps surveys in verse the trumpets silver sound describes and fatal to the cranes the pygmy tribes dark through the air while hovering nations flow and from the clouds descends the feathered foe where happy india boasts a warmer ray and smiling blushes at the birth of day embraced by rocks a flowery vale is seen by few frequented and for ever green here high in fame till heaven that fame withstand the spreading pygmy nations wide command by various arts a frugal life sustain while laboring millions throng each crowded plain but now their desert realms as we descry untilled their vales their bowers unpeopled lie while bones of mighty dwarfs and warriors slain strike every eye and whiten all the plain these realms are now by victorcranes possessed there safe they triumph in each airy nest not thus they moand their countrys fate of old when subject states their monarchs arm controlled the soldier then when ever the foe drew near grasped hard his sword and dreadful shook his spear till gasping now and breathless on the ground deep in his breast he drives the deadly wound his shoulders scarce the ponderous spoil convey alive his terror and when dead his prey often in the grove her curious mansions hung his rage oerthrows and slays the crying young the motherbird from far beholds with pain her kingdoms rifled and her infants slain whose little lives their parents guilt atone for crimes alas expiring not their own his breast no pity to their cries will give doomed by his sword to dye before they live ever yet a form the imperfect young enjoys and in the egg the future foe destroys from this dire spring immortal discords rose which wrought the sons of fame unnumberd foes while warring troops disturb the earth and sky and birds and men confused together dye less tumults from less noble causes sprung the grecian bard of old sublimely sung while thundering arms and meeting hosts around mix in one noise and all the lake homers batrachemuomachia confound here scattered over the bloody plains are laid expiring mice by bulrushspears destroyed there limping frogs distained with generous gore in deep hoarse plaints their absent limbs deplore unactive now forget their springing bound and hardly trail their sluggish weight along the ground now the great morn her light began disclose that morn which fatal to the pygmies rose when they shall rue the rashness of their guilt and wish the young unslain the egg unspilt for this the vengeful sires in war engage burn with revenge and call forth all their rage sad with regret they summon from afar wide distant nations to the airy war what troops remote strymonian waters breed and over caisters flowery meadows feed what hardy bands the scythian lakes supply or poured from isters banks obscure the sky confedrate join  with slaughter all around their bosomsswell and absent seem to wound each whet their talons and their beaks prepare to gore the battle and confuse the war for speedy flight the sounding pinions dressed such thirst of vengeance heaves each warriors breast now spring arrived the gathering troops on high cut the mid air and sail along the sky beneath their wings as they sublimely soar wide empires stretch and wider oceans roar through the bleak north as they their legions guide the day grows darker and the clouds divide fand with the blast and trembling as they fly a loud deep murmur runs along the sky nor less on earth the pygmy fury glows whose chiefs for fight the martial troops dispose direct the war  and as the foe draws near each gripes his sword and eager shakes his spear while closely wedged and dreadful to the foe their double battle hides the plain below and now the monarch of the pygmy throng advancing stalks with ample strides along slowly he moves majestically tall towers over his subjects and oerlooks em all a giantpygmy whose high spirits swell elated with the size of half an ell stern was his visage  for his face all over of savage clans the dire impressions bore and seamd with ghastly wounds his manly breast still owned the foe and still the nails confessed hence wrath immortal wrath his bosom fired to quell the nations and his fall conspired who joined in arms his fury to restrain whet keen their claws and plunge their beaks in vain often as his sword its edge in battle shows to lop a pinion and retard his foes what heaps of dead what mountains of the slain what slaughter reddens all the slippery plain while sighing over strymonian lakes alone sad widows languish and sad orphans moan now broken murmurs sounding from afar presage the approaches of the flying war black with the foe the clouds they now descry cleaving the air and marching through the sky winged troops disclosing as they wide unfold and what they heard aloft they now behold in solemn state above and strict array a dreadful scene the hovering troops display their spreading war extends along the skies and the fanned air before their pinions flies all heaven is crowded and the darkning foe hung in the clouds obscures the camp below with gloomy horror shades the nether plain and millions never to view their native groves again the pygmy troops beneath in firm array with eager looks the hanging foe survey up to the clouds their vengeful eyes they turn demand the fight and for the combat burn when lo the cranes descending from on high rush through the air and dart along the sky amidst his ranks they drive their plunging bands and give that battle which the foe demands both hosts engage  dire deafning murmurs rise and clouds of feathers floating fill the skies the fainting birds their vigor to repair now leave the field and skim aloft in air their strength renewed they shoot along the plain mix in the fight and urge the war again each side an equal part of glory shares and conquest yet for neither host declares here a brave warrior wounded as he flies in circling eddies whirls around the skies still as the foe his fruitless vengeance tires collects his talons and in rage expires there gently streaming from the heroes veins a pygmys gore the purple field distains deep murmurs from his heaving heart resound panting he falls and beats the bleeding ground while shades of death overspread his swimming eyes curses the foes avenging claws and dies and now the ghostly fields of death all over confused with noise and warm with smoking gore from every eye a soft compassion draw here shines a sword there sprawls a trembling claw while copious slaughter gluts the slippery plain with wings of birds and limbs of mortals slain the pygmychief his faulchion waving high wide wasting drops  while millions round him die amidst ten thousand deaths secure he springs mocks their sharp beaks and persecuting wings to stop his wasting sword the avenging foe in circling troops around the warrior flow dark over his helmet thronging legions spread and all the battle rages round his head when lo a crane swift shooting from above such was the will and dire decree of jove caught in his wounding talons as he flies fast gripes the foe and bears him through the skies a cloud of birds the captive king surround clap their glad wings and waft him from the ground while bore aloft and lessening as he soars each pygmy views his lord and each deplores but sigh in vain their monarchs arm oerpowerd their monarch vanquished first and then devoured but see the war once more revives on high sounds through the air and ranges over the sky the pygmys sword around with vengeance drove the cranes disdain and gore him from above then skim aloft the sprawling chief with pain shrinks from the wound and waves his arm in vain such was the war when mountains tossed on high shook joves high throne and labored up the sky while heaven and earth a doubtful fight prepare and rocks and thunders mingle in the air till the winged bolt all flaming from above launched from the dreadful red right hand of jove confounds the war his falling rivals slain gasp over the fields  and smoking hide the plain and now their vigor spent their martial fire glowing in vain the pygmytroops retire pale with despair they leave the fatal field for pity raise their shrill low voice and yield but fierce behind the cranes pursue their way dart from above and tear the flying prey through fields of death the mangled warriors chase and in one battle end the faithless race the pygmynation thus so long renowned overspread with laurels and with trophies crowned resigns her fame  for heaven and partial fate to earths great empires fix one certain date assign the period to each nations fame thus rose and thus expired the assyrian name thus sunk alike their glory and their doom thy pride o persia and thy grandeur rome now mixed with shades of mighty heroes slain the empty troops overspread the elysian plain and if the important story be allowed confirmed by fame each night the fairycrowd unbodyd forms by wondering shepherds seen skim through the gloom

the following lines are esteemed by the best judges to be the finest sketch of the resurrection that any age or language has produced nor do their only excellence consist in being an accurate poem but also in being an exact copy of the painters original upon the altar in magdalen college but so much improved with all the strongest figures and most lively embellishments of a poetical description that the reader receives a double satisfaction in seeing the two sisterarts so useful to each other in borrowing mutual helps and mutual advantages  it is indeed wonderful to find in the narrow compass of so few pages all the most dreadful circumstances of that last terrible crisis of time the poem is a beautiful and succinct epitome of all that has or can ever be said on that important subject the very text which the ingenious mr young has so largely and elegantly paraphrased upon in his excellent poem on the last day  mr addison is to be distinguished through all his performances both latin and english and in his latin particularly in the following one and that on the peace of reswick by the strength of his images and by a forcible and unaffected vivacity of expression which none of our moderns have attained to in so much perfection and which is very rarely to be met with even in any of the ancients since virgil and horace  having mentioned mr addison i cannot avoid congratulating my country on his preferment to one of her greatest civil employments nor forbear observing how happy we are in a king who has shown the world that he will distribute his favors amongst those only whom merit and virtue shall recommend to his service  with what uncommon luster must that man appear to posterity who is not only the best writer and most candid patron of the age he lives in but also the finest gentleman the sincerest friend the most affectionate husband the most accomplished statesman and the most exemplary christian under every one of these views mr addison gains the esteem and admiration even of the bitterest enemies to that cause which he so warmly espouses of the most furious partisans and the most prejudiced of mankind  i must forbear to enlarge any farther on the character of that truly great and good man lest i draw upon my self the imputation of a flatterer by relating what all the world except himself only will allow to be the severest truth  i shall make no excuse for offering the following poem to the world in an english dress and under all the disadvantages of an imperfect translation i have often read it in the original with the greatest pleasure and satisfaction and i hope it will need no apology to be willing to communicate so useful and sublime an entertainment in the best manner i can to those of my fellow subjects who are not

privycouncellor to the king since your ears are continually pestered by a wretched set of poets you have no reason to complain of any new misfortunes happening to you when you shall find the following noble subject debased by my numbers the honor they have lately acquired by their conquests plainly shows how much the english excel all others in the art of war but how unequally low we are in the politer studies of peace is evident from the verses we have lately published the oxford verses on the peace if your darling congreve had not exerted his divine poetical fury with his usual happiness in the adorning of this subject the peace it self had been hardly worth our joy since it has been so miserably celebrated by so many vile poetasters but while i am blaming others i may seem forgetful of my self who perhaps may give you as much trouble in my latin compositions as they have before done in their english unless the variety of the torment may bring some mitigation to the pain you are to suffer for my part i never could prevail upon my self to offer you a poem written in our native tongue since you your self deter all others by your own compositions from such an attempt as much as you excite them by your favor and humanity i am  sir your most devoted humble servant joseph addison  the peace of reswick when now the tumult of the battle dies no shouts the earth no trumpets wake the skies accept great leader what the pious throng less dreadful music and a softer song to sooth the vengeance of thy soul inspire and ease thy bosom of its restless fire let wars no more all nature hushed to rest nor scenes of ruin roll within thy breast no schemes of death delightful to thy eyes swell in thy thoughts and charm thee as they rise already famed the chase of fame give over nor dark with laurels shade thy brows with more no more dire camps a glittering horror yield nor swarming millions hide the crowded field no shouts or tumults shake the sounding plain but downy peace and solemn silence reign with furrows now the peasant all around cuts the wide camp and turns the warlike mound now rampires dreadful to the foe descries rising aloft and threatening as they rise over fields of death the waste of war persues sighs the sad scene and trembles as he views while richer blades along the bulwarks wave and greens arise to strew the warriors grave luxuriant ears the fertile glebe supplies the harvest bending where the hero dies see distant worlds invited from afar to trace the ruins of the finished war wide gaping walls and shattered towers admire oerturnd in tempests of tumultuous fire long tracks of death astonished they explore now view the warriors toil and now deplore while streams of blood each current still distain and ormonds wounds ennoble all the plain where you steep rampires rise with slaughter red still moist with gore and crimsoned with the dead the the lord cutts baron of gowran etc chief his standard fixed whose temples round defended buda with her laurels bound through thickest troops he breaks his glorious way and floods of fire in vain command his stay the bursting shells aloft and sweeping ball around the hero unregarded fall while through dark flames he rushes to the fight and vapors streaked with lengths of ruddy light see threatening once and dreadful to behold a ghastly breach the yawning towers unfold amazing still the broken ruins show enormous hang and shade the plain below now treacherous caves beneath the earth are found where beds of sulphur swell the cavernd ground here mingling hosts in vain their courage try guiltless of death yet doomed alas to die for lo the opening mound asunder flies and hurls at once whole armies to the skies while limbs of mangled heroes upward drove shoot from the bursting earth and reek above the burning troops abandoned to despair in flames ascend and smoke along the air so when the lifted arm of angry jove drives the red bolt all flaming from above persues the foe with thunder down the skies natures sad ruins all her sons surprise amazed they view her rugged form and moan great pelion lost and ossas height overthrown here streams over craggy rocks mistake their way new banks design and through new channels stray the wild confusion all around admire their former hills and vanished shades require here led by williams fortune and his fame united worlds to guard the monarch came fair belgias sons the hardy britons join and nations nursed beyond the sounding rhine while faithful austria from her shining towers sends out by millions her victorious powers with these the eager northern bands conspire and wanting phoebus light yet boast his fire while swarthy troops to the great cause inclined forsake the day and leave their sun behind from climes remote and distant skies around close gathering bands the pious king surround by nature parted worlds together join unite the frozen pole and burning line their language different yet their swords agree all drawn alike for freedom and for thee and thou great colonel codrington colonel of the kings guards chief in war a dreaded name foremost in dangers as the first in fame if isis to thy worth a life can give thine shall elude the grave and ever live while arts and arms to form thy youth combine and both minervas in each action shine with fond reluctance she resigns her prize and gives thee up to fame with weeping eyes our fainty suns too languid to inspire thy soul with vengeance and thy breast with fire thy sultry india where the god of day shoots on the earth direct his burning ray ripens thy godlike vigor and bestows a heat intense as that with which he glows from his kind beams thy kindling ardour came who lent the spark then nursed it to a flame now nations whom no summer suns beguile rough with the shaggy bears enormous spoil attentive hear the story of thy fame forget their clime and glow at williams name beneath their breast as thy great battles roll each feels new heat and burns beneath his pole thy godlike deeds each freezing arm inspire and warmed by thee they ask no other fire see the great chief the czar of muscovy whose empires stretched around nature alone can shut and oceans bound forsake his snowy realms his chilling skies and marks the hero with astonished eyes his eyes the awful warrior round explore and in his looks he reads his battles over the vast idea carrying to his view the forts he stormed and millions that he slew here great namur and there the bleeding boyne with slaughter swelled present their numerous slain while to seneff his thoughts in raptures run where both deserved the palm which neither won how great his mien what port his steps maintain rising he moves and awful heads the plain stern majesty sits lowering on his face with comely terror mixed and frowning grace so with evander when his royal guest a lions curling mane his shoulders dressed his hand in leagues of holy friendship joins thus fierce he looks and thus majestic shines as williams deeds the hero entertain quick beats his heart and swells each bursting vein the blood more sprightly runs its circling rounds and flaming through the purple channels bounds the britons triumphs rising to his view he glows he fights and seems to triumph too in thought elate he now the foe distains and drives the tartar over the russian plains but hear what joyful shouts at distance rise break through the air and doubling fill the skies with williams name the hollow shores rebound and echoing vales repeat the darling sound no more fair albion on the beach reclined with tears augments the seas with sighs the wind nor chides the envious gale and angry main that from her eyes so long their bliss detain the lingering bark no more creates her woe which flying over the waves  yet still is slow see the vast fleet the parting seas divide whitening the surge and cuts the foamy tide arrived at last she drops the dashing oar while peace and william land on albions shore no battles now within his bosom roll awake his rage and fire the warriors soul his thoughts no longer painting to his eye what foe shall bleed the next what rival die soft passions now and every milder grace smile in his looks and smooth the heros face no more dread vengeance reddens at his eyes while in the melting king the warrior dies see how their lord the british youth surrounds and prize their safety scarce above their wounds with comely scars each warriors bosom red asserts how well he fought how often he bled to his loved home as now the soldier flies joy swells his heart and wets his bubling eyes the trembling wife explores her lovers face still coy and doubtful of her lords embrace hangs on his neck confused with mixed surprise and satisfies her love before her eyes the infant starting as the sire draws near deep in the mothers bosom hides his fear he to the astonished crowd recounting over the deaths he gave and hardy toils he bore his own exploits his own full praises crown and pompous words set off his past renown so when the ship with argive heroes fraught back to her greece the shining treasure brought with wonder all the burnished prize behold rigid and stiff with curls of flaming gold still pale with fear the soldier numbers over dire dreadful forms that guard the wakeful shore here streams of fire from hissing serpents rise light the dusk air and flash along the skies there glowing bulls no labors ever could tame groan at the wain and snort a living flame for thy return what grateful trophies rise what honest joy overflows each britons eyes to meet thy fame from all her joyful towers thy isle her populace and nobles pours all to their great returning monarch kind joy smiles before and transport shouts behind while mingling murmurs and applauses round delight thy ear and please while they confound to aid the spreading pomp thy heavens supply uncommon luster and a fairer sky keep back the progress of the rolling year while summer suns the flowery winter cheer now the loved his royal highness william duke of gloucester youth in all his beautys pride and smiling bloom adorns the heros side each parent striving with alternate care divide their love to form him great and fair while in his looks the sire commanding lives the goddess smooths the charms the hero gives each manly feature and severer grace by beauty softened dies upon his face with different glories each the boy inspire one gives the sweetness and one lends the fire in wars already thoughtful to engage he acts thy battles over with mimic rage here pressing eager on the flying foe his boiling veins with artful vengeance glow till from his arm as swiftly he retires stopped by his sword a fancied gaul expires there his young breast and courage to inflame he builds low towers and gives to each their name namures feigned walls awhile his force disdain which falls at last and smoking hides the plain in sieges thus his arm the youth employs till what his hand erects his sword destroys while eager now to reach thy virtuous fame his bosom hardly bounds the restless flame a rising red his youthful cheeks inspires and stains his lillies over with purple fires but oh what muse an equal strength supplies to paint augustas triumphs as they rise through whose glad streets the grape her juice bestows each sordid channel purpling where it flows what verse can reach the lighted orbs on high and falling luster of the artful sky while stars of sulphur through heavnsazure glow and fall and smoke from bursting shells below see the fair night her rival beams display forget her shades and emulate the day forth from the clouds the heaven a torrent pours of falling light and rains in burning showers while meteors blazing through the winter sky trail a long length of fire and crackling die as thus the spheres with shining wonders glow a thousand hideous forms surprise below bright horrid monsters ghastly to the eye in various shapes the artful flames belly here a fierce lion we with dread admire shake his red mane and rough with curls of fire there dressed in flames a slippery serpent slides burns with feigned life and hisses as he glides each subject now while william fills the throne springs with new life and calls that life his own to natures bounds their fleets control the main no dangers dread and every foe disdain secure they wander and while he is kind the sea no terrors has no rage the wind whether to freezing climes their course they hold over icy waves and bound with summers cold or cross those oceans where perfuming gales and blasts of incense swell the driving sails ye sacred shades who from above complain your reeking wounds the fields of death distain still to your isle your great assistance lend and whom the warriors saved their ghosts defend let william still your kind protection prove his pride on earth and guardians when above and while your friendship thus survives the grave your love secures that

printed for e curll in fleet street mdccxviii  dissertatio de insignioribus romanorum poetis omnium in re poetica maxim inclaruerunt romani and romanorum virgilius optimae quaeque regulae huic arti inservientes non tam criticorum praeceptis quam maronis exemplo sunt depromendae ut ideo de reliquis heroici carminis scriptoribus recte statuamus virtutes and vitia quae apud singulos occurrunt lectioni conferamus virgilianae qui si ullibi defecerit bucolicis nonnunquam puriorem immiscuit styli elegantiam quam quae pastoribus conveniat and saepe grandior sonat carminum majestas quam quae tenui avenae consona videatur apud quemlibet georgicorum librum inimitabili quadam sermonis elegantia res rusticae explicantur sed ultimus de apum natura valde praeter caeteros animum delectat ubi dum in tenui argumento procedit poema solennem quandam sententiarum and verborum pompam studiose affectet poeta apum ideo opera cyclopum assimulat laboribus nec majori carminum tumultu aeneae and turni recitat certamina quam hasce insectorum turmas inter sese depraeliantes ubique exiguae reipublicae duces populi studia mores and tenue illud imperium quod intra alvearii angustias exercetur venusta nescio qua carminis magnificentia exprimuntur quin hoc certe in toto opere praecipue occurrit admirandum quomodo dum plantationis pastionis and agriculturae curas exequitur poeta omissis usitatioribus loquendi formulis materiae tam incultae locutionem poeticam accommodaret quomodo ignobiliori depressus argumento nunquam ad stylum plebeium orationem demiserat sed tanta undique apparet locutionum vis ut multi quamvis temere georgicos etiam aeneidi praetulisse non dubitarint sed in hoc opere per argumentum non licuit alias poeseos parts praestitisse quam styli and descriptionum elegantiam quod ad utrumque attinet illud sibi proprium semper vendicat maronis pagina ut quicquid exprimat mira quadam dulcedine animum ingrediatur and quod describat melius quam si oculis subjiciatur tanquam praesens intueamur  in styli puritate proxime accedit lucretius cujus dictio si obsoletae aliquando verborum antiquitati and numeris pene solutis agnoscas illorum palato qui roman sapiunt persuavis videatur in descriptionibus tamen claudiano secundus debetur honos qui amoenas rerum imagines ubique venustissima contexuit oratione in hoc solummodo vitiosus quod fusius quam par est semper expatietur eosdem versus diversis exponat loquendi modis in hac art sese maxim profecisse satis noverat claudianus de quacunque enim re satagit assidue semper quaerit quae describenda sunt imo plurima sumpsit argumenta quae tota in descriptionibus occupantur ut videre est in praefationibus in idylliis in libris de raptu proserpinae de phaenice histrice torpedine and plerisque epigrammatum  ovidius ut erat aulici ingenii homo terso quidem and polito carmine res exhibuit amatorias in caeteris tamen operibus istiusmodi occurrit sermo quali in triviis uti solent ille enim ingenio suo confisus de operosiori dictione elaboranda parum erat satis solicitus in libro tamen metamorphoseos varias optime depinxit animalium mutationes dum prior paulatim exuitur forma and nova superinducitur  utrumque hoc quod jam tractamus poetis officium non raro optime praestitit papinius lucanus neutrum cujus dictio quanquam multum sonat inflata nulla tamen phraseorum aut epithetorum venustate animatur sed orationi magis solutae convenit quam poeticae imo certe tali plerunque utitur verborum delectu qualem vel liber dedignetur sermo et quanquam in descriptionibus saepissime versatur and in hujusmodi diverticula nunquam non excurrit raro tamen ut debet opus absolvit jam vero quod ad statium attinet plurima certe composuit summis poetarum invidenda sed inter magnas virtutes maxima occurrunt vitia in dictione enim verba nimis admittit sesquipedalia nullaque de argumento habita ratione vana numeris miscet tonitrua nec minus in descriptionibus peccat nimio enim calori indulgens dum totis viribus excellere conatur ultra finem tendit opus et in tumorem excrescit in utrumque hujusmodi vitium aliquando incidit claudianus jam vero quoniam de virgilii aeneidis argumento varii multa scripserunt and praeclara pauca solummodo de statii and lucani carminibus sunt advertenda utpote quae latinorum omnium sola epica haberi debent de lucano id saepe in disputationem venit an historia qua constat pharsalicum poema idoneum sit heroici carminis argumentum vera ideo heroicae poeseos natura inquirenda est quam apud librum de dignitate and augmentis scientiarum his verbis optime exhibuit verulamius nostras ex quo satis patet veram historiam cum epico poemate male convenire and proinde lucanum quoad argumentum maxim defecisse quinque in illius poemate maxim emicant heroes caesar pompeius brutus cato and cicero omnes sane tam vita insignes quam morte luctuosi quorum virtutes quantum licuit per humanam naturam perfectioni istae heroicae quam reliqui poetae ducibus suis falso tribuerunt proxime accesserant lucanus caesari undique oblatrat pompeii parts ambitiose fovet sed bruti and catonis encomia ob stoicum credo illud ingenium quod cum his habuit commune maxim celebrat et plurima certe quae lucano objicias philosophiae hujuscemodi sunt referenda inde immodicus iste ingenii tumor and ambitiosa sententiarum ostentatio quam cum illa hominum turba semper habet in deliciis inde quae magna sunt quam quae bona sunt maluit praeferre hinc etiam in eximia illa poeseos virtute passionibus excitandis ipse qui omnes philosophiae affectus tanquam illicitos existimavit male successerat cujus vitii unicum tantum ut taceam caetera argumentum proferam postquam in pugna pharsalica caesar de pompeio victoriam reportaverit lucanus maxim debuit si aliquid ab ipsa historia alienum protulisset lugubri quodam carmine immeritam doluisse pompeii sortem quippe in toto opere summo habuit honor vel saltem ipsum pompeium ut ingens patuit doloris argumentum aut de amissa romae liberate aut de amicorum mortibus aut de propriis querentem infortuniis introduxisse oportuit poeta tamen ab omni hujusmodi dolor tam long abest ut pompeium obnixe hortaretur postquam victus a bello decesserat ut caesaris victoris sui commiserescat quia nempe caesar non sine scelere victoria potitus est nonne juvat pulsum bellis cessisse nec istud prospexisse nefas spumantes coede catervas respice turbatos in cursu sanguinis amnes et soceri miserere tui quo pectore romam intrabit factus compis felicior istis quis tulerit poetam tam ridicule philosophantem quasi vero pompeius senex exul miser triumumphatus ob victorem suum quamvis scelestum commiserationem quandam conciperet illum quidem maxim stoice sapuisse oporterat qui omnibus hisce fortunae donis spoliatus tantam in nuda virtute poneret felicitatem sed nullus poetarum nisi virgilius hujusmodi afficiat dolor alii plerunque dum moerorem aliquem lectoribus inducerent in illo peccant quod nimia prolixitate sese in questus effundant nec unquam satis lachrymarum exhaustum esse sentiant vel ingenium quod maxim possint versibus infundendo faciunt ut magis carmina miremur quam materiam lugeamus de utroque cavit virgilius qui mera semper simplicitate luctuosa ut in se sunt exhibuit and leviter quicquid dolet perstrinxerat lamentationes enim inquit cicero debent esse breves and concisae quia lachryma subito exarescit and difficile est auditorem aut lectorem in summo illo animi affectu tenere ut vero ad statium redeamus illi quidem spiritus non raro feliciter assurgit cui dum temperare nequit nescio quas projicit ampullas and vana carminibus addit numerorum terriculamenta thebaidis quidem argumentum ingenii sui truculentiae sed non heroico poemati satis aptum videatur eteocles enim polynices and tydeus quorum gesta hoc carmine celebrantur nihil habent eorum si unicam fortitudinem demas quae convenient heroibus imo in toto poemate nulla nisi scelerum qualia sunt parricidii perfidiae immanitatis odiorum proferuntur exemplaria dum in omnibus fere quos suo carmine induxit virgilius praeclara quaedam illucescunt and in ipso aenea summam pietatem erga does natum conjugem amicos and parentem oculis semper habemus subjectam epitheta plerunque statiana multum sonant metaphorice dum inanimatis illa tribuuntur quae animalibus convenient in verbis tamen nec raro sine maxima elegantia metaphoras consectatur claudianus virgilius in utrisque parcissimus statius plurimas rerum similitudines composuit multum saepe de virgilii ingenio referentes in qua art melius successerat lucanus si aliquid unquam mediocre admiserat sed dum virgilius ad apes ad formicas and istiusmodi natura ludicra descendit nihil unquam nisi quercum fulminatam terrae exitium aut mundi conflagrationem ebuccinat lucanus et hisce tandem quorum alii non operae pretium duxerunt meminisse de heroicis scriptoribus breviter perstrictis de satyricis restat dicendum quorum omnium juvenalis and horatius palmam dubiam quidem fecerunt inter literatos enim multum discrepat utrum mordax illa ingenii acerbitas qua suam armavit paginam juvenalis an potius horatii festivae irrisiones magis satyrae conveniant ut vero de utroque rectius statuatur pauca prius sunt advertenda ob infamem vitae suae lasciviam etiam nunc temporis male audit horatius virtutem tamen semper rigide coluit juvenalis ille in absolutissima augusti aula versatus

indecoras quasdam aulicorum ineptias plerunque insectatur non ideo abfuisset quin irridetur si aliqua styli severitate ad leviuscula hujusmodi castiganda se accinxisset gravissima tamen in temporibus

roman poets  made english from the latin original by christopher hayes esquire  london printed in the year       a dissertation upon the most celebrated roman poets of all the nations in the world the romans have most excelled in the art of poetry and even among the romans virgil has been the most deservedly celebrated from whom the justest rules of this art are rather to be taken than from the dry precepts of the critics to the end therefore that we may the more truly ascertain the beauties and faults which occur among the rest of the writers of heroic poetry let us compare them with the style of virgil who if he be in any thing deficient it is when he has sometimes in his eclogues mingled such a purity of style as is not entirely agreeable with the dialect of shepherds and frequently the dignity of his verse seems no way consonant to the rural pipe in every book of his georgicks he treats of country affairs with an inimitable elegancy of style but above all we are most delighted with his last book of the nature of bees where in a poem on so inconsiderable a subject our author purposely affects a peculiarly solemn and pompous style in this piece he compares the labors of the bees to those of the cyclops and in the same lofty numbers recounts the skirmishes of these little insects among themselves as he does the rencounters of aeneas and turnus all along the generals of this small republic the populace the factions the customs and forms of government exercised within the narrow limits of the beehive are described with an inexpressible beauty and magnificence throughout the whole work what mostly raises our admiration is that in the persuit of his discourse on planting grazing and agriculture waving the common forms of speech he suits his poetic diction to so unpolite a theme how seemingly depressed with the meanness of his subject he never sinks into a plebeian style but the force and energy of his expression are so conspicuous that many too rashly indeed have not scrupled to prefer the georgicks to the aeneid but in a work of this nature no other parts of poetry could be displayed except an elegance of style and description in both these ways virgil has this peculiar to himself that he captivates the soul with his wonderful sweetness and his descriptions are as lively as if we had the object placed before our eyes  in the purity of his style next follows lucretius whose diction allowing for his obsoleteness and numbers almost prosaick may challenge a share of praise in those who have any taste of the roman eloquence for descriptions however the second post of honor is due to claudian who has throughout in a most beautiful style interwoven his agreeable images faulty in this alone that he expatiates upon his subjects beyond all decency and frequently gives us the same thoughts diversified only in expression in this art claudian well knew the progress he had made for on whatsoever topic he is engaged he diligently searches out matter for description nay most of the subjects he has wrote upon are wholly such as may be seen in his prefaces his eclogues his books of the rape of proserpine his phoenix his porcupine his crampfish and most of his epigrams  ovid like a true courtier as he was describes the affairs of love in neat and polite verse in the rest of his works we meet with the more vulgar way of expression for trusting to a good genius he was little solicitous about forming a more elaborate style but yet in his metamorphoses he has painted in the greatest perfection the various changes of all creatures and his transformations succeed one another with a most surprising celerity  statius has frequently discharged both these requisites of a poet we just now observed lucan neither whose diction although very bombast is not enlivened either by beautiful phrases or epithets but comes nearer prose than poetry nay there is in him commonly such a mean choice of words as is sometimes even beneath prose it self and although he abounds in descriptions and is always making excursions of that kind yet he seldom finishes his work as he ought or brings his thoughts to any justness of conclusion  but now as to statius he has given us compositions worthy of the envy of the best poets but with all his beauties he has greater faults for in his expression he makes too much use of gigantick words and not considering his subject mingles useless thunder in his numbers nor is he less faulty in his descriptions for encouraging too great a heat while he attempts to excel he shoots beyond his mark and swells unnaturally of both which extremes claudian is too often guilty  and now since there have been many pieces written and those of note on the subject of virgils aeneis and less notice is taken of the poetry of statius and lucan to whose productions only the latins allow the title of epick poetry as to lucan it has been often disputed whether his pharsalia be a proper subject for an heroic poem for the decision of this point we must enquire into the true nature of heroic poetry which our countryman the lord bacon has admirably described in his treatise of the advancement of learning from whence it is sufficiently manifest that history and epic poetry are by no means proper companions and therefore that lucan has very much failed in his principal subject the five heroes who make the greatest figure in his poem are caesar pompey brutus cato and cicero each of them indeed as distinguishable in their lives as they were lamented at their deaths men whose virtues allowing for the frailties of human nature came nearest to that pitch of heroic perfection which other poets have falsely attributed to their heroes lucan every where rails at caesar and passionately espouses pompeys interest but most of all celebrates the characters of brutus and cato for that spirit of stoicism which he had equally imbibed with them and indeed most of the faults objected to lucan are rather to be imputed to this kind of philosophy from whence sprung that boundless vein of wit and that peculiar affectation of a lofty style which like that sect of men he always delighted in and therefore gives the preference rather to great than good actions and upon this account in raising the passions that most excellent part of poetry he succeeded but ill because upon the principles of his philosophy the passions themselves were accounted as absolutely unlawful to confirm this passing by many others i will produce but one instance after caesar had obtained the victory over pompey in the battle of pharsalia lucan certainly if he had enlarged on any circumstance foreign to his story should upon so remarkable an occasion have brought in pompey lamenting his unhappy fate in the most mournful strain especially since he pays so high a deference to him throughout his whole work or at least as there was an open field for grief he should have introduced pompey either complaining of romes lost liberty the death of his friends or his own misfortunes but lucan is so far from raising the passions to this just height that he warmly advises pompey when vanquished he retires from the field of action to commiserate the condition of his conqueror caesar because he had not won the day but by unjustifiable methods dont you rejoice that your superior foes have snatched you from a scene of future woes that blessed in exile you escape the sight of bleeding armies in domestic fight behold each river drags her tardy flood choked up with carnage and distained with blood your victorsire with pitying eyes survey nor envy him the fortune of the day how shall he enter rome devoid of shame who on the public ruins builds his name who can bear to hear the poet philosophizing in this ridiculous manner as if pompey a man in years an exile miserable and vanquished should have any concern upon him for the crimes of his conqueror he ought to have been very much stoicizd indeed who despoiled of all the goods of fortune could place the sum of his felicity in mere naked virtue but none of the poets have touched this passion of grief like virgil the generality of other writers when they attempt to move their readers offend in this point that they are too prolix in spinning out their complaints and think their flood of tears inexhaustible or else while they labor to express the greatness of their genius in the profuseness of their verse rather raise our admiration at the flowing of their numbers than excite our pity in the catastrophe of their story virgil has carefully avoided both these extremes and dresses his images of sorrow in their native simplicity and whoever he makes to grieve he always does it with a quick and tender compassion for according to cicero our expressions of grief ought to be short and concise because our tears quickly dry up and it is unnatural to detain either an auditor or a reader in too long a suspension of grief  but to return to statius his spirit is indeed lofty and aspiring to which while he gives too great a loose he runs into bombast and to his poetry often adds useless sounding words the subject of his thebais seems indeed suited to the barbarity of his genius but is beneath the dignity of an heroic poem for neither eteocles polynices nor tydeus whose actions are recorded in this poem have any thing in them except their valor agreeable to heroes nay throughout the whole piece there are no examples produced unless of persons infamous for the most flagitious enormities such as parricide treachery cruelty and revenge while on the contrary every thing praiseworthy shines bright in virgils heroes and in the person of aeneas we have placed before our eyes an instance of consummate piety toward the gods his son his wife his friends and his father the epithets of statius are generally forced and very metaphorical while such properties are ascribed to inanimates as really only belong to animals in the choice of his words and frequently in his metaphors he is followed by claudian with the utmost elegance virgil is sparing in both these particulars statius abounds much with similitudes in which he seems to imitate virgil but in this instance lucan had had better success if he had hit upon the proper medium but while virgil stoops down to the humble subjects of bees ants and other such like delightful themes of nature on the other hand lucan bellows out nothing but stories of oaks split by lightning earthquakes and the worlds conflagration let this in short suffice observable concerning the writers of heroic poetry in itself new and never before taken notice of  something now remains to be said of the satyrists among whom whether juvenal or horace have most right to the bays it is difficult to determine for it has been long a dispute among the learned whether that keenness and bitterness of expression with which juvenal has armed his satires or horaces more jocose lampoons are most agreeable to the end of satire now that we may give a clearer decision on this head a few things must be premised horace bears to this day an ill character for the looseness of his conduct in life juvenal was a rigid practiser of virtue the one was conversant in the most perfectly polite court of augustus the other lived in the dregs of domitians time and therefore both these poets accommodated their writings to the manners of the different ages they lived in for horace is entirely upon the ludicrous and persues not so much the licentiousness of the times as the ridiculous fopperies of some particular courtiers for had he attempted to correct these trifles with severity he had not missed of being laughed at but juvenal lashes the grossest crimes prevalent in his time and complains of enormities which he was ashamed to mention and nothing less than the highest resentment of soul ardency of expression and sharpness of speech could be an equal match to crimes so notorious though whenever he descends to be jocose we frequently meet with the pleasantry of horace both of them allowing for the different manner of their writing are perfect masters in their several ways in the one shines the ridicule in the other the severe the rest of horaces pieces are so admirable that they exceed our highest encomiums and are not only beyond our dislike but above our praise  as to what concerns the dramatick poets plautus and terence bear away the bell whose plots turns and elegancy of style are so well known that nothing new can be said upon them  as to seneca mankind have had different opinions of him some have ranked him with the best tragoedians others have sunk him below the worst he certainly had a great genius an elegant and concise way of expression he abounds with smart turns which always savor much of that stoicism of which he was a follower upon which account he has always been esteemed by those who have had little or no taste of dramatick poetry but then if we consider him as such his tragedies are throughout too elaborate and this to pass by his other faults seems peculiarly senecas that he makes all his actors without any regard to the characters they bear talk in the same strain all of them inculcate rigid philosophical dogmata and such morality as is rather fit for the schools of the stoics than the roman theater for with him the king and the slave strut in the same buskin nay you may perceive the nurse herself deeply tinged with the principles of stoicism  among the epigrammatists martial and claudian have bore the greatest reputation the first for the severe point in the close of his epigrams and the peculiar jingle of his words the other for dispersing the poignancy of his wit throughout his epigrams and that in the most beautiful latin phrase  the rest of the herd of the latin poets creep so low in their numbers that they are beneath the notice either of gods or men and though we may now and then discover in the affected harangues of catullus and the obscene poetry of tibullus and propertius some not disagreeable pieces yet it is not worth our while to rake the dunghills for the sake of the jewels  errata

referred to by mr addison in the  th page of the foregoing dissertation   de poesi narrativa sive eam heroicam appellare placet modo hoc intelligas de materia non de versu ea a fundamento prorsus nobili excitata videtur quod ad dignitatem humanae naturae imprimis spectat cum enim mundus sensibilis sit anima rationali dignitate inferior videtur poesis haec humanae naturae largiri quae historia denegat atque animo umbris rerum utcunque fatisfacere cum solida haberi non possint si quis enim rem acutius introspiciat firmum ex poesi sumitur argumentum magnitudinem rerum magis illustrem ordinem magis perfectum and varietatem magis pulchram animae humanae complacere quam in natura ipsa post lapsum reperire ullo modo possit quapropter cum res gestae and eventus qui vere historiae subjiciuntur non sint ejus amplitudinis in qua anima humana sibi satisfaciat praesto est poesis quae facta magis heroica confingat cum historia vera successus rerum minime pro meritis virtutum and scelerum narret corrigit eam poesis and exitus and fortunas secundum merita and ex lege nemeseos exhibet cum historia vera obvia rerum satietate and similitudine animae humanae fastidio sit reficit eam poesis inexpectata and varia and vicissitudinem plena canens adeo ut poesis ista non solum ad delectationem sed etiam ad animi magnitudinem and ad mores conferat quare and merito etiam divinitatis cujuspiam particeps videri possit quia animum erigit and in sublime rapit rerum simulachra ad animi desideria accommodando non animum rebus quod ratio facit and historia submittendo thus translated in the english edition by dr rawley  as for narrative poesy or if you please heroical so you understand it of the matter not of the verse it seems to be raised altogether from a noble foundation which makes much for the dignity of mans nature for seeing this sensible world is in dignity inferior to the soul of man poesy seems to endow human nature with that which history denies and to give satisfaction to the mind with at least the shadow of things where the substance cannot be had for if the matter be thoroughly considered a strong argument may be drawn from poesy that a more stately greatness of things a more perfect order and a more beautiful variety delights the soul of man than any way can be found in nature since the fall wherefore seeing the acts and events which are the subject of true history are not of that amplitude as to content the mind of man poesy is ready at hand to feign acts more heroical because true history reports the successes of business not proportionable to the merit of virtues and vices poesy corrects it and presents events and fortunes according to desert and according to the law of providence because true history through the frequent satiety and similitude of things works a distaste and misprision in the mind of man poesy cheereth and refreshes the soul chanting things rare and various and full of vicissitudes so as poesy serves and conferreth to delectation magnanimity and morality and therefore it may seem deservedly to have some participation of divineness because it does raise the mind to things as reason and history do finis
