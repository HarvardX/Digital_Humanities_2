the belles stratagem a comedy as acted at the theater royal in covent garden  by mrs cowley  london printed for t cadell in the strand       to the queen madam in the following comedy my purpose was to draw a female character which with the most lively sensibility fine understanding and elegant accomplishments should unite that beautiful reserve and delicacy which whilst they veil those charms render them still more interesting in delineating such a character my heart naturally dedicated it to your majesty and nothing remained but permission to lay it at your feet your majestys graciously allowing me this high honor is the point to which my hopes aspired and a reward of which without censure i may be proud  madam with the warmest wishes for the continuance of your majestys felicity i

at all the chambers round exit servant what the devil brings you to this part of the town  have any of the long robes handsome wives sisters or chambermaids   court perhaps they have  but i came on a different errand and had thy good fortune brought thee here half an hour sooner i would have given thee such a treat ha ha ha   sav i am sorry i missed it what was it   court i was informed a few days since that my cousins fallow were come to town and desired earnestly to see me at their lodgings in warwickcourt holborn away drove i painting them all the way as so many hebes they came from the farthest part of northumberland had never been in town and in course were made up of rusticity innocence and beauty   sav well   court after waiting thirty minutes during which there was a violent bustle in bounced five sallow damsels four of them maypoles  the fifth nature by way of variety had bent in the aesop style  but they all opened at once like hounds on a fresh scent  oh cousin courtall  how do you do cousin courtall lord cousin i am glad you are come we want you to go with us to the park and the plays and the opera and almacks and all the fine places  the devil thought i my dears may attend you for i am sure i will not  however i heroically stayed an hour with them and discovered the virgins were all come to town with the hopes of leaving it  wives  their heads full of knightbaronights fops and adventures   sav well how did you get off   court oh pleaded a million engagements  however conscience twitched me so i breakfasted with them this morning and afterward squired them to the gardens here as the most private place in town and then took a sorrowful leave complaining of my hard hard fortune that obliged me to set off immediately for dorsetshire ha ha ha   sav i congratulate your escape  courtall at almacks with five awkward country cousins ha ha ha  why your existence as a man of gallantry could never have survived it   court death and fire had they come to town like the rustics of the last age to see pauls the lions and the waxwork  at their service  but the cousins of our days come up ladies  and with the knowledge they glean from magazines and pocketbooks fine ladies laugh at the bashfulness of their grandmothers and boldly demand their entrees in the first circles   sav where can this fellow be  come give me some news  i have been at war with woodcocks and partridges these two months and am a stranger to all that has passed out of their region   court oh enough for three gazettes the ladies are going to petition for a bill that during the war every man may be allowed two wives   sav it is impossible they should succeed for the majority of both houses know what it is to have one   court gallantry was blackballd at the coterie last thursday and prudence and chastity voted in   sav ay that may hold till the camps break up  but have ye no elopements no divorces   court divorces are absolutely out and the commonsdoctors starving so they are publishing trials of crim con with all the separate evidences at large which they find has always a wonderful effect on their trade actions tumbling in upon them afterward like mackarel at gravesend   sav what more   court nothing  for weddings deaths and politics i never talk of but whilst my hair is dressing but prithee saville how came you in town whilst all the qualified gentry are playing at popgun on coxheath and the country overrun with hares and foxes   sav i came to meet my friend doricourt who you know is lately arrived from rome   court arrived yes faith and has cut us all out  his carriage his liveries his dress himself are the rage of the day his first appearance set the whole ton in a ferment and his valet is besieged by levees of tailors habitmakers and other ministers of fashion to gratify the impatience of their customers for becoming a la mode de doricourt nay the beautiful lady frolic the other night with two sister countesses insisted upon his waistcoat for muffs and their snowy arms now bear it in triumph about town to the heartrending affliction of all our beaux gorcons   sav indeed well those little gallantries will soon be over he is on the point of marriage   court marriage doricourt on the point of marriage it is the happiest tidings you could have given next to his being hanged  who is the bride elect   sav i never saw her but it is miss hardy the rich heiress  the match was made by the parents and the courtship begun on their nurses knees master used to crow at miss and miss used to chuckle at master   court oh then by this time they care no more for each other than i do for my country cousins   sav i dont know that they have never met since thus high and so probably have some regard for each other   court never met odd   sav a whim of mr hardys he thought his daughters charms would make a more forcible impression if her lover remained in ignorance of them till his return from the continent   enter savilles servant serve mr doricourt sir has been at counselor pleadwells and gone about five minutes   exit servant serve five minutes zounds i have been five minutes too late all my lifetime  good morrow courtall i must pursue him going   court promise to dine with me today i have some honest fellows going off on the opposite side   sav cannot promise perhaps i may  see there there is a bevy of female patagonians coming down upon us   court by the lord then it must be my strapping cousins  i dare not look behind me  run man run   exit on the same side scene ii  a hall at doricourts a gentle knock at the door enter the porter port tap what sneaking devil art thou opens the door enter crowquill so i suppose you are one of monsieurs customers too he is above stairs now overhauling all his honors things to a parcel of em   crowq no sir it is with you if you please that i want to speak   port me well what do you want with me   crowq sir you must know that i am  i am the gentleman who writes the teteatetes in the magazines   port oh oh  what you are the fellow that ties folks together in your sixpenny cuts that never meet any where else   crowq oh dear sir excuse me  we always go on foundation and if you can help me to a few anecdotes of your master such as what marchioness he lost money to in paris  who is his favorite lady in town  or the name of the girl he first made love to at college  or any incidents that happened to his grandmother or great aunts  a couple will do by way of supporters  i will weave a web of intrigues losses and gallantries between them that shall fill four pages procure me a dozen dinners and you sir a bottle of wine for your trouble   port oh oh i heard the butler talk of you when i lived at lord tinkets but what the devil do you mean by a bottle of wine  you gave him a crown for a retaining fee   crowq oh sir that was for a lords amors a commoners are never but half why i have had a baronets for five shillings though he was a married man and changed his mistress every six weeks   port dont tell me what signifies a baronet or a bit of a lord who may be was never further than sun and sun round london we have traveled man my master has been in italy and over the whole island of spain talked to the queen of france and danced with her at a masquerade ay and such folks dont go to masquerades for nothing but mum  not a word more  unless you will rank my master with a lord i will not be guilty of blabbing his secrets i assure you   crowq well sir perhaps you will throw in a hint or two of other families where you have lived that may be worked up into something and so sir here is one two three four five shillings   port well that is honest pocketing the money to tell you the truth i dont know much of my masters concerns yet  but here comes monsieur and his gang i will pump them they have trotted after him all round europe from the canaries to the isle of wight   enter several foreign servants and two tradesmen the porter takes one of them aside tradesm well then you have showed us all   frenchm all en verite messieurs you avez seen every ting serviteur serviteur exeunt tradesmen ah here comes one autre curious englishman and dats one autre guinea pour moi enter saville allons monsieur dis way i will show you tings such tings you never see begar in england  velvets by le moss suits cut by verdue trimmings by grossette

peur  ten tousand pardons excusez mon erreur and permit me you conduct to monsieur doricourt he be too happy a vous voir exeunt frenchman and saville   port step below a bit  well make it out somehow  i suppose a slice of sirloin will not make the story go down the worse exeunt porter and crowquill   scene iii  an apartment at doricourts enter doricourt doric speaking to a servant behind i shall be too late for st jamess bid him come immediately   enter frenchman and saville frenchm monsieur saville exit frenchman   doric most fortunate my dear saville let the warmth of this embrace speak the pleasure of my heart   sav well this is some comfort after the scurvy reception i met with in your hall  i prepared my mind as i came up stairs for a bon jour a grimace and an adieu   doric why so   sav judging of the master from the rest of the family what the devil is the meaning of that flock of foreigners below with their parchment faces and snuffy whiskers what cannot an englishman stand behind your carriage buckle your shoe or brush your coat   doric stale my dear saville stale englishmen make the best soldiers citizens artizans and philosophers in the world but the very worst footmen i keep french fellows and germans as the romans kept slaves because their own countrymen had minds too enlarged and haughty to descend with a grace to the duties of such a station   sav a good excuse for a bad practice   doric on my honor experience will convince you of its truth a frenchman neither hears sees nor breathes but as his master directs and his whole system of conduct is comprised in one short word obedience an englishman reasons forms opinions cogitates and disputes he is the mere creature of your will the other a being conscious of equal importance in the universal scale with yourself and is therefore your judge whilst he wears your livery and decides on your actions with the freedom of a censor   sav and this in defense of a custom i have heard you execrate together with all the adventitious manners imported by our traveled gentry   doric ay but that was at eighteen we are always very wise at eighteen but consider this point we go into italy where the sole business of the people is to study and improve the powers of music we yield to the fascination and grow enthusiasts in the charming science we travel over france and see the whole kingdom composing ornaments and inventing fashions we condescend to avail ourselves of their industry and adopt their modes we return to england and find the nation intent on the most important objects polity commerce war with all the liberal arts employ her sons the latent sparks glow afresh within our bosoms the sweet follies of the continent imperceptibly slide away whilst senators statesmen patriots and heroes emerge from the virtu of italy and the frippery of france   sav i may as well give it up you had always the art of placing your faults in the best light and i cannot help loving you faults and all so to start a subject which must please you when do you expect miss hardy   doric oh the hour of expectation is past she is arrived and i this morning had the honor of an interview at pleadwells the writings were ready and in obedience to the will of mr hardy we met to sign and seal   sav has the event answered did your heart leap or sink when you beheld your mistress   doric faith neither one nor the other shes a fine girl as far as mere flesh and blood goes   but    sav but what   doric why she is only a fine girl complexion shape and features nothing more   sav is not that enough   doric no she should have spirit fire lair enjoue that something that nothing which every body feels and which no body can describe in the resistless charmers of italy and france   sav thanks to the parsimony of my father that kept me from travel i would not have lost my relish for true unaffected english beauty to have been quarreled for by all the belles of versailles and florence   doric pho thou have no taste english beauty it is insipidity it wants the zest it wants poignancy frank why i have known a frenchwoman indebted to nature for no one thing but a pair of decent eyes reckon in her suite as many counts marquisses and petits maitres as would satisfy three dozen of our firstrate toasts i have known an italian marquizina make ten conquests in stepping from her carriage and carry her slaves from one city to another whose real intrinsic beauty would have yielded to half the little grisettes that pace your mall on a sunday   sav and has miss hardy nothing of this   doric if she has she was pleased to keep it to herself i was in the room half an hour before i could catch the color of her eyes and every attempt to draw her into conversation occasioned so cruel an embarrassment that i was reduced to the necessity of news french fleets and spanish captures with her father   sav so miss hardy with only beauty modesty and merit is doomed to the arms of a husband who will despise her   doric you are unjust though she has not inspired me with violent passion my honor secures her felicity   sav come come doricourt you know very well that when the honor of a husband is locumtenens for his heart his wife must be as indifferent as himself if she is not unhappy   doric pho never moralize without spectacles but as we are upon the tender subject how did you bear touchwoods carrying lady frances   sav you know i never looked up to her with hope and sir george is every way worthy of her   doric a la mode angloise a philosopher even in love   sav come i detain you  you seem dressed at all points and of course have an engagement   doric to st jamess i dine at hardys and accompany them to the masquerade in the evening but breakfast with me tomorrow and well talk of our old companions for i swear to you saville the air of the continent has not effaced one youthful prejudice or attachment   sav  with an exception to the case of ladies and servants   doric true there i plead guilty  but i have never yet found any man whom i could cordially take to my heart and call friend who was not born beneath a british sky and whose heart and manners were not truly english   ex doricourt and saville scene iv  an apartment at mr hardys villers seated on a sopha reading enter flutter flut hah villers have you seen mrs racket  miss hardy i find is out   vill i have not seen her yet i have made a voyage to lapland since i came in flinging away the book a lady at her toilette is as difficult to be moved as a quaker yawning what events have happened in the world since yesterday have you heard   flut oh yes i stopped at tattersalls as i came by and there i found lord james jessamy sir william wilding and mr  but now i think of it you shant know a syllable of the matter for i have been informed you never believe above one half of what i say   vill my dear fellow somebody has imposed upon you most egregiously  half why i never believe one tenth part of what you say that is according to the plain and literal expression but as i understand you your intelligence is amusing   flut that is very hard now very hard i never related a falsity in my life unless i stumbled on it by mistake and if it were otherwise your dull matteroffact people are infinitely obliged to those warm imaginations which soar into fiction to amuse you for positively the common events of this little dirty world are not worth talking about unless you embellish em  hah here comes mrs rackett adieu to weeds i see all life enter mrs rackett enter madam in all your charms villers has been abusing your toilette for keeping you so long but i think we are much obliged to it and so are you   mrs rack how so pray goodmorning to ye both here here is a hand apiece for you they kiss her hands   flut how so because it has given you so many beauties   mrs rack delightful compliment what do your think of that villers   vill that he and his compliments are alike  shewy but will not bear examining  so you brought miss hardy to town last night   mrs rack yes i should have brought her before but i had a fall from my horse that confined me a week  i suppose in her heart she wished me hanged a dozen times an hour   flut why   mrs rack had she not an expecting lover in town all the time she meets him this morning at the lawyers  i hope she will charm him she is the sweetest girl in the world   vill vanity like murder will out  you have convinced me you think yourself more charming   mrs rack how can that be   vill no woman ever praises another unless she thinks herself superior in the very perfections she allows   flut nor no man ever rails at the sex unless he is conscious he deserves their hatred   mrs rack thank ye flutter  i will owe ye a bouquet for that i am going to visit the newmarried lady frances touchwood  who knows her husband   flut every body   mrs rack is there not something odd in his character   vill nothing but that he is passionately fond of his wife  and so petulant is his love that he opened the cage of a favorite bullfinch and sent it to catch butterflies because she rewarded its song with her kisses   mrs rack intolerable monster such a brute deserves    vill nay nay nay nay this is your sex now  give a woman but one stroke of character off she goes like a ball from a racket sees the whole man marks him down for an angel or a devil and so exhibits him to her acquaintance  this monster this brute is one of the worthiest fellows upon earth sound sense and a liberal mind but doats on his wife to such excess that he quarrels with every thing she admires and is jealous of her tippet and nosegay   mrs rack oh less love for me kind cupid i can see no difference between the torment of such an affection and hatred   flut oh pardon me inconceivable difference inconceivable i see it as clearly as your bracelet in the one case the husband would say as mr snapper said the other day zounds madam do you suppose that my table and my house and my pictures  apropos des bottes there was the divinest plague of athens sold yesterday at langfords the dead figures so natural you would have sworn they had been alive lord primrose bid five hundred  six said lady carmine  a thousand said ingot the nabob  down went the hammer  a rouleau for your bargain said sir jeremy jingle and what answer do you think ingot made him   mrs racket why took the offer   flut sir i would oblige you but i buy this picture to place in the nursery the children have already got whittington and his cat it is just this size and they will make good companions   mrs rack ha ha ha well i protest that is just the way now  the nabobs and their wives outbid one at every sale and the creatures have no more taste    vill there again you forget this story is told by flutter who always remembers every thing but the circumstances and the person he talks about  twas ingot who offered a rouleau for the bargain and sir jeremy jingle who made the reply   flut egad i believe you are right  well the story is as good one way as the other you know good morning i am going to mrs crotchets concert and in my way back shall make my bow at sir georges going   vill i will venture every figure in your taylors bill you make some blunder there   flut turning back done my taylors bill has not been paid these two years and i will open my mouth with as much care as mrs bridget button who wears cork plumpers in each cheek and never hazards more than six words for fear of showing them exit flutter   mrs rack it is a goodnatured insignificant creature let in every where and cared for no where  there is miss hardy returned from lincolns end  she seems rather chagrind   vill then i leave you to your communications enter letitia followed by her maid adieu i am rejoiced to see you so well madam but i must tear myself away   letit dont vanish in a moment   vill oh inhuman you are two of the most dangerous women in town  staying here to be cannonaded by four such eyes is equal to a rencontre with paul jones or a midnight march to omoa  they will swallow the nonsense for the sake of the compliment aside   exit villers letit gives her cloak to her maid order du quesne never to come again he shall positively dress my hair no more exit maid and this odious silk how unbecoming it is  i was bewitched to choose it throwing herself on a sopha and looking in a pocketglass mrs racket staring at her did you over see such a fright as i am today   mrs rack yes i have seen you look much worse   letit how can you be so provoking if i do not look this morning worse than ever i looked in my life i am naturally a fright you shall have it which way you will   mrs rack just as you please but pray what is the meaning of all this   letit rising men are all dissemblers flatterers deceivers have i not heard a thousand times of my air my eyes my shape  all made for victory and today when i bent my whole heart on one poor cooquest i have proved that all those imputed charms amount to nothing  for doricourt saw them unmoved  a husband of fifteen months could not have examined me with more cutting indifference   mrs rack then you return it like a wife of fifteen months and be as indifferent as he   letit aye there is the sting the blooming boy who left his image in my young heart is at four and twenty improved in every grace that fixed him there it is the same face that my memory and my dreams constantly painted to me but its graces are finished and every beauty heightened how mortifying to feel myself at the same moment his slave and an object of perfect indifference to him   mrs rack how are you certain that was the case did you expect him to kneel down before the lawyer his clerks and your father to make oath of your beauty   letit no but he should have looked as if a sudden ray had pierced him he should have been breathless speechless for oh caroline all this was i   mrs rack i am sorry you was such a fool can you expect a man who has courted and been courted by half the fine women in europe to feel like a girl from a boardingschool he is the prettiest fellow you have seen and in course bewilders your imagination but he has seen a million of pretty women child before he saw you and his first feelings have been over long ago   letit your raillery distresses me but i will touch his heart or never be his wife   mrs rack absurd and romantic if you have no reason to believe his heart preengaged be satisfied if he is a man of honor you will have nothing to complain of   letit nothing to complain of heavens shall i marry the man i adore with such an expectation as that   mrs rack and when you have fretted yourself pale my dear you will have mended your expectation greatly   letit pausing yet i have one hope if there is any power whose peculiar care is faithful love that power i invoke to aid me   enter mr hardy hardy well now was not i right aye letty aye cousin racket was not i right i knew twould be so he was all agog to see her before he went abroad and if he had he would have thought no more of her face may be than his own   mrs rack may be not half so much   hardy aye may be so  but i see into things exactly as i foresaw today he fell desperately in love with the wench he he he   letit indeed sir how did you perceive it   hardy that is a pretty question how do i perceive every thing how did i foresee the fall of corn and the rise of taxes how did i know that if we quarrelled with america norway deals would be dearer how did i foretell that a war would sink the funds how did i forewarn parson homily that if he didnt some way or other contrive to get more votes than rubric he would lose the lectureship how did i  but what the devil makes you so dull letitia i thought to have found you popping about as brisk as the jacks of your harpfichord   letit surely sir it is a very serious occasion   hardy pho pho girls should never be grave before marriage how did you feel cousin beforehand aye   mrs rack feel why exceedingly full of cares   hardy did you   mrs rack i could not sleep for thinking of my coach my liveries and my chairmen the taste of clothes i should be presented in distracted me for a week and whether i should be married in white or lilac gave me the most cruel anxiety   letit and is it possible that you felt no other care   hardy and pray of what sort may your cares be mrs letitia i begin to foresee now that you have taken a dislike to doricourt   letit indeed sir i have not   hardy then what is all this melancholy about ant you going to be married and what is more to a sensible man and what is more to a young girl to a handsome man and what is all this melancholy for i say   mrs rack why because he is handsome and sensible and because she is over head and ears in love with him all which it seems your foreknowledge had not told you a word of   letit fie caroline   hardy well come do you tell me what is the matter then if you dont like him hang the signing and sealing he shant have ye  and yet i cannot say that neither for you know that estate that cost his father and me upwards of fourscore thousand pounds must go all to him if you will not have him if he will not have you indeed twill be all yours all that is clear engrossed upon parchment and the poor dear man set his hand to it whilst he was a dying  ah said i i foresee you will never live to see em come together but their first son shall be christened jeremiah after you that i promise you  but come i say what is the matter dont you like him   letit i fear sir  if i must speak  i fear i was less agreeable in mr doricourts eyes than he appeared in mine   hardy there you are mistaken for i asked him and he told me he liked you vastly dont you think he must have taken a fancy to her   mrs rack why really i think so as i was not by   letit my dear sir i am convinced he has not but if there is spirit or invention in woman he shall   hardy right girl go to your toilette    letit it is not my toilette that can serve me but a plan has struck me if you will not oppose it which flatters me with brilliant success   hardy oppose it not i indeed what is it   letit why sir  it may seem a little paradoxical but as he does not like me enough i want him to like me still less and will at our next interview endeavor to heighten his indifference into dislike   hardy who the devil could have foreseen that   mrs rack heaven and earth letitia are you serious   letit as serious as the most important business of my life demands   mrs rack why endeavor to make him dislike you   letit because it is much easier to convert a sentiment into its opposite than to transform indifference into tender passion   mrs rack that may be good philosophy but i am afraid you will find it a bad maxim   letit i have the strongest confidence in it i am inspired with unusual spirits and on this hazard willingly stake my chance for happiness i am impatient to begin my measures exit letitia   hardy can you foresee the end of this cousin   mrs rack no sir nothing less than your penetration can do that i am sure and i cannot stay now to consider it i am going to call on the ogles and then to lady frances touchwoods and then to an auction and then  i dont know where  but i shall be at home time enough to witness this extraordinary interview goodbye exit mrs racket   hardy well it is an odd thing  i cannot understand it  but i foresee letty will have her way and so i shant give myself the trouble to dispute it   exit hardy end of the first act act ii scene i sir george touchwood s enter doricourt and sir george doricourt married ha ha ha you whom i heard in paris say such things of the sex are in london a married man   sir geo the sex is still what it has ever been since la petite morale banished substantial virtues and rather than have given my name to one of your highbred fashionable dames i would have crossed the line in a sireship and married a japanese   doric yet you have married an english beauty yea and a beauty born in high life   sir geo true but she has a simplicity of heart and manners that would have become the fair hebrew damsels toasted by the patriarchs   doric ha ha why thou art a downright matrimonial quixote my life on it she becomes as mere a town lady in six months as though she had been bred to the trade   sir geo common  common  contemptuously no sir lady frances despises high life so much from the ideas i have given her that she will live in it like a salamander in fire   doric oh that the circle dans la place victoire could witness thy extravagance i will send thee off to st evreux this night drawn at full length and colored after nature   sir geo tell him then to add to the ridicule that touchwood glories in the name of husband that he has found in one englishwoman more beauty than frenchmen ever saw and more goodness than frenchwomen can conceive   doric well  enough of description introduce me to this phoenix i came on purpose   sir geo introduce  oh aye to be sure  i believe lady frances is engaged just now  but another time how handsome the dog looks today aside   doric another time  but i have no other time sdeath this is the only hour i can command this fortnight   sir geo asidei am glad to hear it with all my soul so then you cannot dine with us today that is very unlucky   doric oh yes  as to dinner  yes i can i believe contrive to dine with you today   sir geo psha i didnt think on what i was saying i meant supper  you cannot sup with us   doric why supper will be rather more convenient than dinner  but you are fortunate  if you had asked me any other night i could not have come   sir geo tonight  gad now i recollect we are particularly engaged tonight  but tomorrow night    doric why look ye sir george it is very plain you have no inclination to let me see your wife at all so here i sit throws himself on a sopha  there is my hat and here are my legs  now i shant stir till i have seen her and i have no engagements i will breakfast dine and sup with you every day this week   sir geo was there ever such a provoking wretch but to be plain with you doricourt i and my house are at your service but you are a damned agreeable fellow and ten years younger than i am and the women i observe always simper when you appear for these reasons i had rather when lady frances and i are together that you should forget we are acquainted further than a nod a smile or a howdye   doric very well   sir geo it is not merely yourself in propria persana that i object to but if you are intimate here you will make my house still more the fashion than it is and it is already so much so that my doors are of no use to me i married lady frances to engross her to myself yet such is the blessed freedom of modern manners that in spite of me her eyes thoughts and conversation are continually divided amongst all the flirts and coxcombs of fashion   doric to be sure i confess that kind of freedom is carried rather too far it is hard one cannot have a jewel in ones cabinet but the whole town must be gratified with its luster he shant preach me out of seeing his wife though aside   sir geo well now that is reasonable when you take time to reflect doricourt i always observe you decide right and therefore i hope    enter servant serve sir my lady desires    sir geo i am particularly engaged   doric oh lord that shall be no excuse in the world leaping from the sopha lead the way john  i will attend your lady exit following the servant   sir geo what devil possessed me to talk about her  here doricourt running after him doricourt   enter mrs racket and miss ogle followed by a servant mrs rack acquaint your lady that mrs racket and miss ogle are here exit servant   miss ogle i shall hardly know lady frances it is so long since i was in shropshire   mrs rack and i will be sworn you never saw her out of shropshire  her father kept her locked up with his caterpillars and shells and loved her beyond any thing  but a blue butterfly and a petrified frog   miss ogle ha ha ha  well twas a cheap way of breeding her  you know he was very poor though a lord and very highspirited though a virtuoso  in town her pantheons operas and robes de cour would have swallowed his seaweeds moths and monsters in six weeks  sir george i find thinks his wife a most extraordinary creature he has taught her to despise every thing like fashionable life and boasts that example will have no effect on her   mrs rack there is a great degree of impertinence in all that  i will try to make her a fine lady to humble him   miss ogle that is just the thing i wish   enter lady frances lady fran i beg ten thousand pardons my dear mrs racket  miss ogle i rejoice to see you i should have come to you sooner but i was detained in conversation by mr doricourt   mrs rack pray make no apology i am quite happy that we have your ladyship in town at last  what stay do you make   lady fran a short one sir george talks with regret of the scenes we have left and as the ceremony of presentation is over will i believe soon return   miss ogle sure he cannot be so cruel does your ladyship wish to return so soon   lady fran i have not the habit of consulting my own wishes but i think if they decide we shall not return immediately i have yet hardly formed an idea of london   mrs rack i shall quarrel with your lord and master if he dares think of depriving us of you so soon how do you dispose of yourself today   lady fran sir george is going with me this morning to the mercers to choose a silk and then    mrs rack choose a silk for you ha ha ha sir george chooses your laces too i hope your gloves and your pincushions   lady fran madam   mrs rack i am glad to see you blush my dear lady frances these are strange homespun ways if you do these things pray keep em secret lord bless us if the town should know your husband chooses your gowns   miss ogle you are very young my lady and have been brought up in solitude the maxims you learnt among the woodnymphs in shropshire will not pass current here i assure you   mrs rack why my dear creature you look quite frightened  come you shall go with us to an exhibition and an auction  afterward well take a turn in the park and then drive to kensington  so we shall be at home by four to dress and in the evening i will attend you to lady brilliants masquerade   lady fran i shall be very happy to be of your party if sir george has no engagements   mrs rack what do you stand so low in your own opinion that you dare not trust yourself without sir george if you choose to play darby and joan my dear you should have stayed in the country  it is an exhibition not calculated for london i assure you   miss ogle what i suppose my lady you and sir george will be seen pacing it comfortably round the canal arm and arm and then go lovingly into the same carriage  dine teteatete spend the evening at picquet and so go soberly to bed at eleven  such a snug plan may do for an attorney and his wife but for lady frances touchwood it is as unsuitable as linfeywoolfey or a black bonnet at the festino   lady fran these are rather new doctrines to me  but my dear mrs rackett you and miss ogle must judge of these things better than i can as you observe i am but young and may have caught absurd opinions  here is sir george   enter sir george sir geo asidesdeath another room full   lady fran my love mrs racket and the miss ogles   mrs rack give you joy sir george  we came to rob you of lady frances for a few hours   sir geo a few hours   lady fran oh yes i am going to an exhibition and an auction and the park and kensington and a thousand places  it is quite ridiculous i find for married people to be always together  we shall be laughed at   sir geo i am astonished  mrs racket what does the dear creature mean   mrs rack mean sir george  what she says i imagine   miss ogle why you know sir as lady frances had the misfortune to be bred entirely in the country she cannot be supposed to be versed in fashionable life   sir geo no heaven forbid she should  if she had madam she would never have been my wife   mrs rack are you serious   sir geo perfectly so  i should never have had the courage to have married a wellbred fine lady   miss ogle pray sir what do you take a fine lady to be that you express such fear of her sneeringly   sir geo a being easily described madam as she is seen every where but in her own house she sleeps at home but she lives all over the town in her mind every sentiment gives place to the lust of conquest and the vanity of being particular the feelings of wife and mother are lost in the whirl of dissipation if she continues virtuous it is by chance  and if she preserves her hushand from ruin it is by her dexterity at the cardtable  such a woman i take to be a perfect fine lady   mrs rack and you i take to be a slanderous cynic of twoandthirty  twenty years hence one might have forgiven such a libel  now sir hear my definition of a fine lady  she is a creature for whom nature has done much and education more she has taste elegance spirit understanding in her manner she is free in her morals nice her behavior is undistinguishingly polite to her husband and all mankind  her sentiments are for their hours of retirement in a word a fine lady is the life of conversation the spirit of society the joy of the public  pleasure follows where ever she appears and the kindest wishes attend her slumbers  make haste then my dear lady frances commence fine lady and force your husband to acknowledge the justness of my picture   lady fran i am sure it is a delightful one how can you dislike it sir george you painted fashionable life in colors so disgusting that i thought i hated it but on a nearer view it seems charming i have hitherto lived in obscurity it is time that i should be a woman of the world i long to begin  my heart pants with expectation and delight   mrs rack come then let us begin directly i am impatient to introduce you to that society which you were born to ornament and charm   lady fran adieu my love  we shull meet again at dinner going   sir geo sure i am in a dream  fanny   lady fran returning sir george   sir geo will you go without me   mrs rack will you go without me  ha ha ha what a pathetic address why sure you would not always be seen side by side like two beans upon a stalk are you afraid to trust lady frances with me sir   sir george heaven and earth with whom can a man trust his wife in the present state of society formerly there were distinctions of character amongst ye every class of females had its particular description grandmothers were pious aunts discreet old maids censorious but now aunts grandmothers girls and maiden gentlewomen are all the same creature  a wrinkle more or less is the sole difference between ye   mrs rack that maiden gentlewomen have lost their censoriousness is surely not in your catalogue of grievances   sir geo indeed it is  and ranked amongst the most serious grievances  things went well madam when the tongues at three or four old virgins kept all the wives and daughters of a parish in awe they were the dragons that guarded the hesperian fruit and i wonder they have not been obliged by act of parliament to resume their function   mrs rack ha ha ha and pensiond i suppose for making strict enquiries into the lives and conversations of their neighbors   sir geo with all my heart and empowered to oblige every woman to conform her conduct to her real situation you for instance are a widow your air should be sedate your dress grave your deportment matronly and in all things an example to the young women growing up about you  instead of which you are dressed for conquest think of nothing but ensnaring hearts are a coquette a wit and a fine lady   mrs rack bear witness to what he says a coquette a wit and a fine lady who would have expected an eulogy from such an illnatured mortal  valor to a soldier wisdom to a judge or glory to a prince is not more than such a character to a woman   miss ogle sir george i see languishes for the charming society of a century and a half ago when a grave squire and a still graver dame surrounded by a sober family formed a stiff groupe in a moldy old house in the corner of a park   mrs rack delightful serenity undisturbed by any noise but the cawing of rooks and the quarterly rumbling of an old familycoach on a statevisit with the happy intervention of a friendly call from the parish apothecary or the curates wife   sir geo and what is the society of which you boast  a mere chaos in which all distinction of rank is lost in a ridiculous affectation of ease and every different order of beings huddled together as they were before the creation in the same select party you will often find the wife of a bishop and a sharper of an earl and a fiddler in short it is one universal masquerade all disguised in the same habits and manners   serve mr flutter exit servant   sir geo here comes an illustration now i defy you to tell from his appearance whether flutter is a privy counselor or a mercer a lawyer or a grocers prentice   enter flutter flut oh just which you please sir george so you dont make me a lord mayor ah mrs racket  lady frances your most obedient you

mrs bloomers she was dressed all in green no other color to be seen but that of her face and bosom so says i my dear mrs bloomer you look like a carnation just bursting from its pod   sir geo and what said her husband   flut her husband why her husband laughed and said a cucumber would have been a happier simile   sir geo but there are husbands sir who would rather have corrected than amended your comparison i for instance should consider a mans complimenting my wife as an impertinence   flut why what harm can there be in compliments sure they are not infectious and if they were you sir george of all people breathing have reason to be satisfied about your ladys attachment every body talks of it that little bird there that she killed out of jealousy the most extraordinary instance of affection that ever was given   lady fran i kill a bird through jealousy  heavens mr flutter how can you impute such a cruelty to me   sir geo i could have forgiven you if you had   flut oh what a blundering fool  no no  now i remember  twas your bird lady frances  that is it your bullfinch which sir george in one of the refinements of his passion sent into the wide world to seek its fortune  he took it for a knight in disguise   lady fran is it possible o sir george could i have imagined it was you who deprived me of a creature i was so fond of   sir geo mr flutter you are one of those busy idle meddling people who from mere vacuity of mind are the most dangerous inmates in a family you have neither feelings nor opinions of your own but like a glass in a tavern bear about those of every blockhead who gives you his  and because you mean no harm think yourselves excused though broken friendships discords and murders are the consequences of your indiscretions   flut taking out his tablets vacuity of mind  what was the next i will write down this sermon it is the first i have heard since my grandmothers funeral   miss ogle come lady frances you see what a cruel creature your loving husband can be so let us leave him   sir geo madam lady frances shall not go   lady fran shall not sir george  this is the first time such an expression  weeping   sir geo my love my life   lady fran dont imagine i will be treated like a child denied what i wish and then pacified with sweet words   miss ogle apart the bullfinch that is an excellent subject never let it down   lady fran i see plainly you would deprive me of every pleasure as well as of my sweet bird  out of pure love  barbarous man   sir geo it is well madam  your resentment of that circumstance proves to me what i did not before suspect that you are deficient both in tenderness and understanding  tremble to think the hour approaches in which you would give worlds for such a proof of my love go madam give yourself to the public abandon your heart to dissipation and see if in the scenes of gaiety and folly that await you you can find a recompense for the lost affection of a doting husband   exit sir george flut lord what a fine thing it is to have the gift of speech i suppose sir george practices at coachmakershall or the blackhorse in bondstreet   lady fran he is really angry i cannot go   mrs rack not go

was a severe mortificati to him   mrs rack i cannot absolutely swear it spoilt his appetite he eat as if he was hungry and drank his wine as though he liked it   letit what was the apology   mrs rack that you were ill  but i gave him a hint that your extreme bashfulness could not support his eye   letit if i comprehend him aukwardness and bashfulness are the last faults he can pardon in a woman so expect to see me transformed into the veriest maukin   mrs rack you persevere then   letit certainly i know the design is a rash one and the event important  it either makes doricourt mine by all the tenderest ties of passion or deprives me of him for ever and never to be his wife will afflict me less than to be his wife and not be beloved   mrs rack so you wont trust to the good old maxim  marry first and love will follow   letit as readily as i would venture my last guinea that good fortune might follow the woman that has not touched the heart of a man before he leads her to the altar has scarcely a chance to charm it when possession and security turn their powerful arms against her  but here he comes  i will disappear for a moment  dont spare me   exit letitia enter doricourt not seeing mrs racket doric so looking at a picture this is my mistress i presume  ma foi the painter has hit her off  the downcast eye  the blushing cheek  timid  apprehensive  bashful  a tear and a prayer book would have made her la bella magdalena   give me a woman in whose touching mien a mind a soul a polished art is seen whose motion speaks whose poignant air can move such are the darts to wound with endless love  mrs rack is that an impromptu touching him on the shoulder with her fan   doric starting madam  aside finely caught  not absolutely  it struck me during the dessert as a motto for your picture   mrs rack gallantly turned i perceive however miss hardys charms have made no violent impression on you  and who can wonder  the poor girls defects are so obvious   doric defects   mrs rack merely those of education  her fathers indulgence ruined her  mauvaise honte  conceit and ignorance  all unite in the lady you are to marry   doric marry  i marry such a woman  your picture i hope is overcharged  i marry mauvaise honte pertness and ignorance   mrs rack thank your stars that ugliness and ill temper are not added to the list  you must think her handsome   doric half her personal beauty would content me but could the medicean venus be animated for me and endowed with a vulgar soul i should become the statue and my heart transformed to marble   mrs rack bless us  we are in a hopeful way then   doric aside there must be some envy in this  i see she is a coquette ha ha ha and you imagine i am persuaded of the truth of your character ha ha ha miss hardy i have been assured madam is elegant and accomplished  but one must allow for a ladys painting   mrs rack aside i will be even with him for that ha ha ha and so you have found me but  well i protest i meant no

would tell us about the fine sights you saw when you went oversea  i have read in a book that there are some countries where the men and women are all horses  did you see any of them   mrs rack mr doricourt is not prepared my dear for these enquiries he is reflecting on the importance of the question and will answer you  when he can   let when he can why he is as slow in speech as aunt margery when she is reading thomas aquinas  and stands gaping like mumchance   mrs rack have a little discretion   let hold your tongue  sure i may say what i please before i am married if i cannot afterward  do you think a body does not know how to talk to a sweetheart he is not the first i have had   dor indeed   let oh lud he speaks  why if you must know  there was the curate at home  when papa was ahunting he used to come a suitoring and make speeches to me out of books  no body knows what a mort of fine things he used to say to me  and call me venis and jubah and dinah   dor and pray fair lady how did you answer him   let why i used to say look you mr curate dont think to come over me with your flimflams for a better man than ever trod in your shoes is coming oversea to marry me  but ifags i begin to think i was out  parson dobbins was the sprightfuller man of the two   dor surely this cannot be miss hardy   let laws why dont you know me you saw me today  but i was daunted before my father and the lawyer and all them and did not care to speak out  so may be you thought i couldnt  but i can talk as fast as any body when i know folks a little  and now i have shown my parts i hope you will like me better   enter hardy har i foresee this will not do  mr doricourt may be you take my daughter for a fool but your are mistaken she is a sensible girl as any in england   dor i am convinced she has a very uncommon understanding sir aside i did not think he had been such an ass   let my father will undo the whole  laws papa how can you think he can take me for a fool when every body knows i beat the potecary at conundrums last christmastime and did not i make a string of names all in riddles for the ladys diary  there was a little river and a great house that was newcastle  there was what a lamb says and three letters that was ba and ker ker baker  there was    hardy dont stand baaing there you will make me mad in a moment  i tell you sir that for all that she is devilish sensible   doric sir i give all possible credit to your assertions   letit laws papa do come along if you stand watching how can my sweetheart break his mind and tell me how he admires me   doric that would be difficult indeed madam   hardy i tell you letty i will have no more of this  i see well enough    letit laws dont snub me before my husband  that is is to be  you will teach him to snub me too  and i believe by his looks he would like to begin now  so let us go cousin you may tell the gentleman what a genus i have  how i can cut watchpapers and work catgut make quadrillebaskets with pins and take profiles in shade ay as well as the lady at no    south moultonstreet grosvenorsquare ex hardy and letitia   mrs rack what think you of my painting now   doric oh mere watercolors madam the lady has caricatured your picture   mrs rack and how does she strike yon on the whole   doric like a good design spoilt by the incapacity of the artist her faults are evidently the result of her fathers weak indulgence i observed an expression in her eye that seemed to satyrise the folly of her lips   mrs rack but at her age when education is fixed and manner becomes nature  hopes of improvement    doric would be as rational as hopes of gold from a juglers crucible  doricourts wife must be incapable of improvement but it must be because she is got beyond it   mrs rack i am pleased your misfortune sits no heavier   doric your pardon madam so mercurial was the hour in which i was born that misfortunes always go plump to the bottom of my heart like a pebble in water and leave the surface unruffled  i shall certainly set off for bath or the other world tonight  but whether i shall use a chaise with four swift coursers or go off in a tangent  from the aperture of a pistol deserves consideration so i make my adieus going   mrs rack oh but i entreat you postpone your journey till tomorrow determine on which you will  you must be this night at the masquerade   doric masquerade   mrs rack why not  if you resolve to visit the other world you may as well take one nights pleasure first in this you know   doric faith that is very true ladies are the best philosophers

end of it if i leave ye to yourselves so i will even follow him to the masquerade and tell him all about it let me see  what shall my dress be a great mogul no  a grenadier no  no that i foresee would make a laugh hang me if i dont send to my favorite little quick and borrow his jew isaacs dress  i know the dog likes a glass of good wine so i will give him a bottle of my fortyeight and he shall

lived with so much eclat became the object of my terror and i think of the manners of polite life as i do of the atmosphere of a pesthouse  my wife is already infected she was set upon this morning by

 lady fran indeed to tell you the truth i could wish it was the fashion for married people to be inseparable for i have more heartfelt satisfaction in fifteen minutes with you at my side than fifteen

with pleasure but not on the plan of retirement society has claims on lady frances that forbid it   sir geo claims saville   sav yes claims lady frances was born to be the ornament of courts she is sufficiently alarmed not to wander beyond the reach of her protector  and from the british court the most tenderlyanxious husband could not wish to banish his wife bid her keep in her eye the bright

judgment when we slipped out of the room   sir geo then by this time they must have reached amazement which every body knows is the end of matrimony   mrs rack aye the reverend fathers ended the service with that word prophetically  to teach the bride what a capricious monster a husband is   sir geo i rather think it was sarcastically  to prepare the bridegroom for the unreasonable humors and vagaries of his helpmate   lady fran here comes the bridegroom of tonight   enter doricourt and villers  villers whispers saville who goes out omnes joy joy joy   miss ogle if he is a sample of

the importance of the occasion   vill no nor how shocking a thing it is for a man to be forced to marry one woman whilst his heart is devoted to another   mrs rack well now it is over i confess to you mr doricourt i think twas a most ridiculous piece of quixotism to give up the happiness of a whole life to a man who perhaps has but a few moments to be sensible of the sacrifice   flut so it appeared

perversion of taste that led me to consider the delicate timidity of your deportment as the mark of an uninformd mind or inelegant manners i feel now it is to that innate modesty english husbands owe
