author and sold by a millar in the strand mdcclvi  to the right honorable the lady elizabeth cecil madam i have too great a respect for your ladyships commands to disobey them even when they contradict my inclinations and since you are as averse to hear praise as studious to deserve it i will not offend that delicate modesty i cannot but admire indulge me however madam in the vanity of saying i had your ladyships permission to prefix your name to these papers on condition i avoided the usual style of dedicators and permit me to add that  i am with the most unfeigned respect and a sincerity not always found in addresses of this nature madam your ladyships most obliged most obedient and most devoted servant frances brook  preface the author of these poetical attempts begs leave to say that she should not have printed them but that she is precluded from all hopes of ever seeing the tragedy brought upon the stage by there having been two so lately on the same subject if here is should be found to have any greater resemblance to the two represented than the sameness of the story made unavoidable of which she is not conscious it must have been accidental on her side as there are many persons of very distinguished rank and unquestionable veracity who saw here is in manuscript before the others appeared and will witness for her that she has taken no advantage of having seen them she must here do mr crisp the justice to say that any resemblance must have been equally accidental on his part as he neither did nor could see her virginia before his own was played mr garrick having declined reading here is till mr crisps was published  she is sensible of the danger of appearing in print and of the many imperfections in these pieces but hopes her sex and the early time of lie at which most of them were wrote will plead her excuse she asks no more than to be read with the fame candor and indulgence with which she herself reads the productions of others  one thing more she begs leave to say that she was greatly encouraged to this publication by the favorable reception three odes of here is met with which were inserted in a weekly paper called the old maid as this volume may possibly come into the hands of persons who are strangers to the paper she has reprinted those odes with the others  and now invoking the powers for friendly gales she ventures to launch her little bark into the wide sea of criticism and trembling quits the shore  by this author speedily will be published proposals for printing by subscription a poetical translation with

the conquering equan troops tomorrow may bring them to these walls o numitorius these eyes have seen the bravest sons of rome driven to their very camp like fearful fawns by these often beaten equi by the foes they once disdained nor could my soul condemn them why should they spend their dearest blood for appius  numitorius for him indeed for to his towering genius his brother tyrants bend they wait his nod and take the word from him at his command they steep their impious hands in blood or load with slavish chains their freeborn countrymen  trebonius each hour brings fresh disgrace our conquering army which poured the tide of victory along and like a torrent overflowed the nations now ebbs retiring at the slightest breath of opposition  numitorius gods shall romans fly and from the timorous equi shall the stag the trembling stag pursue the lordly lion  trebonius o rome imperial rome how art thou fallen behold the roman eagle which eerwhile soared with strong pinion over the wondering world now spiritless unnervd with drooping wing sits languid all its daring flights forgot crushed by thoppressive hand of tyranny  numitorius yes we are fallen indeed o my trebonius i blush to tell thee but this monster appius with brutal love has dared tinsult virginia pledged as she is to brave icilius   trebonius gods even sextus stole in secret to lucretia nor thus avowed his baseness  scene iii numitorius trebonius a slave slave numitorius this moment as virginia past the forum to visit fair icilia she was seized by claudius appius most abandoned freedman who called her slave and rudely dragged her off to the tribunal of his lord i hasted to tell you this nor know i more that past  numitorius to his tribunal gods what can it mean the tyrant cannot dare  o soldier friend will thou assist us think of brave virginius is it fit his daughter  but i know thy virtue  trebonius no more away my sword and arm are yours  scene iv the forum appius on his tribunal twelve lictors with rods and axes stand ranged on each side virginia icilius claudius romans claudius kneels o gracious appius to whom the injured never kneel in vain to you i bend for justice this bright maid who long has past for old virginius daughter is daughter of my slave born in my house and thence by fraud conveyed to numitoria who bred her as her own virginius absent to hide the approbrious curse of barrenness this in the hour of sickness was confessed with penitential sighs and tears by her who gave her birth i therefore seized upon her nor will resign her but to brave virginius if he disprove my claim since he is absent from you the friend of justice i demand that she remain with me till his return  appius it is just nor can i stop the course of law lictors make way and let the legal claimant lead off the unhappy virgin see virginius be summoned home to plead his doubtful right be that thy care frontinus to a lictor icilius impious villain and do thou think i tamely will resign her no through my bosom you must cut your way ever you can seize this dear this virtuous maid stand off ye slaves  appius ha do thou thwart my will lictors advance and seize the lawless traitor to the lictors icilius yes lictors yes prepare your rods and axes scourge and behead the bravest sons of rome our fond credulity which raised that tyrant deserves it but let chastity be safe o romans by the sacred name of father by the dear pleasures of domestic love and by the spotless honor of your children preserve virginius daughter from pollution  appius traitor seditious villain well i know thee it is not virginias cause awakes thy rage the tribunician spirit breathes within thee but all thy arts are vain a guard attends to quell the mutinous by heaven that roman who stops the course of justice dies this moment  scene v appius virginia icilius claudius numitorius trebonius romans numitorius where is the wretch who with unhallowed tongue demands a freeborn virgin for his slave sprung from the bravest blood our city holds the numitorii and virginii joined  claudius virginia is my slave by justice mine nor will i quit possession till virginius appears to prove his doubtful right  numitorius fabatus whispers a roman who goes out thy slave thou wretch o romans see her tears those speaking drops with strongest eloquence reproach your strange supineness can it be heavens can it be the daughter of virginius can want a friend in rome ungrateful men how has virginius fought his countrys battles for you to guard your beds from violation he rushes foremost in the bloody field whilst you  but tears prevent me  o virginia  claudius too late you plead the laws adjudge her mine till her reputed father proves her birth  numitorius gods it is too much to bear for pity appius if thou have ought of man within thee hear me with me as next of kindred trust the maid till this unheard of claim is proved twere impious to trust the honor of a roman virgin to that abandoned pandar of pollution my brother may be here by rising dawn to morrow i engage for her appearance  icilius why do thou stoop to supplicate that tyrant assist me generous romans to secure her i will bear her off or perish  trebonius brave icilius o romans countrymen  all romans liberty virginia  appius hear me ye romans and thou numitorius and judge how i revere the name of father not to that clamorous tribunician traitor do i yield ought i scorn his idle threats scorn him so much i will not even secure him but to a fancied parents sacred sorrows i yield thus far send for virginius hither i will defer my sentence till tomorrow but if he then appears not i proceed nor longer will withhold the award of justice let sureties instantly be given to claudius for her appearance  scene vi virginia icilius numitorius trebonius and romans trebonius all are sureties for her  romans all  numitorius thanks romans we may want your aid tomorrow but it is not needed now this gallant friend with us will be sufficient come virginia let me conduct thee hence o romans friends remember but i will not doubt your virtue  scene vii  the house of virginius numitorius trebonius numitorius thanks my trebonius for this generous friendship thus in our moments of distress to aid us and kindly join in our domestic dangers becomes the honest roman and the friend  trebonius is not virginias cause the cause of rome of liberty and virtue too too long our stooping necks have born the yoke of power the yoke ourselves have fixed and shall we want a deed like this to fire us gods shall romans wait till oppression bondage violation in all their horrid forms are loosed upon them ever they assert the spirit of their fathers and crush the tyranny themselves have raised  numitorius for wisest ends we raised this power trebonius to give us laws the wonder of the world from polished greece selected but long since that purpose and their trusted power expired long have they stretched the iron hand of force over our insulted liberties but this this last attempt surpasses all example  trebonius yes numitorius tarquins self must yield the palm of daring villainy to appius and own him foremost in the wicked race but we deserve it power unlimited is only fit for jove why did we trust these sons of earth with thunder much too mighty for their weak arms to wield  numitorius the giddy height to which mistaken rome has raised them turns their maddening brains or appius would behold his sure destruction in this wild attempt the gods are just and though unseen to men they work our good from ill they will i trust confound the tyrant in his own devices and make his purposed crime his punishment  trebonius they will great jove beholds him and will lance the bolt of vengeance at his guilty head  numitorius i yet have hope trebonius had he dared to use his lawless power he never had forged this poor device this tale of fancied slavery this crude unlikely fable of her birth virginius presence yet will save his child by mornings earliest dawn he will be here in him our hopes are centered he alone can stem the torrent of this tyrants passion who trembles at his interest in the camp  trebonius his coward fears i hope are ominous by brave plebeian honest deeds virginius has gained the soldiers love nor will they see however their spirits droop a vetran wronged i left them ripe for every noble purpose long these decemvirs have been hateful to them to this alone is owing our defeats they rather choose to fall beneath the sword than fight for tyranny  numitorius o my trebonius my swelling bosom heaves with rage indignant to see the freeborn sons of mighty rome sunk by their folly low as basest slaves  trebonius perish the tyrants let us hurl this appius down from his black tribunal and again declare for liberty each roman arm will grasp a sword for us  numitorius thou generous man  trebonius this deed is big with fate romes mighty genius though now it slumbers will by this arrousd rush like a whirlwind on these cursed decemvirs and bear down all before it i will go and try to wake the godlike soul of freedom in the deluded people thou tomorrow with brave virginius meet me at the temple of righteous themis soon as he arrives  scene viii virginia icilia virginia welcome icilia thou most loved of friends let us embrace whilst yet i am a roman tomorrows fatal dawn may give me up the slave of claudius when we meet again it will perhaps be infamy to clasp me  icilia o my virginia  but i cannot speak  resentment rage and indignation rise and stop my utterance  art thou not a roman by awful heaven when rome was free and glorious ever these decemvirs fixed their lawless yoke thy virtue might have been her noblest boast  virginia alas icilia we have once been happy but shall no more can thou forget the hours of peace and innocence we past together  icilia o no virginia all the dear delights of growing friendship rush on my remembrance when dawning reason first began to shoot each early hope confect this pleasing end my bosom panted for a counterpart some fellow mind to soften every pang and double joy by sweet participation amongst the soft companions of my youth i sought a friend virginia dear virginia possessed alone of all our roman maids a soul susceptive of the social glow dull was each sport each pastime lost its taste if ever i mist virginia from the train the gentle train that shared our harmless joys  virginia yes our first days were happy smiling youth came on attended by surrounding pleasures but joy to me has been a prodigal who with too lavish hand dispensed her bounties and left my riper days a prey to sorrow  icilia cast back thy thoughts a moment my virginia to those calm joys which blessed our heedless youth how have we sat beneath embowring shades whilst the clear stream in silence glided by and lost in sweet romantic pleasure chid the dancing hours that fled too fast away all then was peace and harmony  virginia no more forbear to wake these tender images remembrance pains me i must now forget all vanished happiness and fill my soul with horrors equal to my dreadful fate i know the tyrants power i know his passion and am resolved   icilia what meanst thou  virginia to be free to die icilia think thou i would live a prey to infamy the slave of claudius  icilia no my virginia nor will appius dare to sentence thee a slave even midst his guard of riotous patrician youth he trembles and fears the soldiers vengeance well he knows the rank virginius holds in their affections  virginia alas icilia had thou seen his looks the looks of mingled passion and revenge with which his fiery eyes even now surveyed me thou would have trembled for me much i fear my only hope of refuge is the grave  icilia where is my brother cannot he protect thee he is the peoples darling and may rouse them to liberty and vengeance  virginia o icilia thou have awaked the pang that tears my heart there i am weak indeed to die is nothing but o i cannot leave my loved icilius our spring of love gaybloomd and promised fruit of chaste connubial bliss when like a blight this ruffian came and withered all our hopes thou dearest of mankind let these tears witness the strong the fond affection of my soul  icilia the gods are friends to virtue my virginia let us when morn first paints the ruddy skies summon a train of roman maids and haste to great dianas shrine there kneel and weep and supplicate the goddess aid to save thee  virginia yes i will go immortal maid attend thou virgin goddess to the chaste a friend if ever my voice amid the tuneful choir in sounds responsive to the breathing lyre has pleased thine ear o take me to thy care regard my tears and grant my ardent prayer if i must die my spotless honor save and let me sink unsullied to the grave  act second scene i  the house of appius appius claudius appius o claudius what a whirlwind tears my soul in what keen tortures did i pass the night tossed by desire revenge and indignation in vain my voice invoked the downy god the lenient power regarded not my prayer by fierce contending passions banished from me long ever the dawn i left my restless couch to seek thy healing counsel  claudius noble appius suspend this heat a while and lend an ear to what my faithful spies have learnt abroad this day must fix you lord of rome for ever or give the sway to tribunician hands can you with tameness yield the reins of power of power the noblest attribute of jove to proud icilius  appius curses on the slave what do thou mean my claudius  claudius whilst you sit supine with folded arms a sighing lover your haughty rival gains the giddy people horatius and valerius too have joined the abject rebel multitude forgetful meanly forgetful of their noble birth  appius horatius and valerius i remember the insolence with which they crossed my will late in the senate when i called the fathers to aid me in the levies for the war  claudius the people worship them the youths can talk and make harangues on ancient roman virtue  appius on virtue what is virtue but a name invented by the wise to shackle fools no it is ambition fires them they would raise themselves upon my ruins it is for this they court the multitude by arts like these by feigned humility and shows of virtue i gained the power which soon shall make them tremble they both shall die this day icilius too and numitorius all shall glut my vengeance a chosen band of noble youths shall wait and intercept their passage from the forum  claudius if fortune smiles ever the revolving sun again shall gild the capitol i hope to see you crowned and hail you king of rome  appius o claudius it is to that my soul aspires but it is not ripe i must delay my purpose fabius commands a camp of hardy veterans it is true he yet implicitly obeys me but it is to share my power and were i once to aim at royalty his roused ambition would thwart my will i must secure him first perhaps some lucky chance may do my work would but the coward troops engage the foe some friendly sabine sword might reach his heart if not petilius has my private orders to take him off by poison  claudius would twere done but can you trust petilius  appius with my life his birth illsuited to his desperate fortunes first turned my eyes upon him and i found him even all i wished my powerful interest raised him to the decemvirate and well he knows his fall with mine involved but let this rest a dearer care now takes up all my soul the bright virginia  ha what sound is that claudius goes to the door and returns claudius one with dispatches from the camp of fabius attends your sacred will  appius conduct him in  scene ii appius claudius messenger appius what from my valiant friend your brave commander the noble fabius  messenger these dispatches sir he begs you will peruse and instant answer  appius it is well attend without reads scene iii appius claudius appius come hither claudius predition on their coward souls the legions who basely fled before the seeble sabines have dared to brave their leaders fabius writes that when at my command the traitor siccius was by a band of tried and faithful soldiers in private taken off the rebel troops no longer owned their generals but assembling in mutinous consult disclaimed obedience and scarce were held from marching strait to rome this tumult is illtimed and i could wish his death had been deferred but it is no matter my power is fixed nor fears their feeble efforts  claudius who is their leader  appius labeo the centurion fabius is much too mild the bloody axe must stop this headlong torrent of sedition their leader shall be scourged and then beheaded the rest by decimation learn their duty this will not brook delay prepare my tablets exeunt scene iv  the house of virginius numitorius icilius icilius where is virginia let me once behold her whilst yet she is my own whilst she is free and i without a blush may own my passion  numitorius she seeks the help of heaven by pious prayer and much i fear it is heaven alone can save her  icilius yes numitorius while we loitering stand and hope for miracles it is heaven alone that must preserve us all but did we dare to draw the sword and pierce the tyrants heart we better should deserve the care of heaven  numitorius patience young man  icilius patience immortal gods does it become the haughty roman virtue famed for swift vengeance and of wrongs impatient calmly to stand and see our wives and children dragged to pollution by these homebred tyrants o rome thou queen of nations shall a son a private citizen by thee entrusted with delegated power thus lord it over us give us our tarquins gods if we must stoop if we must bend beneath the rod of power let not an equal fix our galling chains  numitorius you are too warm icilius  icilius how too warm is she not mine heavens are we not betrothed o my virginia may i be a slave doomed still to bear the yoke of tyranny to crouch beneath the lash if i not save thee from this inhuman monster i will go and find him out this moment  numitorius stay icilius your rash revenge would ruin all our hopes virginius will be here upon the instant and when he comes appius must drop a claim he cannot then support virginia begs by me she begs you will restrain this heat till safer times  icilius what do thou mean by safety can we be safe but by the tyrants death was it for this our tribunes were abolished for this our mighty bulwark of defense the sacred freedom of appeal removed o rome misguided people but no more i will be calm i will await his sentence with all the tameness of a slave but mark me if he withdraws not this most impious claim my sword shall find his heart  numitorius it will be just and heaven will then approve your righteous vengeance  icilius gods it is too much are then our pleasing hopes of virtuous happiness untimely blasted the dear the long expected hour approached to join our hands for ever when this monster stepped in between and dashed our expectations but i will save her yes my loved virginia this arm shall stab the tyrant and preserve thee  numitorius fear not icilius piety like hers is heavens peculiar care nor will the people bear with a deed like this perhaps this appius is but an instrument of jove to raise us from our lethargic state to arm our hands with all the rage of vengeance and restore the golden days of liberty and peace  icilius be all thy hopes prophetic numitorius and sure the soul of rome is lost indeed if we can bear with an attempt like this i will not think we are so vilely sunk it cannot be   numitorius see where trebonius comes his hasty step and unexpected presence since we agreed to meet in themis temple bespeak some new event  scene v numitorius icilius trebonius trebonius where is virginius is he not yet arrived the minutes call o were he here rome might again be free revenge and fury burn in every breast and if he comes the lawless tyrant falls  numitorius he will be here each moment i expect him  trebonius then tremble appius on thy proud tribunal each accident concurs to rouse the people this moment from fidenae is arrived a soldier who relates that valiant siccius is murdered by the cursed decemvirs there by fabius and the rest who copy appius and emulate his blackest deeds the camp is all in tumult  icilius then the gods are just revenge and glorious freedom are our own  trebonius yes brave icilius once again the goddess shall spread her shielding arms round happy rome my soul is all on fire o liberty at thy dear name my kindling spirit mounts and hope inspires my breast again i see romes awful consuls the delivered senate and thy best guard the tribunate restored again the roman eagle spreads his wings over conquered lands and the fierce sabine stoops no more the languid soldier drooping sits but waked to valor rushes on the foe resistless in his course  numitorius o jove alljust let thy strong arm overtake these sons of rapine and level them with earth  trebonius it wakes my wonder that fabius once the fairest son of fame beloved of rome should join this league of tyrants that he whose courage often had saved his country who stood the foremost in her dear esteem should choose to sink so low as appius slave  numitorius alas trebonius valor is a crime if not allied to virtue liberty must guide the righteous sword or war is murder though fame may follow and the thoughtless people applaud yet bravest deeds deserve our hate deserve our scorn if prompted by ambition  trebonius i though it this fabius just as well as brave i though it him zealous for his countrys good but tyranny like virtue sleeping lies till waked by opportunity to action  numitorius is this the man who saved by mighty jove escaped the slaughter of that bloody day when but himself the fabian race expired expired together fighting for their country what time their single force opposed the power the whole united strength of warlike veii  trebonius look down ye mighty spirits and behold the wretch who shames the noble fabian name and throws a shade around your blaze of glories degenerate man but true nobility is of the soul nor waits on empty titles  icilius why stand we here and waste the flying hours in idle contemplation vengeance calls it is now the time for action o trebonius the coming hour must give us up for ever the slaves of appius or secure our freedom exeunt scene vi a garden appius claudius appius o claudius it is in vain to hope for ease till full possession cures this fatal fondness each thought is full of this disdainful maid nor can ambitions active fire expel her even midst my schemes of meditated power her bright idea takes up half my soul and mingles with my golden dreams of empire  claudius why will you thus disturb your soul with cares so needless and so vain she must be yours seditions brawling voice which yesterday dared to oppose your will shall sink in silence and blooming beauty crown your warm desires  appius why did my coward soul consent to yield her virginius may return  claudius think not of him i trust he is ever this secured in chains my bondsman tyro who conveyed your orders is faithful diligent and more to urge his swift dispatch i promised liberty should crown his honest duty if successful  appius it is well i thank thy care was it not hard to have her torn from my fierce rising wishes just when bright hope had given the rein to passion and fancy painted all the melting joys in her dear yielding arms o potent venus give me to feast on her luxurious sweetness to press her panting beauties to my breast and to thy genial power shall rise a temple in all the proud magnificence of greece  claudius trust me the approaching hour shall see her yours this specious tale my fervent zeal inspired shall give the peevish virgin to your arms spite of icilius or the murmuring people  appius o claudius with what dignity she moves what magic dwells in that enchanting form the pride of birth the beauteous pomp of power look vile before her not the rosy dawn nor vernal flowers can boast a bloom like hers my haughty soul unused to bend yet stoops to such amazing beauty nor remembers the low plebeian stock from whence she sprung i swear that did not conscious shame forbid i would repeal my law divorce sempronia and wed this virgin  claudius gods what do i hear could appius then the great the highborn appius descended from a line of matchless heroes who reigns in rome with more despotic sway than ever the royal tarquins dared assert without a blush call base virginius father besides you had forgot icilius claim the glorious rival of your love  appius the slave i had forgot indeed and thou do well to wake my keen disdain my furious passion had hurried me to what i blush to think of to marriage with this maid but for thy counsel  claudius to marriage with her yes you do forget or love disturbs your reason has she not to you avowed her passion for icilius can you so soon forget her haughty answer is she not his to him betrothed long since by strictest vows and stronger love engaged to him to the plebeian slave she destines those matchless charms which like the grecian helens might set the monarchs of the world in arms for shame shake off this mean this abject love and be yourself shall appius poorly sigh and waste the important hours of doubtful empire in whining boyish wishes for a woman and one within his power  appius forgive my weakness her scorn distracts my soul but i deserve it why should i ask for what i can command  claudius why ask indeed remember romulus to what is rome indebted for it is greatness the sabine rape   appius thou do instruct me well i will seize her snatch her from the slave she doats on and force the joys her foolish heart denies me so darting swift the imperial bird of jove in his strong talons grasps the trembling dove in vain she would resist her feeble cry he hears regardless and with conscious joy he bears the struggling panting prize on high  act third scene i  the house of virginius virginius what can this mean in every face i meet sits pale despair the people gazed upon me with looks or i mistake of grief and horror still as i past each eye was fixed on me dread silence reigns around over all my house no sound is heard my slaves who used to fly with duteous joy to welcome my return avoid me now my child too where is she sure she is well my brothers messenger charged me to haste to rome that business called me of more import than life and that a moment might wreck my peace for ever o virginia thou art my nearest care but see my brother he will unfold this riddle  scene ii virginius numitorius numitorius my virginius you come in happy time to save us all  virginius how fares virginia  numitorius well but yet my brother   virginius why do thou pause let me but know the worst and i will try to bear it like a roman the gods can witness if my child is safe all other griefs are trifles  numitorius o virginius she yet is safe but a few posting hours may give her up to shame  virginius ha what to shame by all the gods of vengeance though i love her dearer than life if she has dared to sully the honor of her family this arm shall cut her off and send her to the grave icilius would not sure   numitorius o no my brother icilius is a roman and a brave one his honest heart disdains a thought of baseness but the fell tyrant appius   virginius appius she cannot sure be so degenerate as to prefer the tyrant of her country to brave icilius but my sword shall find her  numitorius you still mistake me still is your virginia the boast of roman maids her sexs pride a moments patience and i will unfold a tale shall rouse each drop of roman blood and set you in a flame know then virginius the fierce decemvir has with eyes of love beheld your beauteous daughter and since all his arts of vice have failed to move her virtue has urged his base abandoned freedman claudius to claim her for his slave  virginius his slave what mean you am i not then a roman  numitorius he pretends the virtuous numitoria bought this maid whilst yet an infant of a female slave in claudius family with slow reluctance awed by the murmuring people he consented that till this morn his sentence should be stayed even on the instant i dispatched fabatus to bring you from the camp but lest your rage should force the story from you i enjoined him not to relate the cause for much i feared his brother tyrants might detain you there and all our hopes are now in your appearance  virginius avenging jove let thy red lightening blast the servile arm that lifts a sword for appius let them come the foes of rome i shall with joy behold them what can they more than drag our freeborn virgins to bonds and violation see this breast scarrd over with honest wounds in romes defense and think of my reward my ages darling the lovely image of my numitoria forced from my arms to sat the brutal rage of a loose tyrants passion but he dares not he dares not urge so far the roman spirit that waits but for a deed like this to rise in all the dreadful majesty of vengeance and crush him at a blow  numitorius there lies my hope he fears the soldiery and well he knows how much thou art beloved  virginius o numitorius is it for this the hardy soldier meets the summers heat and winters piercing cold is it for this he sleeps in open air nor fears the fiery bolts of angry jove that whilst his stubborn toils preserve his country luxurious slaves by him from danger guarded shall poison all his dear domestic peace the price and best reward of fighting fields and drag his children to pollution gods pour down your keenest vengeance on my head if ever i draw a sword for these decemvirs  numitorius no my virginius for the time approaches which may employ your sword to better purpose the dawn of freedom breaks once more on rome this base attempt has roused the languid people even now they call aloud for liberty and urge the restoration of their tribunes  virginius why do we loiter then let us prevent his lawless sentence and attack him now  numitorius the enterprise is just but full of danger he now is guarded by a well armed train of rash patrician youth nor are the people prepared for sudden action let him pass his wild decree i trust he will acquit her oerawd by you but should i judge amiss both gods and men will then assist your vengeance  virginius your counsel shall prevail but should he doom my dearest child a slave i will preserve her even at my lifes expense appius or i must see the sun no more but say my brother are all the senate awed by this proud tyrant or do they meanly join in his oppressions and share the spoils of their unhappy country two and two only of patrician rank espouse the glorious cause of liberty foes to all interests but their bleeding countrys the rest gained over by appius aid his rapines or in the country seek to shun his power his noble uncle publius claudius long essayed to bend his haughty soul to virtue but finding all his counsels vain retired and at regillum shuns the killing sight of rome enslaved and the severe reflection that from the claudian house her tyrant sprung  virginius and who my numitorius are the pair the noble pair that join the cause of honor  numitorius valerius and horatius  virginius generous youths their very names inspire me tremble appius their sires expelled the tarquins  numitorius yes virginius and
