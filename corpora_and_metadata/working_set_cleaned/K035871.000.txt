the case of dissenters as affected by the late bill etc  the case of dissenters as affected by the late bill proposed in parliament for preventing occasional conformity  by a gentleman  london printed and sold by a baldwin near the oxfordarms in warwick lane   0   the case of dissenters etc the spaniards use to glory in the wide extent and pure catholicism of their dominion the italians from a pretension of superior politeness and sagacity contemn all tramontanes the modern french make to themselves a daily triumph of the successes of their grand monarch why may not my countrymen as well exult that the laws by which we are governed are no other than such as our selves by a due representative have chosen oh happy england may thy people esteem as it deserves a benefit so singular may that noble representative of thine called to be guardians of this blessing never want foresight to discover and prudence to prevent the dangers which may arise to threaten it  the ordinary method with us is well known to be that the addition of new laws or amendment of old ones are proposed first by the commons of england and immediately public notice given when the same are to come under a solemn debate which being several times adjourned there arises opportunity sufficient for the subjects from all parts of the kingdom to communicate to the respective members of parliament their opinion severally thereupon so that in this respect seldom any thing of importance is concluded concerning the good people of england without their own tacit consent at least over and above the benefit of their being represented in common such being then the case we cannot celebrate enough our happiness we may basely overlook but once to lose it would be misery to us beyond expression  it is frequent moreover for our laws to be made temporary first till the experiment of a few years has recommended them for perpetual as for those of the highest concern when the benefits or effects are liable to doubt we have seen some bills undergo the scrutiny of several succeeding sessions of parliament before they passed the signature of authority sometimes also our courts of legislature when the inducements and reasons of a bill were not obvious to common eyes or at least liable to misconstruction have thought good to lay the same before the public that their tender regards of general emolument might the better appear  having observed various methods of our propitious legislature an instance of several of them but more especially the latter we are here to consider i mean the late bill for preventing occasional conformity which was so differently apprehended in the last session of parliament as no debates during it were able to reconcile but that matter is of such concern that the proceedings thereupon being printed by authority it seems not unworthy every true lover of his country to put the same into the best light possible in order to frame a right judgment how a bill like unto that if at any time hereafter such should be proposed may affect the commonweal seeing the opinion which shall prevail thereof there can be no doubt will be duly weighed by our representees and because one intention of our lawgivers in publishing the account of their proceedings upon that bill might be not improbably the better to collect the common judgment on it a desire to be assistant unto that with a concern lest unhappy animosities should grow among us did engage me to draw into a clear and familiar method of discourse what is very obvious touching that matter  the bill which is the designed theme of what follows i understand such as it passed last session the house of commons with the several amendments agreed afterward touching which that my argument may be the more distinct i take the liberty to digest it under three heads which are easily discernable on reading the said bill viz the preamble extent and penalties due reference being had thereto however these few things ought to be premised first that the whole of it is prudential and political not censuring directly the persons and cause of the dissenters beyond the point of bearing offices nor interdicting any to be present at their assemblies except such as are engaged in the magistracy or places of trust thereby leaving the matter of conscience as it stood before secondly the communion of the lords supper is considered herein as a discrimination merely civil so that though papists and protestant dissenters are excluded from offices thereby yet is there no provision by the law to render the same a bar to the profane and scandalous which is a consideration seems to concern the honor of the church of england as well as the good administration of the several trusts to which it initiates but because thirdly several cases in religion might be reducible under the subject of this bill i shall comply with the obvious intention of our lawgivers and confine my discourse as much as may be to a secular vein to proceed therefore to the bill  first touching the preamble of it it were not easy peradventure in so few words for our supreme governors to have given more satisfaction to scrupulous consciences than in the religious declaration that serves as an introduction here because therein the sense of the present government appears that those severities under which the dissenters groaned before the late act of indulgence were then to be deemed persecution for conscience sake under which acceptance it is that their exemption from them for the future unless new matter of secular offense to the government arises is to stand upon foundations no less safe than the profession of the christian religion and particularly the doctrine of the church of england this is the highest attestation can be that the dissenters are no longer to be looked upon obnoxious to the church and state or chargeable with schism sedition and rebellion as the former laws ow suspended did insist they were so that the reason given by those laws ceasing and since it is on all hands agreed great advantages have accrued from the act of indulgence they may henceforth expect with the rest of their fellow subjects to partake the serenity and benignity of a government which in all other things ever was and now is the most clement under the sun thus is the bond of engaging goodness laid upon them for ever so that as since the late glorious revolution they are found equally affectionate as others to the interests and settlement of the crown all the former stigmatizing brands upon them are done away  as to the recital of the present state of law which follows the religious declaration that it provides already every person admitted into any office should be conformable to the church the words of it cannot be taken in the strictest sense there being many offices and employments to which persons have been and may be now admitted without lying under an obligation to receive the sacrament or be conformable on that account for instance offices of inheritance and in the forests noncommission offices in the fleet with many more therefore what is asserted in this paragraph in the general we must understand to relate to such persons and offices only as are subsequently mentioned in the bill but if those who break the intention of a law break the law it were fit and desirable that no words if possible might be used in any which in the sequel may lead men into mistakes touching that intention  the last clause of the preamble gives a very just description of the case which the bill is designed to bring a remedy for that is to say no man ordinarily frequenting private meetings should qualify himself for an office by receiving only on that account the sacrament with the church now that nothing however be understood beyond the natural sense of the words thereof i take these two things not to be absolutely concluded in them first that whilst conforming only for a place has a brand of scandal affixed on it yet it does not follow that occasional conformity otherwise without such design ought to be reproached for as to such persons who join themselves to their christian societies severally as taking the conduct of them to be most agreeable to the word of god and because it pleases the sovereign spirit of grace to cooperate more evidently upon them therein for such to go sometimes to a divine service different from what they frequent and choose is an expression of charity to others and ought not therefore to be blamed secondly it can no ways be taken for concluded that a censure upon the conformity in this bill mentioned does imply going to a meeting to be malum in se or savouring of faction or criminal illegal and schismatical as the superceded laws did constantly assert for the mention of it as allowed by law does demonstrate the contrary the manifest and primary purpose of this bill being rather to keep dissenters from the church than others from a meeting however the mutual freedom in this point to the great glory of our times savours of that charitable moderation so remarkably eminent in the primitive ages of christianity as to occasion those universal laws in the creed for every one to believe the holy catholic church and the communion of saints  secondly the enacting part of this bill i term the extent of it because it describes both the crime and the offices thereby to be affected whereof distinctly first then for the crime the definition of it herein is the same with that in two several acts to prevent and suppress seditious conventicles and    and    car ii so that what was criminal by them to all persons becomes again so by this bill to those in office the qualification for offices by express terms of law required at present is in this respect no more than once previously to receive the sacrament with the church but the conformity which would be required herein is besides that never after once taking an office to be present at any conventicle or meeting under color or pretense of any exercise of religion in other manner than according to the liturgy and practice of the church of england where five more than the family shall be this is a sort of qualification for offices widely different as any may see from what the law requires now and we must observe that throughout the bill such terms are only used as have been commonly appropriated to protestant dissenters however to be present at mass is tacitly included  we do not go about to intimate that the injunctions of the law at present to receive the sacrament according to the rites and usage of the church do not in the primary meaning of them imply that the persons ought to be of that communion however none can deny but they will very well bear a larger sense also whereby none ought to be excluded offices who can give a public testimony they esteem a communion with the church lawful which latter acceptance of the laws though the generality of dissenters stand excluded by it has all along for  0 years past brought into the service of the government without very visible ruinous effects no inconsiderable number of men whom the proposed bill in all appearance would finally render incapable  whether it may be for the public benefit any longer to suffer the same latitude in reference to dissenters belongs only to the supreme powers to judge but granting here that it were not we do with all humility offer to consideration whether gentler methods be not more agreeable to the english temper constitution of government nay and the interest of state so the end may be duly attained in the case then before us if the government for example should require from the established church instead of one previous communion which is all in the law expressed that men in office should attend four times yearly or oftener at the sacrament would it not be equal security to the state and greatly for the honor of the church but give no matter of offense or jealousy to dissenters whereas if the qualification for offices is to consist not so much in frequent and devout attendance on the public celebrations as in a distance and aversion to dissenters this cannot but minister just cause of fear that those assemblies at which once to be present exposes to so great a censure are not likely to continue long allowed by law  no man can doubt but a censure of this kind would prove a notorious mark of infamy upon the assemblies of dissenters and in that respect would affect them beyond the case of officers and the revived definition of a conventicle being under the pretense and color of the exercise of religion it deserves to be considered whether it might not be construed to allude to and imply somewhat of those dangerous practices the suspended laws have connected with the said definition but there are other obvious inconveniences in this new method of qualification for it would expose more a great deal than the present way as will be shown elsewhere to the predatory mercy of informers it debarrs the common natural respects of relations in baptisms funeral sermons and the like it casts a hazardous discouragement upon family prayer whereat often among persons of quality and sometimes others more than five may happen to be present and it brings all foreign churches under a censure too whereas the act of uniformity provides that the penalties thereof should not extend to any reformed churches of aliens allowed or to be allowed by his majesty or his successors some such have since had encouragement for their settlement from parliament and have proved beneficial in manufactures to this kingdom toward which their liberty of conscience without reflection has not a little contributed  the second distinction i have made of the extent or enacting part of this bill is of the offices intended by it to be affected which clearly falls under a twofold definition one the same with that in the act    car ii for preventing dangers which may happen from popish recusants the other of the    of car ii for well governing and regulating corporations now because this seems the most tender and sensible part of the bill most liable to mistake and upon the right apprehension whereof our judgment of the whole must very much depend before i descend into a disquisition of it i beg leave to deviate a little from the just method of discourse and therefore before i endeavor to prove what the bill under this head would have enacted  new i will first lay down and consider the reasons commonly alleged why the same ought to be  what is commonly alleged as the ground of the new provisions in this bill amounts to thus much that a national church being absolutely needful to a government the only effectual way to preserve it is by keeping the civil power in the hands of such whose practice and principles are agreeable thereto and that this is equally necessary to the safety and peace of the state likewise but say they the present laws proving too weak to secure those blessings because they are eluded by occasional conformity therefore there wants some new expedients to support them these maxims we can readily grant so far as the security and peace of the state appear undoubtedly concerned so much is allowed on all hands for incontestible but the matter in question before us seems to be whether occasional conformity of dissenters has really endangered the safety and violated the peace of church and state or has any principles in it disagreeable therewith which matter cannot yet be taken for concluded as the proceedings of parliament published do evince and whereof therefore the present juncture and occasion gives liberty to speak  in order to examine then this matter aright we think proper to distinguish the relation which the occasional conformity of dissenters may bear to the church and state severally first therefore in reference to the state occasional conformity it may be agreed to us is no new thing but even coaeval with the act of uniformity it self so that in  0 years experience if it were evident that injuries to the peace of the government had arose thence how came it to pass they should be overlookt so long but while several ways were taken to enjoin conformity how occasional soever it was in no kind before made penal to approve it though thereby offices were attained after such a large attestation from fact it would be needless to say occasional conformity of dissenters has in it self no principles dangerous to the peace of the government if there were not another sort of conformity which does obstinately maintain such as withdraw men from their allegiance to her gracious majesty and from all respect to the present establishment of the crown but as to principles further than is obvious from practice it is not my proper province to discourse that being already sufficiently treated of by divines  if the time past has not produced a necessity of any new provision against accidental or occasional conformity i think we may be confident the present much less does for if the laws already in being do intend that men in office should be entirely conformable her gracious majesty has assured all the world there can be no danger from occasional conformity in this auspicious reign by these words of her last speech to the parliament i shall always make it my particular care to encourage and maintain this church as by law established and every the least member of it in all their just rights and privileges and now having delivered my sentiment upon observations of the past and present time to go further would be to wade into the politics beyond my depth i can say nothing certain of futurity but since the dissenters are known beyond doubt to be very cordially affected to the protestant succession methinks whatever qualifications may be judged requisite for places of magistracy and public trust they may well expect beyond a provision for that no hardships will be laid upon them now    dly to consider occasional conformity in reference to the church it might suffice to say the affairs of it distinct from those of the state do no ways lie under the cognizance of such whom that may vest with government but for what properly concerns the honor and welfare of the church of england the first words of this bill do imply that her greatest glory consists in the character of moderation sweetness and charity truly christian and apostolic and very justly for this would recommend her to all the reformed churches of christendom as worthy to be acknowledged their chief and best in the reign of queen elizabeth all the papists in england came to church and were occasional conformists yet the government was not uneasy and in danger by it but the pope fearing what that was like soon to grow to put a stop to it by bull and the church of rome does generally to this day encourage every thing like to occasional conformity of protestants and the effects show they are in the right and gain their ends by it in like manner can it be thought that the church has gained from any sort of the dissenters among us as from those who have allowed and practiced an occasional conformity with her has she not by permitting it obtained many useful and worthy members does not the practice of it weaken the dissenters and increase her reputation and authority where then has been the damage to the church from occasional conformity it would be difficult to show what security honor or interest she have lost during the greatest indulgence to dissenters in the late reign of any thing she possessed before that time during the unspeakable sufferings of others therefore it must be an accession of honor and safety unto her that she is now by clemency become reverenced of those who formerly were suspected for her enemies  having thus made enquiry what reason there is to apprehend that the safety of the church and state has been or is endangered by the latitude allowed to dissenters from the present condition of the laws i proceed according to promise to enquire what alteration would arise on the head of offices from the bill now under consideration which i shall do in two denominations of them i mean those comprehended in the test act and those peculiarly affected by that for regulating corporations premising here only that the offices of the latter sort which do directly fall within the test i judge better to consider in that denomination because thereby what remains will be more distinct and intelligible when we handle it apart   st for the test clause which is the former in this part of the bill without reciting the words of it we may be allowed to say upon good authority that manifestly and indisputably it does comprehend all the considerable offices and employments of public trust in the kingdom in which the security of the government may be concerned the experience of  0 years past has justified the measures taken by that law that it is extensive enough as to the several sorts of offices for public security the terms of it are express clear and universally understood without any uncertainty as to what employments it relates which is not so evident in those of the corporation act the said act includes all offices of magistracy in especial as well within corporations as without and at the enacting of it there was little regard had to the act for regulating corporations because a more effectual security to the church was given hereby it cannot be taxed as insufficient to compass the end designed by it which was expressly to prevent dangers that might happen from popish recusants and to exclude from offices all others who will not take the sacrament according to the usage of the church established after this manner and in a due medium as would be easy in another sort of discourse to make appear the safety and peace of church and state have been fully provided for nor have the measures of it to procure those been any ways in particular the penalties found deficient  this act being so extensive and complete that it reaches whatever offices concern the safety of the government and is not deficient in any means to attain its end if dangers should from occasional conformity arise it were easy at any time to enjoin such frequency at the public offices of the church as might denominate an entire conformist without a brand upon separate assemblies to raise again the seeds of fatal animosities but as to the places of magistracy and public trust already comprehended in the test as they concern the security of state much more so they affect the body of dissenters much less than those in the corporations for which cause what is to be said in their behalf is more properly referred to that head it would also be very unbecoming any sort of men to enter into argument with their governors upon those high points which are so absolutely in the legislature to judge of and determine it is not fit for me so much as to offer an opinion an explanation of the test more to the disadvantage of dissenters might indeed deprive several of some profitable places in the royal household the exchequer the navy the excise the customs and elsewhere but the magistracy of the city would be the chief import of this matter concerning which what inconveniences have arose to the government from the course of things for near  0 years past there and how an alteration in it will any ways tend to the advantage of the state is equally to me undiscernable but this i do adventure to say that if men whom the negative qualification of this bill would have rendered incapable to serve in such offices should have been finable nevertheless for not serving them and that toties quoties as the humor of the world might lead that sort of persecution might possibly rise pretty high    dly it remains to examine what the proposed bill would have introduced de novo upon the head of the corporation act distinctly the clause whereof expressive of the offices it would affect is in these words any mayor alderman recorder bailiff town clerk commoncouncilman or other person bearing any office of magistracy or places or trusts or other employment relating to or concerning the government of the respective cities corporations boroughs cinque ports and their members and other porttowns as to so much hereof as concerns magistracy the test act having better provided my discourse is to be henceforth restrained to what herein touches only the intrinsic and inferior employments relating to the several boroughs respectively wherein the security of the church and state does not seem to be much concerned  most of our laws have sprung from the evident necessities of the times and so came in as remedies to the proper distempers of them which is in none more apparent than this of the corporations the    car ii those deplorable confusions which had tormented the nation for nigh  0 years preceding lay fresh upon the minds of the parliament when that act was made and it is evident that nothing but so extraordinary a juncture could have excused some parts of it nay it was principally founded upon reasons so peculiar to that time they are sar from being pertinent to ours for there is now no solemn league and covenant needs to be renounced the declaration in it that it is not lawful upon any pretense whatsoever to take up arms against the king and of abhorrence of that traitorous position of doing so by his authority against his person or those commissioned by him  which was the touchstone of the said act and times is now utterly abrogated and no person henceforth can be obliged to take the same as appears in the act primo w and m for appointing other oaths the oaths of supremacy and allegiance therein are also changed the power given by it to the crown to constitute commissioners for two years to turn out and put in the corporation officers ad libitum though they were conformable to the qualifications required by the act was an extravagance the present age would scarce approve the preamble speaks of it as a thing too well known that notwithstanding his majestys unparalleled goodness in pardoning what was past there were many evil spirits still working we do not therefore herein go about to censure the measures of that act as they were suited to the juncture but as the reasons the jealousies and foundations whereon that act was built were so appropriate to that time that the several parts of it here above mentioned as unsuitable to any other are since abolished it is pretty clear that the primary intent thereof had its full and due effect from the commissioners power and the imposition of renouncing the covenant and declaration of fidelity for there was little regard had to it at the time that a more effectual security to the church was provided by the test  we come therefore to consider in the next place what remains yet unrazed of that act in    car ii for well governing and regulating corporations and then will clearly be discerned what the proposed bill would have superadded touching the offices of magistracy the test act has much better and effectually provided which has been already considered and therefore as to what is distinctly under my present head of discourse to be treated of there remains in substance of the corporation act yet in force no more than this that no man shall be placed elected or chosen in or to any offices or places or trusts or other employment relating to or concerning the government of the respective boroughs etc who has not within one year before such election taken the sacrament according to the rites of the church of england in default whereof every such election is thereby declared to be void this being the full import of the said act at present it is upon that foot a measure must be taken what and how much the intended bill would have enacted new upon this head it cannot be amiss here to observe that the corporation act was the first after the restoration which directly affected the dissenters as such  now in corporations there are many offices of a private and inferior nature  which cannot be fully specified because they are so various in the respective boroughs whereon the safety of the state does not appear manifestly to depend but regard only the affairs of the particular town within it self some of these are freeholds and many of them the whole subsistence of families which have been obtained by purchase or long services or attained by custom of course several of these the dissenters are now possessed of and perhaps have enjoyed many years under an obedience to all such terms as the law now in being has prescribed and to dispoil men of their freeholds and possessions by a new law without imputation of any crime and when the security of the government does not appear manifestly concerned is sure among english alen very hard  that the dissenters at this day are not disaffected to the queen and established government nor chargeable with rebellion past nor meditating new troubles or any ways dangerous to the state under which characters the corporationact considered them the preamble of this very bill now in debate does intimate for it asserts that the act in the first year of the reign of the late king william and queen mary of everglorious memory entitled an act for exempting their majestys protestant subjects dissenting from the church of england from the penalties of certain laws was in due consideration that persecution for conscience only was contrary to the profession of the christian religion and doctrine of the church of england  if then the dissenters under an obedience to all such terms as the law now in being has prescribed do possess many inferior offices in corporations which the present bill when passed into an act would immediately seclude from besides those in the magistracy the navy the customs the excise the royal household and others which under the head of the testact it would also deprive them of then sure enough it takes from the dissenters what they enjoyed before by law and is not this to enact something new moreover the dissenters at any time upon the present terms of conforming are now admittable to any office of what quality soever in the kingdom but by this bill they would have a total incapacity put upon them in respect to those under the test and corporation acts abovementioned which incapacity after the first offense would extend to offices of inheritance and in the forests non commission offices in the fleet and many more such as neither the test or corporationacts or any other ever did or intended to exclude them from  it has been already insisted that all the offices wherein the safety of church and state are manifestly concerned are comprehended within the test and that the inferior offices in the boroughs do not come under the same considerations to have therefore the same reasons of state urged for an equal animadversion upon the latter seems very unequal for it brings great difficulty on the commercial sort of men to argue on those topics while they plead for no more than quiet cohabiation with their neighbors but if it be argued that those poor emolumens in the boroughs which the safety of the government might doubtless well enough indulge them came within the intent at least of the corporationact to deny to the dissenters how should they judge of it but very severe to have that act so explained and enforced to their disadvantage that it should take place more in the reign of her gracious majesty than it has done in any time preceding  in this case the dissenters do humbly apologize for themselves as it imports them that granting whatever was designed by this bill was the intent then of the corporationact they do not now stand in the same place the last age did at the passing thereof the present generation it cannot be pretended have brought upon the church and state confusions ruin and desolation they have no ways disturbed the peace of either but have by testimonies incontestible showed that neither their principles or practice are inconsistent with monarchy but contrariwise most conformable to the present government and settlement of the crown nor are there any evil spirits working of rebellion among them if therefore the intent of the corporationact was built upon reasons peculiar to that time they do entirely submit it to consideration whether a pursuing of the same intent now and giving by the negative qualification and penalties of this bill an extent and force to it which in the institution or fince it never had before without any like cause on their part would not be in the nature of punishing the innocent for the sake of the guilty which they do not doubt will be far from so wise just and good a government but the proposed bill they conceive upon the head only of the corporationact would have brought upon them the extraordinary hardships and difficulties here following    st the qualification for offices being made to consist in the utmost distance and aversion unto them will be a brand of ignominy and reproach upon the whole body of dissenters so that an emulation in casting injuries and contempt upon them may in a little time be thought the best recommendation and nearest way to preferment is it just therefore that the whole body should suffer for the sake comparatively of a very few who have occasionally conformed    dly reviving the acts against seditious conventicles in part and giving a new force to that of the corporations they fear will give too much occasion to men of violent tempers to declaim that they lie still under the same odious imputations of disloyalty charged upon them by those acts as if they gave really any manner of jealousy to the state now which clamor however causeless when it shall be industriously vented would be in it self a very heavy affliction    dly the freeholds and offices of an inferior nature in  00 towns of england or thereabouts which have been obtained by purchase or long services or in course some of them the whole subsistence of families and of long time possessed under an obedience to all the terms prescribed by law would not only be immediately lost to the possessors but an incapacity would lie upon all dissenters for the future of attaining the like and after the first offense any other offices in the kingdom whatsoever but they hope the crime charged upon some few of them is not of so detestable a nature that they ought all to be reduced to so unhappy a condition for it    thly in many corporations the election of members to serve in parliament is only in such as are concerned in the government of them and giving a vote for a representative in parliament is the essential privilege whereby every englishman preserves his property and whatsoever deprives him of a capacity for having such vote deprives him of his birthright the magistracy of corporations which by the testact now takes place is one thing but the offices affected by the new bill would be quite another    thly there have been for several towns and cities acts passed of late years for setting the poor on work therein and punishing vagrants besides the former ancient hospitals touching which the dissenters are likely by this bill to have been excluded the appearing usefully in their places which is a mark of dishonor on them as well as discouragement to charitable intentions   thly to leave protestant dissenters subject to fines and penalties if they do not accept offices  toties quoties and at the same time if they do accept to restrain them upon the severe penalties of this bill from doing what their conscience obliges to whether this would not  against the intent of the bill be persecution for conscience sake all good men might be left to judge but they only would feel and every borough in england at discretion be left to proportion the degree    thly the dissenters have reason to fear innumerable injuries and oppressions besides these mentioned would be their lot in all municipal rates freedoms duties privileges services parishoffices and every sort of intercourse with their townsmen and neighbors when upon complaint of any such injuries those fellowcitizens who only have power to do them justice are like to suffer in their own reputations interests and employments for so doing as favorers of the phanatical excluded party  these considerations of their suffering though they appear evident and unavoidable are with all candor and resignation referred to the judgment of others but the dissenters must crave leave to add that they would be the more pungent and sensible upon persons not chargeable by the bill with any offense because without penal laws and their attendants with the clamorous insults of the profane and designing the very dissenting from the public is in it self as to earthly things many ways a misfortune which nothing but unpretended conscience however mistaken would oblige them to  thirdly the penalties which are the last part of the bill shall be considered under three heads   st what sutableness there is in them to the act of indulgence   dly what proportion between the protestant dissenters and popish   dly what danger from thence to the innocent    st for the sutableness there is in these penalties to the act of indulgence it may sure be granted that the good effects of liberty to tender consciences are everywhere visible that the foregoing bitterness and animosities are much calmed the dissenters brought to a temper of respect and more candor toward the church and the church satisfied by sufficient experience that the freedom of others does not lessen her security and reputation thus is our sion at unity within her self and the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace according to the prayer of our church preserved one cannot therefore lay to heart the peace of our jerusalem without some concern lest the severities of this bill should contribute to disturb it for besides that it would dispossess immediately persons legally vested with places and affect many offices which no law did before and many ways be injurious in the boroughs and leave men to occasional persecution for conscience sake and be a brand upon all the assemblies of dissenters as already has been instanced there are in it some further peculiarities of punishment  before the act of indulgence while conventicles were illegal and criminal assemblies even then a man in office who was present at them was only liable to a fine of ten pounds whereas by this bill he is liable to a fine of  00 l and   l per diem for three months besides loss of his place the sum you see may amount to   0 l which is more than would need to beggar some thousands of corporation and other officers in england whould be liable to it and the more in danger because the whole sum goes to the informer which is good booty for that sort of privateers and the rather when a conviction on this bill would not be so difficult as in most other cases  the dissenters during the worst of their prosecutions heretofore upon a visible conformity without renunciation or declared abhorrence of their former practice were at any time capable of places of profit and trust but this bill draws over all their heads a dismal cloud of incapacity none will deny but a total incapacity to serve his prince and country is a mark of high infamy so that next to the loss of life it seems the heaviest punishment and in the several towns corporate of england which may probably be   or  00 to be rendered by law incapable of ever acquiring the support of any of those little places which appertain to them besides those of profit under the head of the testact and those many more upon conviction which no law yet has ever affected is altogether if considered a very unhapyy condition but after the immediate forfeiture of all the several offices now legally possessed by the dissenters upon the passing of this bill then a person might still go to a meeting without breach of any law as long as the toleration continues and one would think such a man were bonus and legalis homo and capable of the privileges of a reeborn subject and at liberty to provide for his family and maintenance but to impose a severe censure on any action allowed by law seems very unreasonable however that be there would remain upon all and every man of the dissenters an incapacity not only as above but after the first offense for any office or employment whatsoever within the kingdom in which regard this bill would extend to offices of inheritance and in the forests noncommission offices in the fleet with many more which neither the test or corporationacts or any other ever could affect or ever intended so to do  as to the shame and incapacity of one convicted upon this bill that is to say before he ever again could enter by grant or election into any office or employment within the kingdom of england he must at the next quarter sessions of the county where he resides or in one of her majestys courts at westminster in public and open court make oath in writing that within the year foregoing he has not once been present at any conventicle but has three times at the least received the sacrament at the church which oath is to be kept upon record this would not be so much worthy of consideration nor the aggravation of the sentence on a second offense as a relapse and apostasy if the value of the forfeiture and easiness of conviction did not put too much hazard on the innocent even after such purgation as well as before it    dly the proportion by the penalties of this bill between the protestant and papist is to be scanned by two ways first by examining whether they are equally liable to loss of offices and suffering the punishments  dly what difference there is otherwise for the first the test being more expressly contrived to eject all popish recusants and the complexion of the times since the grand revolution not favoring them every man will agree with me that the immediate loss to them upon passing this bill would be nothing they have no concern in the matter but on the other hand the dissenters  under the terms hitherto required by law do possess many offices as has been distinctly intimated the first loss to them thereupon would upon many accounts be very considerable now for the punishments sufferable by this bill the dissenters enjoying a liberty upon condition of open doors a conviction would at all times be more feasible upon them than the papists who are enforced to conceal their worship by other laws furthermore the nature of the protestant worship requires all their attendants at once whereas that of private masses need not engage above five besides the family in the same instant thus the papist would not be so exposed to the forfeitures fine and incapacity as the protestant  the difference otherwise between the popish and protestant dissenter is no more than this that whereas the testact did more expressly intend the papist and the protestant was but tacitly included the bill under consideration uses such terms only as have been appropriate to protestants and herein the papist is but tacitly included however he is equally reached by the intention and penalties hereof and thus the popish dissenter and protestant do stand upon a par but granting the papist is not liable to loss of benefit at all or to suffering the penalties like the protestant because conviction is more difficult upon him no man is made liable to suffer so much by any other law for assisting at the solemnest acts of that religion as he would by this bill for being present at a conventicle a popish convict receiving the sacrament of the church is immediately cleared no such shame of renuntiation no incapacity lies upon him a papist that shall relapse and fall under a second conviction is to be convicted over again without any aggravation of his censure but justice and good policy require there should be a proportion between the offense and punishment thus the laws of england have all along treated papists as the most inveterate restless and formidable enemies of the state because they depend upon a foreign power and are subject to it which is such a one as always was and ever will be employed to ruin us theresore there has constantly been a less degree of punishment in the laws upon the protestant dissenter than them this reason if i be not mistaken has a considerable accession of weight to it in our days the papists having refused since the late revolution their allegiance to the crown of england more than ever from the early days of the reformation  lastly let us consider what danger would arise from the penalties of this bill to the innocent for their safety seems the highest concern of all laws now for the administrations in public according to the liturgy of the church though for want of it before universitysermons or upon an omission of prayer for the royal family or upon contravening the practice of the church of england men would come within the letter of this bill which is a condition not wholly out of danger yet it is likely the obvious design of it being against dissenters would render a prosecution in those cases fruitless however family prayers differing from the liturgy at which should be present more than five accidentally above the household circumstances not uncommon would clearly come within reach and then the villainy of a couple of bad servants dismissed perhaps for ill practices would have sufficient encouragement but the greatest danger to the innocent arises from two things in this bill first from the value of the forfeiture which may amount to  00 l and is all given to the informers a temptation beyond what is commonly set before them by our laws or what the integrity of the age can well assure us against for a detestable sort of men there has been who for much less gains have done wrongfully to a great many and proved a very nuisance to the government several of whom were convicted of perjury about  0 years ago  dly the easiness of conviction is another subject of danger to the innocent for as the law in relation to offices now stands every man chooses his own witnesses to receiving of the sacrament whose attestation with that of the ministers and churchwardens being put upon record a man is almost beyond a possibility of suffering by a false accusation but in the bill before us it is not so safe for false witnesses may choose to assign such a time and place when they saw him at a meeting as they know the party least likely to disprove and the accused in that case has but a kind of negative proof to defend himself withal  as i have not presumed to draw into argument the disposal of offices wherein the safety of church and state did appear manifestly concerned so neither shall i once enter into the thoughts of those high affairs which might be any ways affected by this bill as whether the desirable union with scotland may not be embarassed thereby whether putting all foreign churches under a censure may weaken the good understanding which ought to be between england and her protestant allies whether this expedient bears due regard to the condition of like affairs among our nearest neighbors holland scotland and ireland or whether in time of so dubious a war especially since a pretender to our throne is set up by the enemy it be proper to do any thing which may raise heats and animosities among our selves these being matters cognizable only by the proper ministers of state or the high court of parliament and not fit for private persons to debate  as to the grand point of their loyalty and due allegiance which above all others the dissenters are concerned to vindicate themselves about her majestys loving subjects who being protestants and by the rights of nature english men lie under the unhappiness of dissenting in some smaller matters of religion from the established church are abundantly satisfied from the christianlike preamble of this bill and otherwise that in the sacred breast of her most excellent majesty and in those also of the highly honored lords and commons of england they stand fully acquitted from the vile and detestable imputation of any principles repugnant to the safety of this government the testimony of their own consciences does equally concur and their behavior shall as they hope it does demonstrate to all the world that none of their fellow subjects can be more devoted to the present rightful and lawful settlement of the crown were such imputations true they could never with any face complain of whatever hardships were put upon them but being in the case of the present government absolved before god and men they do always allow themselves to hope that during their consonant and uniform obedience no difficulties or distresses will be laid upon them and above all nothing which may look like a blemish upon their loyalty her most gracious majesty whom god long preserve has several times expressed her pious parental candor and compassion unto them who indeed without the severity of penal laws are for the sake of undissembled conscience daily under various temporal misfortunes and as from that disposition of her majestys they hold the benefits of the act of indulgence dear to them above all other earthly considerations none can more ardently and sincerely than they constantly do and will implore the choicest blessings of heaven upon her excellent majesty and all their governors  to dissent from the public they are sensible is always to be in the wrong but if instead of the few things scrupled wherein they are involuntarily so their union in the essential and more important points of religion with the church might find a due consideration they doubt not but all reproaches upon them of any hostile dispositions toward it would also be done away this is what next to an affectionate allegiance to the state they could desire most to vindicate to themselves the character of and which they have for many years by all means so endeavored that if the unfriendly passions of some men with the visible interest of the papists had not hindered the same would long ever this have crowned their wishes with an universal attestation to dissent touching matters civil and common from any society we are in i appeal to all men does it imply ill will to it why then should it be construed so in the case before us or if we please why not quite otherwise  the church of england is it not as a city which has an ambitious and powerful enemy in the field she has indeed other fortifications more near and proper but why may not the dissenters to her also be accounted as detached outworks and lines of defense had ever the common enemy a design immediate to execute upon this city but first his secret engines were wrought to breed misunderstanding between the town and her dependants then open attacks were made upon the separated forts and while many storms have fallen upon those their fidelity to the town has been the more approved but the city it self secure no persecutions could extort any petition from them for a toleration of popery but after a long and obstinate defense when those outward posts came to be abandoned and demolished did not the enemy soon get within the town the papists it is true when once possessed of their conquest to secure against the revolt of it though before by open force they had taken and levelled all those redoubts did then officiously erect them anew thinking to serve their interest of them but the dissenters glad of liberty indeed who can blame them no sooner discovered the enemys design then they adhered to their ancient mother and principal  the author hereof to obviate undue constructions thinks fit to declare he is not liable to the loss of any office by the foresaid bill nor has he reaped any personal advantage from the revolution or any ways from the government since but the true occasion of this discourse was not so much a respect to the dissenters as an accidental computation in himself of the flourishing estate of the reformed interest in europe in the commencement of the last century and of the dismal declension of it at the latter end which gave him occasion to reflect that in humane appearance the only defensible bulwark of it now must consist in the welfare of our government and an indissoluble union with holland upon which occasion considering that the indemnity of dissenters from penal laws was by the act of indulgence declared an effectual means to unite our protestant fellow subjects in interest and affection he could not but conclude that the imposing new penalties and sufferings would disunite them and what can look more fatal upon us than to see buried animosities flame out afresh who can tell but a breach when opened may beyond all our foresight grow in time so wide that the merciless usurpations of france and rome may enter at it  but as to our days the hope and wishes of our enemies shall be disappointed if we will listen to the direction which the pious and prudent authority over us has prescribed in appointing on the late solemn fast to obtain success in this war whereon the safety of the kingdom does wholly depend this prayer for our use and the god of mercy vouchsafe us a favorable answer to it give us grace o lord seriously to lay to heart the great dangers we are in by our unhappy divisions take away all hatred and prejudice and whatsoever else may hinder us from godly union and concord that as there is but one body and one spirit and one hope of our calling one lord one faith one baptism one god and father of us all so we may henceforth be all of one heart and of one soul united in one holy bond of truth and peace of faith and charity and may with one mind and one mouth glorify thee o god through christ jesus our lord amen  finis
