      observations upon mr potts general remarks on fractures etc  in three letters to a young surgeon intending to settle in the country  with a postscript concerning the cure of compound dislocations in which the usual method of treating wounds of the tendons and ligaments is briefly considered  i hope that i shall never hesitate to differ from any and every authority when i think that i have truth on my side and the good of mankind in my view pott by thomas kirkland surgeon  london printed for t becket and p a de hondt in the strand  mdcclxx   price eighteenpence   introduction to the students in surgery gentlemen i beg leave to lay before you the following letters which contain a short view of the improvements made in england in the cure of simple fractures within these last twenty years a dissuasive against speedy amputation except in some particular cases in compound fractures and some practical observations added to mr potts theory on dislocations though perhaps that letter which relates to the treatment of compound fractures and the postscript on compound dislocations may chiefly merit your attention  i have always heard of speedy amputation in such accidents with astonishment and concern especially in these days in which it is said surgery had made such great strides toward perfection and was glad to see that mr boucher see mem royal acad surg vol ii mem   and mr bilguer dissert on the inutility of the amputat of limbs had resolution enough to make a protest against this practice which appears to me most frequently precipitate and unnecessary though upon reading mr bilguers book i was sorry to observe that he had taken off from the weight of his arguments by indiscriminately and almost totally forbidding this operation  however what mr pott has now said about amputation in compound fractures seems to demand a further enquiry into this matter and the request of the young gentleman to whom these letters where written has drawn me to undertake a task which i should have been glad to have seen done by some other person for publicly dissenting from the opinion of men truly eminent in their profession is extremely disagreeable and yet it is absolutely necessary when there is sufficient ground to think what they have advanced may happen to prove injurious for whatever comes from such hands commonly makes deep impression upon the minds of those who have not had experience enough to judge for themselves nor can an ingenuous disquisition be displeasing to a generous mind  instead therefore of confining to private use what occurred to me while i was writing upon this subject i also offer it to your notice and if what i have asserted upon proper enquiry is found to be true it will i hope be thought a sufficient apology for this publication  lately published price   s a reply to mr maxwells answer to mr kirklands essay on fevers wherein the utility of the practice of suppressing them is further exemplified vindicated and enforced  by thomas kirkland surgeon  printed for t becket and co in the strand  of whom may be had mr maxwells answer price  s  d  observations etc letter i ashby feb        dear sir i take the first opportunity that business will permit of answering your letter dated the beginning of last month by informing you that i have read mr potts book upon fractures which contains many valuable directions and i know that putting the muscles as he advises in a state of relaxation both at the time of reduction and during the remainder of the cure will on many accounts be attended with great ease and great advantage to the patient  i imagine the rigid discipline of keeping fractured legs in a state of extension has not been so steadily adhered to since mr pugh treatise of midwifery p   0 in      proposed by the use of his splints to move the patient from his back to his side in order to give him relief in his situation and wherever this method was practiced the leg must frequently be laid on one side with the knee bent though probably often without being aware of all the advantages arising from this posture ever since the first of may      one osbourne of donnington on the heath at this time broke his thigh somewhere near leicester and was brought home several miles in a coal wagon over a very rough stony road by which means his thigh was violently shaken and it afterward swelled to an enormous size to reduce this swelling i applied a stale beer poultice and placed the muscles in a state of relaxation by laying the thigh on one side with the knee bent which answered my expectation for the patient soon became very easy and a complete cure followed with less trouble than i had ever before seen and left no room for me to doubt which was the best method of placing simple fractures of the thigh  i have constantly laid fractured thighs in the manner mr pott directs and believe it has been practiced by others to whom i pointed out the advantages of this situation in particular it seems impossible to make a good cure where the neck of the thigh bone is fractured without putting the limb in a state of flexion it must be observed that mr pugh recommended the placing the thigh in a state of flexion when fractured at the neck though he did not lay it on one side but in a box contrived for this purpose  but by this method i have seen this accident cured without lameness  the old method of violent extension to reduce fractured limbs i do believe has been long disused because quite unnecessary and evidently to every capacity injurious nor do i remember ever seeing it practiced the bones being always capable of being laid strait by gentle extension and mr gooch see page      ten years since recommended this kind of treatment in his cases and remarks in surgery  i imagine the limb in simple fractures has not frequently been disturbed after being properly placed except by those who use no other than liquid discutients we never unwrap or move it till it will bear moving unless great swelling has made the use of poultices necessary for by applying a cerate that without irritating is capable of attenuating the obstructed fluids and of preserving the vessels in a state of acting upon their contents we keep the part in a continual state of perspiration so that we have nothing to do but to see that the limb lies easy and is not displaced or where a moderate swelling has taken place before this application is used we gradually draw our bandage and splints a little tighter as the swelling subsides whereas those who use embrocations etc only are daily disturbing their bandage and after all neglect that principal point of preserving the natural elasticity of the fibers to which where the parts are neither much bruised nor swelled a proper degree of pressure by bandage may greatly contribute by not suffering the vessels to be distended beyond their natural state whence less inflammation less pain and consequently less disturbance will follow this may be accomplished by the eighteen tail bandage which has been long used in simple fractures and mr gooch publicly took notice of the advantages that would arise from its supplying the place of the common roller in the cases and remarks we have referred to but it must be observed that mr potts contrivance of making the tails fold over each other in an oblique direction is a considerable improvement  mr pughs long splints were made to secure both ends of the fractured bone mr gooch cases and remarks in surgery vol ii p  00  some years after advised the same practice and both mr wathen and mr sharp have since made an improvement by adapting long splints to the shape of the leg  so that you see the practice recommended has been gradually taking place though putting the limb in a state of flexion to assist reduction is entirely new except that mr sharp of mincinglane assistant surgeon of the same hospital has got the start of mr pott by laying in november      a paper before the royal society wherein he advises  when a surgeon is called to a fractured leg at the place where the accident happens let him lay the patient on the injured side on a flat surface and raise the knee of the limb toward the abdomen bending at the same time the kneejoint so as to put the extensor muscles of the foot which are the strongest into a state of relaxation he will then be enabled to replace the ends of the fractured bones and restore them to their proper situation without the customary strong extension of the lim which is troublesome to the surgeon painful to the patient and apt to bring on tension spasms and inflammation of the stretched muscles  the fracture being reduced and the patient laid on a bed upon which there is a mattress the proper remedies with the many tail bandage which has been used many years in st bartholomews hospital and his long splints are applied the patient is kept on his side with the broken leg undermost the knee bent and the thigh drawn up instead of laying him on his back with the injured limb extended  these splints he says were first applied with great success in an oblique fracture of the tibia which could not be kept in a proper situation by the usual methods and afterward as happily in a dislocation of the lower extremity of the same bone accompanied with a fracture of the fibula in this latter case it is often difficult to reduce the dislocation even with a strong extension and more so to retain the bones in their proper situation whilst the limb is laid in the usual extended posture both which difficulties are absolutely avoided by the means above described   nevertheless in justice to mr pott it must be observed that he is the first writer who has scientifically proved that putting the muscles in a state of relaxation and nonresistance is the most proper method both of reducing and curing fractures and he has further demonstrably shown that this part of surgery as well as the rest can only be regularly practiced by those who understand the structure and use of the several parts of the body notwithstanding many bonesetters have acquired reputation by pretending to have cured fractured limbs which were never broken  i shall take the first opportunity of resuming this subject and the next letter i send you may perhaps be of a more interesting nature  i am etc  letter ii feb  0      dear sir notwithstanding i so much approve of the directions mr pott has given about treating simple fractures and pay the greatest deference to his opinion yet i think what he has said about the necessity of immediate amputation in very bad compound fractures is too general for though the practice he recommends may be right in the hospital to which he is surgeon it does not follow that the same steps should be taken in the situation in which you intend to place yourself  indeed if amputation is to take place whenever the probable chance of destruction from the nature and circumstances of the accident is greater than it would be from this operation every limb must be cut off where the bones are shattered and the muscles considerably torn as i imagine in general in sound habits amputation would be attended with much less trouble and more absolute certainty of recovery than even a compound fracture where the bone has made its way out in such a manner as to give free admission to the air without causing any violent laceration of the muscles and yet fractures thus circumstanced so frequently admit of cure as to justify every attempt to preserve the limb nor can i think in private practice the consideration of amputation where it is not fully evident that the limb cannot hereafter be useful often requires immediate determination that a minutes delay will many times be to the patients disadvantage or that a small space of time will frequently make all the difference between probable safety and fatality if according to mr pott immediate amputation is only to prevent gangrene or a large suppuration with formation and lodgment of matter for gangrenes following injuries must be either local from the violence of the injury or succeeding inflammation or they must arise from a bad habit of body or both causes joined  if a gangrene is only local we need not be precipitate in our determination because by proper management it will certainly stop when it comes to the parts which are not injured if it is likely to arise from a bad habit of body amputation will not prevent it as the wound following the operation will most likely mortify for in a gangrenous disposition of the fluids this disease as frequently manifests itself in simple as in more complex wounds and surely there are other methods to remedy large suppuration or lodgement of matter or at least we ought not to amputate till we see the discharge is greater than the patient can bear so that you see there will always be time for deliberation whence we shall act with a certaintly that cannot be known except in particular cases when we are first called to the patient and if necessary we shall have opportunities of performing the operation before he becomes incapable of undergoing its consequences  but mr pott is of a very different opinion he says  when gangrene and mortification are the mere consequence of the time of or by the fracture it generally makes its appearance very eaerly in which case also its progress is generally too rapid for art to check for these reasons when the mischief seems to be of such a nature as that gangrene and mortification are most likely to ensue no time can be spared and the impending mischief must either be submitted to or prevented by early amputation i have already said that a very few hours make all the difference between probable safety and destruction if we wait till the disease has taken possession of the limb even in the smallest degree the operation will answer no purpose but that of accelerating the patients death if we wait for an apparent alteration in the part we shall have waited until all opportunity of being really serviceable is past the disease takes possession of the cellular membrane surrounding the large blood vessels and nerves some time before it makes any appearance in the integuments and will always be found to extend much higher in the former than its appearance in the latter seems to indicate i have more than once seen the experiment made of amputating after a gangrene has begun but i never saw it succeed it has always hastened the patients destruction  i would therefore advise that such attempt should never be made but the first opportunity having been neglected or not embraced all the power of the chirurgical art is to be employed in assisting nature to separate the diseased part from the sound an attempt which now and then under partiuclar circumstances has proved successful but is so rarely so as not to be much depended upon  if the parts are so bruised and torn that the circulation through them is rendered impracticable or if the gangrene is the immediate effect of such mischief the consequence of omitting amputation and of attempting to save the limb is as i have already observed most frequently very early destruction but if the gangrenous mischief be not merely and immediately the effect of the wounded state of the parts but of high inflammation badness of general habit improper disposition of the limb etc it is sometimes in our power so to alleviate correct and alter these causes as to obtain a truce with the disease and a separation of the unsound parts from the sound  now i have not any doubt but in st bartholomews hospital what is here said about the rapidity and untractableness of mortifications arising merely from injury done to the limb is exactly true for i can readily conceive in this situation local will often be converted into the most malignant spreading gangrenes in opposition to the utmost care and good management otherwise it has always been thought that gangrenes from a bad habit of body are more difficult of cure than those which arise from the wounded state of the parts for from the days of hippocrates down to rushworth gangrenes from a bad habit of body were always by the ablest surgeons deemed to be incurable whereas instances abound of mortifications from the violence of the injury alone being cured by amputation the success which attended amputation in local gangrenes inclining to spread probably for want of proper distinction brought it indiscriminately into use in spreading gangrenes arising from a diseased habit where it would always prove insufficient to answer any good end and though we do not recommend amputation in any kind of gangrene will it is stopped yet from this state of the matter we see the reason why it has in this case both been advised and rejected  cauterization caustics etc and though since the use of the bark in this disease has been known we can often cure gangrenes arising from an internal cause yet in the country i have constantly found that those which arise simply from the injury are with more certainty relieved  perhaps there is not any thing which contributes more to a true method of treating mortifications than making a proper distinction betwixt one mortification and another and my practice several years ago led me to discover the difference in them already mentioned which distinctions have ever since been of great use to me in the management of this disorder but as i cannot find that what i said about this matter in my treatise of gangrenes is attended to i shall here describe separately the symptoms accompanying a mortification arising from a gangrenous disposition of the juices and a local mortification when merely the consequence of external injury  when a mortification in compound fractures arises from a gangrenous disposition of the juices soon after the injury is received whether a large wound is made by external violence or a small wound by protrusion of the broken bone the lymph which stagnates about the wound immediately inflames and corrodes the vessels which contain it when air bubbles in the membrana adiposa and other membranes are instantly formed which air bubbles by increasing the inflammation are increased and extended immediately upon the smallest degree of obstruction taking place all over the limb etc an emphysema often first discovering the tragedy that is acting under the skin not yet apparently diseased a fever at this time frequently comes on accompanied with a delirium great dejection of spirits and often a particular wildness in the looks the pulse is either quick low weak and fluttering or quick unequal and hard and the scene is frequently closed with a rapidity that will not admit of assistance  if an incision is made into the affected part when the air bubbles are first formed it is sensible and blood is discharged from the arteries in a florid state as free as usual the membrana adiposa is of a darkish yellow color and the muscles only appear browner than common afterward the skin becomes inflated and the muscles not yet having lost their shape frequently force themselves out immediately upon making an incision with a large discharge of wind and a quantity of frothy matter the blood in the vessels is now turned to a black coagulated mass the membrana adiposa and the membranes in the interstices of the muscles and fibers and the muscles themselves putrify and lastly the skin also becomes livid and putrid from all which it seems evident that a gangrene brings on a sphacelus while the blood is yet circulating in the vessels  on the contrary when the mortification arises simply from injury done to the limb it is not preceded by a gangrene but comes on in consequence of an absolute stagnation of the blood and juices alone and accordingly the skin and all the injured parts become dead and putrid at the same time without any previous emphysema a mortification arising from a weakness and deficiency of native heat comes on in the same manner only more gradual with the same appearances and should a compound fracture happen to a person in years in a weak state of health this kind of mortification may seize him but the state of the patient will discover the nature of his disease  if an incision is early made the part is insensible no other than extravasated blood is discharged nor do i ever remember seeing a mortification arise from this cause except in gunshot wounds without the skin suffering equally with the subjacent parts for if the muscles are only lacerated by the ends of the broken bone suppuration instead of mortification as in other lacerated wounds is always the common consequence if no other cause interferes because the circulation except in the divided parts is not entirely interrupted  in this kind of mortification the countenance continues serene nor does any other fever supervene but such as is common to contused wounds and unless the affected part is very near the body the disease slowly extends itself not by air bubbles taking possession of the cellular membrane surrounding the large blood vessels and nerves some times before it makes its appearance in the integuments as when it arises from a bad habit of body but by the acrid fluids corroding the neighboring parts in the manner of a caustic till matter enough is absorbed to contaminate unless prevented the whole mass of blood but so far as i can judge about this matter a stop may always be put to a local sphacelus for i have never seen a mortification arising merely from the injury done to the part which did not give way to proper management the same kind of success probably induced mr gooch after forty years experience to say that a mortification attending a compound fracture should not alarm the surgeon to a hasty determination of the loss of the limb and i am apprehensive you will often commit mistakes greatly injurious to your patient if you suppose every local mortification as fatal as those in the hospitals  however the chief reason which induces me to differ in opinion from mr pott is the success of the country surgeons who unless the parts are so destroyed as to be evidently irrecoverable seldom amputate and as seldom fail in their attempts to cure from the best information i can procure i do believe the country practitioners who have been really bred surgeons do not take off more than one limb in twenty which has received a compound fracture nor do they upon an average lose more than one in ten of those they attempt to cure without amputation and surely if matter of fact is of any consequence though mr bilguer is far from having proved the inutility of amputation yet he certainly has given proof enough to show that immediate amputation is not often necessary  these circumstances may seem to call in question the judgment of mr pott in so strenuously recommending immediate amputation but their success in the hospital i dare say fully justifies all he has said for i do verily believe in very bad compound fractures their attempts to preserve limbs have most frequently been frustrated by the death of the patients and that the escapes are much too rare to be made precedents it therefore is certainly from a principle of humanity that he recommends a remedy from which in his situation it has been found that the chance of death is by no means equal to that arising from such kind of fracture which leads us to examine how it comes to pass that the country surgeons are more successful in the cure of compound fractures than those gentlemen who have the care of great and crowded hospitals  for this purpose it will be necessary to enquire what is the immediate cause of death in compound fractures and if we except a loss of blood from the principal arteries beihg divided which i believe is very seldom fatal it will probably appear owing to a putrid state of the fluids for this is manifestly the case when death is brought on by a gangrene arising from a bad habit of body and when by a mortification brought on simply by injury done to the parts the patient is chiefly destroyed by an absorption of putrid matter if he perishes by a putrid fever it is also inconsequence of an absorption of putrid blood or putrid matter arising from bruised flesh if by a colliquative fever the putrid matter which is absorbed being less active produces its effects more slowly but it sometimes gives rise to internal abscesses always weakens the fibers and destroys the crasis of the blood whence the discharge from the sore and other evacuations become too great and the patient is exhausted  it is no wonder then that rapid mortifications and great discharges of matter should frustrate their attempts to cure bad compound fractures in a large hospital in the midst of a great and populous city where the air the patient breathes notwithstanding the greatest care combines with the cause of these disorders in his destruction for it is well known where a great number of people breathe constantly in the same room the air is not only destitute of its vivifying spirit so necessary for the preservation of life but it really becomes putrid from being confined and repeatedly inspired and from being loaded with the putrid exhalations arising from mortifications different kinds of sores diseased bodies etc etc etc and perhaps too the general methods used here may contribute to the dispatch of many of these unfortunate people for porters and those who have been used to drink plentifully of drams beer and the like will sink even under the full diet of the hospital and die for want of some indulgence in these bad habits which are now from custom become necessary assistants in supporting the strength of the body so that the gentlemen of the hospital labor under the greatest disadvantages and we may wonder that any recover rather than that most die whereas in the country the patient has every possible advantage from purity of air nor are we tied down to set rules but from learning the former manner in which the patient has lived we supply him properly with those things to which he has been accustomed and i have repeatedly seen the most salutary effects follow a due allowance of ale wine or brandy where a few days low diet has brought on want of sleep delirium loss of appetite and an ill state of the wound  perhaps it may be worth while to enquire too whether free and frequent bleeding to prevent or remove inflammation in every compound fracture may not sometimes hasten the dissolution of the patient for notwithstanding it may seem proper during the state of inflammation yet by thinning the blood emptying the vessels and reducing the strength a greatel absorption of matter follows after the inflammation is gone off and produces more violent effects  i have constantly observed whenever the patient has lost much blood at the time of the accident or whenever i have been called where there has been a free use of the lancet that colliquative sweats looseness and a greater discharge from the ulcer is sooner the consequence of the absorption of matter and with much more violence than when the patient was less reduced and it is very probable if these people had lived upon spare diet and breathed the air of an hospital their complaints had still been aggravated till death had been the consequence  i well remember that the gentleman i served my apprenticeship with very seldom bled in compound fractures and what may seem strange to those who are fond of bleeding it was impossible for any man living to have better success and many accidents of this kind fell under our care nor was this treatment confined to his practice alone for upon enquiring i have been informed by others of long experience who have also had remarkable good success in the cure of these accidents that like him they always hastened the digestion of the wound without much bleeding  for my own part i have always been cautious in reducing the patients strength yet in strong plethoric habits where much blood has not been lost at the time of the accident especially if heated by liquor which is not infrequent i commonly take blood away to prevent great inflammation etc but on the other hand where the haemorrhage has been considerable or where the patient is rather of a weak constitution i defer the operation and only afterward bleed if the symptoms of inflammation peremptorily demand this evacuation but this rarely or never happens and i have seldom found the tumor pain and inflammation or fever rise so high as to make repeated bleeding necessary if proper care has been taken of the limb not only by placing it in a proper position and then leaving nature to accomplish her own work but by using such applications as are capable of giving her assistance and even where improper applications have been used or the injury for some hours entirely neglected etc so that great tumor and inflammation have come on even till blisters have arisen upon the part yet so much bleeding is not here necessary as theory may lead us to think for the discharge from these blisters when properly promoted assists in taking off the tension by unloading the lymphatic vessels and if to the topical remedies moderate bleeding antiphlogistic sudorifics and medicines which purge are joined the tumor commonly declines in a few days for i find when these symptoms arise from simple inflammation they are not so formidable as their appearance might lead us to think repeated bleeding in these cases is only required to prevent an increase of inflammation by lessening the impulse of the blood against the obstructed vessels when too violent for which purpose the loss of a moderate quantity is sufficient and if you will have a little patience the discharge from the sore will most effectually remove every disagreeable symptom for wherever the obstructed fluids can be outwardly discharged it makes a material difference in the treatment from those inflammations where no evacuation can be made from the affected part  there is not any doubt but antiphlogistic medicines a spare cooling diet and an open belly are in general proper while the limb is in a state of inflammation but where this treatment has been carried much farther i do think with mr pott that it has not unfrequently been the cause of the loss both of limbs and lives we therefore do not wait till the appetite begins to fail and the patient sweats and purges without assignable cause or in consequence of a large discharge of matter from the limb before we alter our proceedings for when things are come to this pass it may often be impossible to find remedies sufficient to cure the disease these symptoms therefore must be guarded against rather than suffered to take place for which purpose as soon as digestion appears and the pulse becomes quieter the bark should immediately be given which may be done with the utmost safety and a more generous diet gradually allowed as the appetite returns for though excess should be carefully avoided yet entirely altering the way of living of the patient certainly leads to destruction and i believe the best way of treating him is only to abridge him a little of his usual diet when it has been of that kind which has a tendency to inflame or greatly enrich the blood remembering the aphorism of hippocrates that a slender and strict diet is in lingering diseases always dangerous so much for the general method of treating the patient now let us more particularly consider the injured limb  what mr pott says about the reduction of the limb carries conviction along with it but much of your future good success depends upon removing loosened and detached or sharp pointed bones extraneous bodies etc at the first dressing by the practice of freely dilating the wound where it is too small for this purpose by which means you reduce the wound nearer to a simple state and not only prevent irritation pain and their consequences but render future probing and examining into the sore unnecessary and thus avoid many inconveniences that might arise from that indiscreet practice  this operation should always be done without violence but i am fearful you will scarce always be able to remove loosened or sharp pointed bones which ought to be taken away without giving pain but the patient will suffer much less if they are removed just after the accident has happened while the parts are rather insensible than after inflammation has taken place indeed it appears to me that we should not if it can be done without great violence or lacerating any large blood vessel omit removing at the first dressing whatever may cause irritation for i have constantly found when these along with the coagulated blood are instantly taken away the patient always recovers with much more ease both to himself and his surgeon  but though what is said about the reduction of the leg appears to be perfectly right yet there are some other things which require consideration for if the wound happens to be on the out or under side must not the leg be moved every dressing  this circumstance has escaped mr potts notice but mr sharp new method of treating fractured legs says the leg may be supported by a steady hand against the upper splint and put into any posture that may be necessary to dress a sore on the fibula or under part but i am very apprehensive let the hand be ever so steady this moving will overbalance all advantages from situation again if the wound happens to be on the inward or upper side the matter will lodge till the wound is full enough to run over and part being absorbed produce those evils so loudly complained of in the hospitals to remedy this inconvenience i have lately placed a fractured leg where the wound was on the upper side so that there was a declivity from the shin to the calf by which means the matter did not lodge for i would not if possible give up the advantages arising from the relaxed state of the muscles  on the other hand if the wound is on the shin or on the back part of the leg the side position is most favorable for the discharge of matter so that it may be well worth considering whether the wound ought not to direct us in what manner to place the leg if it should be thought prudent under some circumstances still to place it after reduction in the old posture the practice of sawing off the protruding bone must sometimes take place which operation is done without much trouble or any hazard and always with great advantage to the patient whereas the lodging of matter is always capable of producing mischievous and frequently fatal effects and should be guarded against not only by an enlargement of the wound when too small but by every other step that can be taken  dry lint is very properly advised as the best application where the fracture is likely to heal by the first intention for in order to promote a reunion of the parts we should avoid every step that usually brings on digestion and dry lint in itself has no property of promoting digestion mr sharp says by this new position if the fracture be compound the wound generally heals by the first intention the great impediment irritation being prevented and there is no doubt but this practice may contribute much to a reunion but on the contrary mr pott says the cure by the first intention is the case of some of the lucky few and from what i have seen of this matter the cure by this method can only take place when the bone is simply broken and comes through the skin without causing great laceration for when the wound is so large as to give a free admission to the air suppuration follows therefore when from this circumstance it appears that the cure by suppuration must be pursued the wound should be dressed with a digestive balsam suited to the degree of irritability of the patient instead of dry lint by which treatment you will find ease and digestion much sooner procured for the inflammation will not rise so high as when dry lint is used mr monro to avoid the inconveniences which attended the application of astringents etc usually applied after operations to suppress the bleeding of the small vessels judiciously says there is occasion for no other application to the wound than the threads of soft halfworn linen which the french call charpie the english lint and we caddiss which is a gentle absorbent is soft and easy to the wound and by the corrupting liquors it imbibes proves one of the strongest most mild and safe suppuratives ed med ess vol iv p     this doctrine mr samuel sharp afterward applied to wounds in general without considering that the encomium mr monro bestowed upon dry lint was to show its preference to the astringents which used to hinder digestion by constringing the mouths of the small vessels or that in accidental wounds it is seldom wanted to suppress bleeding and that notwithstanding in the end by collecting the corrupting liquors it proves a suppurative yet certainly nature may be better assisted in promoting digestion for when dry lint only is applied the divided vessels inflame and the obstruction continues till the confined juices become acrid enough to give themselves liberty whereas when a mild balsam of a proper consistence is applied the vessels are preserved in a state capable of giving way to the impulse of the fluids less tension will of course follow and more ease to the patient but reasoning apart if dry lint is applied a week or more elapses before digestion is complete during which time the part remains hot swelled and painful if a digestive balsam is used a good digestion follows in two or three days and the patient complains of much less soreness and pain than when contrary steps have been taken    and it is most certainly not only your duty to avoid doing mischief but also to assist nature by removing every thing injurious and by supplying her with what is wanting to perform a cure in which the whole art of surgery consists  however this dressing must be continued no longer than till the tumor and inflammation are entirely gone digestion is complete and the sore becomes clean lest too great a discharge should be procured when dry lint or lint dipped in simple tincture of myrrh may be applied for though these spirituous dressings manifestly do injury till the state of inflammation is over yet afterward where the discharge is great i think they do service by bracing up the relaxed fibers  what mr pott says about relaxing cataplasms well deserves your attention for though great inflammation requires great relaxation yet by over relaxing parts which are not much swelled the juices stagnate and abscesses or large suppuration is the consequence and i make not any doubt but many have fallen victims to this practice  but on the other hand i do not think the form of the applications used to keep off inflammation where poultices are improper immaterial for though some of the liquid discutients generally applied are powerfully capable of attenuating obstructed fluids yet they are destitute of the other properties which are necessary to prevent inflammation for as i take it the topical remedies calculated for this intention should both attenuate obstructed fluids and at the same time preserve the vessels in a state capable of acting upon their contents whence the circulation and perspiration are carried on regularly in the neighboring parts about the wound and great inflammation is thereby prevented whereas when embrocations alone are used a stagnation of the juices does in a greater or less degree ensue from the skin becoming hard and dry betwixt the times of dressing  this i do not assert from the nature of things only but from experience having frequently been called to people where lotions dry lint a pledget of digestive and the eighteen tail bandage were the only applications that came in contact with the limb which i always found remarkably tense and painful sometimes the swelling and inflammation were risen to a very great height and abscesses which might have been prevented were the consequence it would be well therefore for those who pursue this method of practice to consider whether it is not owing to this kind of treatment that they are obliged to have recourse to large and repeated doses of opium to ease pain for i do aver that we who follow a different method of cure are seldom or never under any sort of necessity of having recourse to that remedy indeed if our applications are not compounded with a view both of attenuating obstructed fluids and of preserving the vessels as near their natural state as possible we fall very short of the true intentions of cure and i am very certain if this circumstance is duly attended to and these lacerated wounds which cannot be cured by the first intention are brought speedily to digestion by the method already recommended even in bad habits and where the case is not fortunately circumstanced the inflammation will for the most part be kept within due bounds without hazarding the consequences of losing a great deal of blood by venesection  from what i have already said you see i entirely agree with mr pott that perfect quietude is absolutely necessary in the cure of compound fractures but we have at the same time shown when the leg is laid on one side this injunction cannot always be complied with and i imagine as soon as the fractured bones acquire some degree of firmness but not before the kneejoint should be gently moved see sharps new method of treating fractures p     to prevent that contraction of the tendons of the ham which might probably take place if the knee was suffered to remain bent eight or ten weeks without stirring  the chief reason which has ever induced surgeons to remove compound fractures has been to keep them clean but to defend the bandage from matter and to prevent us from being under any necessity of changing it often mr gooch cases p  0  or second edit p     vol i recommended the green oilcase cloth to be placed on the outside of the compresses to which i have found it necessary to add pieces of sponge both above and below the wound to prevent the matter from running out at each end by which means i have frequently kept the bandage clean enough six weeks or two months without once moving the limb where the discharge has been considerable  junks you know have commonly been used in compound fractures to keep the limb steady which purpose they answer very well when properly made and properly applied nevertheless they cannot be used in the sideposition of the limb and mr pott you see advises the long splints which supply their place and lie very commodiously upon the part in this situation however it is worth considering whether they are not liable to one of the principal objections against the use of short splints in the cure of compound fractures which is confining the matter that ought to be discharged as they lie flat upon the leg the fracture box kept the leg steady but by pressing up the sides of the pillow it often confined the matter whence i soon laid aside this piece of trumpery and always succeeded with the most ease when my apparatus was most simple indeed there is simplicity in these long splints and when the wound is conveniently situated for the purpose they may often be very useful if bolsters to prevent their pressing upon the sore are at the same time applied i have often used long splints toward the close of the cure in compound fractures with advantage and i imagine mr pott can only mean to recommend them under particular circumstances for you will certainly meet with accidents of this sort in which splints at first either long or short would be improper on account of the violence of the injury  strengthening the injured limb when it is become soft and flabby by relaxing cataplasms is another material circumstance but this i am apprehensive cannot be well effected by the application of corroborating medicines alone and i shall therefore just observe that amongst all the remedies no one can contribute more to the cure of compound fractures than a due degree of pressure by the eighteen tail bandage properly timed and i imagine it can only be owing to a general disuse in the hospitals that so many surgeons have not attended to the advantages arising from this valuable branch of surgery we were before told by mr sharp pref to crit enquiry  that the chief purpose of bandage was to maintain the due situation of a dressing or to make a compress on particular parts and i cannot find that mr pott uses it in fractures for any other purpose than keeping the dressings in their proper place and yet where a compound fracture will admit of cure by the first intention it certainly promotes a reunion and in every case where it can first be applied it prevents inflammation and pain and forwards a regular suppuration for if by the assistance of a due degree of pressure a distension of the vessels and fibers is not suffered to take place nor their sides drawn nearer together than usual the nerves will be put less upon the stretch the vessels will be less loaded and more capable of acting upon their contents of course the circulation will be more regular and the fluids will be transmitted properly into the sore  but these advantages cannot be expected where the parts are much bruised or lacerated or where inflammation has already taken place because the vessels are become impervious and pressure where the fluids are incapable of moving must be injurious by confirming the obstruction and by increasing pain where sensation from the nerves being in a state of tension is become acute  nevertheless when in consequence of the discharge and by the assistance of proper remedies the obstruction and inflammation are removed no application is so capable as bandage of preventing a large discharge by strengthening the vessels and fibers and restoring them to their pristine state and notwithstanding sinuss and abscesses are freely opened and counter openings made which i would always recommend matter will lodge if bandage is not applied and be productive of much mischief and indeed when the use of this assistant is omitted sinuss will often be formed which it is impossible to open with any great advantage for where the eighteen tail bandage after being sprinkled with an embrocation had only been applied with a view to keep on the dressings or to make a compress on a particular part i have found at the end of ten or twelve weeks or sometimes longer sinuss penetrating deep amongst the muscles and running in different directions almost all over the limb besides the fleshy fibers had more the appearance of a jelly than flesh and the patients were sinking under a hectic fever and a deluge of matter which i take to be owing to the height of bad surgery because when the dressings and bandage have been from time to time properly adapted and the patients strength preserved from the beginning this violent relaxation never happens fewer sinuss are formed and the discharge is seldom or never perhaps this assertion may seem strange to those who have had the mortification of seeing their patients die or of being obliged to amputate in consequence of a great discharge but i have never yet seen the discharge in compound fractures productive of either of these consequences and i have been also assured by several surgeons of long experience that they have never lost a patient or taken off a limb on this account so great as to exhaust the patient who is almost always out of danger by proper management in ten or twelve weeks time nor do i believe there ever was a compound fracture which would not bear pressure with advantage if properly managed and properly timed and i am fully persuaded a clever recovery in a bad case without it must be merely accidental but on the other hand no remedy is capable of doing more mischief if injudiciously used for if the pressure is not made with the nicest judgment it retards digestion confines matter brings on inflammation with pain and all their consequences it can therefore only be made with advantage by those who are become handy in this business by use and are capable of distinguishing from the state of the affected part when pressure and what degree is necessary for it is as much impossible to apply it with propriety from description as to play upon the harpsichord without ever having learnt upon that instrument  upon the whole so far as i can judge of this matter immediate amputation in compound fractures ought not to take place where the joints have not suffered violently by the injury unless the muscles and tendons are so crushed or otherways destroyed as to make putrefaction not a probable but an inevitable consequence and it evidently appears from the anatomy of the part that when the mortified flesh etc is digested off the limb cannot be made useful and even when the joints have received considerable injury the necessity of immediate amputation will depend upon particular circumstances for if only part of the ligaments are torn and the fractured head of the bone can be taken away the patient may often be cured so as to have a tolerable good limb but if the greatest part of the ligaments connecting the joint are spoiled there cannot be any hopes of making a good cure and in such cases by deferring amputation we lose time omit a good opportunity of performing it while the parts are uninflamed and suffer the patient to undergo unnecessary pain from the subsequent inflammation without any prospect of future advantage mr faure is of a different opinion which see with the arguments of mr boucher neals translat mem royal academy of surgery vol iii p       but my connections with those of my profession have not only led me to know the success of many surgeons whose situation affords them only common accidents but also of several who as well as myself have had the care of the workmen in collieries limekilns leadmines and the like where the most violent injuries of this kind frequently happen in these places the bones are for the most part not only broken into many pieces and their extremities now and then separated so as to come away but they are also often forced into the ground the principal arteries sometimes divided and the muscles etc are frequently lacerated and crushed with immense weights even so much that coal sleck etc in great quantities is driven into the very substance of the flesh so as to render the accident as formidable as possible and yet it is a notorious fact that where the part is not absolutely destroyed these desperate cases seldom fail of being cured without the loss of the limb from all which i am induced to think that notwithstanding speedy amputation may be necessary and right in great hospitals yet this ought to be no precedent for country practice which certainly points out that much more may be expected from the resources of nature than some imagine because the escapes with life and limb are not very rare but most frequently happen you see mr gooch who has wrote well on this subject is not in general for speedy amputation and i am certain you will have much more satisfaction and acquire more reputation by the discerning part of mankind in preserving a limb than in taking it off  i know indeed operations often make a great noise and prejudice people in favor of the abilities of the operator and some with very little knowledge in surgery have raised themselves great reputation by this mechanical part of the profession which requires no great genius as it depends only upon a knowledge of anatomy and a practical dexterity of the hand for do not young surgeons of no great abilities after some trials upon dead bodies perform operations with the greatest success and you see the nicest operations are daily performed by illiterate men upon brute animals with a dexterity that cannot be excelled by those who unthinkingly dress themselves in a most formidable habit when they perform operations on the human subject and yet there have been men weak enough to lessen themselves and their profession in thinking that a dextrous application of the knife characterizes a good surgeon  nevertheless notwithstanding this part of practice is so readily acquired it has of late years been more attended to by the student and cultivated with more assiduity than the treatment of fractures luxations wounds abscesses ulcers etc mr pott in the preface to his treatise on the fistula lachrymalis observes that the operative part of surgery is the great and almost only object which they who come to the hospital have in view because it is what they have seen the least of and it may be added that above half the young fellows that have attended during mr potts time were bred apothecaries and had seen little or nothing of surgery when they arrived in london so that it is easy to imagine what will be the consequence of advising speedy amputation to these gentlemen who are not conversant with any other method of cure it is true indeed mr pott has in the same place very properly recommended greater attention to the common practice of surgery and he has done much in his several writings toward bringing this part of the art to perfection but if i am well informed operations still engross chiefly the minds of many of those who attend the hospital for improvement  and an able writer upon operations some years since overlooked these articles because he thought the method of treating them was settled the book mr pott has now wrote shows there was still room for improvement in the cure of fractures and dislocations and a little reflection would have discovered that the treatment of ulcers was not arrived at its ne plus ultra and indeed i am fearful the study of that part of surgery which is most common has been neglected since the spirit of performing capital operations has so much taken place  these things i mention to you with an intent to stimulate you to apply your mind to the common by the common practice of surgery i would be understood to mean that part which cures without the assistance of the knife except the opening of abscesses sinuss and the like practice of surgery and i make not any doubt if this part of the profession is duly attended to there will soon be a decrease in the number of capital operations and when an operation is performed you will better know how to treat the patient for a true knowledge in the cure of ulcers is required wherever there is a solution of continuity which comes to digestion and not only ulcers but the cure of obstruction inflammation and abscess etc will still admit of improvement you will here find an ample field for the exercise of your genius and an enlarged mind will always have infinite pleasure in learning from nature what methods are best to assist her and the knowledge you acquire will soon distinguish you from those whose chief enquiries are confined to the narrow limits of handling a knife  not that i would have you neglect instructing yourself properly about the manner of performing operations it being a very useful and necessary part of the art but when the nature of diseases and the consequence of wounding particular parts are understood so that you know when to cut and when to let it alone this knowledge will easily be attained for there are few difficulties that occur in operations but what you will be able to surmount if you can preserve a calmness and a presence of mind for which purpose i would advise you not foolishly to imitate those who value themselves upon being quick for if any accident happens you will be disconcerted but go on without too much haste nor be unnecessarily slow and if i can judge from experience you will not only always be guarded against any thing that may happen to frustrate your proceeding but you will also be less liable to commit any error that may be injurious for i am very apprehensive that great quickness in chirurgical operations often ends quickly in the death of the patient but i am running from my subject and as nothing but matter of fact can be depended upon in these cases shall only add that i desire you will inquire amongst the country surgeons who have been regularly trained up to practice whether i have not farly stated their success in the accidents under consideration i e whether they do not cure nearly eighteen compound fractures out of twenty without amputation and if it appears that you have not been misinformed i hope you will think i have done right in pointing out to you a method by which the country folks at least who have the misfortune to meet with very bad compound fractures may by proper management end their days for the most part with two legs instead of one  i am and c  letter iii march  0      dear sir nothing is of greater use in surgery than ascertaining the principles upon which we are to act as it leads us out of uncertainty and directs us to proceed with every advantage to the patient what mr pott therefore says on dislocations deserves your greatest attention as it is designedly wrote to ascertain the principles upon which their reduction depends an improvement much wanted as they seem not hitherto to have been generally understood or fully considered by any writer  indeed it cannot be said that he is the first who pointed out that great extension was wrong and that the muscles ought to be put into a state of nonresistance in order to reduce a dislocated bone with propriety and ease as you will see if you examine mr thompsons paper in the second volume of the london medical observations and inquiries but he is the first who has considered the nonresistant state of the muscles as a general principle and has endeavored to prove that the difficulty attending the reduction of every kind of dislocation is wholly owing to the resistance of the muscles and tendons attached to and connected with the bones composing the joint whereas mr thompson imagines that one cause of difficulty is from the head of the bone not being able to get readily back through the opening which he thinks it always makes in the capsular ligament for in dissecting the arm of a man who had a dislocated shoulder at the time he died it was found on the second day of enquiry that this ligament was torn off from the neck of the humerus in which notion he has the sanction of petit who forty years ago was of the same opinion he advises to make the dislocated bone reenter its cavity by the way it was forced out because it leads to the opening in the sacculus ligamentosus which has been made by the eruption of the head of the bone otherwise coming to its cavity by a new way and finding no aperture in the ligamentary tunicle it carries it along with it into its socket which hinders the reduction being exact etc des malad des of p    tom i or med obs and inq vol ii see note to p      and from considering the anatomy of the joints and from experiments made upon dead bodies we find the same sentiments since adopted by dr hunter med comment p  0   this doctrine you see mr pott has considered his arguments about it have weight and so far as i can judge from experience i believe if the advice of galen which has been copied by almost every writer of returning the dislocated bone the same way in which it was displaced is followed you will in recent dislocations never meet with any obstacle from the ligament if care is taken that the muscles do not make resistance to the reduction  if you look back into the writers on surgery you will find the best of them advise if possible the practice of reducing dislocated bones by the hand without much extension and where extension is necessary when it is properly made they direct the bone to be conducted into its place in the same manner they must mean when it is not instantly replaced by the muscles upon coming near to the cavity into which it is to enter and it will be worth your while to consider whether this part of practice should not occasionally be continued even when we proceed upon mr potts principles  mr sergeant wiseman copied the practice of reducing dislocations of the thigh in young patients of tender constitutions by laying one hand upon the thigh and the other on the leg and having somewhat extended it toward the sound leg the knee must be suddenly forced up toward the belly and the head of the femur pressed into its acetabulum and it will knap in for he says there is no need of so great extension in this kind of luxation for the most considerable muscles being upon the stretch the bowing of the knee as aforesaid reduces it  you will readily recollect that mr travis of scarborough about twelve years ago reduced a thigh which was dislocated inwards toward the foramen ovale of the pubis by fixing his patient upon his back upon a bed with his heel against a high raised bedstead where he had sufficient foothold and the extension was made by three men with a towel fixed above the knee upon a napkin folded and rolled on to prevent the skin from being chafed the patients right knee was bent so as the leg made about a right angle with the thigh and an assistant was placed on his knees upon the floor holding the ancle with directions on a certain signal to push the leg outward by which as with a lever the head of the thigh bone would be twisted inwards and downwards mr travis placed himself on the patients right side at the bed foot with the palm of his left hand on the head of the luxated bone and his right near the patella the extension being made gradually and steadily by the towelmen until mr travis thought the bone might be moved the signal was given to the assistant who held the ancle which he punctually obeyed at the same instant with a smart jerk mr travis pushed the head of the bone downwards and outward and the patella inwards and immediately the bone rushed into its proper place with a snap that was perceived by all present  about twentyeight years ago i saw mr holbrooke reduce a dislocated thigh in a hearty young fellow about twentyone or twentytwo years of age much in the same manner except that the extension was made by pulling at the ancle as well as at a cloth fixed above the knee  a gentleman bred up to surgery living in the same town was first called in who soon discovered the nature of the accident but having declined every part of the profession except midwifery and not having before seen a dislocated thigh he directly sent for mr holbrooke in whose absence it fell to my share to attend but before i set out i thought proper to look what had been said about an accident i had never seen and had the misfortune to take down turner who seems to have copied from wiseman but has omitted the material circumstance of making his extension toward the sound leg and pushing the knee up in the same direction when i came to the patient the round head of the bone in the groin near to the foramen ovale and a cavity where the great trochanter ought to have been at once discovered what was the matter and we therefore set about reducing the dislocation in the manner dr turner directs surgery vol ii p      but after repeated attempts without success we tried whether the strap would assist by one pulling on the outside the thigh while the other pushed upon the head of the bone but this did not help us and seeing we were not likely to accomplish the work we had undertaken i dispatched a messenger away for my master  being come he made the extension in the manner we had already done but he placed himself betwixt the patients legs with both his hands upon the outside of the mans knee and one of his own knees was fixed against the upper part of the thigh bone and when he thought the extension was sufficiently made he at the same instant as the patient lay upon a bed rather below him pushed the femur downward and outward and pulled the knee inward by which means the head of the bone went directly with a considerable snap into its place  so that in all these cases the reduction was finally accomplished by making a lever of the thigh bone  some years since a child about six years of age was brought into my surgery on account of its having received by a fall an injury in its hip and upon inquiry i found the upper part of the thigh bone entirely at liberty and under the edge of the gluteus muscle upon which i of course set about examining whether the head of the bone was dislocated or broken off at its neck for which purpose i directed as the child lay upon a womans lap the thigh to be put into a state of flexion then extended by pulling gently at the knee and moved from side to side keeping my own hand upon the greater trochanter which i could plainly perceive but luckily at the very first of our making these motions while i was pressing upon the bone it slipped from under my hand into its place so that we cured the patient and learnt the nature of the accident both at the same time  a similar case lately fell under my notice a lad about twelve or fourteen years of age was thrown from a horse and some bags of flour fell upon his hip from which accident that leg and thigh were rendered useless the surgeon who was first called attended him several days and the hip being swelled from the bruise he honestly told the friends of the boy that he could not tell with certainty what was the matter upon which i was called in i first saw him in bed and observed as soon as the bedcloaths were removed that the knee of the injured thigh lay over the middle of the sound thigh in a loose awkward manner and upon taking hold of the knee i plainly discovered that the upper part of the bone was at liberty under the gluteus muscles but whether it was dislocated or broken we could not yet tell we therefore placed him upon a table to make our proper inquiries but in moving the thigh as in the last case i felt the bone slip from under my hand the hip and thigh became perfectly right and the patient from this time began to recover the complete use of his leg etc  hence it is plain that a dislocated thigh may most easily be reduced in a state of flexion and though these were only young people yet it is probable that those farther advanced in years may be cured in the same manner by only making a stronger extension celsus parey wiseman and many others reduced thighs in this state notwithstanding their extension was made in a strait line but unless they took great care to keep down the head of the bone when they pushed up the knee the bone would return to the place from whence it was drawn and prevent the reduction which inconvenience will be avoided if the thigh is bent at the time extension is made may not we therefore from these circumstances from the cases we have mentioned and from what mr pott has said upon this subject select a practice that will effectually serve our purpose whenever the accident immediately under consideration requires our assistance  when a thigh is dislocated inward or outward perhaps it will be best to follow the advice of celsus in laying the patient on one side so that the part into which the bone has slipped be always uppermost and that from which it has receded lowermost by which means the extension may be made in any direction you have a mind and your own invention will point out to you twenty ways of securing the patient upon a bed for a table will be too high so that a proper resistance may be made to the extension  this being done the knee bent and a towel fixed properly above it you must place yourself on that side of the thigh to which the bone is dislocated with your knee near to the head of the bone and both hands on the opposite side of the knee of the patient an assistant being fixed at the ancle the extension may then gradually be begun by three or four men with the thigh rather in a state of flexion and when there is reason to think that the head of the bone is drawn upon a level with the socket the extension being steadily continued the knee may be bent nearer to the abdomen and at the same instant while your knee pushes the bone toward its place the ancle must be moved in the same but the knee of the patient in a contrary direction by which means i imagine the bone will in general be replaced provided the extension is sufficiently made before we attempt to return it into its socket  i think it is generally allowed that dislocations of the thigh rarely happen otherwise than inward or outward though writers also talk of its being dislocated upwards and downwards but when we call to mind how seldom this accident in any way is met with it will appear that our assistance may perhaps never once be required to reduce dislocations of the thigh thus circumstanced and it may be much questioned whether surgeons have not copied this account from one another without ever once having seen this accident for hippocrates first started the opinion perhaps from imagining there was a possibility of its happening in these different directions and i see it has been handed down by almost every writer in his very words  however if the dislocation upwards or downwards does ever happen i imagine you will not be at any great loss about the reduction if the same plan as we have just laid down is pursued except that extension must at first be made with the thigh in a strait line and it seems most proper to place the patient as parey advises hippocrates advised the patient in these cases to be laid either prone or supine and most of the writers except parey have copied him from one another very exactly but by placing the patient in the side position you have not only the advantage of using your knee but the extension can be continued while the thigh is brought into a state of flexion and the person at the ancle can assist you much by pulling backward or pushing forward the bent knee and turning the ancle as the case requires  on his sound side and of a convenient height that the pressure with your knee may be made in a strait direction  when the shoulder is dislocated the head of the bone you know often rushes into its place when it approaches the cup of the scapula even when the extension has been made with the muscles in a state of resistance and it is reasonable to believe that it will more readily happen when this impediment is removed by their being relaxed nevertheless further art will sometimes i think be required to conduct the bone into its place even under this advantage mr thompson you see proposes that the arm should be raised upwards and a little inwards to bring it in a line of direction centering between the tendons of the subscapularis and teres minor muscles both of which and the flap of the capsular ligament will be relaxed by that means the arm is to be held in that position by one hand of the surgeon the inferior angle of the scapula must then be carried backwards toward the spine and the acromion depressed downwards by an assistant these motions will bring the head of the humerus to the outside of the brim of the glenoide cavity and the surgeon who has hold of the patients arm making a gentle extension upwards and passing the thumb or fingers of his other hand into the axilla and there pressing upon the head of the humerus by way of fulcrum depresses the arm with a quick motion in a line of direction as before mentioned thus the reduction i apprehend will most likely take place by the head slipping over the flap of the capsular ligament and between the two tendons into its socket  i have never tried this method because in the space of twenty years though i have used nothing but the napkin and ball i have not in recent dislocations of the humerus been once disappointed in my first attempt to reduce them when the head of the bone has lodged in the axilla though ever since i read mr thompsons paper i have made my extension with the fore arm bent which is supported either by the patient himself or a standerby i place the patient upon a cushion on the floor and fix him by proper assistance that his body cannot give way to the extension having put the arm through a napkin tied together in the common manner and betwixt my thighs i put the napkin over my neck and fix a linen or a woollen ball in the middle of the napkin so that it cannot move this ball is three times as large as those commonly used of sufficient hardness to make a resistance to the head of the bone and yet soft enough to press into the axilla the processus acromium is left entirely at liberty and when three or four men who by sitting upon the bare floor are rather lower than the patient have by a towel tied with the usual cautions above the elbow drawn the head of the bone forward enough in a direction that keeps it about the middle of the axilla i press the ball in behind it and by leaning backwards instead of forcing the head of the bone against the neck of the scapula i push it outward so as to assist those who make the extension till i find it arrived at the edge of the glenoide cavity when i direct the elbow to be brought nearer to the side and at the same time raise myself more perpendicular by which means the head of the humerus raises the processus acromium a little and slips up immediately upon which i push the acromium down again if necessary though it is seldom required afterward i move the arm in all directions that the long tendon of the biceps etc may again return to their usual place  you will readily see from this account that the arm is drawn rather downwards which according to the opinion of some is an improper position for they say if the extension is made in an horizontal direction or downwards as the head of the humerus will press upon one or other of the tendons of the subscapularis or teres minor muscles if the extension be forwards or backwards and if it be in the middle it will be opposed by the united force of both tendons and of the stretched capsular ligament so as to render the reduction impracticable without a further laceration  indeed in regard to an horizontal position of the arm i can easily believe it improper when the bone is dislocated downwards but i assure you the method of reduction just mentioned has always been attended with the greatest ease both to myself and patient besides a complete recovery and believe me one grain of matter of fact to a practical surgeon is worth a pound of reasoning  i have some few times seen the head of the humerus under the pectoral muscle but in making the extension and moving the arm inward it slipped into the axilla and was then reduced in the common manner i have oftener seen the head of the bone dislocated backwards toward the scapula i remember being called to a case of this kind in a hard working fellow betwixt twenty and thirty years of age many years ago after discovering the nature of the accident i placed the patient in a chair and ordered the extension to be made with the arm in an horizontal posture which i assisted by pushing with my own hand the head of the bone toward its place but though we brought it near to the glenoide cavity of the scapula yet these steps alone could not replace it i therefore kept my hand fixed upon the head of the bone that it should not recede in which i was assisted by a steady extension at the elbow which i directed to be bent and to be pulled backward at the same instant that the hand was turned a little upwards upon which the bone was immediately reduced and i have since had the same success under the same circumstances but i took the management of the fore arm to myself and got an assistant to push at the head of the bone  if you call to mind you will remember that a dislocation of the under jaw is put to rights by extending the jaw forward pressing down the posterior part of it and at the same time pushing the anterior part upward the elbow when dislocated is reduced by making an extension till the forearm can be put into a state of flexion and then it is easily accomplished by bearing upon the lower end of the humerus with one hand and by taking hold of the wrist and bending the elbow with the other and if it is on either side the hand of the patient must be turned inward or outward at the same instant as the case requires nearly the same steps are taken with the knee or ancle when out of joint etc from all which we may conclude with celsus that whatever be the species of dislocation the method of reduction is the same  in dislocations of long standing we find the head of the bone forms for itself a new socket see med obs and inq vol ii p     case    which with the growing together of the lacerated with the neighboring parts in some cases and the contraction of the tendons etc in others is probably the reason why they are reduced with difficulty or that reduction is impracticable see dr hunters med comment part i page  0 note   the method of reduction mr white recommends of suspending the body by the arm seems the most likely to overcome this obstacle though myself and another surgeon of much experience used it without effect with every other method we could think of in an old dislocation where the os humeri had slipped backwards toward the scapula perhaps the case was incurable for the same gentleman tried it where the bone had been a month under the pectoral muscle with success and another surgeon has since informed me of his moving the head of the humerus by this method from under the pectoral muscle where it had lain some time into the axilla  it was a common practice both with hippocrates and galen to reduce dislocated thighs by tying ligatures about the ancles and knees and suspending the patient with his heels toward the top of the room but remember whenever this mode of reduction in the shoulder is pursued above the elbow is the part upon which the suspending ligature should alone be fixed  by this time i imagine you heartily repent asking my opinion about these matters but as one link of a chain draws on another so i have been led to say more upon this subject than i first intended though i imagine joining practice to theory will always be acceptable to a young surgeon if the method of reducing a dislocated thigh had been clearly laid down the surgeons at the sea ed ess and observe vol ii p     worcester infirmary could not have been at a loss in what manner to have relieved this accident and you see at last they were forced to have recourse to the vis percussionis which i would choose to translate reduction at random  if you take a view of the chirurgical writers in regard to dislocations you will find they have chiefly copied what hippocrates has said upon this subject and that much the greatest part of the improvements which have been made till within these few years has been in an alteration of or an addition to the machines he sometimes used in reducing them which was certainly improving the worst part of his practice he gave us the different methods that were employed in his time some of which have been copied by one writer and some by another and they have been handed down to us as the work of different men by the idle custom of every one implicitly copying a favorite author whereas had they collected only the most eligible practice from hippocrates together with the few real improvements made by other writers i think they might have deduced a rational method of cure for they might have learned that the dislocation should be reduced as soon as possible that the extension should be gentle gradual and continued till the dislocated bone is upon a level with the cavity from whence it receded at which time if it did not return of itself it should be reduced the same way in which it was displaced or as celsus has it from that side in which it was prolapsed to the contrary by pressing upon the head and making a lever of the dislocated bone parey expressly says you should not fasten the ligature to the wrist in a dislocation of the shoulder or to the ancle in a dislocation of the thigh bone but above the elbow or above the knee otherwise the joint of the elbow or of the knee will be more extended than the shoulder or hip the extension in dislocations of these parts was in the days of hippocrates and galen often made with the fore arm and knee bent and it evidently appears from the practice of every writer and i should imagine from every mans own experience that whenever a dislocated limb was reduced both with ease to the patient and his surgeon the muscles were in a state of flexion but the reason these were not selected from the injudicious parts of practice seems to be because the principles upon which we ought to proceed were not ascertained but from observing mr potts doctrine in preserving the muscles in a state of nonresistance by the position of the limb and by retaining the practice of conducting the head of the dislocated bone into its place i apprehend we shall make choice of that method which will relieve our patients with certainty and ease  i am dear sir your affectionate humble servant  postscript september      i designedly omitted saying any thing on the use of fomentations cataplasms and the like previous to reduction where the part is much swelled and on the treatment necessary after the joint is replaced because these are sufficiently taken notice of by almost every writer upon this subject but it may not perhaps be improper to add something to what mr pott has said upon compound dislocations for he only tells us speaking of the dislocation of the tibia at the ancle page     that when this accident is accompanied as it sometimes is with a wound of the integuments of the inner ancle and that made by the protrusion of the bone it not infrequently ends in a fatal gangrene unless prevented by timely amputation though i have several times seen it do well without whence as you have not yet acquired equal knowledge with this writer you may perhaps be at a loss to know whether in such a case you ought immediately to take off the ancle or to attempt the cure without this operation  now a gangrene may more frequently follow a laceration of the ligaments etc connecting the joints than other parts because the inflammation attending these accidents often rises higher is more obstinate and of longer continuance but this is only local and what we have already said about amputation on account of gangrenes holds equally good here except that it will be more frequently necessary in local mortifications of the joints on account of the ligaments being destroyed but if i may judge from what i have seen i do believe if the inflammation is properly treated it will for the most part be prevented from terminating in what is properly called a gangrene  nevertheless i am clearly of opinion with mr gooch that compound dislocations are in general of worse consequence than compound fractures if the cure is attempted by replacing the dislocated bone not only on account of the obstinate obstruction and inflammation owing to the compact structure of the injured parts and to the dissolution of the ligaments which of course follows but also because the air having admittance into the joint renders the synovia acrid which where it is not freely discharged inflames and corrupts the ligaments produces abscesses about the joint a caries of the ends of the bone intolerable pain a great discharge and a colliquative fever in consequence of an absorption of matter and when things are coming to this pass life can often only be preserved by a timely amputation or if the symptoms are not so violent as to require immediate amputation a fistula of the joint is commonly the consequence and the patient afterward drags on for a long time at least a miserable life  but i observe when the wound is so fortunately circumstanced that the ichor and matter do not lodge in the joint but readily drain away the symptoms are much less severe and a cure happily ensues and less disturbance and a cure still more readily follows if the protruding bone can be taken away for by this means the matter has a free exit new flesh more easily rises in the sore and the new callus takes upon it the form of a joint from the impression made by the head of that bone which remains entire  instead therefore of hastily taking off the limb when the head of the dislocated bone protrudes through a wound i would advise the practice mr gooch recommends of sawing the bone off which may be easily done as it is rather spongy  a tall boney muscular man fortynine years of age was on the   st day of july last thrown off from a wagon load of hay and great part of the load falling upon him he was almost crushed double at the same time that the fibula of his left leg was broken and the tibia dislocated and forced out more than two inches through a large wound of the teguments of the inner ancle  he was immediately bled by those present but the protruding bone remained unaltered till i saw him which was three hours afterward when i readily took it off with a small saw the knee was then bent and the leg laid on one side with a declivity that the matter which was hereafter to be formed might be readily discharged the wound was dressed with a mild digestive balsam and the other applications and bandage used in compound fractures and an ounce of glauber salts were immediately given on account of the bruise in his breast next day i found the patient easy and the wound in a good state digestion soon afterward appeared the discharge has since been inconsiderable the void space filled up with new flesh which has already acquired a boney consistence and in short the cure has gone on without interruption and with very little trouble to the patient further than what was occasioned by his leg being once moved from our being unprovided with a proper apparatus at the beginning and there is not any doubt but he will have as useful a leg as he had before the accident happened  indeed the ease with which this patient has recovered and the good success i have seen where the head of the bone has been broken off so as to come away together with the cases mr gooch has given us induces me warmly to recommend this practice and i have not any doubt but upon trial it will be found to be one of those experiments that will recommend itself  perhaps it may seem strange to you that i so freely used greasy applications in wounds of the ligaments as they have in this case been decried by almost every writer since celsus and more especially as the oil of turpentine is still used and recommended by very eminent men both in this and other nations as a specific in wounds of the tendons and ligmanets because it is an old practice  but i am apprehensive the use of oil of turpentine in these cases is very pernicious for i do believe it has not infrequently by irritating and inflaming brought on abscesses and mortifications which were thought to be in consequence of the accident alone i know an eminent writer says oil of turpentine has the virtue of allaying pain arising from wounds of the tendons and nerves as is confirmed by the practice of parey by the opinion of all authors and his own continual experience de haens difficulties in the modern system of physic  and yet there is not a lad that has played tricks with a mountebanks horse who does not know that it has directly a contrary effect and only reflect one moment upon the application of this remedy to an inflamed nerve but i cannot any way so effectually explode this practice as by giving you a short view of the principles upon which it was first introduced and i hope you will give me the hearing a little longer as the getting clear of this remedy in this case seems to be a matter of consequence  hippocrates who used the word nerve to signify a glutinous such as the tendons ligaments and the like after telling us how the nerves are formed of glutinous matter de locis in bomine sect   and exactly in different places describing the tendons and ligaments by the name of nerve and after informing us that the spinal marrow which descends from the brain is neither fat nor much glutinous he says the nerves may be distinguished by broiling them along with other parts for that part which is neither nervous nor glutinous will soon be broiled whereas the nervous and glutinous parts will not broil because they contain but little fat for fat and oily parts are soon consumed  a distinction it is impossible for any to mistake who have ever taken notice of a roasted leg of mutton nerve was the general name for both tendon and ligament and these particular names were also used to describe their office for  was the name given to those nerves which are the instruments of flexion contraction and extension and  to those which tied any part together so that hippocrates did not make the distinction betwixt nerve tendon and ligament that later writers have done but often more properly called the tendons nervous tendons  a ligament nervous ligament  and where he thought a ligament was composed of both a nerve and cartilage he called it  a cartilaginous and nervous ligament several other nerves had particular names which see in arist de hist animal lib iii cap    instead of a medullary substance says that cold is injurious to the nerves and a moderate warmth which does not exceed the third degree useful wherefore he orders them to be dressed when wounded with myrtle roots powdered sifted and kneaded with oil and with fiveleaved grass rubbed in oil which are to be removed the the third day which applications he says had better be used in winter than summer and ceslus who used the word nerve in the same classical sense in his anatomical description of the spine lib viii cap   he says the vertebrae send out two processes on each side in the middle they are perforated where the spinal marrow connected with the brain descends the sides also between the two processes are perforated by small holes through which from the membranes of the brain similar small membranes proceed now certainly had these been known by the name of nerves in his time he would not have called them membranes and i think it is hence pretty evident that he was unacquainted with what herophilus and erasistratus had said about this matter nor does caelius aurelianus or pliny call any substance by the name of nerve but the nerves described by hippocrates see next note  says with hippocrates that they are injured by cold recommends the application of agglutinants to heal recent wounds of them that would admit of cure by the first intention but where the wound was severe emollient cataplasms were outwardly applied in ulcers where the nerves were laid bare he first covered them with linen to prevent their being injured by remedies which might be necessary to cleanse the sore and mild digestives were also used in ulcers amongst the nerves when wounds would not unite by the first intention celsus often immediately gave them the name of ulcer and it is probable he used this practice whether in recent or old ulcers he no where treats distinctly of wounds of the nerves i e tendons except when he copies from hippocrates about wounds of the joints but what he says about them lies dispersed throughout his works  but this practice galen overturned  he had learnt the improvements made in anatomy by herophilus and erasistratus these writers who lived long after hippocrates were the first discoverers of the use of the nerves arising from the brain and they first very improperly gave these organs of sense the name of nerves probably because they appeared to be white cords something resembling the tendons and had really a nervous coat though in every other respect destitute of any properties that should have thus characterized them and from the idea which was immediately affixed to this appellation much perplexity has arisen amongst succeeding writers of neurology herophilus said that some nerves obedient to the will arose from the brain and spinal marrow others took their rise from the bones and were inserted into bones and some passed from one muscle into another which also tie together the joints see rufi ephesii opera cap de ven et arter p    which distinctions galen at first adopted for in his book de ossibus ad tyrones he tells us there are three sorts of nerves those which arise from the brain and spinal marrow are called the voluntary nerves those arising from the muscles tendons and those which arise from the bones ligaments but he afterward changed his sentiments see next note aretaeus made the same distinctions  and after making a new distinction he made the distinctions betwixt nerve tendon and ligament now in use but it is worth observing that he says  de usu part lib   the tendons are inserted into each joint wherefore they are formed of ligaments and nerves which were dispersed amongst the muscles being afterward collected together etc and in explaining this matter in another place  de motu muscul lib   he says a tendon is of a mixed nature betwixt a ligament and a nerve it is as much harder than a nerve as it is softer than a ligament but it is such a kind of body because it is made of both of them a ligament indeed is insensible a nerve is endowed with all sense but a tendon is not insensible because it is part of a nerve nor is it so sensible as a nerve because it is not wholly a nerve therefore so much as it partakes of the nature of a ligament so much its seeling is blunted whence he durst not venture to unite divided tendons by suture because of their connection and sympathy with the brain so that he did not only contradict asclepiades who said that the nerves i e tendons were insensible and rufus ephesius who told us they had only an obtuse feeling whilst they were cut cap de venis et arteriis page    but you will find upon examining that all the mistakes in practice about the sensibility of the tendons in an uninflamed state arose from this imaginary structure the mere offspring of a fertile genius betwixt nerve and tendon and then again confounding these different substances under one name it is from hence that the word  was used by after writers without distinction not only to signity what we now call a nerve but a tendon likewise and a ligament and what is really curious after the plain distinction galen had made he copied the symptoms following the wounded nerves so called by hippocrates and applied them to injuries both of these and of the nerves arising from the brain by which he made them both productive of the same consequences and this mistake in opposition of the lights which modern anatomy has afforded and to facts which frequently present themselves is handed down to this very day even boerhaave has fallen into these errors and his learned commentator has in consequence with great ingenuity accounted for symptoms and diseases following wounds of the nerves which from the nature of the parts could never possibly happen so little indeed have people been aware of this mistake committed by galen that a very late writer after telling us the consequence of pricking or wounding a nerve arising from the brain refers back to hippocrates for further proof of this matter and yet it is certain he never said one word about them it would give me pleasure to explain this point farther for a dissertation on wounds of the nerves and wounds of the tendons beginning de novo is much wanted but as i am fearful of tiring you shall at present omit what has occurred to me on this head  we are informed that his principal aim in the cure of wounded nerves was to guard against putrefaction  seeing says he  de comp med secund gener lib   that putrefaction in all things is produced by heat and moisture i always think the cure in wounds liable to putrefaction should be attempted by cold and drying applications  again i agree with hippocrates that cold is an enemy to the nerves and imagine that that medicine is the properest for wounded nerves which dries and is of a middle nature betwixt heat and cold or rather inclining to heat for heat without humidity cannot moisten  in punctures therefore of the nerves after opening the external wound medicines of thin consistence vehemently drying which will excite a moderate warmth penetrate to the bottom and draw from afar without giving pain or injuring the interjacent parts should be applied  but warm water though it mitigates other inflammations yet it is very prejudicial in wounded nerves what inflammation could happen in which the nerves arising from the brain were not concerned even according to galens own description of them who says they spread like the branches from the trunk of a tree all over the body  de usu part lib   but this doctrine was applicable to wounds of the tendons  etc for the same reasons relaxing cataplasms should not be applied nor are things of thick consistence of service it is better to foment with old thin oil made warm for cold obstructs the small opening etc and the nerves here he is manifestly speaking of what we now call the nerves but what he says of their being of a cold nature is copied from hippocrates who knew nothing of these nerves at least not under that name are the most sensible parts being a continuation of the brain of a cold nature and easily affected by cold or with oil in which the seeds of the fir tree and poplar flowers have been boiled or the oil of savin which is void of astringency there is a strange inconsistency in this doctrine just above he has recommended things vehemently drying here with more reason they are to be void of astringency now things vehemently drying would certainly stop the discharge and in that sense be astringents and of thin part  compound medicines for the same purpose were made of resin turpentine euphorbium sagapenum opopanax and the like but when the nerves were laid bare he advised milder applications that would dry without irritating for he says they will not bear the force of euphorbium etc as when the skin interferes he therefore in this case used washed lime or pomphylyx mixed in a large quantity of oil etc but when the wound was accompanied with pain he applied a cataplasm made of bean flour and the lixivium stillatitium called stacte  now though it is true that heating and drying substances prevent putrefaction in dead bodies yet in living bodies and especially in tendinous parts they produce exactly a contrary effect by hardening and inflaming the vessels and fibers however this theory and practice with very little variation was implicitly copied by the greeks arabians and latins except that by some unlucky mistake instead of the lixivium stillatitium which is a liquor that sweats from the myrrh tree before it is lanced see pliny lib xii cap     they used common ley i cannot tell whom to charge with this mistake but i rather think it was owing to the arabians because i find the aqua cineris advised by avicenna from whom it was copied by guido cauliaco etc etc etc but in justice to aqua pendente it must be observed that he was careful enough to make an exact copy from galen but unfortunately this was overlooked  which i dare say you will easily conceive could not afford much ease when the injured parts were inflamed and painful and yet upon no better authority than this blunder a soap suds poultice was applied by parey to the kings arm charles the ixth of france when he was pricked in a nerve lib x cap    after all that has been said about this case and its being so frequently instanced to show the method of curing pricked tendons it does not appear from any of the symptoms which followed that the tendon in the kings arm was injured by the lancet the instant pain which made him cry out must be owing to a nerve being pricked for pain does not immediately come on upon pricking a tendon as the copiers from parey have asserted but slowly afterward which i do not only know from my own practice but job a meekren also says obs med chirurg in describing the symptoms which follow a pricked tendon non mox ab incisione sed lento pede molestarunt sydenham affirmed the same thing and dr hunter in his medical commentaries is of the same opinion  now the kings arm was instantly dressed before they could possibly tell whether the tendon was hurt or not and there is every reason to suspect that the chief sufferings this royal patient bore were owing to the hot oils and soap suds poultice    instead of a vein  oil of turpentine however this was a very different application from old thin oil oil of savin or oil in which fir seeds and poplar flowers bad been boiled so perfectly agreed with the remedy described by galen for pricked nerves that it immediately came into use when the method of making it was known and perhaps more especially as galen himself had used oil in which the seeds of the fir tree had been boiled and to the oil of turpentine some aqua vitae you see was added to make it still more capable of exhausting and drying up the serous and virulent humor which sweats from the substance of the pricked nerve of preventing bad symptoms and of mitigating pain by its actual heat  now the oil of turpentine etc was applied before any serous humor could be discharged provided the tendon had been pricked therefore it must be used by way of prevention but is not this serous humor the natural discharge from a wounded tendon the books since galen tell us that it is also the consequence of pricking or wounding a nerve arising from the brain but this no where that i know of appears rightly upon record and seems to be one of those mistakes which galen made by copying what was wrote before his time about wounds of the nerves see note page    for it had been said that a discharge of ichor was the consequence of wounding a nerve i e tendon  and therefore would not stopping it by drying remedies increase inflammation and pain it is highly probable the ease the king enjoyed was from the oxycrate and nutritum but these gave way to the poultice above mentioned which was thought to be a better remedy for dissolving and drying two very different intentions virulent humors occasioning pain but i dare say from the nature of this application you will think the king had a narrow escape from torture as he was to have been cauterized with scalding oil if the pain had not luckily ceased and the cure took up three months which is a much longer time than is usually required for the recovery of accidents of this kind  this case i have particularly taken notice of because it is copied by heister and many others as a standard for practice if you urge the authority of parey himself i will go a little further to show you how far his great good sense was imposed on by a specious theory he dressed pricked tendons in the manner of galen with applications made of old oil resin galbanum opopanax euphorbium pitch and the like and says if the pain yield not to these remedies but rather increase with inflammation of the affected part a swelling of the lips of the wound and a sweating forth of a serous thin virulent matter or filth then you shall cauterize the part with scalding oil for this will take away the sense from the nerve tendon or membrane like as if they were burnt with a cautery and so the pain will be ceased  now could any thing more effectually produce a swelling of the lips of the wound and a discharge of serous matter etc especially in irritable habits than the applications parey used and might not the patient often be tortured with scalding oil in consequence of symptoms brought on by improper treatment  but i will give you one other instance to show how far a pleasing theory may mislead men of sense  wiseman had copied the theory about remedies of hot dry and subtle parts being proper for wounded nerves or tendons to consume that ichorous water which first affects them and causes the putrefaction and therefore he in the beginning used scalding oil of roses with a little bay sait dissolved in it and dropped into the injured part and to mend the matter if tumor and inflammation came on he advised the cataplasm made with common lixivium or wine before taken notice of  a procedure that cannot be reflected on without horror and yet he afterward relates a case to show the bad effects of the over use of hot oils which he says in these cases have been very mischievous to many and he cures the patient by a simple and rational method directly contrary to that which he himself had proposed a young woman was pricked in a tendon by being bled in the foot and in consequence of using hot oil of turpentine the lips of the wound became turgid dry and inflamed wiseman being called showed the surgeon his error dressed with basilicon an embrocation of oil of roses and with diachylon softened with oil which lying on two or three days cured the patient book v cap    notwithstanding he immediately afterward mentions two cases where he applied a balsam composed of euphorbium turpentine cloves sagapenum etc equally hot with oil of turpentine and which manifestly did injury to both the patients on whom it was used there being a necessity of applying fomentations and emollient cataplasms to subdue the inflammation it had caused from all which his own knowledge and his paying too great a regard to authority are at once both evident  the same may be said of parey for when he thought for himself it is remarkable that those who did not embarrass themselves with the prevailing theory pointed out a much better method of cure marchetti dressed a tendon laid bare with dry lint and sydenham advised an emollient cataplasin to pricked tendons  no man shone more in his profession but when he suffered himself to be fettered with theory we see his practice was horrible but we have a recent instance in de haen how far a preconceived prejudice may biass the mind in favor of a bad remedy in opposition to matter of fact we have already observed that he used oil of turpentine in imitation of parey to ease pain but he happened to meet with some cases in schlichting which fairly prove that this oil applied to the skin caused great pains and dreadful inflammations but as the same untoward symptoms did not appear in the same persons from the use of hungary water he instead of concluding that the oil was more irritating than hungary water curiously observes that all the mischief was owing to an idiosyncrasy or peculiar temper of the skin  turner also embarrassed himself with the same theory and practice and after bringing on inflammation with oil of turpentine and then reducing it by emollient cataplasms he fays indeed through mistake it may so happen that all these fiery exsiccating medicines may be pernicious and hasten those very accidents they were intended to avert as where the injury has been slight or glancing only on the aponeurosis when i have frequently seen a small pledget of the common digestive even a little basilicon applied to the festering orifice has made way for some unhappy symptoms to go off without farther disturbance which had undoubtedly been aggravated by either of the foregoing dressings  nevertheless one of the best practical surgeons in this kingdom in a late useful publication has adopted the old theory for he cautions us against using oleaginous or cold applications to wounds of the nerves and tendons and says the most suitable applications to the nervous or tendinous part itself are those of a subtle spirituous nature such as sp terebinth dressing the other parts of the wound with vulnerary balsams etc  now if oil of turpentine gives pain to the flesh it cannot be proper to the nerves themselves because they are the organs of sensation i cannot conceive that this able surgeon ever uses oil of turpentine to inflamed or wounded nerves and i wish he had not like wiseman copied the mistakes of former writers  and how unnecessary its use is in wounds of the nerves the common method of dressing a limb after amputation where the great nerves are wounded fully proves it is true indeed it cannot give equal pain to the tendons when uninflamed because they are then nearly insensible but it will most certainly crisp up and harden their fibers and a slough thicker or thinner will be superinduced whereas if a tendon is only laid bare by a simple wound and dry lint is applied its blood vessels will first look inflamed like an inflamed eye from whence new flesh will arise and a cure will ensue without any separation provided the moisture which drains from the lips of the wound be artfully kept from interfering by pieces of sine sponge but if the nature of the accident be such that the tendinous parts will unavoidably suppurate they may be dressed like other wounds and in this respect will terminate equally well allowing only a longer time for them to separate which they always require on account of their compact structure so that you see i am recommending you back to the practice of celsus who no other way guarded against the effects of cold than by keeping off cold air and is it not amazing that this treatment which would procure ease should be overlooked and preference given to the fiery remedies of the followers of galen  examine thoroughly therefore commonly received opinions before you adopt them whence you will be led to think for yourself which is the high road toward knowledge in particular you will find brought down to our own times as much absurd reasoning about the nature and cure of ulcers and some as bad practice in consequence of this reasoning as any we have described but i hope the mistakes i have already pointed out in this postscript will put you upon your guard against plausible and pleasing theories and if you are desirous of being esteemed in your profession remember that wisdom lists up the head of him that is of low degree and makes him to sit among great men  finis
