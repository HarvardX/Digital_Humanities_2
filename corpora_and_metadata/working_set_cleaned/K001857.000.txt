frequently taken notice of the medicine chests in furnishing medicine chests particular regard must be had to the different climates and to the disorders that are most prevalent in those countries  the same in traveling chests  each person knowing their own constitution will endeavor to accomodate themselves accordingly in the cabinetshops some containing six bottles some nine and some twelve others larger with drawers to hold different medicines which are extremely convenient in any exigency and would be more universally made use of if a simple and safe plan could be adopted and i think it is a pity no person has ever given a hint how to furnish those small ones there are frequently advertised large chests the plan of which i do not altogether approve of because when a persons buys one and takes it many miles in the country and is out of the several medicines he is obliged to send up to the first proprietor otherwise they cannot have the same therefore all medicines in the chests should bear the title of the london dispensatory as directed by the college of physicians unless there may be something added more efficacious and then the recipe should be given or say where it is taken from  i do not mean to enter largely on the dispensatory as those have done but only to endeavor at a scheme for furnishing small ones from   l   s to about   l   s each first cost persons suiting their own stations to be ready at any time when any sudden illness should seize any of the family  the necessity of such a plan is too obvious especially when we consider the many accidents human nature is subject to in which without immediate help we are either lost or kept in great pain which would be in a great measure prevented if masters or mistresses of families would keep a small chest by them and particularly those who reside in a country village often many miles from a town where an apothecary is to be met with  i shall now proceed to select such medicines as i think necessary and choose those chiefly which the the college of physicians have ordered the apothecaries to keep in their shops that by asking for the medicines by their names you will always have the right if you deal with a person of credit  i will not recommend any medicine where there may be danger in it without pointing it out likewise electuaries on account they are so disagreeable to take i leave out as i can always substitute something more agreeable in a liquid and as my design is to curtail physic i shall chiefly confine myself to those medicines that lie in a small compass whose virtues i have often so happily experienced  at my first writing of this i had no thoughts of offering my service to the public to furnish those small chests but if any person is desirous of my service i will very readily give my advice and explain more particularly the recipes and nature of the medicines and take care they shall be supplied with the best of them and as i am the first who has endeavored to make these small chests universal without any reserve i hope at least i may meet with candor and any hints that will improve the whole will be gratefully received by  their humble servant francis spilsbury chemist no   mountrow westminsterbridge surry  directions for furnishing medicine chests i have in the course of this work exceeded the bounds i at first intended and have taken notice of several medicines which are useful on particular occasions and which the public may be furnished with if they think proper though not absolutely necessary to be kept in every house the small chests with a few bottles will ever be found the most serviceable the use of which i most strongly plead for without interest as i am entirely against any secret nostrums being put in and hope no one will encourage any such practices  a table of weights twenty grains make one scruple three scrupies make one dram eight drams make one ounce twelve ounces make one pound a gill in measure is called four ounces in weight glass mortars are handy and cheap and with care will last some time  first scheme which no family ought to be without elixir paregoric anodyne balsam traumatic balsam or turlingtons wine of ipecacoanha tincture of jalap the chief recommendation of the tincture of jalap is its lying in a small compass and purging briskly otherwise some people may choose tincture of rhubarb or sena commonly called daffys elixir or an imitation of baume de vie salts or hartshorn drops  if you should choose a ninebottle case then add the three following  tincture of soot styptic tincture aromatic tincture  if a twelvebottle case then add the following or any others you may think proper  spirit of lavender compound tincture of valerian volatile the basilicon powder  a scheme to furnish a large medicine chest others may be added elixir paregoric balsam anodyne tincture of soot hartsh drops or salts wine of ipecacoanha styptic tincture volatile tinct of valerian tincture of jalap an imitation of beaume de vie jesuits drops balsam traumatic wine of antimony compd powder contrayerva basilicon powder tinct of sena or daffys elixir spirit of wine and camphor liquid laudanum bitter tincture aromatic tincture cream of tartar magnesia nitre spermaceti yellow basilicon diachylon plaster turners cerate rhubarb glauber salts and manna hysteric water spirit of lavender compound  and the following dried articles will be found very useful  allspice alum gum arabic ginger pearlbarley cinnamon  also the following dried herbs marshmallows mint peppermint chamomile flowers pennyroyal ground ivy balm and sage to make teas or infusions  as medicine chests are made of different sizes each person may adopt which they please the first nine or twelve i particularly recommend to every family those who keep the whole will have a very good apothecarys shop and a physician or apothecary may make a good medicine up quickly to suit any exigency i have omitted the bark and several other valuable medicines because there is time sufficient to procure them when wanted and first for colds and coughs is  elixir paregoric this excellent elixir was invented by le mort a french surgeon and was called the elixir asthmatic it is a medicine of great efficacy in fresh colds or coughs and may be given to children in the chincough commonly called the whoopingcough dose a teaspoonful not more going to bed grown people may take more up to a teaspoonful and a half it is a gentle opiate  n b persons who are subject to a bad cough of long standing and shortness of breath must take care not to meddle with it an account of the opium in it which would almost choke them when a person has got a cold they should put on a double nightcap and a woollen stocking round their neck children are frequently troubled with a cough that proceeds from eating trash which occasions tough phlegm to be lodged in the stomach in that case or where it is a whoopingcough a gentle vomit of ipecacoanha wine dose two drams in any pleasant liquor for a child of six years old may be given or a gentle purge as take manna half an ounce dissolve it in a cup of tea and add tincture of jalap one teaspoonful but where worms are suspected a dose of basilicon powder must be given  observe in taking of medicines to begin with a small dose and so increase or diminish as you find them operate by this you will discover what is commonly called the constitution in fevers this should be given very sparingly as it will rather increase the heat  balsam anodyne this is a valuable composition it cures fresh aches and pains arising from colds almost to a wonder those who are troubled with the gout or rheumatism must use opodeldoc  it likewise cures the tooth and headache and is the basis of those tinctures advertised for outward pains rub half an ounce well in before the fire and wear a flannel for nervous cholics or gravelly complaints it is sometimes used dose twenty drops to sixty for a grown person this is a stronger opiate than the former  balsam traumatic or baume de commandeur this is similar to the fryars and turlingtons balsam and is used for the same purposes viz fresh cuts it is good for inward decays and tickling coughs as it is so generally known i shall not say any more to recommend it it is rather thinner than the advertised medicines but no ways inferior  soot drops or tincture of soot where children are these drops should always be at hand there is not any medicine of so great efficacy as this is in bringing people out of fits when properly applied i have known a grown person seized with fits which before used to hold an hour and could not be brought to herself by any of those cruel misjudged methods very often made use of by strangers as forcing open the hands pinching burning etc which is wrong my method was to pour a papspoonful of these drops down the patients throat by itself and almost immediately they would recover if not i gave the second which seldom failed indeed i never knew it to fail it is a safe medicine for children from one to four years old i lower it for them by mixing two or three parts water with it as one teaspoonful of drops and three of water when children either purge or vomit the danger is over rubbing their limbs and soles of the feet is good the best preservative against fits is an issue and purge off the acids with magnesia and rhubarb in lethargy fits a strong vomit must be forced down as the wine of antimony the sal vitriol these two last medicines require judgment  the styptic tincture as sometimes accidents happen by breaking a bloodvessel or too great an effusion of blood i have thought proper to recommend this to be kept ready and will answer all the end of the celebrated styptic of helvetius or eaton dip a piece of cloth in it and apply to the part  spirit of rosemary otherwise hungary water simple spirit of lavender both of these when made in perfection are very grateful and fragrant they are frequently rubbed on the temples etc under the notion of refreshing and comforting the nerves and likewise taken internally to the quantity of two or three teaspoonfuls as warm cordials in wine etc  wine of ipecacohana commonly called the sack vomit it is mild safe and serviceable in dysenteries the powder of ipecacohana is best for small chests dose of the wine for a child six years old is six drams in powder four grains grow people one ounce and a half of the wine and in powder ten grains  hartshorn drops their use is well known dose from ten drops to sixty  salts of hartshorn the dose is from a grain or two to ten or twelve  tincture of martial flowers or of iron people who live at a distance from chalybeat waters may supply themselves by substituting this tincture by dropping from ten to twenty drops in any vehicle twice or thrice a day  sweet spirit of nitre a pleasant cooling diuretic medicine dose from ten to fifty drops good in fevers  the sweet spirit of vitriol acid elixir of vitriol and sweet elixir of vitriol are often used on particular occasions for weakness and relaxations of the stomach and decays of constitution  the volatile tincture of valerian is a very good hysteric medicine in nervous cases and lowness of spirits dose three times a day from one to two teaspoonfuls in a glass of any liquor as wine or wine and water  tincture of jalap is a useful safe purgative if it had not that burning heat in the throat it would not be unpleasant it is handy to mix in small quantities in any effusion especially for children whose aversion to physic creates much trouble dose for children six years old a small teaspoonful grown people two spoonfuls in any liquor jalap is frequently used in scurvy grass and concentrated juices sold as quack medicines and when dropped in water or beer turns whitish  stomachic elixir otherwise stoughtons elixir take of gentian root two ounces orange peel one ounce virginian snakeroot half an ounce cochineal half a dram french brandy two pints   let them steep for three days then filter the elixir  this safe medicine being so generally known needs no further comment dose from one to four teaspoonfuls in any liquor  tincture of sena or daffys elixir this mixture is warm and comfortable to the stomach and bowels and somewhat proper in cholic complaints and for the wind dose for grown persons one ounce or two if given to children lower the dose as it is too hot for their tender mouths  spirits of wine and camphor is very handy for sprains inflammations discussing tumors preventing gangreens etc  liquid laudanum or thebaic tincture an opiate a good medicine in skilful hands but very dangerous in ignorant the white syrup of poppies is a very good opiate and not so dangerous peppermintwater sweetened with this syrup is good to stop vomiting or an over purging one grain of laudanum in substance is equal to thirty drops of the liquid for strength  bitter tincture is handy for those who like to drink it in wine or make purl of it is very safe and helps digestion dose thirty to sixty drops  the aromatic tincture is a very warm medicine for weakness of the stomach in languors and flatulencies and other like complaints dose a teaspoonful or two in a glass of wine or wine and water  huxhams wine of antimony i prefer to that directed by the college of physicians it is a noble medicine in proper hands good to be given against the smallpox as a preparative for inoculation for coughs as an alterative and diaphoretic and apoplectic cases none ought to meddle with it but with great care dose for a child eight years old one teaspoonful in a glass of water grown people two three is a large dose it vomits very strong rectified spirits of wine poued on the glass of antimony will neither vomit nor purge and is the basis of norriss and rysseegs medicines  spirit of lavender compound this is the red drops of lavender very good to snuff up the nose when you have got cold it comforts the head and raises the spirits dose from twenty to sixty drops on sugar or in wine and water  an imitation of baume de vie take of the sacred tincture two ounces of the stomach tincture one ounce syrup of saffron two drams mixed this is a very pleasant safe easy purge and no ways inferior to that boasted medicine baume de vie in it is virtues try and believe  observe people that are troubled with the piles must not meddle with aloetic medicines as this and the baume de vie likewise scotch pills  jesuits drops or balsamic tincture take balsam of capivi one ounce gum guiacum two drams balsam of peru four drams oil of sassafras two scruples salt of tartar twelve grains rectified spirits of wine nine ounces digest them together for four days and pour off what is fine for use this is partly taken from le mort who gave the proprietor the first hint it is an admirable warm medicine and a pity it is not more known in some cases it has long been advertised for curing a certain disorder which it will not cure this medicine is exceeding good for ulcerations decays of the lungs and kidneys fresh cuts etc and for that painful complaint the stone in the gall or the gravel dose one teaspoonful to three or four when required it turns water like milk as balsams will do when lowered with this i have often cured a pain in the bowels or stomach much sooner than the tincture of rhubarb so often prescribed  compound powder of contrayerva this is a powder much superior to the gascoignes it is a warm sudorific cordial medicine and given in low fevers or where a sweat is wanted to be raised dose ten grains to half a dram every fourth and sixth hour  magnesia an exceeding good safe useful medicine no family should be without it given with rhubarb to correct and purge off the acids in the stomach solutions of magnesia in all acids are bitter and purgative while those of the other earths are more or less austere and astringent a large dose of the magnesia if the stomach contains no acid to dissolve it does not purge or produce any sensible effect a moderate one if an acid is lodged there or if acid liquors are taken after it procures several stools whereas the common absorbents in the same circumstances instead of loosening bind the belly   rhubarb the powder is well known it is good for strengthening the stomach and purging off crudities dose for one seven years old twelve grains a grown person half a dram  nitre white powder a cooling diuretic dose from ten grains to twentyfour twice a day it should be taken in warm water with a little spirit and sugar to sweeten and correct the coldness it will allay heat  cream of tartar a white powder this is an agreeable acid and sometimes in making of punch supplies the place of lemonjuice it purges very gently dose from ten grains to two drams a safe medicine  sperma ceti is useful in lyingin cases and miscarriages or inward bruises or coughs  the royal basilican powder from quincey quincey says and not without reason this is one of the best purges for gross children that are apt to breed worms and have large bellies the ingredients are efficacious it is operation is mild and wonderfully clears the bowels of slime this cathartic is very proper to be given to persons when they are to be inoculated it is a very good family medicine and will be of service in the gout rheumatism itch leprosy evil and other cutaneous disorders take care not to catch cold dose for children from six grains to fifteen for grown people from fifteen to forty mixed with a syrup for it is a heavy powder and a mercurial preparation  white emulsion for a cough or pain in the side take oil of sweet almonds and syrup of balsam of each two ounces four ounces of barleywater and thirty drops of sal volatile shake them well together and take two large spoonfuls if this does not answer it will be necessary to be blooded  for the ague best bark two drams salt of wormwood half a dram and snakeroot half a dram divide it into four doses one dose in a morning fasting two hours before the fit comes on  for the gout a safe simple remedy which will give ease and keep the gout off  take flower of brimstone one teaspoonful in milk fasting every morning it must be continued every day throughout the year and begin after a fit is over it will gripe at first before you are used to it if you doubt try  for the jaundice take a pint and a half of ale and heat a poker red hot and quench it in the beer stirring it till the hissing is off let this be repeated four or five times then run the ale through a cloth and put in the ale that is left two tablespoonfuls of treacle saffron ten grains and tamarind in powder a scruple stir it and take the whole nine mornings fasting this has been seldom known to fail and has been kept a secret  a tincture for the teeth take proof spirits of wine eight ounces spirit of vitriol sufficient to give it an agreeable acid and cochineal a scruple let it stand six hours then filter it through a glass funnel this is what is sold at a shilling a bottle at the shops if i mistake not a boys patent was granted for it  who can help smiling  for the earach the smoke of tobacco blown into the ear is excellent or the oil of almonds dropped in the ear mixed with a little spirit of lavender compound  for the cure of a crumb of bread or any other ingredient going down the throat wrongway as is commonly expressed take a bit of fresh butter the size of a small nut and swallow it gently if that dont cure add the second bit it gives ease and stops the fit of coughing sweet oil will do as well as butter  the headache a temporary relief take spirit of vitriol pour a little into the palm of the hand and rub it on the forehead keeping the hand there some time or the thin peel of a seville orange fresh cut without the white put on the forehead is the best remedy it makes the place smart and draws the pain out  a gargle for a sore throat take the best vinegar half a pint red port wine a gill alum two drams dissolve it in the vinegar and wine then add honey half an ounce mix and gargle the throat often a blister round the throat is the best remedy to draw the humor off or rub the volatile liniment on the part and keep the body gently open  the following is a carminative for children when in pain and purge too much take mintwater a gill rhubarb sixteen grains diascordium two scruples sweeten it with sugar dose a small papspoonful for a child six months old going to bed it comforts the bowels eases the griping pain and makes them sleep some simmer the mintwater and rhubarb together  huxhams tincture of bark take peruvian bark in powder two ounces seville orangepeel one ounce and a half virginia snakeroot three drams saffron four scruples french brandy twenty ounces and let it stand four days dose dram to half an ounce this is given with success in slow nervous fevers and in the decline of putrid spotted and pestilential fevers though the remissions are very obscure it strengthens the solids prevents the farther dissolution and corruption of the blood and in the event restores its crasis  barley water take barley one ounce water two pints often washing the barley boil it two minutes throw the water away then add fresh water three pints boil it to a quart  tincture of japan it is astringent corroborates a relaxed stomach and bowels stops defluxions catarrhs vomiting diarrheaas uterine fluxes dose half a spoonful to a spoonful in red wine or mint water the tincture of cinnamon or one made of cassia will do as well to keep  scorbutic juices take the juice of seville oranges and of garden scurvy grass each a quart the juice of brooklime and of watercresses of each a pint mix them and when the dregs are subsided strain them through a flannel these juices given from two to four ounces two or three times a day and continued for some time are of considerable use in scorbutic disorders similar to this with the addition of dandelyon and honey is the vegetable syrup which has been so often advertised if mankind lived on a vegetable diet then would this be sufficient to extirpate the disorders but as we live so high in our sauces and madeup dishes the mineral kingdom which is more ponderous must be called in  spirit of minderus this is an excellent deobstruent diuretic and diaphoretic neutral spirit and as it operates without heat it may be given in febrille and inflammatory disorders where medicines of the warm kind if they fail of procuring sweat aggravate the distemper this dose is from one dram to half an ounce more or less according to its strength which is somewhat precarious either by itself or rather with other medicines adapted to the intention  stomach pills take of rhubarb one ounce socotrine aloes six drams myrrh half an ounce vitriolated tartar one dram essential oil of mint half a dram syrup of orangepeel a sufficient quantity make them into a mass this pill is intended for moderately warming and strengthening the stomach and evacuating crude viscid humors a scruple of the mass may be taken twice a day some use a stomachplaister for bad complaints  the decoction of bark take jesuits bark in powder one ounce and boil it in a quart of pure water to a pint toward the end add liquoriceroot cut half an ounce to the colature add nutmegwater two ounces and mix them the dose is a small wineglass with ten twenty or forty drops of the volatile tincture of guiacum a small quantity of winters bark gives it a grateful warmth and renders a quantity of the compound water less necessary this receipt will make the simple decoction only leave out the nutmegwater  tooth powder take dragons blood alum myrrh cream of tartar equal parts in fine powder which mix to give it a fine color some add vermillion but it is better to be let alone this powder may be used by itself but if the gums are wasted you may make a paste by mixing it with honey of roses and use it gently with your finger  a very good sudorific tincture take virginia snakeroot six drams cochineal and english saffron each two drams opium one scruple spirit of minderus one pint digest them together in a gentle heat for three days and then pass the tincture through a strainer this composition is an efficacious sudorific to be taken for a sweat dose half an ounce in a glass of simple water or wine taken for easing pain and composing the patient to sleep  salt of wormwood draught take a scruple of salt of wormwood pour upon it by little and little fresh lemonjuice till it has quite done fomenting and tastes quite insipid about one large spoonful is sufficient then add a little fine sugar to make it palatable about a wineglass of spring or barley water and a papspoonful of cinnamon water make a most pleasant draught above the age of fourteen it may be given once in six or eight hours in any little feverish complaints sickness at stomach watchings parched dryness of the mouth and suchlike ills and is often preferable to the fever powder from seven to fourteen years half a draught is sufficient under that age still decrease the quantity  distilled or essential oils are never given alone on account of their extreme heat and pungency which in some is so great that a single drop let fall upon the tongue produces a gangrenous eschar they are readily imbibed by pure dry sugar and in this form may be conveniently exhibited ground with eight or ten times their weight of sugar they become soluble in aqueous liquors and thus may be diluted to any assigned degree mucilages also render them miscible with water in an uniform milky liquor they dissolve likewise in spirits of wine the more fragrant in an equal weight and almost all of them in less than four times their own quantity their solutions may either be taken on sugar or mixed with syrup or the like on mixing them with water the liquor grows milky and the oil separates  essential oil of anniseeds this oil possesses the taste and smell of the anniseeds in perfection it is one of the mildest of the distilled oils fifteen on twenty drops may be taken at a time without dagger though common practice rarely goes so far as half the number its smell is extremely durable and diffusive milk drawn from the breast after taken it is found impregnated with it is odor and possibly this may be in part the foundation of pectoral virtues usually ascribed to it in flatulences and cholics it is said by some to be less effectual than the seeds themselves  oil of cinnamon this valuable oil is extremely hot and pungent of a most agreeable flavor like that of cinnamon itself in cold languid cases and debilities of the nervous system it is one of the most immediate cordials and restoratives the dose is one two or three drops which must always be carefully diluted by the mediation of sugar etc for so great is the pungency of this oil that a single drop let fall upon the tongue undiluted produces as boerhaave observes a gangrenous eschar  essential oil of juniper berries this oil is a very warm and pungent one of a strong flavor not unlike that of berries in the dose of a drop or two it proves a serviceable carminative and stomachic in one of six or eight or more as stimulating detergent diuretic and emmenagogine it seems to have somewhat of the nature of the turpentines or their distilled oils like which it communicates a violent smell to the urine  essential oil of the leaves of common mint this oil smells and tastes strongly of the mint but it is in both respects somewhat less agreeable than the herb itself it is a useful stomachic medicine and not unfrequently exhibited in want of appetite weakness of the stomach reachings to vomit and other like disorders when not accompanied with heat or inflammation two or three drops or more are given for a dose it is likewise employed externally for the same purposes and is an excellent ingredient in the stomachic plaster of the shops  essential oil of the leaves of peppermint this possesses the smell taste and virtues of the peppermint in perfection the color is a pale greenish yellow it is a medicine of great pungency and subtility and diffuses almost as soon as taken a glowing warmth through the whole system in cholics accompanied with great coldness and some hysteric complaints it is of excellent service a drop or two are in general a sufficient dose  essential oil of nutmegs the essential oil of nutmegs possesses the flavor and aromatic virtues of the spice in an eminent degree it is similar in quality to the oil of mace but somewhat less grateful  essential oil of jamaica pepper this is a very elegant oil and may be used as a succedaneum to those of some of the dearest spices it is of a fine pale color in flavor more agreeable than the oil of cloves and not far short of that of nutmegs it sinks in water like the oils of some of the eastern spices  essential oil of the leaves of penny royal this oil in smell and taste resembles the original plant the virtues of which it likewise possesses it is given in hysteric cases from one to four or five drops  essential oil of rosemary the oil of rosemary is drawn from the plant in flower when in perfection it is very light and thin pale and almost colorless of great fragrancy though not quite so agreeable as the rosemary itself it is recommended in the dose of a few drops in nervous and hysteric complaints boerhaave holds it in great esteem against epilepsies and suppressions of the uterine purgations occasioned by weakness and inactivity  essential oil of rhodium this oil is extremely odoriferous and principally employed as a perfume in scenting pomatums and the like custom has not as yet received any preparation of this elegant aromatic wood into internal use it is a very dear oil  essential oil of sassafras this is the most ponderous of all the known essential oils but rises in distillation with sufficient ease it appears limpid as water has a moderately pungent taste a very fragrant smell exactly resembling that of the sassafras it stands greatly recommended as a sudorific and for purifying the blood and juices it is likewise supposed to be of service in humoural asthmas and coughs the dose is from one drop to eight or ten  oil of lavender flowers is of considerable service both externally and internally in paralytic complaints and in debilities of the whole nervous system in general the dose is from two to five or six drops  syrups syrups are saturated solutions of sugar made in water or watery or vinous infusions or in juices they were formerly considered as medicines of much greater importance than they are thought to be at present syrups and distilled waters were for some ages made use of as the great alteratives insomuch that the evacuation of any peccant humor was never attempted till by a due course of these it had first been regularly prepared for expulsion hence arose the exuberant collection of both which we meet with in pharmacopoeias and like errors have prevailed in each as multitudes of distilled waters have been compounded from materials unfit to give any virtue over the helm so numbers of syrups have been prepared of ingredients which in this form cannot be taken in sufficient doses to exert their virtues for twothirds of a syrup consist of sugar and greatest part of the remaining third is an aqueous fluid syrups are at present chiefly regarded as convenient vehicles for medicines of greater efficacy and made use of for sweetening draughts and juleps for reducing the lighter powders into boluses pills or electuaries and other like purposes some likewise may not improperly be considered as medicines themselves as those of saffron or buckthornberries  syrup of meconium or white poppies this syrup impregnated with the opiate matter of the poppyheads is given to children in doses of two or three drams to adults from half an ounce to an ounce and upwards for obtunding and incrassating acrimonious humors easing pain procuring rest and answering the other intention of mild opiates  syrup of saffron saffron is very well fitted for making a syrup as in this form a sufficient dose of it is contained in a reasonable compass this syrup is at present more frequently prescribed than the wine from which it is made it is a pleasant cordial and gives a fine color to juleps  the simple syrup take of white sugar and water each equal quantities boil them into a syrup these preparations are plain liquid sweets void of flavor or color they are convenient for sundry purposes where these qualities are not wanted or would be exceptionable  ointments i recommend the following which will serve in any common accident  diachlon plaster this plaster is the common application in excoriations of the skin slight fresh wounds and the like it keeps the part soft and somewhat warm and defends it from the air which is all that can be expected in these cases from any plaster  yellow basilicon this is commonly employed in dressings for digesting cleansing and incarnating wounds and ulcers  pomatum the use is well known  blistering plaster is handy to be kept for the apothecary to apply  ladies plaster and sweet oil of olives their virtues are well known  turners cerate is commonly used for cuts scalds bruises chilblains and other trifling complaints where the skin is worn off  ointment for the itch take of sulphur one ounce white helebore root in powder or crude sal ammoniac two drams hogs lard two ounces mix arid make them into an ointment sulphur is a certain remedy for the itch more safe and efficacious than mercury for as dr pringle observes unless a mercurial unction was to touch every part of the skin there can be no certainty of success the quantity of ointment above directed serves for four unctions the patient is to be rubbed every night but to prevent any disorder that might arise from stopping too
