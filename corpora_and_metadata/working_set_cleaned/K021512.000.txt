who now think me soft as dough i nor mind their balls nor feasting nor their specious promise heed what is the bread without the yeast in what is the word without the deed  wife lord johnny now why make you such a fuss what is truth and conscience to such folk as us nor one nor the other will as i am a sinner ever give us credit for a sundays dinner sir courtly says if you will but vote for him he will fill our pockets to the very brim  john i tell thee no  he is one of those they say who is ever ready to talk any way loud as a bull or mute as any mouse a dial or a larum in the house all smiles and treachery all bows and lies in fact a complication of disguise squire trusty is my man who just and true butters his bread just as a man should do  wife he cannot say bo to a goose  dont

great your vote and your interest will raise you to note if for interest you tender your interest and vote would you hang on the arm of my lord or his grace and familiarly ask for a pension or place to your interest he will promise his life to devote if you will promise him both your interest and vote this engages the minds of the great and the small of our friendships and loves is the basis of all each talent each virtue each gift he has got who can boast borough interest and proffers his vote  john sad doctrine this but be it mine to prove we have not quite forgot our countrys love to venal honors let me never aspire but in my station tend my humble fire on no vain schemes of false ambition bent my pride integrity  my wealth content  song whilst happy in my native land i boast my counrys charter i will never basely lend my hand her liberties to barter the noble mind is not at all by poverty degraded it is guilt alone can make us fall and well i am persuaded each freeborn britons song should be  or give me death or liberty though small the power which fortune grants and few the gifts she sends us the lordly hireling often wants that freedom which defends us by law secured from lawless strife our house is our castellum thus blessed with all that is dear in life for lucre shall we sell em no every britons song should be  or give me death or liberty exit enter

wholly over i have lost my fancied greatness you your lover spite of all i could say your fathers gone to give his vote for trusty  we are undone condemned through life to be the slave and sloven we must eat raspins still and draw the oven  sally ah cruel fortune must i then despair and lose the only youth that is worth my care then all my dreams of happiness are flown still must i wear this linseywoolsey gown still without curtains sleep upon the floor and rival the miss patches now no more  song adieu to silks and satins to love and peace adieu each day in homely pattens i still must bake and brew each morn at early rising must twirl the hated mop and every thought disguising attend my fathers shop adieu etc  wife here comes young mr richard  i am afraid  heartbroken  i shall die   sally and i a maid    richard welcome my lovely sally  why so sad beauty and youth should be for ever glad  wife yes but our friends will one and all forsake us and now we have nothing left but this poor bakehouse my husband voted wrong  richard he acted right true to his trust his conduct seems more bright unawed unbiased he preserves his fame would every englishman could say the same  sir courtly was my friend to him i owe the little fortune which i offer now to aid his cause with warmth to take his part duty and gratitude impelled my heart but gratitude nor duty bid condemn that honor which so often springs from them your fathers merit sets him up to view and more enhances my esteem for you  song ah let it never with truth be said that public virtue droops her head that english faith should luckless prove or cross one english virgins love if in my sallys youthful heart her richard ever may claim a part this happy hour shall smiling prove that honor firmly fixes love  enter john well friends the poll is over  all is done sir courtly has thrown up and we have won  to richard i wish i could have granted your request but conscience bade me vote as i thought best  richard
