history of some of the effects of hard drinking  the sixth edition  by j c lettsom md frs and fsa  london printed by w darton and co no    gracechurchstreet and sold by c dilly in the poultry  mdccxcl  preface in the first volume of the memoirs of the medical society of london i described some of the unhappy effects of the too free indulgence of strong liquors my opinions have been disseminated by insertion into many public prints both at home and abroad and i have reason to conclude have been productive of essential benefit to the community to render this benefit still more extensive i have reprinted that part of the original essay more immediately applicable to the pernicious use of these liquors to which i have added some farther cautions and likewise a moral and physical thermometer the hint of which was suggested by a friend abroad it is formed to convey by a glance of the eye the sentiments i wish to impress upon the reader  london april       john coakley lettsom  this little performance was originally printed to give away but the demands becoming very numerous i have applied it to the benefit of the philanthropic society institued for the prevention of crimes and for a reform in the manners of the rising poor  the general outlines of the plan adopted by the society are to take miserable and destitute children from poor depraved parents and from the resorts of wicked people to cloth feed and educate them as orphans and thus by a total separation from their abominable connections and a redemption from the lowest depths of distress to restore them to civil community to which they were either lost or known only as its burdens nuisances and plunderers  although this society has been but a few months established there are already placed under the care of proper persons in hired houses conveniently situated at hackney several children of both sexes who a few weeks since were inhabitants of the most miserable abodes of vice and want but are now enjoying the blessings of a new life heightened by the prospects of acquiring an honorable support by their own industry  history of some of the effects of hard drinking after introducing the want of appetite for food arising from the indulgence of drinking strong liquors i cannot well dismiss the subject without adverting more fully to its painful influence upon the constitution which i have observed with more anxiety as the sufferers are often those of the more delicate part of the female sex whose habits of intemperance are not unfrequently introduced by those who should have been the guardians of their health  the miseries entailed by these indulgences differ much as to their progress and violence and even the symptoms vary so much as to admit of obvious distinctions  the first i shall notice as being generally less painful though equally permanent are the symptoms more especially attendant on persons who have early in life habituated themselves to drink freely of wine of various kinds and from their situations in life undergone a change of climate as from europe to the indies etc punchdrinkers likewise have been liable to similar complaints the first appearance of disease is loss of appetite which at length is so weakened and vitiated that after taking food before the return of the next meal a kind of heavy pain of the stomach with a constriction of the muscles of the abdomen come on and with a slight effort a sweetish brackish or acid fluid is thrown up and the pain and constriction for a short time subside for several years in this unhappy state the patient drags on a life rendered now and then more supportable either by renewed potations or exputations till at length the bodily and mental powers become impaired the object grows emaciated the whole body shrinks neither swelling nor dropsy appear though the countenance looks sallow the region of the liver is not enlarged and the liver itself seems less than natural the urine is not very high colored the faeces are hard and darkcolored the stomach will take and retain food but after receiving it it is oppressed and feels tightened or contracted in its dimensions the patient expresses it as if it were tied by a straight bandage the same sensation affects the intestines and the abdomen suffers such irregular constrictions as become evident to the external touch the muscles being drawn into irregular action the surface of the belly is diversified with protuberances and cavities sometimes the spasmodic strictures run transversely and raise this surface like waves of the sea the pain continues increasing to such excess that the miserable sufferer is obliged to press against a table or some hard body to mitigate his distress till vomiting brings a respite or he hastens this operation by thrusting his finger into the throat and thus relieves himself till the next reception of nourishment when the same tragedy is repeated the matter discharged is thin acrid sour sweet or brackish sometimes instead of constipation an occasional purging ensues and mitigates the pain whilst it subdues the constitution and after years of misery the victim slides into a fatal decay but long before this the powers of the mind have been debilitated and its recollection and actions impaired  the second train of distressful symptoms which i shall relate more generally succeed the free use of spirits or of wines with the admixture of spirits as madeira and especially where late hours and illicit amors have been superadded  the early symptoms of complaint are a pain and oppression about the pit of the stomach after eating or distension from fluids this pain extends to the breast and shoulders there are frequent eructations of wind which seem to burn the throat as they ascend these symptoms which are usual in affections of the liver and particularly in bilious effusions are at first so trivial as seldom to alarm the fears of the patient or he slightly mentions them as symptoms of the gout whilst he attempts to avert the present suffering by indulging more freely in the very cause of the mischief till repeated fillips of raw spirits or a dilution of the poison render existence miserable  the appetite now totally fails but an insatiable thirst continues and if it be not supplied with an exhilarating cordial the vital spirits instantly flag and such horrors take place as are dreadful even to a byestander the poor victim is so depressed as to fancy a thousand imaginary evils he expects momentarily to expire and starts up suddenly from his seat walks wildly about the room breathes short and seems to struggle for breath if these horrors seize him in bed when waking from slumber he springs up like an elastic body with a sense of suffocation and the horrors of frightful objects around him at the same time the pain of the stomach continues and augments the fight of wholesome plain food gives disgust instead of appetite drink is his cry or if hunger is excited it is after highseasoned salt or acrid nourishment  at this time if a dropsy or fatal jaundice do not terminate existence the legs shrink are swarthycoloured like the rest of the body and sometimes purple spots appear and disappear for many months the extremities feel sore to the touch and upon scratching them exude blood the thighs likewise shrink but the body and particularly about the region of the liver enlarges and the hardness of the liver may be frequently traced the face is nearly coppercoloured is emaciated sometimes with little suppurations which dry and turn scaly the breath smells like rotten apples and the morbus niger or vomitings of a fluid like that of coffeegrounds snatch the patient from complicated misery sometimes a purging or bloody discharges hasten the catastrophe  the third train of symptoms to be described is not consined to age or sex but is in general more frequently the attendant of the female sex  the persons liable to the symptoms have been those of delicate habits who have endeavored to overcome the nervous debility by the aid of spirits many of these have begun the use of these poisons from persuasion of their utility rather than from the love of them the relief however being temporary to keep up their effects frequent access is had to the same delusion till at length what was taken by compulsion gains attachment and a little drop of brandy or gin and water becomes as necessary as food the female sex from natural delicacy acquire this custom by slow degrees and the poison being admitted in small doses is slow in its operations but not less painful in its effects  the soberer class of tradesmen also who occasionally indulge in their sixpennyworth of brandy and water gradually slide into the same unhappy habits and entail upon their constitutions the same misery which i shall now introduce  the first appearance of indisposition very much resembles what has been last described and under the deception of the gout the fuel is heaped upon the fire till the delusion has been too long maintained to admit of retreat in general at least the attachment to the use of spirituous drinks becomes so predominant that neither threats nor persuasions are powerful enough to overcome it the miserable sufferer is so infatuated as in spite of locks and keys to bribe by high rewards the dependent nurse privately to procure it  but the concluding symptoms are very different from either of the foregoing histories frequently indeed the appetite for food vanishes but sometimes continues voracious and at the same time whilst the body is costive and no vomiting ensues the lower extremities grow more and more emaciated the legs become as smooth as polished ivory and the soles of the feet even glassy and shining and at the same time so tender that the weight of the finger excites shrieks and moaning and yet i have known that in a moments time heavy pressure has given no uneasiness the legs and the whole lower extremities lose all power of action wherever they are placed there they remain till moved again by the attendant the arms and hands acquire the same palsied state and the patients are rendered incapable of feeding themselves thus for years they exist with no material alteration in the size of the body or aspect of the countenance  whether they really undergo the agonies they appear to suffer i much doubt as at this period their minds appear idiotish they often shriek out with a vehemence that may be heard at a considerable distance but upon enquiring about the seat of pain they have been vague and indecisive in their answers when a cramp comes on the lower extremities involuntary motions draw up the legs and produce the most piercing shrieks and the features of the face altered by convulsive twitchings excite pain in a spectator for some months before they die these shrieks are more incessant and as violent as the strength will admit  they talk freely in the intervals of mitigation but of things that do not exist they describe the presence of their friends as if they saw realities and reason tolerably clear upon false premises  mostly before they die they take less food sometimes a purging succeeds of a thin substance and of a dark green color sometimes a vomiting of black matter but most generally they gradually sink from the accumulation of pain and debility there is rarely any fever they do not as in the preceding state fall into dropsies but usually become paralytic the breath is not offensive nor is there the same difficulty of breathing or horror of suffocation whether the imperceptible and gradual augmentation in the use of spirits is the cause of this difference i am not certain but the difference is considerable as must appear from their histories which i have drawn from actual observation  i would not however infer that every spiritdrinker acquires the symptoms of disease above related or that other diseases do not more frequently succeed this dangerous habit liver diseases of various kinds it is well known usually result from intemperance and dropsies often succeed but from some circumstances in the constitution or from the mode of indulgence in liquors the symptoms i have described have severally occurred where no dropsical affections have supervened there is something in sprituous liquors so injurious to the human frame that too much attention cannot be paid in discouraging the use of them many of the unhappy victims i have attended ascribe their sufferings to the unguarded advice of some medical practitioner who has under the idea of wine turning sour on the stomach permitted a little drop of brandy and water to be substituted seldom indeed a day passes without introducing me to the sick bed of some deluded object of misery and it is from the most decided conviction of the injury that i would guard every person from beginning with even a little drop of this fascinating poison which once admitted is seldom if ever afterward overcome whenever i hear the patient plead for some substitute for beer or wine under the supposition of their turning sour my fears are alarmed and my endeavors excited to pluck the unsuspicious patient from the brink of destruction this plea is never made till the exhilarating influence of spirit has been experienced and not a moment should be lost in warning such objects of their danger  some who avoid brandy have been induced to take rum from a vulgar opinion that it is more oily and balsamic the argument is erroneous for what balsamic qualities can empyreumatic oil contain others who condemn both brandy and rum make no objection to gin because they think it diuretic but so far from it that half the dropsies among the lower classes of the people originate or at least are confirmed by the use of this spirit they are all poisons and are nearly alike deleterious  when the effects of spirits on the constitution have not greatly contaminated it beyond the frequent recurrence of sickness and vomiting after interdicting spirits altogether the patient should be allowed to fix upon some one species of nutriment and whatever it is should be confined to it alone and that in the smallest quantities possible and at regular stated distances that the preceding portion may be properly digested before any addition be allowed when the stomach has thus acquired more tone either some new or an increase of the former nutriment may be admitted  i once attended a lady who could not retain any food on the stomach above an hour or two i requested her to fix upon some light nourishment that she could palate and she mentioned milk i then restrained her to four tablespoonfuls of it every six hours and afterward increased the quantity as the stomach could bear it from this she went to broth and thus gradually acquired such a state of the stomach as to bear the usual food of the family and for four years past she has enjoyed good health with the moderate use of a glass of wine or beer but not one drop of spirits  but in some cases where the habit of drams has been long continued the total and sudden omission of them has sunk the person into irretrievable debility here this pernicious custom must be left off gradually a man who usually drank twelve drams a day being convinced of his approaching misery took the resolution to wean himself from this poison he always drank out of one glass into this he daily dropped a drop of sealingwax by this means he had twelve drops less of spirit every day till at length his glass being filled with wax his habit was cured  the same advantage has been obtained by taking the dram or glass of cordial out of a quart bottle which is to be replenished each time with as much water and by this means gradually diluting the remaining liquor till its strength becomes wholly subdued and little more than the substituted water remains  painful indeed is this truth that when the indulgence in spirituous liquors is rendered habitual it is extremely difficult to overcome although the miserable object is persuaded that it clouds his reason debilitates his mental as well as corporeal faculties debars him of all the cheerful gratifications annexed to health and virtue yet so excessive are the debility and tremors of the body  and so horrid is the despondency of the mind after the exhilarating effects of these liquors have subsided that without a perseverance in determined efforts to vanquish this habit a repetition of the delusive poison will be indulged till resolution is too transient and weak to enable the victim to stop at the precipice which terminates his painful existence  may such however as have strength of resolution to reflect upon their danger be encouraged by an assurance that however great the debility may feel and strong the idea of dissolution may appear yet from mere debility alone life is not in danger and this is a certain fact that the longer and more frequently the evil habit is resisted that habit becomes less powerful whilst the strength of the constitution proportionally augments and thereby renders the victory less difficult than might at first appear and what exertions are more interesting and worthy of a rational being than those which substitute vigor and health of body for agitation tremor and pain and serenity and cheerfulness of mind for horror despondency and suicide  a moral and physical thermometer or a scale of the progress of temperance and intemperance liquors with their effects in their usual order scale of the effects
