the noble peasant a comic opera in three acts as performed at the theater royal in the haymarket  by thomas holcroft  dublin printed by j exshaw for the company of booksellers  m dcc lxxxiv  advertisement for the ease and convenience of the provincial theaters as well as to gratify the curiosity of the reader those passages and songs which were omitted in the representation are put between inverted commas scenes which often are tedious in the theater amuse in the closet and it would perhaps be an experiment not much to the advantage of most theatrical productions to restore on any stage passages which without great experience it would be difficult to give a reason why they should not be restored  the fable relates to times so remote that the task of supporting dialogue in which wit is necessary and yet of not offending the manners of those times is no easy one glory is often acquired in proportion as impediments are overcome far be it however from the author to insinuate in what degree he is entitled to this kind of praise that decision rests with the public and it cannot be in hands more equitable  ambitious of deriving fame from a source whence fame has so often flowed from poetry the author has paid an attention to the songs which he hopes the lovers of poetry will approve should they really possess excellence it is still to be expected it must oftcn remain unnoticed the poetical beauties of the songs in the duenna are frequently overlooked but they are not therefore the less beautiful in some instances poetry has here been obliged to give place to situation and other accidents and pretends to no charms  to mr shield the author of the music every praise every respect is due the universal admiration he has received on this as well as on various former occasions must give pleasure to every ingenuous mind for who can forbear being happy at the prosperity of a man whose head and whose heart are equally superior the noble peasant owes much very much of its success to the genius of the musician the airs not only possess sweetness and originality but they are learned likewise and what is far to be preferred they have passion and enthusiasm the very accompaniments are full of these inestimable qualities if friendship be not more than partial the first song in the third act is in particular in all its parts worthy of the greatest master harmony ever inspired and yet to single out this song only is doing great injustice to the rest there is little danger indeed in declaring such opinions for every one declares the same  to all those whose talents have contributed to the success of this opera from the greatest to the least the author returns his thanks he forbears to recite names because distinctions are difficult and because he cannot without an appearance of seeking to flatter mention them with all the respect he wishes should he mention them at all  upper marylebonestreet august         the words of the

comic opera act i overture shield scene i the scene is a forest  deer seen at a distance  the archers are hid beneath a very thick foliage  they are heard singing a glee and after singing a part of it appear and finish it enter adam bell will cloudeslee clym of the clough etc dressed in the old english fashion with their bows and arrows swords etc glee smith come my good fellows and quit the bower the sun no longer seems to lour your arrows bring your bows of yew with silver tips and silken clue and let the lusty bugle horn tell of the death of deer forlorn with fatal note resounding what though he be swift and bounding the horn the horn the lusty horn shall tell the death of deer forlorn adam well said and well sung my merry hearts but where is leonard where is the valiant stripling  does he not draw a good bow will what think thou clym is not he a child of valor   clym by my faith he is no flincher   will it must be a hard crown that the youngster cannot crack   clym how furiously the rascal laid about him in the battle   adam i tell thee what clym  mercy forsake me if i would not rather encounter the sheriff and all his men than be obliged hand to hand to fight this leonard   will by the lord he has an arm like the claws of a lion   adam ay boy and he has a lions heart too did you see in the fight how he brought down that termagant dane that man of might that alric  he that seemed determined to kill every body himself how he died grinding the dust and cursing his heathen gods to be so baffled by a boy   will yes and as if leonard cared little for such a victory he left another to take the spoil   adam ay prithee will who was that knight that was so nimble at running away with the slain alrics arms i had not seen him before in the battle   will seen him  no no  he will take care nobody shall see him in any danger  catch him there if you can  twas earl egbert   adam oh what the foolish braggart that we have played pranks with him and his purse so often   will ay he  i saw his beaver up  i could not mistake his unleavened face   clym but hark ye me boys tell me you that can what was the cause of this fray for though i have been fighting i hardly know what about   adam about  about a pair of blue eyes two rosy cheeks some certain  of ivory teeth with various items and and ceteras all summed up in the word woman   clym explain explain   adam why thus  anlaff the dane meets upon a certain day with edwitha the daughter of earl walter and is amazed at her beauty  well sir finding himself attacked by a terrible disease called sighing with dangerous symptoms he demands me this same lady fair in marriage that he may be able to eat his beef as heretofore earl walter however did not choose his daughter should be the danes doctor in this case   clym why so   adam why so  zounds clym have no religion  do not know that these redheads these carrotypolesare pagans   clym damn it i had forgot that   adam my frecklefaced gentleman takes this denial in dudgeon and turning on his heel vows vengeance  now neither earl walter nor his son harold are of the cuckoo breed they will not be pecked at  so the issue of this no marriage was the battle in question   will and anlaff instead of gaining a wise has lost his brother alric   clym ay and some few more  we left some on their backs that wontt be in a hurry to get up   will well well they may call us outlaws if they please but i say we are brave fellows and if not the most honorable we are at least as merry as our neighbors   song will cloudeslee shield i beneath the worn rock or upon the shorn grass where pipes the blythe lad or where trips the sweet lass by hawthorns that bloom or that bear the red berry in hail rain or sunshine we are happy and merry ii when clouds ride the mountains and winds rend the vales when murrains and mildews the shepherd bewails if scanty our store let us share it with pleasure the heart of the brave is the chest of his treasure adam but let me tell you my hearts harold may thank us for the victory that anlaff and his redheads and especially that alric with his twohanded sword bestirred themselves so stoutly that by the lord lads harolds men were little better than runaways when we came to the field   will well then  our assistance gained the battle  what now shall be our reward   clym hanging on the next tree if earl walter could catch us   adam why truly my boys there are dangerous complaints gone abroad against us your fat monks and your lean usurers have taken exception at us forresters and called us freebooters  for which reason the kings pardon would be a good thing   clym but how are we to get it   adam why i have a project   will ay  what is it   adam i will go to the castle disguised like a friar  there i shall learn what they say about the battle and whether they will be ready to thank us for the service we did them   clym thank us why zounds they did not know it was us did not we all go disguised   adam but we have tongues and they understand english  earl walter is a great man at court   clym but hark ye me adam suppose you should be discovered and there should be any foul play   adam there is no danger i have a friend there in a corner  besides i know how to a my part i will sing them jovial songs tell them merry tales and forgive them all their sins and i warrant i shall be a favorite in the family   clym nay i dont fear thee for thou art thoroughly instructed in the art and mystery of eating drinking and wenching and that is the trade of a friar   adam however i intend to go armed and sling my bugle horn across my shoulder do you watch round the skirts of the forest and in case of any accident i will wind the signal of good or ill success  but let leonard know the scheme as soon as you see him  he has a true heart and will never forsake a good cause   clym why to be sure he will fight  but he has one bad fault   adam ay  what is that   clym too scrupulous  too conscientious  he would not let me rob the old miserly abbot of whitby the other day  we almost quarrelled about it   adam oh he has not been long among us you know  he will mend   will well success

cheerful but memory will not let me  i know as well as thou do that sorrow will not cure a wound but knowing myself the cause of this unhappy broil the cheerful spirits which health and active youth bestow are all dispersed by fear and froward apprehension i am like a respited criminal that every moment dreads a confirmation of his sentence   ade pshaw edwitha i declare you dont deserve your happiness there are hundreds of ladies in little england that would give their brightest eye thus to have the gauntlet thrown and see themselves the happy subject of contention when young and valiant knights mount neighing steeds and ride in bright and burnished armor to the field  to hear the winding of the buglehorn the clattering of the horses hoofs and the prophetic buz of victory among the warriors oh were i the beauteous dame that could inspire such glorious strife i should think of nothing but roses and lilies venus and the graces  talk of nothing but helen and hector greeks and trojans  read nothing but ballads of beauteous ladies and valorous knights and sing em in my sleep  should  lord i should be so transported i dont know what i should do   edw this good cousin is said

harolds safe  edw this is enchantment adela it is sure some kind spirit sent to comfort me   ade i cannot tell how kind he may be but i have discovered the spirit come come from your hiding place mr  and let us know what and who you are adela goes toward a tuft of trees from whence   scene iii enter leonard with his flute edw was it you young swain that with such respondent sweetness echoed me   leo bows   ade ha that is as much as to say yes mimics his modest bow   edw such delightful melody in a poor peasant is surely wonderful   leo bows again and shakes his head   ade oh ho  that is as much as to say  no mimicking come come young man dont be over modest  if heaven has given you good gifts hold up your head and own it   edw but tell me truly  do you know any thing of my brothers fate  is he  is he safe   leo he is bows   edw then i am happy   ade there  there now  didnt i tell you so   edw and is he victorious is anlaff vanquished   leo he is  edwitha turns away as if to suppress the joy that overpowers her ade there there  didnt i tell you that too didnt i bid you dance and sing and  here young man  here is something for your good news  offers him money leo bows and refuses it thank you lady i am overpaid already   ade gadamercy aye indeed how so   leo by being a welcome messenger to such fair and gentle ladies   ade heyday  a peasant too  do you mind this edwitha this silly fellow refuses money and talks  i dont know how   edw tell me young swain where you learnt these happy tidings i it from report you speak or were you at the battle   leo i was at the battle   ade were you oh for heavens sake give us a description of it   leo how shall a simple peasant lady speak of such high deeds besides i saw but little of the combat   edw perhaps you joined the combatants and fought   leo bows   ade upon my word mr young man you are a very extraordinary kind of a person  what is your name   leo leonard   ade and  how many danes might you kill yourself   leo to speak of my own exploits were to undo with my tongue what i had achieved with my arm i and my companions came not to the field till it was late the battle was hot and then i fought among the rest   edw companions and did you go to fight for harold and edwitha   leo for harold and edwitha bows   edw what shall i say how shall i thank you but come come young swain to the castle and my father earl walter shall bestow rewards equal i hope to your deserts   leo the rewards i sought are already bestowed  harold is victorious and edwitha condescends to approve sighs   ade a sigh too observe his eyes edwitha  if you give him any further encouragement he will make love to you  well really he is a very likely fellow what a pity it is he is a peasant edwitha   edw it is indeed adela sighs   ade it is indeed adela mimicks her so so sigh for sigh  why don cupid seems disposed to make a pretty piece of work here aside come edwitha it is time to be gone i see  will you walk  fare you well young man fare you well  edwitha is very much obliged to you  she seems inclined to like the color of your hair too  but that the fates and destinies forbid significantly and so you  you must return home again and comfort pretty nancy or pretty peggy or  some other neat little linseywoolsey lass  and you will sing and play and tell em a pretty tale  i warrant they will listen  and do you hear dont  dont you be silly and dream either of paradise or purgatory but eat your curds and cream and honor your father and mother after your old fashion  you understand me  content is better than a downbed and the stars will be obeyed  there is many a precious stone trod under foot  every hero cannot be alexander  but these things cannot be helped  so farewell to you  come come edwitha   edw take this ring young swain wear it in remembrance of edwitha  come adela  heaven protect you sir and make you victorious in battle and fortunate in love   leo thanks gentle lady sweet lady from my heart dear lady i thank you  and while one drop of blood shall cherish this poor bosom will wear with thankfulness your favor  and so farewell  exit leonard scene iv adela and edwitha ade well really there is something very uncommon about this young man  a rustic dignity  a conscious kind of humble superiority  a firm step  a steady eye  a bold front  yes the warriors character is absolutely stamped upon his forehead   edw and that is surely magnanimity   ade so have i been told girl   rondeau adela shield the hero conscious of his worth amid tumultuous war sedate arms rage and danger sends them forth and seems to give decrees to fate when trumpets in the deafend ear with brazen throat and warlike breath would drown the trembling voice of fear and bid the coward look on death the hero conscious of his worth amid tumultuous war sedate arms rage and danger sends them forth and seems to give decrees to fate edw oh leonard wherefore should such a mind be called ignoble  ungenerous and unjust   ade but how now edwitha why surely girl you have more wit more pride than positively to love this peasant i can see the fellow has a handsome leg as well as you  can read the modest preeminence of his eye as quick  can construe all his latent virtues as truly  what of that  i cannot purchase every trinket i see and there are many that if i had them i could not wear because  they are unfashionable   edw more is the pity that modesty courage and virtue should be out of fashion   ade very true but this has been a pitiable subject ever since adam wore a beard  consider edwitha the respect due to yourself your father and your    edw nay adela prithee do not mistake me so widely  though i can see and cannot but admire in a poor peasant those exalted virtues which first made men noble yet i know my duty i must worship nobility in its titles and its outward honors for so the freejudging world and the haughty pride of lineal dignity demand  and i obey  though my heart may lament its destiny it never shall reproach me   ade why that is my brave girl  and yet methinks there is something exceedingly remantic in this sudden way of falling in love at first sight   edw nay adela if it even were love it is not at first sight   ade no indeed  aha what you are old acquaintances then   edw we never spoke till now but lately he has often crossed my way run before me to open gates chase the browzing ox and remove the straggling bramble from my path seeking to be noticed yet avoiding to be thanked once too he hung a garland on a style over which i was to pass   ade audacity  an enterprizing gentleman truly  but you did not touch his garland   edw no  i turned suddenly back to the castle   ade you did right  come come think of these things but as a dream remember the victory of your brother and smile at trifles   duet edwitha and adela rauzzini virtue bids us conquer passion hard the victory we obtain hard to vanquish inclination but the pleasure pays the pain if a moment virtue waver she restored to former peace proud that vice could not enslave her feels her energy increase exeunt scene v changes to the inside of the castle enter adam bell in a friars habit followed

autumn wakes spring ii when the swallows twittering sing of the lovely birth of spring when bridegrooms make our three bells ring ding dong ding  ding dong ding when the valleys face is seen veiled in

sears the rook when the kine stand in the brook when sleepy louts lose many a crook and codlings drop when trees are shook when salt mushrooms nightly spring and martins dip the dappled wing when the

friar you and i complete the proverb be merry and wise for you are merry and i am wise  and let me tell you i am not the only wise fool in the world   adam may be so  but pray you now expel some of your wisdom upon me and tell me how earl walter bears this dangerous absence of his son   fool oh sir with that gravity of deportment as should seem to say  i defy fate  if misfortune come i am no flincher  and then sir he strokes his beard and endeavors to put a good face on the matter  but i know him  he has it here  sick of the father  sir between ourselves  he has been  as melancholy  as a fiddle with one string  as restless as a cat in a cage  and as solemn as a blind baboon on good friday   adam but is he naturally thus grave and serious   fool oh no the old gentleman is a  very good sort of an old gentleman  when he is pleased  a sociable conversable comprehensible kind of an old lord enough  likes to have his own way  as most of your great lords do i observe   adam ay and little

midnight  happy as a lawyer in term time or a physician in november   adam but what if he were vanquished how then   fool then  why then sir the old gentleman would sit you down as mute and as motionless as a bell without a clapper  as silent  as a bagpipe without wind and as sedately dismal as a deaths head upon a tombstone   adam you abound in comparisons master motley   fool yes  they are part of my stock in trade and i love to keep a good assortment  can you tell why the world is like a fair   adam no    fool no  your finger to your lip then  listen and learn  the world is like a
