the coffeehouse politician or the justice caught in his own trap  a comedy as it is acted at the theater royal in lincolns end fields  written by mr fielding  london printed for j watts at the printingoffice in wildcourt near lincolns end fields mdccxxx  prologue spoken by mr paget in ancient greece the infant muses school where vice first felt the pen of ridicule with honest freedom and impartial blows the muse attacked each vice as it arose no grandeur could the mighty villain screen from the just satyr of the comic scene no titles could the daring poet cool nor save the great right honorable fool they spared not even the aggressors name and public villainy felt public shame long has this generous method been disused for vice has grown too great to be abused by power defended from the piercing dart it reigns and triumphs in the lordly heart while beaus and cits and squires our scenes afford justice preserves the rogues who weild the sword all satyr against her tribunals quashed nor lash the bards for fear of being lashed but the heroic muse who sings tonight through these neglected tracks attempts her flight vice clothed with power she combats with her pen and fearless dares the lion in his den then only reverence to power is due when public welfare is its only view but when the champions whom the public arm for their own good with power attempt their harm he sure must meet the general applause who against those traitors fights the public cause and while these scenes the conscious knave displease who feels within the criminal he sees the incorrupt and good must smile to find no mark for satyr in his generous mind epilogue spoken by mrs mullart rape upon rape what author ever chose a name so sure to make the fair his foes and ladies i can read in

commanded us and heard the dice into the street but there were two coaches with coronets on them at the door so we thought it proper not to go in   squeez you did right the laws are turnpikes only made to stop people who walk on foot and not to interrupt those who drive through them in their coaches  the laws are like a game at loo where a blaze of court cards is always secure and the knaves are the safest cards in the pack   staff we have taken up a man for a rape too   squeez what is he   staff i fancy he is some great man for he talks french sings italian and swears english   squeez is

ever to have done you the honor of dubbing mr justice i cannot see why you should be so incensed against me for i do not imagine you any otherwise an enemy to these amusements than a popish priest to sin or a doctor to disease   mrs squeez you are very civil sir to threaten to dub my husband before my face   ramb i ask pardon madam i did not know with whom i had the honor to be in company it was always against my inclination to affront a lady but a woman of your particular merit must have claimed the most particular respect   mrs squeez i should have expected no rudeness from a gentleman of

your acquaintance at a much greater danger than this prosecution which i believe you already see the malice of i hope madam i stand already acquitted in your opinion   mrs squeez i hope sir it will only appear to have been a frolic i must own i have been always a great enemy to force  since there are so many willing   ramb so i find there is no danger of a rape here  aside mrs squeez well child can you find any thing against this gentleman   squeez the woman is difficult of confessing in public but i fancy when i examine her in private i may get it out of her  so mr constable withdraw your
