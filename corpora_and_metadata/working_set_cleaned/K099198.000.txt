the mystery of the supposed cocklane ghost revealed etc  price one shilling  the mystery revealed containing a series of transactions and authentic testimonials respecting the supposed cocklane ghost which have hitherto been concealed from the public   since none the living dare implead arraign him in the person of the dead dryden london printed for w bristow in st pauls churchyard mdccxlii  the mystery revealed etc it is somewhat remarkable that the reformation which in other countries banished superstition in england seemed to increase the credulity of the vulgar at a time when bacon was employed in restoring true philosophy king james was endeavoring to strenghen our prejudices both by his authority and writings scot glanville and coleman wrote and preached with the same design and our judges particularly sir matthew hales gave some horrid proofs of their credulity  since that time arguments of this kind have been pretty much rejected by all but the lowest class the vulgar have indeed upon several occasions called for justice upon supposed criminals and when denied have often exercised it themselves their accusations however in general fell upon the poor the ignorant the old or the friendless upon persons who were unable to resist or who because they knew no guilt were incapable of making an immediate defense  but of all accusations of this nature few seem so extraordinary as that which has lately engrossed the attention of the public and which is still carrying on at an house in cocklane near smithfield the continuance of the noises the numbers who have heard them the perseverance of the girl and the atrociousness of the murder which she pretends to detect are circumstances that were never perhaps so favorably united for the carrying on of imposture before the credulous are prejudiced by the childs apparent benevolence her age and ignorance wipe off the imputation of her being able to deceive and one or two more who pretend actually to have seen the apparition are ready to strengthen her evidence  upon these grounds a man otherwise of a fair character as will shortly appear is rendered odious to society shunned by such as immediately take imputation for guilt and made unhappy in his family without having even in law a power of redress few characters more deserve compassion than one that is thus branded with crimes without an accuser attacked in a manner at once calculated to excite curiosity and spread defamation and all without a power of legal vindication if a person in such circumstances disregards calumny and appears unconcerned he is then accused of obstinacy and impudence if he shrinks at the reproach his timidity is construed as a symptom of his guilt a writer of the life of urban grandier who was maliciously accused and burnt for being a magician thus describes his situation if he spoke like an orator says the historian his accusers observe that the devil inspired his eloquence if he was silent they looked upon it as a tacit avowal of his guilt when he groaned aloud under the torture they called it obstinacy when he fainted away they asserted that his familiar had rendered him insensible in short if the credulous are resolved to suspect even opposite and improbable circumstances will serve to awaken suspicion and then calumny shall grow though incapable of being traced to the author or though apparently propagated by malice resentment or imbecility  it is however a great instance of the good sense of the public upon the present occasion that even the vulgar have scarce given the smallest degree of assent to this deception though no scheme was ever laid with more low cunning and carried on with more indefatigable application yet it has found but very few partisans even among the very lowest of the people who are ready enough to believe any tale of this nature they readily perceived that it was but a trick they were only amazed at what could be the motives for so black an imputation and probably desired information they heard the persons character who had been accused very freely treated in the news papers and perhaps were not unwilling to believe a crime against a man whom they had been taught to dislike i shall therefore upon the present occasion give the public a more satisfactory account of this whole transaction than has hitherto transpired and that without partiality or prejudice i shall repeat nothing as a truth that will not upon the closest examination be found strictly so living witnesses shall be appealed to in proof of each assertion more studious of defense than recrimination nothing is asserted that even the opponents will not confess it is the duty of every honest man to exculpate the guiltless and enlighten the public and these are the only motives for my present publication  the circumstances that gave rise to this affair are in short as follows in the year      mr k  was married to miss e  l  of l  in the county of norfolk and during the short time she lived with him they enjoyed all the happiness a married state could bestow but in about eleven months after their cohabitation mr k  having taken the post office at s  in norfolk he and his wife were scarce settled there a month when she died in childbed this fatal accident therefore determined him to lay aside all thoughts of public business but as he had engaged for a year certain at the post office he was obliged to keep house till the expiration of that term during this interval miss f  l  the person whose ghost is supposed to appear and who was sister to his late wife and lived with her as a companion at her decease continued to reside with mr k  in the character of his housekeeper the frequent intercourse arising from such a situation soon produced a very tender affection between them mr k  however finding that by the strictness of the canon law he was not allowed to indulge his passion as his deceased wifes issue by him was born alive though it died a short time after birth took a resolution of coming up to london with intentions of purchasing a place in some public office and in hopes of finding a cure from absence and dissipation their affections however seemed to increase by absence he constantly received letters from the young lady filled with repeated entreaties to spend the rest of their lives together and with positive protestations of coming to london after him even on foot if he did not procure her a more creditable conveyance these instances of her regard and resolution awakened all his passion and at last induced mr k  to comply with her solicitations thus at once to gratify his own inclination as well as here is as the canon law would have allowed him to marry her had there been no issue born alive from his former wife he thought himself at least in foro conscientiae permitted to gratify his passion nor could he see why so small an obstacle as the birth of a child that so short a time survived its mother should prevent his happiness  during their residence at s  they had contracted an acquaintance with one mr l  a gentleman who lived some years in the same neighborhood to this gentleman who was now settled in london mr k  had recourse as a friend and understanding that he soon purposed spending a fortnight in norfolk about whitsuntide      mr k  communicated the whole affair to him showed him her letters and entreated him if she persisted in her resolution of coming to london to conduct her up to town upon his return the gentleman complied and upon his going into the country waited upon miss f  informed her of his instructions and as his principal business lay at a village about  0 miles distant from her where he intended to stay eight or ten days he desired to be acquainted with her final resolution by letter accordingly three or four days before his intended return to town he received a letter from her requesting him to meet her at s  m a market town exactly midway between them here they agreed to go for london that night and as the yarmouth stage coach was going then for london they took that opportunity and arrived in town at about five in the evening  mr k  not being exactly apprized of the day of her arrival was at that time at his country lodgings at greenwich upon which miss f  took a pair of oars and went to him there as it was mr k  s intention for the future to live with her as his wife he had declared himself a married man to all his acquaintance long before her arrival nor were any of them surprised at his bringing home a woman whom he acknowledged as his lawful wife she was always called by his name and ever treated and considered as a wife by him and from their mutual happiness and affection the contrary would have never been known had not her relations who by all the ties of honor and generosity were concerned to keep it a secret taken every opportunity of divulging it to the world and from a pretended regard for her reputation endeavored to publish her shame  as mr k  could not find an house to his mind he took her to his lodgings near the mansion house where however they did not continue long for to use the expression of a gentleman who published an account in one of the public news papers signed j a l the people of the house where they lodged did not altogether approve their conduct and indeed it would be surprising if they had for mr k  was obliged to arrest his landlord for above twenty pounds that he had lent him a step which it is probable this same landlord did not entirely approve  from this lodging they removed to mr p  s in cocklane near west smithfield but it soon unfortunately happened that his present landlord had the very same cause of dislike to mr k  that his former landlord had money was borrowed by this as well as the former and the same slow disposition to repay it appeared in the new as well as the old mr k  was therefore obliged to have recourse once more to law and to sue his new landlord for twelve pounds after many vain solicitations for payment this as may naturally be expected created uneasiness and disturbances between them and the quarrel rose to such an height that at last he left mr p  s house at an hours warning and took another lodging at a jewellers in the same neighborhood an inconvenient apartment indeed but which he expected would serve for a short time till an house which he had taken in bartletcourt was fitted up  thus far then we see nothing so very culpable in the conduct of mr k  there was neither inveigling nor incest in the case as the world has been taught to believe the ladys coming to london was almost against his consent and his living with her after as his wife was what the canon law would have allowed had it not been for the child by his former wife which was born alive this light circumstance prevented a public marriage but to remedy this the young lady and he took every precaution to live faithfully together and to unite their friendship by the ties also of interest they made their wills mutually in each others favor mr k  s fortune was considerable hers only amounted to a bare hundred pound so that if there was any advantage on either side it was on the part of the young lady yet how has this been misrepresented to the public by the same gentleman in the news papers who signs himself j a l he seems to intimate that the lady was inveigled from her friends and then decoyed into making a will perjudicial to her own interests but who is this person who so disinterestedly espouses the cause of public justice and takes this open method of aspersing mr k  there is a gentleman of k  s acquaintance the initials of whose name are these letters and whether he really was or not concerned in the publication will be shortly made appear in a due course of justice  if there be any thing very culpable in mr k  s behavior the public has now seen it perhaps a rigid moralist would censure him in some instances of it but certain i am there are few who conscious of their own transgressions could not pardon him what the reader has seen however is the only indefensible part of his character in all other respects he was entirely blameless and what follows of his conduct is as open and as well attested as any evidence that was ever given and which instead of reproach will perhaps merit approbation  at his new lodging he had not remained above a week when mrs l  was taken ill a physician was immediately sent for who had occasionally visited her before an apothecary was employed and every precaution taken that tenderness could suggest but the reader will best determine on the manner of her treatment by the following certificate drawn up by the physician himself and signed by him and the apothecary  some time in november      i visited mr k  at his lodgings at mr p  s in cocklane and was then retained to attend the deceased f   in her expected labor she being then in the sixth month of her pregnancy in the course of the following months i visited her occasionally twice or thrice in the same house on the   th of january following i received a message from mr k  about nine in the morning that the lady was ill and wanted my assistance i found them removed from p  s to an inconvenient apartment in the neighborhood i found the lady deceived by an acute pain in the back into an opinion that she was actually in labor but on my declaring the contrary found not only she but the women about her were extremely uneasy still suspecting i had formed a wrong judgment after a few hours mr k  informed me he had taken a house in bartletscourt near redlyon street clerkenwell and if i thought there was no danger would be glad to remove her thither i told him there were no signs of labor but that from the symptoms she would probably be ill some time as i apprehended an eruptive fever though i had not at that time any suspicion of the smallpox as i did not know she had never had them in the afternoon i attended the deceased in a coach having properly secured her from receiving any injury by cold to the house mr k  having been before sent to prepare the apartment i had her immediately put to bed ordered her to be blooded and prescribed such cordial medicines as i thought were proper to throw out an eruption a nurse was immediately provided and all necessaries for the care of the sick patient the next morning i met mr jones her apothecary by appointment the eruption began to appear and from the violent lumbago of the day before and other symptoms we prognosticated a confluent smallpox of a very virulent nature mr k  was informed that in her situation the most favorable species of that distemper would be extremely hazardous and that here is being a bad sort the danger was very great we endeavored to assist nature by early blisterings and administered medicines of a cordial nature the symptoms were for the first four or five days rather favorable but when maturation should have been performed the pulse flagged the fever sunk and the whole eruption put on a wharty pallid appearance and as she could not swallow but with difficulty she could but seldom be prevailed on to take any thing she was herself sensible of her danger and mr k  was told she could not survive three or four days he was advised therefore to procure a minister to visit her which was accordingly done for the last two days no persuasion could bring her to taste any thing so that for near fifty hours before she died she hardly swallowed a pint of any fluid whatever and that only when myself or the apothecary were present to administer it to her the last morning of her life we found her extremely low her eyes sunk her speech failing and her intellects very imperfect we told mr k  she could not then live twelve hours  accordingly a short time after we left her her speech was wholly taken from her she became senseless a little convulsed and expired in the evening viz on the  d of feb       t c the foregoing is a true relation of the case of f   which we who attended her in her illness are ready to attest as witness our hands tho cooper m d northumberlandstreet charing cross ja jones apothecary graftonstreet soho  feb        by this we find the lady taken ill of a disorder in itself extremely dangerous still more so at her mature time of life but most of all so as the patient was now far advanced in her pregnancy we see her treated in the most judicious manner by persons of learning and credit her danger prognosticated with judgment and accuracy and her disorder going through all the regular but fatal stages peculiar to the smallpox alone together with her death foretold and prepared for four days before it happened  after such an attestation we may judge what credit is to be given to the supposed ghost when among the rest of her answers she asserts that she was poisoned but three hours before she died it here appears she swallowed nothing but in the presence of the physician at least fifty hours before her death and in fact there was no great necessity to poison her if there had been such an intention and if she could swallow when the doctor and apothecary both joined in asserting she could not live twelve hours and when the symptoms of approaching death but too visibly promised to anticipate the operations of even the strongest poison so as to make the perpetration needless  after such a full vindication therefore the reader may judge what credit is to be given to the calumny of the person who subscribes himself r  b  a man at best  but i will have more tenderness to his character than he had to that of mr k  it is enough to observe that he was connected with her relations and saw nothing that he relates there can be no credit therefore given to this man when he assures the public that she was purely or in a fair way of doing well the day before she died  in fact so far from being so that she perceived herself the approaches of death and prevailed on mr k  to send for one mr m  s an eminent attorney of her acquaintance to examine her will in mr k  s favor and if not found a good one to draw it over anew upon mr m  s declaring the will to be good she asked this gentleman if it could not be made still more strongly in mr k  s favor to which he replied in the negative upon which declaring her satisfaction mr k  asked her if she would choose to give any thing to any of her relations to which she replied no he then desired to know if she chose to divide her clothes among her sisters to which she answered with some emotion i have nothing to give to any one but you she was at that time sensible and surely had she herself suspected any foul treatment she would never have carried her affection so far as to reward the cause of her destruction  but she was also attended by a divine of the church of england mr a  a gentleman equally remarkable for his benevolence learning and morals he was a witness to mr k  s treatment and her behavior he declares and has often declared that never during the time of his visits did he see a grief more expressive than in mr k  nor a tenderness more affecting than in the deceased  as soon as she died mr k  sent her sister who lived in pall mall the earliest notice ordered an undertaker to make as good a coffin as he could both lined and covered but being apprehensive of a prosecution if he gave her his own name upon it and being unwilling to give her any other he desired that no name should be fixed but afterward when called upon for to have her name registered finding himself obliged to give some name he gave her his own being determined she should not suffer reproach whatever might be the result her funeral was as decent as his circumstances could permit and her sister who was present wept over the corpse for some time before the coffin was screwed down by which it farther appears what credit should be given to the aforesaid b  when he says that her sister was deprived of the pleasure of seeing her dear sisters body as the coffin had been screwed down some time before she came to the house her sister wept for some time over the body while yet exposed and the coffin being then screwed down she attended it with the company to the vault in st j  clerkenwell and seemed at that time well satisfied with her sisters treatment mr k  upon their return offered her any part of the clothes of the deceased or the whole if she chose them to which she replied that she looked upon mr k  s behavior to her sister in the same light as if they had been actually married and that he was welcome to all that he was possessed of belonging to her sister  such is the plain narrative of the behavior of mr k  to miss l  not supported by mere assertion but by facts that will bear the strictest scrutiny not by witnesses remote or obscure but by persons of undoubted credit candor and veracity not produced as supporters of a controversy for the accusation is too ridiculous to admit one but mentioned in order to carry conviction and indeed it was happy for him that his conduct was observed by a greater number of persons than are generally present upon such occasions his behavior could admit of no suspicion and there were no suspicious characters concerned in the transaction  a person who had behaved in so fair and open a manner might surely have no reason to expect reproach upon this affair he might rest in security that no accusation or calumny arising from his former conduct could affect him now but he was attacked from a quarter that no person in his senses could in the least have imagined in a manner that but to mention would have excited the laughter of thousands after an interval of two years all of a sudden he was surprised with the horrid imputation of being a murderer of having murdered the person he held most dear upon earth of having murdered her by poison and who is his accuser why a ghost the reader laughs yet ridiculous as the witness is groundless as the accusation it has served to make one man completely unhappy the slightest evils by frequent repetition at last become real misfortunes and the imputation of great crimes however unsupported often blacken a character more than the commission of smaller ones  i would not choose to pall the reader with a repetition of transactions which he has already heard too often repeated but the story of the ghost is in brief as follows  for some time a knocking and scratching has been heard in the night at mr p  ss where mr k  and mrs l  formerly lodged to the great terror of the family and several methods were tried to discover the imposture but without success this knocking and scratching was generally heard in a little room in which mr p  ss two children lay the eldest of which was a girl about twelve or thirteen years old the purport of this knocking was not thoroughly conceived till the eldest child pretended to see the actual ghost of the deceased lady mentioned above when she had seen the ghost a weak ignorant publican also who lived in the neighborhood asserted that he had seen it too and mr p  s himself the gentleman whom mr k  had disobliged by suing for money he also saw the ghost about the same time the girl saw it without hands in a shroud the other two saw it with hands all luminous and shining there was one unlucky circumstance however in the apparition though it appeared to three several persons and could knock scratch and flutter yet its coming would have been to no manner of purpose had it not been kindly assisted by the persons thus haunted it was impossible for a ghost that could not speak to make any discovery the people therefore to whom it appeared kindly undertook to make the discovery themselves and the ghost by knocking gave its assent to their method of wording the accusation thus there was nothing illegal on any side mr k  s character was blackened without an accuser the persons haunted only asked questions no doubt merely from curiosity without any assertion that could be reprehended and answers by knocking could by no means be looked upon as a legal cause of impeachment thousands who believed nothing of the matter came in order if possible to detect its falsehood or satisfy curiosity and the words poison and murder being frequently joined with the name of the supposed offender that name became every where public joined to an accusation which whether believed or not in itself is to a sensible mind sufficient misery to become every where remarkable by imputed guilt is certainly a state of uneasiness that only falls short of a consciousness of real villainy  when therefore the spirit taught the assistants or rather the assistants had taught the spiit for that could not speak that mr k  was the murderer the road lay then open and every night the farce was carried on to the amusement of several who attended with all the good humor which the spending one night with novelty inspires they jested with the ghost soothed it flattered it while none was truly unhappy but him whose character was thus repeatedly rendered odious and trifled with merely to amuse idle curiosity  to have a proper idea of this scene as it is now carried on the reader is to conceive a very small room with a bed in the middle the girl at the usual hour of going to bed is undressed and put in with proper solemnity the spectators are next introduced who sit looking at each other suppressing laughter and wait in silent expectation for the opening of the scene as the ghost is a good deal offended at incredulity the persons present are to conceal theirs if they have any as by this concealment they can only hope to gratify their curiosity for if they show either before or when the knocking is begun a too prying inquisitive or ludicrous turn of thinking the ghost continues usually silent or to use the expression of the house miss fanny is angry the spectators therefore have nothing for it but to sit quiet and credulous otherwise they must hear no ghost which is no small disappointment to persons who have come for no other purpose  the girl who knows by some secret when the ghost is to appear sometimes apprizes the assistants of its intended visitation it first begins to scratch and then to answer questions giving two knocks for a negative and one for an affirmative by this means it tells whether a watch when held up be white blue yellow or black how many clergymen are in the room though in this sometimes mistaken it evidently distinguishes white men from negroes with several other marks of sagacity however it is sometimes mistaken in questions of a private nature when it deigns to answer them for instance the ghost was ignorant where she dined upon mr k  s marriage how many of her relations were at church upon the same occasion but particularly she called her father john instead of thomas a mistake indeed a little extraordinary in a ghost but perhaps she was willing to verify the old proverb that it is a wise child that know its own father however though sometimes right and sometimes wrong she pretty invariably persists in one story namely that she was poisoned in a cup of purl by red arsenic a poison unheard of before by mr k  in her last illness and that she heartily wishes him hanged  it is no easy matter to remark upon an evidence of this nature but it may not be unnecessary to observe that the ghost though fond of company is particularly modest upon these occasions an enemy to the light of a candle and always most silent before those from whose rank and understanding she could most reasonably expect redress when a committee of gentlemen of eminence for their rank learning and good sense were assembled to give the ghost a fair hearing then one might have thought would have been the time to knock loudest and to exert every effort then was the time to bring the guilty to justice and to give every possible method of information but in what manner she behaved upon this test of her reality will better appear from the committees own words than mine their advertisement runs thus i think it proper to acquaint the public that the following account of the proceedings of the committee of gentlemen who met at my house on monday evening in order to enquire into the reality of the supposed visitation of a departed spirit at a house in cocklane is alone authentic and was drawn up with the concurrence and approbation of the assembly while they were present and that the account in the ledger of this day contains many circumstances not founded in truth  ste aldrich feb        on this night many gentlemen eminent for their rank and character were by the invitation of the rev mr aldrich of clerkenwell assembled at his house for the examination of the noises supposed to be made by a departed spirit for the detection of some enormous crime  about ten at night the gentlemen met in the chamber in which the girl supposed to be disturbed by a spirit had with proper caution been put to bed by several ladies they sat rather more than an hour and hearing nothing went down stairs where they interrogated the father of the girl who denied in the strongest terms any knowledge or belief of fraud  the supposed spirit had before publicly promised by an affirmative knock that it would attend one of the gentlemen into the vault under the church of st john clerkenwell where the body is deposited and give a token of her presence there by a knock upon her coffin it was therefore determined to make this trial of the existence or veracity of the supposed spirit  while they were enquiring and deliberating they were summoned into the girls chamber by some ladies who were near her bed and who had heard knocks and scratches when the gentlemen entered the girl declared that she felt the spirit like a mouse upon her back and was required to hold her hands out of bed from that time though the spirit was very solemnly required to manifest its existence by appearance by impression on the hand or body of any present by scratches knocks or any agency no evidence of any preternatural power was exhibited  the spirit was then very seriously advertised that the person to whom the promise was made of striking the coffin was then about to visit the vault and that the performance of the promise was then claimed the company at one went into the church and the gentleman to whom the promise was made went with one more into the vault the spirit was solemnly required to perform its promise but nothing more than silence ensued the person supposed to be accused by the spirit then went down with several others but no effect was perceived upon their return they examined the girl but could draw no confession from her between two and three she desired and was permitted to go home with her father  it is therefore the opinion of the whole assembly that the child has some art of making or counterfeiting particular noises and that there is no agency of any higher cause    such an account will convince those who are under the influence of reason but nothing can gain over some who from their infancy have been taught to believe but not to think to convince such it were to be wished that the committee had continued their scrutiny a night or two longer by which means the impostor would in all probability be caught in the fact or at least more thoroughly detected for if the ghost persisted in such company to continue silent it would then be obvious that it was afraid of the discovery it pretended to aim at or if it continued to knock or scratch the noises by explaining themselves could not long frustrate a judicious enquiry  but as it is the ghost still continues to practice as before and in some measure remains undetected and it is probable that she will thus continue for a much longer time to exhibit among friends who desire no detection or among the curious whose pleasure is in proportion to the deception the ghost knows perfectly well before whom to exhibit she could as we see venture well enough to fright the ladies or perhaps some men about as courageous as ladies and as discerning but when the committee had come up and gathered round the bed it was no time then to attempt at deception the ghost was angry and very judiciously kept her hunters at bay  but let not the reader imagine that i would seriously produce formal arguments to refute an accusation which upon the first blush answers itself what was once said to a writer who drew up a book to prove the iniquity of the inquisition might in such a case be applied to me men said he who read books of controversy are already convinced of the absurdity you undertake to refute while those who believe such falsehoods never examine their own opinions and will consequently never read yours  the question in this case therefore is not whether the ghost be true or false but who are the contrivers or what can be the motives for this vile deception to attempt to assign the motives of any action is not so easy a task as many imagine a thousand events have risen from caprice pride or mere idleness which an undiscerning spectator might have attributed to reason resentment and close laid design it would not therefore become me who have been now endeavoring to vindicate innocence to lay the blame of this imposture on any individual upon earth though never so rationally to be suspected all i shall say is that as the reader may remember mr k  has many who owe him an ill will his landlord at one house whom he arrested for money lent him had cause of resentment his lardlord in cocklane the father of the child whom he was obliged to sue from similar motives was it is to be supposed willing enough to retaliate the supposed injury but above all mrs l  s relations who had filed a bill in chancery against him just two months before this infernal agent appeared to strengthen their plea this lawsuit between him and the family of the deceased is of a domestic nature and therefore unfit at present to be laid before the public all that is necessary to be mentioned is that their animosity has been carried to the highest pitch and that since its commencement they have pursued him with implacable resentment what may be the justice of his cause or of their anger the proper judges and not the public are to determine but whether it goes for or against him the world may be assured that the whole true state of this chancery suit as far as is consistent with law will be very minutely laid before them upon a proper occasion for the present it is sufficient to observe that it was commenced in november last while mr k  was upon a journey for his brother and that when he returned to put in his appearance he soon found a prosecution of a much more terrible nature commenced against him more terrible as unexpected and more dangerous as the cause was unknown  i have now as briefly and indeed as tenderly as i could stated the whole of this most surprising transaction and the reader by this time sees how far mr k  is culpable he sees him living affectionately with a woman as his wife whom the laws of nature allowed him to love but the strictness of the canon law forbade him to marry he sees every possible method taken to preserve this womans reputation and life and the most reputable persons produced as witnesses of her end he sees men of the highest rank both for birth character and learning joined to acknowledge the whole of the pretended ghost as an imposition upon the public and lastly he sees those who pretend to bear witness to the accusation persons of a mixed reputation of gross ignorance great cruelty and what is more armed with resentment against him i would not wish however to turn the popular resentment upon any particular person but i think it my duty to divert it some where from the guiltless  but still it seems something extraordinary how this imposition could be so long carried on without a discovery however when we compare it to some others which have successfully deceived the public a yet longer time our wonder will be in some measure diminished it was the observation of erasmus that whenever people flock to see a miracle they are generally sure of seeing a miracle they bring an heated imagination and an eager curiosity to the scene of action give themselves up blindly to deception and each is better pleased with having it to say that he had seen something very strange than that he was made the dupe of his own credulity there are many alive now who must i suppose remember the famous impostor richard hathaway whose case is recorded in the state trials this ignorant creature deceived the public both successfully and long he vomited in public crooked pins which he had previously swallowed in private he accused an innocent person of magic he pretended to fast for a month together and even in this deceived his guardians with twenty other feats by which means the person he accused was actually imprisoned and stood her trial at guildford assizes the circumstances were strong but then was not the time for burning for witchcraft as about an age before the poor woman was acquitted and her accuser ordered to prison in her stead hathaway was consigned to the care of an apothecary who lived in guildford if i remember and here guarded by a maid who pretended to be sorry for his situation and took part in his distress to her therefore he confessed all his impostures and the apothecary actually detected him at last through an hole in his chamber wall either hiding more pins in his mouth or making an hearty meal upon provisions the maid had stole for him richard however though put in the pillory as an impostor had many partisans of credit and reputation and some were so credulous as to suppose him sincere even after his own confession to the contrary  the people believed in richard but there never was an instance in which they were in general so averse to imposture as in the present attempt to deceive them it is not known however what effect a continuance of those endeavors if not silenced by proper methods may have it is easy to conceive how much credulity is wrought upon by perseverance even pious and orthodox divines themselves have been known to give credit to the strangest falsehoods of this kind and glanville declares his solemn belief in a ghost whose only business consisted in playing tricks and clattering plates and trenchers  in fact the geople can at last be taught to believe any thing and may probably by perseverance be taught to believe this nor can i avoid deploring the easiness with which some whose duty it is to guide them from error suffer themselves to be led into it a story that i am going to relate will serve as an instance how far the public may deceive themselves and how far even a protestant divine may unknowingly help the imposture the account is given us by adrian regenvolscius a protestant divine in a work entitled a chronological system of history respecting the reformation in sclavonia printed in utrecht      p    he mentions it as a transaction for the truth of which he can vouch and his prudence and the historians veracity are confirmed still farther by voetius one of the most eminent theologicians of his time and who was himself the editor the passage is this  in the number of these obstacles to the reformation in poland which we have already mentioned we may add another namely about the year      god permitted the appearance of a certain spirit at first it could not be said whether it was black or white to delude several from the true faith after the old superstitions there was a certain girl whose name was bietka who was courted by a young man called zachary they were both natives of weilam and had received their education there this youth though in deacons orders and also soon expecting to be priested was nevertheless resolved to marry bietka and accordingly they mutually plighted a promise to each other but his father in consideration of the rank which he held in the church prevented his marriage upon which he became melancholy and soon after hanged himself a short time after his death a spirit appeared to the disconsolate bietka which pretended to be the soul of zachary her lover assuring her that he was sent by god to apprize her of his displeasure at the rashness of his death and that as she had been the principal cause of his temerity he was come to accomplish his promise to her and to marry her this false spirit knew perfectly well how to cajole this poor girl by promising to enrich her so that he at length persuaded her that he was in reality the spirit of her lover and she accordingly plighted him her marriage vow the noise of this extraordinary match between a woman and a spirit was quickly spread over the whole country and the curious from every quarter flocked in to be witness of so extraordinary an affair  many of the polish nobility who believed in the honesty of the spirit became intimately acquainted with him and even many of them brought him home to their houses by these means bietka amassed a large sum of money and so much the more as the spirit would not return an answer nor speak to a single person nor foretell the smallest occurrence without his wifes consent the spirit lived a whole year in the house of the sieur trepka intendant of cracovia from thence going from house to house he went at last to reside with a certain widow lady whose name was wlodkow where he remained for the space of two years and there played all the tricks of which he was capable the principal are as follow he told all things past and present he talked in favor of the roman catholic religion and assured his auditors that the reformers were all damned he would not even permit one of them to approach him for he considered them as unworthy his conversation he rather persisted in assuring his audience that their only study was novelty and not reformation and thus he brought back many again to popery  hitherto not a single creature had perceived that this spirit was the devil nor would it have ever been known had it not been for some polanders who going to rome in the year of jubilee   00 spread the news of the spirit through the whole country a certain italian who understood magic hearing this report among others and being informed that the spirit had now exhibited five years recollected that he had lost a spirit about that time which he had long kept confined near his person this magician therefore went to poland and waiting upon dame wlodkow demanded his property to the astonishment of all the spectators he insisted that this devil which had fled from him should be restored back with which reasonable request the lady instantly complied he once more therefore shut up this malicious spirit in a ring and brought him back to italy assuring the people that had the devil been permitted to stay in poland much longer he would have drawn down numberless miseries upon the nation  one would think that a story of this nature could hardly gain credit and yet it deceived a whole nation for five years successively what is still more surprising it deceived a protestant divine otherwise of sense and of learning i cannot avoid thinking that there are several similar circumstances between this polish ghost and the ghost of cocklane the ghost at cocklane answered questions so did zachary the cocklane ghost is visited by the nobility so was zachary the cocklane ghost plays tricks so did zachary the cocklane ghost follows a girl so did zachary there is one circumstance however in which the parallel will not hold good zachary was believed to be a real ghost by a protestant divine but i fancy no protestant divine can be found among us so much the old woman as to lend even a moments assent to the ghost in cocklane
