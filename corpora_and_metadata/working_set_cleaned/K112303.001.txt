sir may it please you to pardon the boldness of a stranger to your person if upon the encouragement of common fame he presumes so much upon your candor as to lay before you this account of his travels as the scene of them is not only remote but for the most part little frequented also so there may be some things in them new even to you and some possibly not altogether unuseful to the public and that just veneration which the world pays as to your general worth so especially to that zeal for the advancement of knowledge and the interest of your country which you express upon all occasions gives you a particular right to whatever may any way tend to the promoting these interests as an offering due to your merit i have not so much of the vanity of a traveller as to be fond of telling stories especially of this kind nor can i think this plain piece of mine deserves a place among your more curious collections much less have i the arrogance to use your name by way of patronage for the too obvious faults both of the author and the work yet dare i avow according to my narrow sphere and poor abilities a hearty zeal for the promoting of useful knowledge and of any thing that may never so remotely tend to my countries advantage and i must own that ambition of transmitting to the public through your hands these essays i have made toward those great ends of which you are so deservedly esteemed the patron this has been my design in this publication being desirous to bring in my gleaning here and there in remote regions to that general magazine of the knowledge of foreign parts which the royal society thought you most worthy the custody of when they chose you for their president and if in perusing these papers your goodness shall so far distinguish the experience of the author from his faults as to judge him capable of serving his country either immediately or by serving you he will endeavor by some real proofs to show himself  sir your most faithful devoted humble servant w dampier  the preface before the reader proceed any further in the perusal of this work i must bespeak a little of his patience here to take along with him this short account of it it is composed of a mixed relation of places and actions in the same order of time in which they occurred for which end i kept a journal of every days observation  in the description of places their product etc i have endeavored to give what satisfaction i could to my countrymen tho possibly with the describing several things that may have been much better accounted for by others choosing to be more particular than might be needful with respect to the intelligent reader rather than to omit what i thought might tend to the information of persons no less sensible and inquisitive tho not so learned or experienced for which reason my chief care has been to be as particular as war consistent with my intended brevity insetting down such observables as i met with nor have i given my self any great trouble since my return to compare my discoveries with those of others the rather because should it so happen that i have described some places or things which others have done before me yet i different accounts even of the same things it canhardly be but there will be some new light afforded by each of  but after all considering that the main of this voyage has its scene laid in long tracts of the remoter parts has of the east and west indies some of which very seldom visited by english men and others as rarely by any europeans i may without vanity encourage the reader to expect many things wholly new to him and many others more fully described than be may have seen elsewhere for which not only this voyage tho it self of many years continuance but also several former long and distant ones have qualified me  as for the actions of the company among whom i made the greatest part of this voyage a thread of which i have carried on through it it is not to divert the reader with them that i mention them much less that i take any pleasure in relating them but for methods sake and for the readers satisfaction who could not so well acquiesce in my description of places etc without knowing the particular traverses i made among them nor in these without an account of the concomitant circumstances besides that i would not prejudice the truth and sincerity of my relation tho by omissions only and as for the traverses themselves they make for the readers advantage how little soever sor mine since thereby i have been the better enabled to gratify his curiosity as one who rambles about a country can give usually a better account of it than a carrier who jogs on to his inn without ever going out of his road  as to my style it cannot be expected that a seaman should affect politeness for were i able to do it yet i think i should be little sollicitous about it in a work of this nature i have frequently indeed divested my self of sea phrases to gratify the land reader for which the seamen will hardly forgive me and yet possibly i shall not seem complaisant enough to the other because i still retain the use of so many sea terms i consess i have not been at all scrupulous in this matter either as to the one or the other of these for i am persuaded that if what i say be intellig  matters not greatly in what words it is expressed  for the same reason i have not been curious art the spelling of the names of places plants fruits animals etc which in many of the remoter parts are given at the pleasure of travelers and vary according to their different humors neither have i confined my self to such names as are given by learned authors or so much as enquired after many of them i write for my countrymen and have therefore for the most part used such names as are familiar to our english seamen and those of our colonies abroad yet without neglecting others that occurred as it may suffice me to have given such names and descriptions as i could i shall leave to those of more leisure and opportunity the trouble of comparing them with those which other authors have assigned  the reader will find as he goes along some references to an appendix which i once designed to this book as to a chapter about the winds in diferent parts of the world to a description of the bay of campeachy in the west indies where i lived long in a former voyage and to a particular chorographical description of all the south sea coast of america partly from a spanish mss and partly from my own and other travelers observations beside those contained in this book but such an appendix would have swelled it too unreasonably and therefore i chose rather to publish it hereafter by its self as opportunity shall serve and the same must be said also to a particular voyage from achin in the isle of sumatra to tonquin malacca etc which should have been inserted as part of this general one but it would have been too long and therefore omitting it for the present i have carried on this next way from sumatra to england and so made the tour of the world correspondent to the title  for the better apprehending the course of the voyage and the situation of the places mentioned in it i have caused several maps to be engraven and some particular draughts of my own composure among them there is in the map of the american isthmus a new scheme of the adjoining bay of panama and its islands which to some may seem superfluous after that which mr ringrose has published in the history of the buccaneers and which he offers as a very exact draught i must needs disagree with him in that and doubt not but this which i here publish will be found more agreeable to that bay by any who shall have opportunity to examine it for it is a contraction of a larger map which i took from several stations in the bay it self the reader may judge how well i was able to do it by my several traverses about it mentioned in this book those particularly which are described in the  th chapter which i have caused to be marked out with a pricked line as the course of my voyage is generally in all the maps for the readers more easy tracing it  i have nothing more to add but that there are here and there some mistakes made as to expression and the like which will need a favorable correction as they occur upon reading for instance the log of wood lying out at some distance from the sides of the boats described at guam and parallel to their keel which for distinctions sake i have called the little boat might more clearly and properly have been called the side log or by some such name for though fned at the bottom and ends boatwise yet is not hollow at top but solid throughout in other places also i may not have exressd my self so fully as i ought but any considerable omissin that i shall recollect or be informed of i shall endeavor to make it up in those accounts i have yet to publish and for any faults i leave the reader to the jint use of his judgment and candor

the loyal merchant of  for jamaica captain knapman commander i went a passenger designing when i came thither to go from thence to the bay of campeachy in the gulf of mexico to cut logwood where in a former voyage i had spent about three years in that employ and so was well accquainted with the place and the work  we sailed with a prosperous gale without any impediment or remarkable passage in our voyage unless that when we came in sight of the island hispaniola and were coasting along on the south side of it by the little isles of vacca or ash i observed captain knapman was more vigilant than ordinary keeping at a good distance off shore for fear of coming too near those small low slands as he did once in a voyage from england about the year      losing his ship there by the carelessness of his mates but we succeeded better and arrived safe at port royol in jamaica some time in april      and went immediately ashore  i had brought some goods with me from england which i intended to sell here and stock my self with rum and sugar saws axes hats stockings shoes and such other commodities as i knew would sell among the campeachy logwoodcutters accordingly i sold my english cargo at port royal but upon some maturer considerations of my intended voyage to campeachy i changed my thoughts of that design and continued at jamaica all that year in expectation of some other business  i shall not trouble the reader with my observations at that isle so well known to english men nor with the particulars of my own affairs during my stay there but in short having there made a purchase of a small estate in dorsetshire near my native country of somerset of one whose title of it i was well assured of i was just embarking my self for england about christmas      when one mr hobby invited me to go first a short trading voyage to the country of the moskitos of whom i shall speak in my first chapter i was willing to get up some money before my return having laid out what i had at jamaica so i sent the vvriting of my new purchase along with the same friends whom i should have accompanied to england and went on board mr hobby  soon after our setting out we came to an anchor again in negril bay at the west end of jamaica but finding there captain soxon sawkings sharp and other privateers mr hobbys men all left him to go with them upon an expedition they had contrived leaving not one with him beside my self and being thus left alone after   or   days stay with mr hobby i was the more easily persuaded to go with them too  christmas      when we set out the first expedition was to portobel which being accomplished it was resolved to march by land over the isthmus of darien upon some new adventures in the south seas accordingly on the  th of april    0 we went ashore on the isthumus near golden island one of the sambaloes to the number of between   and  00 men carrying with us such provisions as were necessary and toys wherewith to gratify the wild indians through whose country we were to pass in about nine days march we arrived at santa maria and took it and after a stay there of about three days we went on to the south sea coast and there embarked our selves in such canoas and periagos as our indian friends furnished us withal we were in sight of panama by the   d of april and having in vain attempted puebla nova before which sawkings then commander in chief and others were killed we made some stay at the neighboring isles of quibo  here we resolved to change our course and stand away to the southward of the coast of peru accordingly we left the keys or isles of quibo the  th of june and spent the rest of the year in that southern course for touching at the isles of gorgonia and plata we came to ylo a small town on the coast of peru and took it this was in october and in november we went thence to coquimbo on the same coast and about christmas were got as far as the isle of john fernando which was the farthest of our course to the southward  christmas we went back again to the northward having a design upon arica a strong town advantageously situated in the hollow of the elbow or bending of the peruviam coast but being there repulsed with great loss we continued our course northward till by the middle of april we were come in sight of the isle of plata a little southward to the equinoxial line  i have related this part of my voyage thus summarily and concisely as well because the world has accounts of it already in the relations that mr ringrose and others have given of capt sharps expedition who was made chief commander upon sawkings being killed as also because in the prosecution of this voyage i shall come to speak of these parts again upon occasion of my going the second time into the south seas and shall there describe at large the places both of the north and south america as they occurred to me and for this reason that i might void needless repetitions and hasten to such particulars as the public has hitherto had no account of i have chosen to comprize the relation of my voyage hitherto in this short compass and place it as an introduction before the rest that the reader may the better perceive where i mean to begin to be particular for there i have placed the title of my first chapter  all therefore that i have to add to the introduction is this that while we lay at the isle of john fernando captain sharp was by general consent displaced from being commander the company being not satisfied either with his courage or behavior in his stead captain watling was advanced but he being killed shortly after before arica we were without a commander during all the rest of our return toward plata now watling being killed a great number of the meaner sort began to be as earnest for choosing captain sharp again into the vacancy as before they had been as forward as any to turn him out and on the other side the abler and more experienced men being altogether dissatisfied with sharps former conduct would by no means consent to have him chosen in short by that time we were come in sight of the island plata the difference between the contending parties was grown so high that they resolved to part companies having first made an agreement that which party soever should upon polling appear to have the majority they should keep the ship and the other should content themselves with the launch or longboat and canoas and return back over the isthmus or go to seek their fortune other ways as they would  accordingly we put it to the vote and upon dividing captain sharps party carried it i who had never been pleased with his management tho i had hitherto kept my mind to my self now declared my self on the side of those that were outvoted and according to our agreement we took our shares of such necessaries as were fit to carry over land with us for that was our resolution and so prepared for our departure  map of the north coast of the isthmus of america panama the

near cape st lawrence in the isthmus of darien with an occasional description of the moskito indians  april the   th      about ten a clock in the morning being    leagues n w from the island plata we left captain sharp and those who were willing to go with him in the ship and embarked into our lanch and canoas designing for the river of santa maria in the gulf of st michael which is about  00 leagues from the isle of plata we were in number    white men who bore arms a spanish indian who bore arms also and two moskito indians who always bear arms amongst the privateers and are much valued by them for striking fish and turtle or tortoise and manatee or sea cow and five slaves taken in the south sas who fell to our share  the craft which carried us was a lanch or long boat one canoa and another canoa which had been sawn asunder in the middle in order to have made bumkins or vessels for carrying water if we had not separated from our ship this we joined together again and made it tight providing sails to help us along and for   days before we parted we sifted so much flower as we could well carry and rubbed up  0 or  0 pound of chocolate with sugar to sweeten it these things and a kettle the slaves carried also on their backs after we landed and because there were some who designed to go with us that we knew were not well able to march we gave out that if any man faultred in the journey over land he must expect to be shot to death for we knew that the spaniards would soon b after us and one man falling into their hands might be the ruin of us all by giving an account of our strength and condition yet this would not deer em from going with us we had but little wind when we parted from the ship but before    a clock the seabreeze came in strong which was like to founder us before we got in with the shore for our security therefore we cut up an old dry hide that we brought with us and barricadoed the lanch all round with it to keep the water out about  0 a clock at night we got in about   leagues to windward of cape passao under the line and then it proved calm and we lay and drove all night being fatigued the preceding day the   th day we had little wind till the afternoon and then we made sail standing along the shore to the northward having the wind at s s w and fair weather  at   a clock we came abrest of cape passao and found a small bark at an anchor in a small bay to leeward of the cape which we took our own boats being too small to transport us we took her just under the equinoctial line she was not only a help to us but in taking her we were safe from being described we did not design to have meddled with any when we parted with our consorts nor to have seen any if we could have helped it the bark came from gallio laden with timber and was bound for guiaquil  the   th day in the morning we came to an anchor about    leagues to the southward of cape st francisco to put our new bark into a better trim in   or   hours time we finished our business and came to sail again and steered along the coast with the wind at s s w intending to touch at gorgonia  being to the northward of cape st francisco we met with very wet weather but the wind continuing we arrived at gorgonia the   th day in the morning before it was light we were afraid to approach it in the day time for fear the spaniards should lie there for us it being the place where we careened lately and where they might expect us  when we came ashore we found the spaniards had been there to seek after us by a house they had built which would entertain  00 men and by a great cross before the doors this was token enough that the spaniards did expect us this day again therefore we examined our prisoners if they knew any thing of it who confessed they had heard of a pereago or a large canoa that rowed with    oars which was kept on the river on the main and once in   or   days came over to gorgonia purposely to see for us and that having discovered us she was to make all speed to panama with the news where they had   ships ready to send after us  we lay here all the day and scrubbd our new bark that if ever we should be chased we might the better escape we filled our water and in the evening went from thence having the wind at s w a brisk gale  the   th day we had much wind and rain and we lost the canoa that had been cut and was joined together we would have kept all our canoas to carry us up the river the bark not being so convenient  the   th day we went from thence with a moderate gale of wind at s w in the afternoon we had excessive showers of rain  the   th day was very wet all the morning betwixt  0 or    it cleared up and we saw two great ships about a league and half to the westward of us we being then two leagues from the shore and about  0 leagues to the southward of point garrachina these ships had been cruising between gorgonia and the gulf   months but whether our prisoners did know it i cannot tell  we presently furled our sails and rowed in close under the shore knowing that they were cruisers for if they had been bound to panama this wind would have carried them thither and no ships bound from panama come on this side the bay but keep the north side of the bay till as far as the keys of quibo to the westward and then if they are bound to the southward they stand over and ay setch gallco or betwixt it and cape st francisco  the glare did not continue long before it rained again and kept us from the sight of each other but if they had seen and chaced us we were resolved to run our bark and canoas ashore and take our selves to the mountains and travel over land for we knew that the indians which lived in these parts never had any commerce with the spaniards so we might have had a chance for our lives  the   th day at   a clock in the morning we came to an anchor at point garrachina about   leagues from the gulf of st michael which was the place were we first come into the south seas and the way by which we designed to return  here we lay all the day and went ashore and dried our clothes cleaned our guns dried our ammunition and fixed our selves against our enemies if we should be attacked for we did expect to find some opposition at landing we likewise kept a good lookout all the day for fear of those two ships they saw the day before  the  0th day in the morning at   a clock we came into the gulf of st michaels mouth for we put from point garrachina in the evening designing to have reached the islands in the gulf before day that we might the better work our escape from our enemies if we should find any of them waiting to stop our passage  about   a clock we came to an anchor a mile without a large island which lies   miles from the mouth of the river we had other small islands without us and might have gone up into the river having a strong tide of flood but would not adventure farther till we had looked well about us  we immediately sent a canoa ashore on the island where we saw what we always feared a ship at the mouth of the river lying close by the shore and a large tent by it by which we found it would be a hard task for us to escape them  when the canoa came aboard with this news some of our men were a little disheartened but it was no more than i ever expected  our care was now to get safe over land seeing we could not land here according to our desire therefore before the tide of flood was spent we manned our canoa and rowed again to the island to see if the enemy was yet in motion when we came ashore we dispersed our selves all over the island to prevent our enemies from coming any way to view us and presently after high water we saw a small canoa coming over from the ship to the island that we were on which made us all get into our canoa and wait their coming and we lay close till they came within pistolshot of us and then being ready we started out and took them there were in her one white man and two indians who being examined told us that the ship which we saw at the rivers mouth had lain there six months guarding the river waiting for our coming that she had    guns and   0 seamen and soldiers that the seamen all lay aboard but the soldiers lay ashore in their tents that there were  00 men in the mines who had all small arms and would be abroad in two tides time they likewise told us that there were two ships cruising in the bay between this place and gorgonia the biggest had  0 guns and  00 men the other  0 guns and   0 men besides all this they told us that the indians on this side the country were our enemies which was the worst news of all however we presently brought these prisoners aboard and got under sail turning out with the tide of ebb for it was not convenient to stay longer there  we did not long consider what to do but intended to land that night or the next day betimes for we did not question but we should either get a good commerce with the indians by such toys as we had purposely brought with us or else force our way through their country in spite of all their opposition and we did not fear what these spaniards could do against us in case they should land and come after us we had a strong southerly wind which blew right in and the tide of ebb being far spent we could not turn out  i persuaded them to run into the river of congo which is a large river about three leagues from the islands where we lay which with a southerly wind we could have done and when we were got so high as the tide flows then we might have landed but all the arguments i could use were not of force sufficient to convince them that there was a large river so near us but they would land somewhere they neither did know how where nor when  when we had rowed and towed against the wind all night we just got about cape st lorenzo in the morning and sailed about   miles farther to the westward and run into a small creek within two keys or little islands and rowed up to the head of the creek being about a mile up and there we landed may         we got out all our provision and clothes and then sunk our vessel  while we were landing and fixing our snapsacks to march our moskito indians struck a plentiful dish of fish which we immediately dressed and therewith satisfied our hunger  having made mention of the moskito indians it may not be amiss to conclude this chapter with a short account of them they are tall well made raw boned lusty strong and nimble of foot long visaged lank black hair look stern hard favored and of a dark coppercolour complexion they are but a small nation or family and not  00 men of them in number inhabiting on the main on the north side near cape gratia dios between cape honduras and nicaragua they are very ingenious at throwing the lance fisgig harpoon or any manner of dart being bred to it from their infancy for the children imitating their parents never go abroad without a lance in their hands which they throw at any object till use has made them masters of the art then they learn to put by a lance arrow or dart the manner is thus two boys stand at a small distance and dart a blunt stick at one another each of them holding a small stick in his right hand with which he strikes away that which was darted at him as they grow in years they become more dexterous and courageous and then they will stand a fair mark to any one that will shoot arrows at them which they will put by with a very small stick no bigger than the rod of a fowlingpiece and when they are grown to be men they will guard themselves from arrows tho they come very thick at them provided two do not happen to come at once they have extraordinary good eyes and will discry a sail at sea farther and see any thing better than we their chiefest employment in their own country is to strike fish turtle or manatee the manner of which i describe elsewhere chap   for this they are esteemed and coveted by all privateers for one or two of them in a ship will maintain  00 men so that when we careen our ships we choose commonly such places where there is plenty of turtle or manatee for these moskito men to strike and it is very rare to find privateers destitute of one or more of them when the commander or most os the men are english but they do not love the french and the spaniards they hate mortally when they come among privateers they get the use of guns and prove very good marksmen they behave themselvis very bold in fight and never seem to flinch nor hang back for they think that the white men with whom they are know better than they do when it is best to fight and let the disadvantage of their party be never so great they will never yield not give back while any of their party stand i could never perceive any religion nor any ceremonies or superstitious observations among them being ready to imitate us in whatsoever they saw us do at any time only they seem to fear the devil whom they call wallesaw and they say he often appears to some among them whom our men commonly call their priests when they desire to speak with him on urgent business but the rest know not any thing of him nor how he appears otherwise than as these priests tell them yet they all say they must not anger him for then he will beat them and that sometimes he carries away these their priests thus much i have heard from some of them who speak good english  they marry but one wife with whom they live till death seperates them at their first coming together the man makes a very small plantation for there is land enough and they may choose what spot they please they delight to settle near the sea or by some river for the sake of striking fish their beloved employment  far within land there are other indians with whom they are always at war after the man has cleared a spot of land and has planted it he seldom minds it afterward but leaves the managing of it to his wife and he goes out a striking sometimes he seeks only for fish at other times for turtle or manatee and whatever he gets he brings home to his wife and never stirs out to seek for more till it is all eaten when hunger begins to bite he either takes his canoa and ss for more game at sea or walks out into the woods and hunts about for peccary warree each a sort of wild hogs or dear and seldom returns empty handed nor seeks for any more so long as any of it lasts their plantations are so small that they cannot subsist with what they produce for their largest plantations have not above  0 or  0 plantaintrees a bed of yams and potatoes a bush of indian pepper and a small spot of pineapples which last fruit is a main thing they delight in for with these they make a sort of drink which our men call pinedrink much esteemed by these moskitos and to which they invite each other to be merry providing fish and flesh also whoever of them makes of this liquor treats his neighbors making a little canoa full at a time and so enough to make them all drunk and it is seldom that such feasts are made but the party that makes them has some design either to be revenged for some injury done him or to debate of such differences as have happened between him and his neighbors and to examine into the truth of such matters yet before they are warmed with drink they never speak one word of their grievances and the women who commonly know their husbands designs prevent them from doing any injury to each other by hiding their lances harpoons bows and arrows or any other weapon that they have  these moskitos are in general very civil and kind to the english of whom they receive a great deal os respect both when they are aboard their ships and also ashore either in jamaica or elsewhere whither they often come with the seamen we always humor them letting them go any where as they will and return to their country in any vessel bound that way if they please they will have the management of themselves in their striking and will go in their own little canoa which our men could not go in without danger of eversetting nor will they then let any white man come into their canoa but will go a striking in it just as they please all which they allow them for should we cross them tho they should see shoals of fish or turtle or the like they will purposely stride their harpoons and turtle irons aside or so glance them as to kill nothing they have no form of government among them but acknowledge the king of england for their sovereign they learn our language and take the governor of jamaica to be one of the greatest princes in the world  while they are among the english they wear good clothes and take delight to go neat and tight but when they return again to their own country they put by all their clothes and go after their own country fashion wearing only a small piece of linen tied about their wastes hanging down to their knees  chap ii the authors land journey from the south to the north sea over the terra firma or isthmus of darien  being landed may the  st we began our march about   a clock in the afternoon directing our course by our pocket compasses n e and having gone about   miles we came to the foot of a hill where we built small huts and lay all night having excessive rains till    a clock  the  d day in the morning having sair weather we ascended the hill and found a small indian path which we followed till we found it ran too much easterly and then doubting it would carry us out of our way we climbed some of the highest trees on the hill which was not meanly furnished with as large tall trees as ever i saw at length we discovered some houses in a valley on the north side of the hill but it being steep could not descend on that side but followed the small path which led us down the hill on the east side where we presently found several other indian houses the first that we came to at the foot of the hill had none but women at home who could not speak spanish but gave each of us a good calabash or shell full of corndrink the other houses had some men at home but none that spoke spanish yet we made shift to buy such food as their houses or plantations afforded which we dressed and eat altogether having all sorts of our provision in common because none should live better than others or pay dearer for any thing than it was worth this day we had marched   mile  in the evening the husbands of those women came home and told us in broken spanish that they had been on board of the guard ship which we fled from two days before that we were now not above   mile from the mouth of the river congo and that they could go from thence aboard the guard ship in half a tides time  this evening we supped plentifully on fowls and pecary a sort of wild hogs which we bought of the indins yams potatoes and plantains served us for bread whereof we had enough after supper we agreed with one of these indians to guide us a days march into the country toward the north side he was to have for his pains a hatchet and his bargain was to bring us to a certain indians habitation who could speak spanish from whom we were in hopes to be better satisfied of our journey  the  d day having fair weather we began to stir betimes and set out batween   nd   a clock marching through several old ruined plantations this morning one of our men being tired gave us the slip by    a clock we had gone   mile and arrived at the indians house who lived on the bank of the river congo and spoke very good spanish to whom we declared the reason of this visit  at first he seemed to be very dubious of enterining any discourse with us and gave very imertinent answers to the questions that we demandd of him he told us he knew no way to the north side of the country he could carry us to cheapo or santa maria which we knew to be spanish garrisons the one lying to the eastward of us the other to the westward either of them at least  0 miles out of our way we could get no other answer from him and all his discourse was in such an angry tone as plainly declared he was not our friend however we were forced to make a virtue of necessity and humor him for it was neither time nor place to be angry with the indians all our lives lying in their hands  we were now at a great loss not knowing what course to take for we tempted him with beads money hatchets macheats or long knives but nothing would work on him till one of our men took a skycolored petticoat out of his bag and put it on his wife who was so much pleased with the present that she immediately began to chatter at her husband and soon brought him into a better humor he could then tells us he knew the way to the north side and would have gone with us but that he cut his foot   days before which made him incapable of serving us himself but he would take care that we should not want a guide and therefore he hired the same indian who brought us hither to conduct us   days march further for another hatchet the old man would have stayed us here all the day because it rained very hard but our business required more haste our enemies lying so near us for he told us that he could go from his house aboard the guardship in a tides time and this was the  th day since they saw us so we marched   mile farther and then built hutts where we stayed all night it rained all the afternoon and greatest part of the night  the  th day we began our march betimes for the forenoons were commonly fair but much rain afternoon tho whether it rained or shined it was much at one with us for i verily believe we crossed the rivers  0 times this day the indians having no paths to travel from one part of the country to another and therefore guided themselves by the rivers we marched this day    miles and then built our hutts and lay down to sleep but we always kept two men on the watch otherwise our own slaves might have knocked us on the head while we slept it rained violently all the afternoon and most part of the night we had much ado to kindle a fire this evening our hutts were but very mean and ordinary and our fire small so that we could not dry our clothes scarce warm our selves and no sort of food for the belly all which made it very hard with us i confess these hardships quite expelled the thoughts of an enemy for now having been   days in the country we began to have but few other cares than how to get guides and food the spaniards were seldom in our thoughts  the  th day we set out in the morning betimes and having traveled   miles in those wild pathless woods by  0 a clock in the morning we arrived at a young spanish indians house who had formerly lived with the bishop of panama the young indian was very brisk spoke very good spanish and received us very kindly this plantation afforded us store of provision yams and potaroes but nothing of any flesh beside   fat monkeys we shot part whereof we distributed to some of our company who were weak and sickly for others we got eggs and such refreshments as the indians had for we still provided for the sick and weak we had a spanish indian in our company who first took up arms with captain sawkins and had been with us ever since his death he was persuaded to live here by the master of the house who promised him his sister in marriage and to be assistant to him in clearing a plantation but we would not consent to part ftom him here for fear of some treachery but promised to release him in two or three days when we were certainly out of danger of our enemies we stayed here all the afternoon and dried our clothes and ammunition cleared our guns and provided ourselves for a march the next morning  our chyrurgeon mr waser came to a sad disaster here being drying his powder a careless fellow passed by with his pipe lighted and set fire to his powder which blew up and scorched his knee and reduced him to that condition that he was not able to march wherefore we allowed him a slave to carry his things being all of us the more concerned at the accident because liable our selves every moment to misfortune and none to look after us but him this indian plantation was seated on the bank of the river congo in a very fat soil and thus far we might have come in our canoa if i could have persuaded them to it  the  th day we set out again having hired another guide here we first crossed the river congo in a canoa having been from our first landing on the west side of the river and being over we marched to the eastward   mile and came to another river which we forded several times though it was very deep two of our men were not able to keep company with us but came after us as they were able the last time we forded the river it was so deep that our tallest men stood in the deepest place and handed the sick weak and short men by which means we all got over safe except those two who were behind foreseeing a necessity of wading through rivers frequently in our landmarch i took care before i left the ship to provide my self a large joint of bambo which i stopped at both ends closing it with wax so as to keep out any water in this i preserved my journal and other writings from being wet tho i was often forced to swim when we were over this river we sat down to wait the coming of our consorts who were left behind and in half an hour they came but the river by that time was so high that they could not get over it neither could we help them over but bid them be of good comfort and stay till the river did fall but we marched   mile farther by the side of the river and there built our hutts having gone this day   miles we had scarce finished our hutts before the river rose much higher and overflowing the banks obliged us to remove into higher ground but the next night came on before we could build more hutts so we lay straggling in the woods some under one tree some under another as we could find convenience which might have been indifferent comfortable if the weather had been fair but the greatest part of the night we had extraordinary hard rain with much lightening and terrible claps of thunder these hardships and inconveniences made us all careless and there was no watch kept tho i believe no body did sleep so our slaves taking opportunity went away in the night all but one who was hid in some hole and knew nothing of their design or else fell asleep those that went away carried with them our chyrurgeons gun and all his money  the next morning being the  th day we went to the rivers side and found it much fallen and here our guide would have us ford it again which being deep and the current running swift we could not then we contrived to swim over those that could not swim we were resolved to help over as well as we could but this was not feizable for we should not be able to get all our things over at length we concluded to send one man over with a line who should hale over all our things first and then get the men over this being agreed on one george gayny took the end of a line and made it fast about his neck and left the other end ashore and one man stood by the line to clear it away to him but when gayny was in the midst of the water the line in drawing after him chanced to kink or grow entangled and he that stood by to clear it away stopped the line which turned gayny on his back and he that had the line in his hand threw it all into the river after him thinking he might recover himself but the stream running very swift and the man having three hundred dollars at his back was carried down and never seen more by us those two men whom we left behind the day before told us afterward that they found him lying dead in a creek where the eddy had driven him ashore and the money on his back but they meddled not with any of it being only in care how to work their way through a wild unknown country this put a period to that contrivance this was the fourth man that we lost in this land journey for those two men that we left the day before did not come to us till we were in the north seas so we yielded them also for lost being frustrated of getting over the river this way we looked about for a tree to fell across the river at length we found one which we cut down and it reached clear over on this we passed to the other side where we found a small planta inwalk which we soon ransackt  while we were busy getting plantains our guide was gone but in less than two hours came to us again and brought with him an old indian to whom he delivered up his charge and we gave him a hatchet and dismissed him and entered our selves under the conduct of our new guide who immediately led us away and crossed another river and entered into a large valley of the fattest land i did ever take notice of the trees were not very thick but the largest that i saw in my travels we saw great tracks which were made by the pecaries but saw none of them we marched in this pleasantcountry till   a clock in the afternoon in all about   miles and then arrived at the old mans country house which was only a habitation for hunting there was a small plantain walk some yams and potatoes here we took up our quarters for this day and refreshed our selves with such food as the place afforded and dried our clothes and ammunition at this place our indian provided to leave us for now we thought our selves past danger this was he that was persuaded to stay at the last house we came from to marry the young mans sister and we dismissed him according to our promise  the  th day the old man conducted us toward his own habitation we marched about   miles in this valley and then ascended a hill and travel led about   miles farther over two or three small hills before we came to any settlement half a mile before we came to the plantations we light of a path which carried us to the indians habitation we saw many wooden crosses erected in the way which created some jealousy in us that here were some spaniards therefore we new primed all our guns and provided our selves for an enemy but coming into the town found none but indians who were all got together in a large house to receive us for the old man had a little boy with him that he sent before  they made us welcome to such as they had which was very mean for these were new plantations the corn being not eared potatoes yams and plantains they had none but what they brought from their old plantations there was none of them spoke good spanish two young men could speak a little it caused us to take more notice of them to these we made a present and desired them to get us a guide to conduct us to the north side or part of the way which they promised to do themselves if we would reward them for it but told us we must lie still the next day but we thought our selves nearer the north sea than we were and proposed to go without a guide rather than stay here a whole day however some of our men who were tired resolved to stay behind and mr wafer our chyrurgeon who marched in great pain ever since his knee was burned with powder was resolved to stay with them  the tenth day we got up betimes resolving to march but the indians opposed it as much as they could but seeing they could not persuade us to stay they came with us and having taken leave of our friends we set out  here therefore we left the chyrurgeon and two more as we said and marched away to the eastward following our guides but we often looked on our pocket compasses and showed them to the guides pointing at the way that we would go which made them shake their heads and say they were pretty things but not convenient for us after we had descended the hills on which the town stood we come down into a valley and guided our selves by a river which we crossed    times and having marched   miles we built hutts and lay there all night this evening i killed a quaum a large bird as big as a turkey wherewith we treated our guides for we brought no provision with us this night our slave run away  the eleventh day we marched  0 miles farther and built hutts at night but went supperless to bed  the twelfth in the morning we crossed a deep river passing over it on a tree and marched   mile in a low swampy ground and came to the side of a great deep river but could not get over we built hutts upon its banks and lay there all night upon our barbecus or frames of sticks raised about   foot from the ground  the thirteenth day when we turned out the river had overflowed its banks and was   foot deep in our hutts and our guides went from us not telling us their intent which made us think they were returned home again now we began to repent our haste in coming from the last settlements for we had no food since we came from thence indeed we got macawberries in this place wherewith we satisfied our selves this day though coursly  the fourteenth day in the morning betimes our guides came to us again and the waters being fallen within their bounds they carried us to a tree that stood on the bank of the river and told us if we could fell that tree cross it we might pass if not we could pass no further therefore we set two of the best ax men that we had who felled it exactly cross the river and the boughs just reached over on this we passed very safe we afterward crossed another river three times with much difficulty and at   a clock in the afternoon we came to an indian settlement where we met a drove of monkeys and killed   of them and stayed here all night having marched this day   miles here we got plantains enough and a kind reception of the indian that lived here all alone except one boy to wait on him  the fifteeenth day when we set out the kind indian and his boy went with us in a canoa and set us over such places as we could not ford and being past those great rivers he returned back again having helped us at least   mile we marched afterward   mile and came to large plantain walks where we took up our quarters that night we there fed plentifully on plantains both ripe and green and had fair weather all the day and night i think these were the largest plantain walks and the biggest plantains that ever i saw but no house near them we gathered what we pleased by our guides orders  the sixteenth day we marched   mile and came to a large settlement where we abode all day not a man of us but wished the journey at an end our feet being blistered and our thighs stripped with wading through so many rivers the way being almost continually through rivers or pathless woods in the afternoon five of us went to seek for game and killed   monkeys which we dressed for supper here we first began to have fair weather which continued with us till we came to the north seas  the eighteenth day we set out at  0 a clock and the indians with   canoas carried us a league up a river and when we landed the kind indians went with us and carried our burdens we marched   mile farther and then built our hutts having traveled from the last settlements   miles  the nineteenth day our guides lost their way and we did not march above   miles  the twentieth day by    a clock we came to cheapo river the rivers we crossed hitherto run all into the south seas and this of cheapo was the last we met with that run that way here an old man who came from the last settlements destribued his burden of plantains amongst us and taking his leave returned home afterward we forded the river and marched to the foot of a very high mountain where we lay all night this day we marched about   miles  the   st day some of the indians returned back and we marched up a very high mountain being on the top we went some miles on a ridge and steep on both sides then descended a little and came to a fine spring where we lay all night having gone this day about   miles the weather still very fair and clear  the   d day we marched over another very high mountain keeping on the ridge   miles when we came to the north end we to our great comfort saw the sea then we descended and parted our selves into  companies and lay by the side of a river which was the first we met that runs into the north sea  the   d day we came through several large plantain walks and at  0 a clock came to an indians habitation not far from the north sea here we got canoas to carry us down the river conception to the sea side having gone this day   miles we found a great many indians at the mouth of this river they had settled themselves here for the benefit of trade with the privateers and their commodities were yams potatoes plantains sugar ces fowls and eggs  these indians told us that there had been a great many english and french ships here which were all gone but one barcolongo a french privateer that lay at la sounds key or island this island is about leagues from the mouth of the river conception and is one of the samballoes a range of islands reaching for about  leagues from point samballas to gden island eastward these islands or keys as we call them were first made the rendezvous of prieers in the year      being very convenient  caing and had names given to some of them by the captains of the privateers as this la sounds key particularly  thus we finished our journey from the south sea to the north in    days in which by my account we traveled   0 miles crossing some very high mountains but our common march was in the valleys among deep and dangerous rivers at our first landing in this country we were told that the indians were our enemies we knew the rivers to be deep the wet season to be coming in yet excepting those we left behind we lost but one man who was drowned as i said our first landing place on the south coast was very disadvantageous for we traveled at least fifty miles more than we need to have done could we have gone up cheapo river or santa maria river for at either of these places a man may pass from sea to sea in   days time with ease the indians can do it in a day and a half by which you may see how easy it is for a party of men to travel over i must confess the indians did assist us very much and i question whether ever we had got over without their assistance because they brought us from time to time to their plantations where we always got provision which else we should have wanted but if a party of  00 or  00 men or more were minded to travel from the north to the south seas they may do it without asking leave of the indians tho it be much better to be friends with them  on the   th of may having lain one night at the rivers mouth we all went on board the privateer who lay at la sounds key it was a french vessel captain tristian commander the first thing we did was to get such things as we could to gratify our indian guides for we were resolved to reward them to their hearts content this we did by giving them beads knives scissars and lookingglasses which we bought of the privateers crew and a half dollar a man from each of us which we would have bestowed in goods also but could not get any the privateer having no more toys they were so well satisfied with these that they returned with joy to their friends and were very kind to our consorts whom we left behind as mr wafer our chyrurgeon and the rest of them told us when they came to us some months afterward as shall be said hereafter  i might have given a further account of several things relating to this country the inland parts of which are so little known to the europeans but i shall leave this province to mr wafer who made a longer abode in it than i and is better able to do it that any man than i know and is now preparing a

arrival in virginia  the privateer on board which we went being now cleaned and our indian guides thus satisfied and set ashore we set sail in two days for springers key another of the samballoes isles and about   or   leagues from la sounds key here lay   sail of privateers more viz capt coxon  0 guns  00 men capt pain  0 guns  00 men capt wright a barcolongo   guns  0 men capt williams a small barcolongo english commanders and english men capt yanks a barcolongo   guns about  0 men english dutch and french himself a dutchman capt achemboe   guns  0 men capt tucker   guns  0 men capt rose a barcolongo french commanders and men   an hour before we came to the fleet captai wright who had been sent to chagra river arrive at springers key with a large conoa or pereag laden with flower which he took there some o the prisoners belonging to the pereago came from panama not above   days before he took her an told the news of our coming over land and likewise related the condition and strength of panama which was the main thing they enquired after for captain wright was sent thither purposely to get  prisoner that was able to inform them of the strength of that city because the privateers designed to join all their force and by the assistanc of the indians who had promised to be their guides to march over land to panama and there is no other way of getting prisoners for that purpose but by absconding between chagra and portabell because there are much goods brought that way for panama especially when the armado lies at portabell all the commanders were aboard of captain wright when we came into the fleet and were mighty inquisitive of the prisoners to know the truth of what they related concerning us but as soon as they knew we were come they immediately came aboard of captain tristian heing all overjoyed to see us for captain coxon and many others had left us in the south seas about    months since and had never heard what became of us since that time they enquired of us what we did there how we lived how far we had been and what discoveries we made in those seas after we had answered these general questions they began to be more particular in examining us concerning our passage through the country from the south seas we related the whole matter giving them an account of the fatigues of our march and the inconveniences we suffered by the rains and disheartened them quite from that design  then they proposed several other places where such a party of men as were now got together might make a voyage but the objections of some or other still hindered any proceeding for the privateers have an account of most towns within  0 leagues of the sea on all the coast from trinidado down to la vera cruz and are able to give a near guess of the strength and riches of them for they make it their business to examine all prisoners that fall into their hands concerning the country town or city that they belong to whether born there or how long they have known it how many families whether most spaniards or whether the major part are not coppercolourd as mulattoe mustesoes or indians whether rich and what the riches do consist in and what their chiefest manfactures if fortified how many great guns a what number of small arms whether it is possib to come undescried on them how many lookou or sentinels for such the spaniards always keep and how the lookouts are placed whether possib to avoid the lookouts or take them if any riv or creek comes near it or where the best landing with innumerable other such questions which the curiosities lead them to demand and if they ha had any former discourse of such places from oth prisoners they compare one with the other the examine again and enquire if he or any of the are capable to be guides to conduct a party of me thither if not where and how any prisoner man be taken that may do it and from thence they aterwards lay their schemes to prosecute whateve design they take in hand  it was   or   days after before any resolution wa taken yet consultations were held every day the french seemed very forward to go to any town tha the english could or would propose because the governor of petit guavos from whom the privateer take commissions had recommended a gentleman lately come from france to be general of the expedition and fent word by captain tucker wit whom this gentleman came that they should i possible make an attempt on some town before he returned again the english when they were in company with the french seemed to approve o what the french said but never looked on that general to be fit for the service in hand  at length it was concluded to go to a town the name of which i have forgot it lies a great wa in the country but not such a tedious march as i would be from hence to panama our way to i lay up carpenters river which is about  0 leagues to the westward of portabell our greatest obstruction in this design was our want of boats therefore it was concluded to go with all our fleet to st andreas a small uninhabited island lying near the isle of providence to the westward of it in    degrees    m north lat and from portabell n n w about  0 leagues where we should be but a little way from carpenters river and besides at this island we might build canoas it being plentifully stored with large cedars for such a purpose and for this reason the jamaicamen come hither frequently to build sloops cedar being very fit for building and it being to be had here at free cost beside other wood jamaica is well stored with cedars of its own chiefly among the rocky mountains these also of st andreas grow in stony ground and are the largest that ever i knew or heard of the bodies alone being ordinarily  0 or  0 foot long many  0 or  0 and upwards and of a proportionable bigness the bermudas isles are well stored with them so is virginia which is generally a sandy soil i saw none in the east indies nor in the south sea coast except on the isthmus as i came over it we reckon the pereagos and canoas that are made of cedar to be the best of any they are nothing but the tree it self made hollow boatwise with a flat bottom and the canoa generally sharp at both ends the pereago at one only with the other end flat but what is commonly said of cedar that the worm will not touch it is a mistake for i have seen of it very mucb worm eaten  all things being thus concluded on we sailed from hence directing our course toward st andreas we kept company the first day but at night it blew a hard gale at n e and some of our ships bore away the next day others were forced to leave us and the second night we lost all our company i was now belonging to captain archembo for al the rest of the fleet were overmannd captain archembo wanting men we that came out of the south seas must either sail with him or remain among the indians indeed we found no cause to dislike the captain but his french seamen were the saddest creatures that ever i was among for tho w had bad weather that required many hands aloft ye the biggest part of them never stirred out of their hammocks but to eat and ease themselves w made a shift to find the island the fourth day where we met captain wright who came thither the da before and had taken a spanish tartan wherei were  0 men all well armed she had   paterroes and some long guns placed in a swivel on the gunnel they fought an hour before they yielde the news they related was that they came from cartagena in company of    armadilloes which a small vessels of war to seek for the fleet of privteers lying in the samballoes that they parted from the armadilloes   days before that they were oderd to search the sambaloes for us and if they di not find us then they were ordered to go to portbel and lie there till they had farther intelligen of us and he supposed those armadilloes to be n there  we that came over land out of the south seas being weary of living among the french desired captain wright to fit up his prize the tartan and mak a man of war of her for us which he at first seem to decline because he was settled among the fren in hispaniola and was very well beloved both b the governor of petitguavos and all the gentry and they would resent it ill that captain wrigh who had no occasion of men should be so unkin to captain archembo as to seduce his men from him he being so meanly manned that he could hardly sail his ship with his frenchmen we tol im we would no longer remain with captain arhembo but would go ashore there and build caoas to transport our selves down to the moskitoes f he would not entertain us for privateers are not bliged to any ship but free to go ashore where hey please or to go into any other ship that will ntertain them only paying for their provision  when captain wright saw our resolutions he greed with us on condition we should be under his ommand as one ships company to which we nanimously consented  we staid here about  0 days to see if any more of our fleet would come to us but there came no more of us to the island but three viz captain wright captain archembo and captain tucker therefore we concluded the rest were bore away either for boccatoro or bluefields river on the main and we designed to seek them we had fine weaher while we lay here only some tornadoes or thundershowers but in this isle of st andreas there being neither fish fowl nor deer and it being therefore but an ordinary place for us who had but little provision we sailed from hence again n quest of our scattered fleet directing our course for some islands lying near the main called by the privateers the cornislands being in hopes to get corn there these islands i take to be the same which are generally called in the maps the pearl islands lying about the lat of    d  0 m north here we arrived the next day and went ashore on one of them but found none of the inhabitants for here are but a few poor naked indians that live ere who have been so often plundered by the privateers that they have but little provision and when they see a sail they hide themselves otherwise ships that come here would take them and make slaves of them and i have seen some of them that have been slaves they are people of a mean stature yet strong limbs they are of a dar copper color black hair full round faces smal black eyes their eyebrows hanging over their eye low foreheads short thick noses not high bu flattish full lips and short chins they have a fashion to cut holes in the lips o the boys when they are young close to their chin which the keep open with little pegs till the are    or    years old then the wear beards in them made of tutle or tortoiseshell in the for you see in the margin the little notch at the upper end they put i through the lip where it remain between the teeth and the lip the under part hangs down over their chin thi they commonly wear all day and when they slee they take it out they have likewise holes bore in their ears both men and women when young and by continual stretching them with great pegs they grow to be as big as a milled five shillingpiec herein they wear pieces of wood cut very roun and smooth so that their ear seems to be all wood with a little skin about it another ornament the women use is about their legs which they a very curious in for from the infancy of the girl their mothers make fast a piece of cotton cloat about the small of their leg from the ankle to the calf very hard which makes them have a ver full calf this the women wear to their dying day both men and women go naked only a clout about their wastes yet they have but little fee though they go barefoot finding no provisio here we sailed toward bluefield river where w careened our tartane and there captain archemb and captain tucker left us and went toward boccotoro  this blewfields river comes out between the rivers of nicuragua and veragua at its mouth is a fine sandy bay where barks may clean it is deep at its mouth but a shoal within so that ships may not enter yet barks of  0 or  0 tuns may it had this name from captain blewfield a famous privateer living on providence island long before jamaica was taken which island of providence was settled by the english and belonged to the earls of warwick  in this river we found a canoa coming down the stream and tho we went with our canoas to seek for inhabitants yet we found none but saw in   or   places signs that indians had made on that side the river the canoa which we found was but meanly made for want of tools therefore we concluded these indians have no commerce with the spaniards nor with other indians that have  while we lay here our moskito men went in their canoa and struck us some manatee or seacow besides this blewfields river i have seen of the manatee in the bay of campechy on the coasts of bocca del drago and bocca del toro in the river of darien and among the south keys or little islands of cuba i haveheard of there being found on the north of jamaica a few and in the rivers of surinam in great multitudes which is a very low land i have seen of them also at mindanao one of the philippine islands and on the coast of newholland this creature is about the bigness of a horse and  0 or    foot long the mouth of it is much like the mouth of a cow having great thick lips the eyes are no bigger than a small pea the ears are only   small holes on each side of the head the neck is short and thick bigger than the head the biggest part of this creature is at the shoulders where it has   large fins one on each side of its belly under each of these fins the female has a small dug to suckle her young from the shoulders toward the tail it retains its bigness for about a foot then it grows smailer and smaller to the very tail which is flat and about    inches broad and  0 inches long and in the middle   or   inches thick but about the edges of it not above   inches thick from the head to the tail it is round and smooth without any fin but those two before mentioned i have heard that some have weighed above   00 l but i never saw any so large the manatee delights to live in a brackish water and they are commonly in creeks or rivers near the sea it is for this reason possibly they are not seen in the south seas that ever i could observe where the coast is generally a bold shore that is high land and deep water close home by it with a high sea or great surges except in the bay of panama yet even there is no manatee whereas the west indies being as it were one great bay composed of many smaller are mostly low land and shoal water and afford proper pasture as i may say for the manatee sometimes we find them in salt water sometimes in fresh but never far at sea and those that live in the sea at such places where there is no river nor creek fit for them to enter yet do commonly come once or twice in    hours to the mouth of any fresh water river that is near their place of abode they live on grass   or   inches long and of a narrow blade which grows in the sea in many places especially among islands near the main this grass grows likewise in creeks or in great rivers near the sides of them in such places where there is but little tide or current they never come ashore nor into shallower water than where they can swim their flesh is white both the fat and the lean and extraordinary sweet wholesome meat the tail of a young cow is most esteemed but if old both head and tail are very tough a calf that sucks is the most delicate meat privateers commonly roast them as they do also great pieces cut out of the bellies of the old ones  the skin of the manatee is of great use to privateers for they cut them into straps which they make fast on the side of their canoas through which they put their oars in rowing instead of tholes or pegs the skin of the bull or of the back of the cow is too thick for this use but of it they make horsewhips cutting them   or   foot long at the handle they leave the full substance of the skin and from thence cut it away tapering but very even and square all the four sides while the thongs are green they twist them and hang them to dry which in a weeks time become as hard as wood the moskitomen have always a small canoa for their use to strike fish tortoises or manatee which they keep usually to themselves and very neat and clean they use no oars but paddles the broad part of which does not go tapering toward the staff pole or shandle of it as in the oar nor do they use it in the same manner by laying it on the side of the vessel but hold it perpendicularly griping the staff hard with both hands and putting back the water by main strength and very quick strokes one of the moskitoes for there go but   in a canoa sits in the stern the other kneels down in the head and both paddle till they come to the place where they expect their game then they lie still or paddle very softly looking well about them and he that is in the head of the canoa lays down his paddle and stands up with his striking staff in his hand this staff is about   foot long almost as big as a mans arm at the great end in which there is hole to place his harpoon in at the other end of his staff there is a piece of light wood called bobwood with a hole in it through which the small end of the staff comes and on this piece of bobwood there is a line of  0 or    fathom wound neatly about and the end of the line made fast to it the other end of the line is made fast to the harpoon which is at the great end of the staff and the moskito man keeps about a fathom of it loose in his hand when he strikes the harpoon presently comes out of the staff and as the manatee swims away the line runs off from the bob and although at first both staff and bob may be carried under water yet as the line runs off it will rise again then the moskito men paddle with all their might to get hold of the bob again and spend usually a quarter of an hour before they get it when the manatee begins to be tired it lies still and then the moskito men paddle to the bob and take it up and begin to hale in the line when the manatee feels them he swims away again with the canoa after him then he that steers must be nimble to turn the head of the canoa that way that his consort points who being in the head of the canoa and holding the line both sees and feels which way the manatee is swimming thus the canoa is towed with a violent motion till the manatees strength decays then they gather in the line which they are often forced to let all go to the very end at length when the creatures strength is spent they hale it up to the canoas side and knock it on the head and tow it to the nearest shore where they make it fast and seek for another which having taken they go ashore with it to put it into their canoa for it is so heavy that they cannot lift it in but they hale it up in shoal water as near the shore as they can and then overset the canoa laying one side close to the manatee then they roll it in which brings the canoa upright again and when they have heaved out the water they fasten a line to the other manatee that lies aflout and tow it after them i have known two moskito men for a week every day bring aboard two manatee in this manner the least of which has not weighed less than  00 pound and that in a very small canoa that   english men would scarce adventure to go in when they strike a cow that has a young one they seldom miss the calf for she commonly takes her young one under one of her fins but if the calf is so big that she cannot carry it or she so frighted that she only minds to save her own life yet the young never leaves her till the moskito men have an opportunity to strike her  the manner of striking manatee and tortoise is much the same only when they seek for manatee they paddle so gently that they make no noise and never touch the side of the canoa with their paddle because it is a creature that hears very well but they are not so nice when they seek for tortoise whose eyes are better than his ears they strike the tortoise with a square sharp iron peg the other with a harpoon the moskito men make their own striking instruments as harpoons fishhooks and a tortoiseiron or pegs these pegs or tortoiseirons are made   square sharp at one end and not much above an inch in length of such a figure as you see in the margin the small spike at the broad end has the line fastened to it and goes also into a hole at the end of the striking staff which when the tortoise is struck flies off the iron and end of the line fastened to it going quite within the shells where it is so buried that the tortoise cannot possibly escape  they make their lines both for fishing and striking with the bark of maho which is a sort of tree or shrub that grows plentifully all over the west indies and whose bark is made up of strings or threads very strong you may draw it off either in flakes or small threads as you have occasion it is fit for any manner of cordage and privateers often make their rigging of it so much by way of digression  when we had cleaned our tartane we sailed from hence bound for boccatoro which is an opening between   islands about  0 degrees  0 min north lat between the rivers of veragne and chagre here we met with captain yanky who told us that there had been a fleet of spanish armadilloes to seek us that captain tristian having fallen leeward was coming to boccatoro and fell in amongst them supposing them to be our fleet that they fired and chased him but he rowed and towed and they supposed he got away that capt pain was likewise chaced by them and capt williams and that they had not seen them since they lay within the islands that the spaniards never came in to him and that captain coxon was in at the careening place  this boccatoro is a place that the privateers use to resort to as much as any place on all the coast because here is plenty of green tortoise and a good careening place the indians here have no commerce with the spaniards but are very barbarous and will not be dealt with they have destroyed many privateers as they did not long after this some of captain pains men who having built a tent ashore to put his goods in while he careened his ship and some men lying there with their arms in the night the indians crept softly into the tent and cut off the heads of   or   men and made their escape nor was this the first time they had served the privateers so there grow on this coast vinelloes in great quantity with which chocolate is perfumed these i shall describe elsewhere  our fleet being thus scattered there was now no hopes of getting together again therefore every one did what they thought most conducing to obtain their ends capt wright with whom i now was was resolved to cruise on the coast of cartagene and it being now almost the westerly wind season we sailed from hence and captain yanky with us and we consorted because captain yanky had no commission and was afraid the french would take away his bark we past by scuda a small island where it is said sir francis drakes bowels were buried and came to a small river to the westward of chagre where we took two new canoas and carried them with us into the sambaloes we had the wind at west with much rain which brought us to point samballas here captain wright and captain yanky left us in the tartane to fix the conoas while they went on the coast of cartagene to seek for provision we cruised in among the islands and kept our moskitomen or strikers out who brought aboard some halfgrown tortoise and some of us went ashore every day to hunt for what we could find in the woods sometimes we got pecary warree or deer at other times we light on a drove of large fat monkeys or quames corrosoes each a large sort of fowl pigeons parrots or tuttledoves we lived very well on what we got not staying long in one place but sometimes we would go on the islands where there grow great groves of sapadillies which is a sort of fruit much like a pear but more juicy and under those trees we found plenty of soldiers that live in shells a little kind of animals and have two great claws like a crab and are good food one time our men sound a great many large ones and being sharp set had them dressed but most of them were very sick afterward being poisoned by them for on this island were many manchaneel trees whose fruit is like a small crab and smells very well but they are not wholesome and we commonly take care of meddling with any animals that eat them and this we take for a general rule when we find any fruits that we have not seen before if we see them peckd by birds we may freely eat but if we see no such sign we let them alone for of this fruit no birds will taste many of these islands have of these manchaneeltrees growing on them  thus cruising in among these islands at length we came again to la sounds key and the day before having met with a jamaica sloop that was come over on the coast to trade she went with us it was in the evening when we came to an anchor and the next morning we fired   guns for the indians that lived on the main for to come aboard for by this time we concluded we should hear from our   men that we left in the heart of the country among the indians this being about the latter end of august and it was in the beginning of may when we parted from them according to our expectation the indians came aboard and brought our friends with them mr wafer wore a clout about him and was painted like an indian and he was some time aboard before i knew him one of them named riehard cobson dyed within   or   days after and was buried on la sounds key  after this we went to other keys to the eastward of these to meet captain wright and captain yanky who met with a fleet of pereagos laden with indian corn hog and fowls going to cartagene being conveyed with a small armadilly of   guns and   patereroes her they chsed ashore and most of the pereagoes but they got   of them off and brought them away  here captain wrights and captain yankys barks were cleaned and we stocked our selves with corn and then went toward the coast of cartagene in our way thither we passed by the river of darien which is very broad at the mouth but not above   foot water on a spring tide for the tide rises but little here captain coxen about   months before we came out of the south sea went up this river with a party of men every man carried a small strong bag to put his gold in expecting great riches there tho they got little or none they rowed up about  00 leagues before they came to any settlement and then found some spaniards who lived there o truck with the indians for gold there being gold scales in every house the spaniards admire how they came so far from the mouth of the river because there are a sort of indians living between that place and the sea who are very dreadful to the spaniards and will not have any commerce with them nor with any white people they use trunks about  foot long out of which they blow poisoned darts and are so silent in their attacks on their enemies and retreat so nimbly again that the spaniards can never find them their darts are made of macawwood being about the bigness and length of a knittingneedle one end is wound about with cotton the other end is extraordinary sharp and small and is jagged with notches like a harpoon so that whatever it strikes into it immediately reaks off by the weight of the biggest end which t is not of strength to bear it being made so slener for that purpose and it is very difficult to be got ut again by reason of those notches these indins have always war with our darien friendly indins and lived on both sides this great river  0 or  0 egues from the sea but not near the mouth of he river there are abundance of manatee in this iver and some creeks belonging to it this retion i had from several men who accompanied captain coxon in that discovery and from mr cook  particular who was with them and is a very ntelligent person he is now chief mate of a ship ound to guinea to return therefore to the proseution of our voyage meeting with nothing of ote we passed by cartagene which is a city so ell known that i shall say nothing of it we iled by in sight of it for it lies open to the sea and had a fair view of madre de popa or nuestra a sennora de popa a monastery of the virgin marys standing on the top of a very steep hill just behind cartagene it is a place of incredible wealth by reason of the offerings made here continually and for this reason often in danger of being visited by the privateers did not the neighborhood of cartagene keep them in awe it is in short the very loretto of the west indies it has innumerable miracles related of it any misfortune that befalls the privateers is attributed to this ladys doing and the spaniards report that she was abroad that night the oxford man of war was blown up at the isle of vacca near hispaniola and that she came home all wet as belike she often returns with her clothes dirty and torn with passing through the woods and bad ways when she has been out upon any expedition deserving doubtless a new suit for such eminent pieces of service  from hence we passed on to the rio grande where we took up fresh water at sea a league off the mouth of that river from thence we sailed eastward passing by st martha a large town and good harbor belonging to the spaniards yet has it within these few years been twice taken by the privateers it stands close upon the sea and the hill within land is a very large one towering up a great height from a vast body of land i am of opinion that it is higher than the pike of tenariff others also that have seen both think the same tho its bigness makes its height less sensible i have seen it in passing by  0 leagues off at sea others as they told me above  0 and several have told me that they have seen at once jamaica hispaniola and the high land of santa martha and yet the nearest of these two places is distant from it   0 leagues and jamaica which is farthest off is accounted near   0 leagues and i question whether any land or either of those   islands may be seen  0 leagues ts head is generally hid in the clouds but in clear weather when the top appears it looks white supposed to be covered with snow st martha ieth in the lat of    degrees north  being advanced   or   leagues to the eastward of santa martha we left our ships at anchor and reurnd back in our canoas to the river grande enring it by a mouth of it that disembogues it self near santa martha purposing to attempt some towns that lie a pretty way up that river but this design meeting with discouragements we reurned to our ships and set sail to rio la hacha this has been a strong spanish town and is well built but being often taken by the privateers the spaniards deserted it some time before our arrival it lies to the westward of a river and right against the town is a good road for ships the bottom clean and sandy the jamaica sloops used often to come over to trade here and i am informed that the spaniards have again settled themselves in it and made it very strong we entered the fort and brought   small guns aboard from thence we went to the rancheries one or   small indian villages where the spaniards kept   barks to fish for pearl the pearlbanks lie about   or   leagues off from the shore as i have been told thither the fishing barks go and anchor then the diverse go down to the bottom and fill a basket which is let down before with oysters and when they come up others go down   at a time this they do till the bark is full and then go ashore where the old men women and children of the indians open the oysters there being a spanish overseer to look after the pearl yet these indians do very often secure the best pearl for themselves as many jamaica men can testify who daily trade with them the meat they string up and hang it a drying at this place we went ashore where we found one of the barks and saw great heaps of oystershells but the people all fled yet in another place between this and rio la hacha we took some of the indians who seem to be a stubborn sort of people they are longvisaged black hair their noses somewhat rising in the middle and of a stern look the spaniards report them to be a very numerous nation and that they will not subject themselves to their yoke yet they have spanish priests among them and by trading have brought them to be somewhat sociable but cannot keep a severe hand over them the land is but barren it being of a light sand near the sea and most savanah or champion and the grass but thin and course yet they feed plenty of cattle every man knows his own and looks after them but the land is in common except only their houses or small plantations where they live which every man maintains with some fence about it they may remove from one place to another as they please no man having right to any land but what he possesses this part of the country is not so subject to rain as to the westward of santa martha yet here are tornadoes or thundershowers but neither so violent as on the coast of portabell nor so frequent the westerly winds in the westerly wind season blow here tho not so strong nor lasting as on the coasts of cartagene and portabell  when we had spent some time here we returned again toward the coast of cartagene and being between rio grande and that place we met with westerly winds which kept us still to the eastward of cartagene   or   days and then in the morning we descryed a sail off at sea and we chaced her at noon captain wright who sailed best came up with her and engaged her and in half an hour after captain yankey who sailed better than the tartan the vessel that i was in came up with he likewise and laid her aboard then captain wright also and they took her before we came up they lost   or   men and had   or   wounded the prize was a ship of    guns and  0 men who had all good small arms she was laden with sugar and tobacco and had   or  0 tuns of marmalet on board she came from saint jago on cuba and was bound to cartagene  we went back with her to rio grande to fix our rigging which was shattered in the fight and to consider what to do with her for these were commodities of little use to us and not worth going into a port with at the rio grande capt wright demanded the prize as his due by virtue of his commission captain yanky said it was his due by the law of privateers indeed captain wright had the most right to her having by his commission protected captain yanky from the french who would have turned him out because he had no commission and he likewise began to engage her first but the company were all afraid that captain wright would presently carry her into a port therefore most of captain wrights men stuck to captain yanky and captain wright losing his prize burned his own ark and had captain yankys it being bigger than is own the tartan was sold to a jamaica trader and captain yanky commanded the prize ship we ent again from hence to rio la hach and set the risoners ashore and it being now the beginning of ov we concluded to go to querisao to sell our ugar if favored by westerly winds which were ow come in we sailed from thence having fair eather and winds to our mind which brought us  querisao a dutch island captain wright went aar to the governor and offered him the sale of e sugar but the governor told him he had a eat trade with the spaniards therefore he could t admit us in there but if we would go to st thomas which is an island and free port belonging to the danes and a sanctuary for privateers he would send a sloop with such goods as we wanted and money to buy the sugar which he would take at a certain rate but it was not agreed to  querisao is the only island of importance that the dutch have in the west indies it is about   leagues in length and may be   or  0 in circumference the northermost point is laid down in north lat    d  0 m and it is about   or   leagues from the main near cape roman on the south side of the east end is a good harbor called santa barbara but the chiefest harbor is about   leagues from the s e end on the south side of it where the dutch have a very good town and a very strong fort ships bound in thither must be sure to keep close to the harbors mouth and have a hasar or rope ready to send one end ashore to the fort for there is no anchoring at the entrance of the harbor and the current always sets to the westward but being got in it is a very secure port for ships either to careen or lie safe at the east end are two hills one of them is much higher than the other and steepest toward the north side the rest of the island is indifferent level where of late some rich men have made sugar works which formerly was all pasture for cattle there are also some small plantations of potatoes and yames and they have still a great many cattle on the island but it is not so much esteemed for its produce as for its situation for the trade with the spaniard formerly the harbor was never without ships from cartegne and portobell that did use to buy of the dutch here  000 or   00 negroes at once besides great quantities of european commodities but of late that trade is fallen into the hands of the english at jamaica yet still the dutch have a vast trade over all the west indies sending from holland ships of good force laden with european goods whereby they make very profitable returns the dutch have   other islands here but of little moment in comparison of querisao the one lies   or   leagues to the westward of querisao called aruba the other   or  0 leagues to the eastward of it called bon airy from these islands the dutch fetch in sloops provision for querisao to maintain their garrison and negroes i was never at aruba therefore cannot say any thing of it as to my own knowledge but by report it is much like bon airy which i shall describe only not so big between querisao and bon airy is a small island called little querisao it is not above a league from great querisao the king of france has long had an eye on querisao and made some attempts to take it but never yet succeeded i have heard that about    or    years since the governor had sold it to the french but dyed a small time before the fleet came to demand it and by his death that design failed afterward in the year      the count d estree who a year before had taken the isle of tobago from the dutch was sent thither also with a squadron of stout ships very well manned and fitted with bombs and carcasses intending to take it by storm this fleet came first to martinico where while they stayed orders were sent to petit guavers for all privateers to repair thither and assist the count in his design there were but   privateers ships that went thither with him which were manned partly with french partly with english men these set ut with the count but in their way to querisao he whole fleet was lost on a riff or ridge of ocks that runs off from the isle of aves not above   ships escaping   of which was   of the priteers and so that design perished  wherefore not driving a bargain for our sugar ith the governor of querisao we went from thence  bon airy another dutch island where we met a dutch sloop come from europe laden with irish b which we bought in exchange for some of our s  bon  is the eastermost of the dutch islands and is the largest of the   tho not the most confiderable the middle of the island is laid down in lat    d    m it is about  0 leagues from the main and   or  0 from querisao and is accounted    or    leagues round the road is on the s w side near the middle of the island where there is a pretty deep bay runs in ships that come from the eastward luff up close to the eastern shore and let go their anchor in  0 fathom water within half a cables length of the shore but at the same time they must be ready with a boat to carry a hasar or rope and make it fast ashore otherwise when the landwind comes in the night the ship would drive off to sea again for the ground is so steep that no anchor can hold if once it starts about half a mile to the westward of this anchoring place there is a small low land and a channel between it and the main island  the houses are about half a mile within land right against the road there is a governor lives here a deputy to the governor of querisao and   or   soldiers with   or   families of indians there is no fort and the soldiers in peaceable times have little to do but to eat and sleep for they never watch but in time of war the indians are husbandmen and plant maiz and guinea corn and some yams and potatoes but their chiefest business is about cattle for this island is plentifully stocked with goats and they send great quantities every year in salt to querisao there are some horses and bulls and cows but i never saw any sheep tho i have been all over the island the south side is plain low land and there are several sorts of trees but none very large there is a small spring of water by the houses which serves the inhabitants tho it is blackish at the west end of the island there is a good spring of fresh water and   and   indian families live there but no water nor houses at any other place on the south side near the east end is a good saltpond where dutch sloops come for salt  from bonairy we went to the isle of aves or birds so called from its great plenty of birds as menofwar and boobies but especially boobies the booby is a waterfowl somewhat less than a hen of a light greyish color i observed the boobies of this island to be whiter than others this bird has a strong bill longer and bigger than a crows and broader at the end her feet are flat like a ducks feet it is a very simple creature and will hardly go out of a mans way in other places they build their nests on the ground but here they build on trees which i never saw any where else though i have seen of them in a great many places their flesh is black and eats fishy but are often eaten by the privateers their numbers have been much lessened by the french fleet which was lost here as i shall give an account  the manofwar as it is called by the english is about the bigness of a kite and in shape like it but black and the neck is red it lives on fish yet never lights on the water but soars alost like a kite and when it sees its prey it flys down head foremost to the waters edge very swiftly takes its prey out of the sea with his bill and immediately mounts again as swiftly and never touching the water with his bill his wings are very long his feet are like other landfowl and he builds on trees where he finds any but where they are wanting on the ground  this island aves lies about   or   leagues to the eastward of the island bonairy about    or    leagues french fleet was lost as i mentioned above runs along from the east end to the northward about   mile then trends away to the westward making as it were a half moon this riff breaks off all the sea and there is good riding in even sandy ground to the westward of it there are   or   small low sandykeys or island within this riff about   miles from the main island the count destree lost his fleet here in this manner coming from the eastward he fell in on the back of the riff and fired guns to give warning to the rest of his fleet but they supposing their admiral was engaged with enemies hoisted up their topsails and crowded all the sail they could make and ran full sail ashore after him all within half a mile of each other for his light being in the maintop was an unhappy beacon for them to follow and there escaped but one kingsship and one privateer the ships continued whole all day and the men had time enough most of them to get ashore yet many perished in the wreck and many of those that got safe on the islnd for want of being accustomed to such hardships died like rotten sheep but the privateers who had been used to such accidents lived merrily from whom i had this relation and they told me that if they had gone to jamaica with   cl a man in their pockets they could not have enjoyed themselves more for they kept in a gang by themselves and watched when the ships broke to get the goods that come from them and though much was staved against the rocks yet abundance of wine and brandy floated over the riff where these privateers waited to take it up they lived here about   weeks waiting an opportunity to transport themselves back again into hispaniola in all which time they were never without   or   hogsheads of wine and brandy in their tents and barrels of beef and pork which they could live on without bread well enough tho the newcomers out of france could not there were about forty frenchmen on board in one of the ships where there was good store of liquor till the after part of her broke away and floated over the riff and was carried away to sea with all the men drinking and singing who being in drink did not mind the danger but were never heard of afterward  in a short time after this great shipwreck captain pain commander of a privateer of   guns had a pleasant accident befell him at this island he came hither to careen intending to fit himself very well for here lay driven on the island mast yards timbers and many things that he wanted therefore he haled into the harbor close to the island and unriggd his ship before he had done a dutch ship of  0 guns was sent from querisao to take up the guns that were lost on the riff but seeing a ship in the harbor and knowing her to be a french privateer they thought to take her first and came within a mile of her and began to fire at her intending to warp in the next day for it is very narrow goingin capt pain got ashore some of his guns and did what he could to resist them though he did in a manner conclude he must be taken but while his men were thus busied he spied a dutch sloop turning to get into the road and saw her at the evening anchor at the west end of the island this gave him some hope of making his escape which he did by sending two canoas in the night aboard the sloop who took her and got confiderable purchase in her and he went away in her making a good reprizal and leaving his own empty ship to the dutch man of war  there is another island to the eastward of the isle of aves about   leagues called by privateers the little isle of aves which is overgrown with mangrove trees i have seen it but was never on it there are no inhabitants that i could learn on either of these islands but boobies and a few other birds  while we were at the isle of aves we careend capt wrights bark and scrubbd the sugarprize and got   guns out of the wrecks continuing here till the beginning of feb        we went from hence to the isles rocas to careen the sugarprize which the isle of aves was not a place so convenient for accordingly we haled close to one of the small islands and got our guns ashore the first thing we did and built a breastwork on the point and planted all our guns there to hinder an enemy from coming to us while we lay on the careen then we made a house and covered ir with our sails to put our goods and provisions in while we lay here a french man of war of    guns came through the keys or little islands to whom we sold about  0 tun of sugar i was aboard twice or thrice and very kindly welcomed both by the capt and his lieutenant who was a cavalier of malta and they both offered me great encouragement in france if i would go with them but i ever designed to continue with those of my own nation  the islands rocas are a parcel of small uninhabited islands lying about the lat of    degrees  0 min about    or    leagues from the main and about  0 leagues n w by w from tortuga and   or   leagues to the westward of orchilla another island lying about the same distance from the main which island i have seen but was never at it rocas stretch themselves east and west about   leagues and their breadth about   leagues the northermost of these islands is the most remarkable by reason of a high white rocky hill at the west end of it which may be seen a great way and on it there are abundance of tropic birds menofwar booby and noddys which breed there the booby and manofwar i have described already the noddy is a small black bird about the bigness of the english blackbird and indifferent good meat they build in rocks we never find them far off from shore i have seen of them in other places but never saw any of their nests but in this island where there is great plenty of them the tropic bird is as big as a pidgeon but round and plump like a partridge they are all white except two or three feathers in each wing of a light gray their bills are of a yellowish color thick and short they have one long feather or rather a quill about   inches long grows at the rump which is all the tail they have they are never seen far without either tropic for which reason they are called tropic birds they are very good food and we meet with them a great way at sea and i never saw of them any where but at sea and in this island where they build and are found in great plenty  by the sea on the south side of that high hill there is fresh water comes out of the rocks but so slowly that it yields not above  0 gallons in    hours and it tastes so copperish or aluminous rather and rough in the mouth that it seems very unpleasant at first drinking but after   or   days any water will seem to have no taste  the middle of this island low plain land over grown with long grass where there are multitudes of small gray fowls no bigger than a black bird yet lay eggs bigger than a magpys and they are therefore by privateers called egg birds the east end of the island is overgrown with black mangrove trees  there are   sorts of mangrove trees black red and white the black mangrove is the largest tree the body about as big as an oak and about  0 foot high it is very hard and serviceable timber but extraordinary heavy therefore not much made use of for building the red mangrove grows commonly by the sea side or by rivers or creeks the body is not so big as that of the black mangrove but always grows out of many roots about the bigness of a mans leg some bigger some less which is about     or  0 foot above the ground join into one trunk or body that seems to be supported by so many artificial stakes where this sort of tree grows it is impossible to march by reason of these stakes which grow so mixed one amongst another that i have when forced to go through them gone half a mile and never set my foot on the ground stepping from root to root the timber is hard and good for many uses the inside of the bark is red and it is used for tanning of leather very much all over the west indies the white mangrove never grows so big as the other two sorts neither is it of any great use of the young trees privateers use to make loom or handles for their oars for it is commonly straight but not very strong which is the fault of them neither the black nor white mangrove grow towering up from stilts or rising root as the red does but the body immediately out of the ground like other trees  the land of this east end is light sand which is sometimes overflown with the sea at springtides the road for ships is on the south side against the middle of the island the rest of the islands of rocas are low the next to this on the south side is but small flat and even without trees bearing only grass on the south side of it is a pond of brackish water which sometimes privateers use instead of better there is likewise good riding by it about a league from this are two other islands not  00 yards distant from each other yet a deep channel for ships to pass through they are both overgrown with red mangrove trees which trees above any of the mangroves do flourish best in wet drowned land such as these two islands are only the east point of the westermost island is dry sand without tree or bush on thispoint we careened lying on the south side of it  the other islands are low and have red mangroves and other trees on them here also ships may ride but no such place for careening as where we lay because at that place ships may hale close to the shore and if they had but four guns on the point may secure the channel and hinder any enemy from coming near them i observe that within among the islands was good riding in many places but not without the islands except to the westward or south west of them for on the east or n e of these islands the common trade wind blows and makes a great sea and to the southward of them there is no ground under  0  0 or  00 fathom close by the land  after we had filled what water we could from hence we set out again in april      and came to salttortuga so called to distinguish it from the shoals of dry tortugas near capt florida and from the isle of tortugas by hispamola which was called formerly french tortugas though not having heard any mention of that name a great while i am apt to think it is swallowed up in that of petitguavres the chief garrison the french have in those parts this island we arrived at is pretty large uninhabited and abounds with salt it is in lat    d north and lies west and a little northerly from margarita an island inhabited by the spaniards strong and wealthy it is distant from it about    leagues and    or    from cape blanco on the main a ship being within these islands a little to the south ward may see at once the main margarita and tortuga when it is clear weather the east end of tortuga is full of rugged bare broken rocks which stretch themselves a little way out to sea at the s e part is of an indifferent good road for ships much frequented in peaceable times by merchantships that come thither to lade salt in the months of may june july and august for at the east end is a large saltpond within  00 paces of the sea the salt begins to kern or grain in april except it is a dry season for it is observed that rain makes the salt kern i have seen above  0 sail at a time in this road come to lade salt and these ships coming from some of the caribbe islands are always well stored with rum sugar and limejuice to make punch to hearten their men when they are at work getting and bringing aboard the salt and they commonly provide the more in hopes to meet with privateers who resort hither in the aforesaid months purposely to keep a christmas as they call it being sure to meet with liquor enough to be merry with and are very liberal to those that treat them near the west end of the island on the south side there is a small harbor and some fresh water that end of the island is full of shrubby trees but the east end is rocky and barren as to trees producing only course grass there are me goats on it but not many and turtle or tortoise come upon the sandy bays to lay their eggs and from them the island has its name there is no riding any where but in the roads where the saltponds are or in the harbor  at this isle we thought to have sold our sugar among the english ships that come hither for salt but failing there we designed for trinidada an island near the main inhabited by the spaniards tolerably strong and wealthy but the current and easterly winds hindering us we passed through between margarita and the main and went to blanco a pretty large island almost north of margarita about  0 leagues from the main and in    d  0 m north lat it is a flat even low uninhabited island dry and healthy most savannah of long grass and has some trees of lignum vitae growing in spots with shrubby bushes of other wood about them it is plentifully stored with guanos which are an animal like a lizard but much bigger the body is as big as the small of a mans leg and from the hind quarter the tail grows tapering to the end which is very small if a man takes hold of the tail except very near the hind quarter it will part and break off in one of the joints and the guano will get away they lay eggs as most of those amphibious creatures do and are very good to eat their flesh is much esteemed by privateers who commonly dress them for their sick men for they make very good broth they are of diverse colors as almost black dark brown light brown dark green light green yellow and speckled they all live as well in the water as on land and some of them are constantly in the water and among rocks these are commonly black others that live in swampy wet ground are commonly on bushes and trees these are green but such as live in dry ground as here at blanco are commonly yellow yet these also will live in the water and are sometimes on trees the road is on the n w end against a small cove or little sandy bay there is no riding any where else for it is deep water and steep close to the land there is one small spring on the west side and there are sandy bays round the island where turtle or tortoise come up in great abundance going ashore in the night these that frequent this island are called green turtle and they are the best of that sort both for largness and sweetness of any in all the west indies i would here give a particular description of these and other sorts of turtle in these seas but because i shall have occasion to mention some other sort of turtle when i come again into the south seas that are very different from all these i shall there give a general account of all these several sorts at once that the difference between them may be the better discerned some of our modern descriptions speak of goats on this island i know not what there may have been formerly but there are none now to my certain knowledge for my self and many more of our crew have been all over it indeed these parts have undergone great changes in this last age as well in places themselves as in their owners and commodities of them particularly nombre dedios a city once famous and which still retains a considerable name in some late accounts is now nothing but a name for i have lain ashore in the place where that city stood but it is all overgrown with wood so as to leave no sign that any town has been there  we staid at the isle of blanco not above ten days and then went back to salttortuga again where captain yanky parted with us and from thence after about   days all which time our men were drunk and quarrelling we in capt wrights ship went to the coast of caraccos on the main land this coast is upon several accounts very remarkable it is a continued tract of high ridges of hills and small valleys intermixed for about  0 leagues stretching east and west but in such manner that the ridges of hills and the valleys alternately run pointing upon the shore from south to north the valleys some of them about   or   others not above one or two furlongs wide and in length from the sea scarce any of them above   or   mile at most there being a long ridge of mountains at that distance from the seacoast and in a manner parallel to it that joins those shorter ridges and closes up the south end of the valleys which at the north ends of them lie open to the sea and make so many little sandy bays that are the only landing places on the coast both the main ridge and these shorter ribs are very high land so that   or   leagues off at sea the valleys scarce appear to the eye but all looks like one great mountain from the isles of rocas about    and from the isle of aves about  0 leagues off we see this coast very plain from on board our ships yet when at anchor on this coast we cannot see those isles tho again from the tops of these hills they appear as if at no great distance like so many hillocks in a pond these hills are barren except the lower sides of them that are covered with some of the same rich black mould that fiills the valleys and is as good as i have seen in some of the valleys there is a strong red clay but in the general they are extremely fertile well watered and inhabited by spaniards and their negroes they have maiz and plantains for their support with indian fowls and some hogs but the main product of these valleys and indeed the only commodity it vends are the cacao nuts of which the chocolate is made the cacaotree grows no where in the north seas but in the bay of campeachy on costa rica between portabel and nicaragua chiefly up carpenters river and on this coast as high as the isle of trinidada in the south seas it grows in the river of guiaquil a little to the southward of the line and in the valley of collima on the south side of the continent of mexico both which places i shall hereafter describe besides these i am confident there is no place in the world where the cacao grows except those in jamaica of which there are now but few remaining of many and large walks or plantations of them found there by the english at their first arrival and since planted by them and even these tho there is a great deal of pains and care bestowed on them yet seldom come to any thing being generally blighted the nuts of this coast of caraccos tho less than those of costa rica which are large flat nuts yet are better and fatter in my opinion being so very oily that we are forced to use water in rubbing them up and the spaniards that live here instead of parching them to get off the shell before they pound or rub them to make chocalate do in a manner burn em to dry up the oil for else they say it would fill them too full of blood drinking chocolate as they do five or six times a day my worthy consort mr ringrose commends most the guiaquil nut i presume because he had little knowledge of the rest for being intimately acquainted with him i know the course of his travels and experience but i am persuaded had he known the rest so well as i pretend to have done who have at several times been long used to and in a manner lived upon all the several sorts of em abovementioned he would prefer the caraccos nuts before any other yet possibly the drying up of these nuts so much by the spaniards here as i said may lessen their esteem with those europeans that use their chocolate ready rubbed up so that we always chose to make it up our selves  the cacao tree has a body about a foot and an half thick the largest sort and   or   foot high to the branches which are large and spreading like an oak with a pretty thick smooth darkgreen leaf shaped like that of a plumbtree but larger the nuts are enclosed in cods as big as both a mans fists put together at the broad end of which there is a small tough limber stalk by which they hang pendulous from the body of the tree in all parts of it from top to bottom scattered at irregular distances and from the greater branches a little way up especially at the joints of them or partings where they hang thickest but never on the smaller boughs there may be ordinarily about  0 or  0 of these cods upon a well bearing tree and they have   crops of them in a year one in december but the best in june the cod it self or shell is almost half an inch thick neither spongy nor woody but of a substance between both brittle yet harder than the rind of a lemmon like which its surface is grained or knobbd but more course and unequal the cods at first are of a darkgreen but the side of them next the sun of a muddy red as they grow ripe the green turns to a fine bright yellow and the muddy to a more lively beautiful red very pleasant to the eye they neither ripen nor are gathered at once but for three weeks or a month when the season is the overseers of the plantations go every day about to see which are turned yellow cutting at once it may be not above one from a tree the cods thus gathered they lay in several heaps to sweat and then bursting the shell with their hands they pull out the nuts which are the only substance they contain having no stalk or pith among them and excepting that these nuts lie in regular rows are placed like the grains of maiz but sticking together and so closely stowed that after they have been once separated it would be hard to place them again in so narrow a compass there are generally near  00 nuts in a cod in proportion to the greatness of which for it varies the nuts are bigger or less when taken out they dry them in the sun upon mats spread of the ground after which they need no more care having a thin hard skin of their own and much oil which preserves them salt water will not hurt them for we had our baggs rotten lying in the bottom of our ship and yet the nuts never the worse they raise the young trees of nuts set with the great end downward in fine black mould and in the same places where they are to bear which they do in   or   years time without the trouble of transplanting there are ordinarily of these trees from  00 to  000 and upward in a plantation or cacao walk as they call them and they shelter the young trees from the weather with plantains set about them for   or   years destroying all the pantains by such time the cacaotrees are of a pretty good body and able to endure the heat which i take to be the most pernicious to them of any thing for tho these valleys lie open to the north winds unless a little sheltered here and there by some groves of plantain trees which are purposely set near the shores of the several bays yet by all that i could either observe or learn the cacaos in this country are never blighted as i have often known them to be in other places cacao nuts are used as money in the bay of campeachy  the chief town of this country is called caraccos a good way within land it is a large we wey place where live most of the owners of se cacaowalks that are in the valleys by the the plantations being managed by overseers and negroes it is in a large savannah country  abounds with cattle and a spaniard of my acqutance a very sencible man who has been there tells me that it is very populous and he judges it to be   times as big as corunna an gallicia the way to it is very steep and craggy over that ridge of hills which i say closes up the valleys and partition hills of the cacao coast in this coast it self the chief place is la guiare a good town close by the sea and though it had but a bad harbor yet it is much frequented by the spanish shipping for the dutch and english anchor in the sandy bays that lie here and there in the mouths of several valleys and where there is a good riding the town is open but has a strong fort yet both were taken some years since by captain wright and his privateers it is seated about   or   leagues to the westward of cape blanco which cape is the eastermost boundary of this coast of caraccos further eastward about  0 leagues is a great lake or branch of the sea called laguna de venezaela about which are many rich towns but the mouth of the lake is so shallow that no ship can enter near this mouth is a place called comana where the privateers were once repulsed without daring to attempt it any more being the only place in the north seas they attempted in vain for many years and the spaniards since throw it in their teeth frequently as a word of reproach or defiance to them not far from that place is verina a small village and spanish plantation famous for its tobacco reputed the best in the world  but to return to caraccos all this coast is subject to dry winds generally north east which caused us to have scabby lips and we always sound it thus and that in different seasons of the year for i have been on this coast several times in other respects it is very healthy and a sweet clear air the spaniards have lookouts or scouts on the hills and breastworks in the valleys and most of their negroes are furnished with arms also for defense of the bays the dutch have a very profitable trade here almost to themselves i have known three or four great ships at a time on the coast each it may be of  0 or  0 guns they carry hither all sorts of european commodities especially linen making vast returns chiefly in silver and cacao and i have often wondered and regretted it that none of my own countrymen find the way thither directly from england for our jamaicamen trade thither indeed and find the sweet of it tho they carry english commodities at second or third hand  while we lay on this coast we went ashore in some of the bays and took   or   tun of cacao and after that   barks one laden with hides the second with european commodities the third with earthen ware and brandy with these   barks we went again to the island rocas where we shared our commodities and separated having vessels enough to transport us all whither we thought most convenient twenty of us for we were about  0 took one of the vessels and our share of the goods and went directly for virginia in our way thither we took several of the sucking fishes for when we see them about the ship we cast out a line and hook and they will take it with any manner of bait whether fish or flesh the sucking fish is about the bigness of a large whiting and much of the some shape toward the tail but the head is flatter from the head to the middle of it back there grows a sort of flesh of a hard gristl substance like that of the limpit a shellfish tapering up piramidically which sticks to the rocks or like the head or mouth of a shell snai but harder this exerescence is of a flat oval for about   or   inches long and   or   broad and rsing about half an inch high it is full of sma ridges with which it will fasten it self to any thing that it meets with in the sea just as a snail does to a wall when any of them happen to come about a ship they seldom leave her for they will feed on such filth as is daily thrown overboard or on mere excrements when it is fair weather and but little wind they will play about the ship but in blustering weather or when the ship sails quick they commonly fasten themselves to the ships bottom from whence neither the ships motion tho never so swift nor the most tempestuous sea can remove them they will likewise fasten themselves to any other bigger fish for they never swim fast themselves if they meet with any thing to carry them i have found them sticking to a shark after it was haled i on the deck though a shark is so strong and boisterous a fish and throws about him so vehemently for half an hour together it may be when caught that did not the suckingfish stick at no ordinary rate it must needs be cast off by so much violence it is usual also to see them sticking to turtle to any old trees planks or the like that lie driving at sea any knobs or inequalities at a ships bottom are a great hindrance to the swiftness of its sailing and  0 or    of these sticking to it must needs retard it as much in a manner as if its bottom were foul so that i am inclined to think that this fish is the remora of which the ancients tell such stories if it be not i know no other that is and i leave the reader to judge i have seen of these sucking fishes in great plenty in the bay of campeachy and in all the sea between that and the coast of cces as about those islands particularly i have lately described rocas blanco tortugas etc they have no scales and are very good meat  we met nothing else worth remark in our voyage to virginia where we arrived in july      that country is so well known to our nation that i shall say nothing of it nor shall i detain the reader with the story of my own affairs and the troubles that befell me during about    months of my stay there but in the next chapter enter immediately upon my second voyage into the south seas and round the globe  chap iv the authors voyage to the isle of john fernando in the south sea he arrives at the isle of cape verd isle of sall its salt ponds the flamingo and its remarkable nest ambergriese where found the isles of st nicholas mayo st jago fogo a burning mountain with the rest of the isles of cape verd sherborough river on the coast of guinea the

other indians the island described the savannahs of america goats at john fernandos seals sea lions snappers a sort of fish rockfish the bays and natural strength of this island  being now entering upon the relation of a new voyage which makes up the main body of this book proceeding from virginia by the way of terra del fuego and the south seas the east indies and so on till my return to england by the way of the cape of good hope i shall give my reader this short account of my first entrance upon it among those who sharp into the south seas in our former expedition and leaving him there returned over land as is said in the introduction and in the  st and  d chapters there was one mr cook an english native of st christophers a cirole as we call all born of european parents in the west indies he was a sensible man and had been some years a privateer at our joining our selves with those privateers we met at our coming again to the north seas his lot was to be with captain yanky who kept company for some considerable time with capt wright in whose ship i was and parted with us at our  d anchoring at the isle of tortugas as i have said in the last chapter after our parting this mr cook being quartermaster under captain yanky the second place in the ship according to the law of privateers laid claim to a ship they took from the spaniards and such of captain yankys men as were so disposed particularly all those who came with us over land went aboard this prize ship under the new capt cook this destribution was made at the isle of vacca or the isle of ash as we call it and here they parted also such goods as they had taken but capt cook having no commission as captain yanky captain tristian and some other french commanders had who lay then at that island and they grutching the english such a vessel they all joined together plundered the english of their ship goods and arms and turned them ashore yet capt tristian took in about   or  0 of these english and carried them with him to petit guavers of which number captain cook was one and capt davis another who with the rest found means to seize the ship as she lay at anchor in the road capt tristian and many of his men being then ashore and the english sending ashore such french men as remained in the ship and were mastered by them though superior in number stood away with her immediately for the isle of vacca before any notice of this surprise could reach the french governor of that isle so deceiving him also by a stratagem they got on board the rest of their countrymen wha had been left on that island and going thence they took a ship newly come from france laden with wines they also took a ship of good force in which they resolved to embark themselves and make a new expedition into the south seas to cruise on the coast of chili and peru but first they went for virginia with their prizes where they arrived the april after my coming thither the best of the prizes carried    guns this they fitted up there with sails and every thing necessary for so long a voyage selling the wines they had taken for such provisions as they wanted my self and those of our fellowtravellers over the isthmus of america who came with me to virginia the year before this most of which had since made a short voyage to carolina and again returned to virginia resolved to join our selves to these new adventurers and as many more engaged tn the same design as made our whole crew consist of  0 men so having furnished our selves with necessary materials and agreed upon some particular rules especially of temperance and sobriety by reason of the length of our intended voyage we all went on board our ship  august         we sailed from achamack to virginia under the command of capt cook bound for the south seas i shall not trouble the reader with an account of every days run but hasten to the less known parts of the world to give a description of em only relating such memorable accidents as happened to us and such places as we touched at by the way  we met nothing worth observation till we came to the islands of cape verd except a terrible storm which could not escape it this happened in a few days after we left virginia with a s s e wind just in our teeth the storm lasted above a week it drencht us all like so many drowned rats and was one of the worst storms i ever was in one i met with in the east indies was more violent for the time but of not above    hours continuance after that storm we had favorable winds and good weather and in short time we arrived at the island sall which is one of the eastermost of the cape verd islands of these there are ten in number so considerable as to bear distinct names and they lie several degrees off from cape verd in africa whence they receive that appellation taking up about   degrees of longitude in breadth and about as many of latitude in their length viz from near    to    north they are most inhabited by portuguese banditti this of sall is an island lying in the lat of    in long    degrees    m west from the lizard in england stretching from north to south about   or   leagues and not above a league and an half or   leagues wide it has its name from the abundance of salt that is naturally congealed there the whole island being full of large saltponds the land is very barren producing no tree that i could see but some small shrubby bushes by the sea side neither could i discern any grass yet there are some poor goats on it  i know not whether there are any other beasts on the island there are some wild fowl but i judge not many i saw a few flamingos which is a sort of large fowl much like a heron in shape but bigger and of a reddish color they delight to keep together in great companies and feed in mud or ponds or in such places where there is not much water they are very shy therefore it is hard to shoot them yet i have lain obscured in the evening near a place where they resort and with two more in my company have killed    of them at once the first shot being made while they were standing on the ground the other two as they rose they build their nests in shallow ponds where there is much mud which they scrape together making little hillocks like small islands appearing out of the water a foot and half high from the bottom they make the foundation of these hillocks broad bringing them up tapering to the top where they leave a small hollow pit to lay their eggs in and when they either lay their eggs or hatch them they stand all the while not on the hillock but close by it with their legs on the ground and in the water resting themselves against the hillock and covering the hollow nest upon it with their rumps for their legs are very long and building thus as they do upon the ground they could neither draw their legs conveniently into their nests nor sit down upon them otherwise than by resting their whole bodies there to the prejudice of their eggs or their young were it not for this admirable contrivance which they have by natural instinct they never lay more than two eggs and seldom fewer they young ones cannot fly till they are almost full grown but will run prodigiously fast yet we have taken many of them the flesh of both young and old is lean and black yet very good meat tasting neither fishy nor any way unsavory their tongues are large having a large knob of fat at the root which is an excellent bit a dish of flamingos tongues being fit for a princes table  when many of them are standing together by a ponds side being half a mile distant from a man they appear to him like a brick wall their feathers being of the color of new red brick and they commonly stand upright and single one by one exactly in a row except when feeding and close by each other the young ones at first are of a light gray and as their wingfeathers spring out they grow darker and never come to their right color or any beautiful shape under  0 or    months old i have seen flamingos at rio la hacha and at an island lying near the main of america right against querisao called by privateers flamingo key from the multitude of these fowls that breed there and i never saw of their nests and young but here  there are not above   or   men on this island of sall and a poor governor as they called him who came on board in our boat and brought   or   poor lean goats for a present to our captain telling him they were the best that the island did afford the captain minding more the poverty of the giver than the value of the present gave him in requital a coat to cloth him for he had nothing but a few rags on his back and an old hat not worth   farthings which yet i believe he wore but seldom for fear he should want before he might get another for he told us there had not been a ship in   years before we bought of him about  0 bushels of salt for a few old clothes and he begged a little powder and shot we stayed here   days in which time one of these partuguese offered to some of our men a lump of ambergriese in exchange for some clothes desiring them to keep it secret for he said if the governor should know it he should be hanged at length one mr coppinger bought it for a small matter yet i believe he gave more than it was worth we had not a man in the ship that knew ambergriese but i have since seen it in other places and therefore am certain it was not right it was of a dark color like sheeps dung and very soft but of no smell and possibly twas some of their goats dung i afterward saw some sold at the nequebars in the east indies which was of a light color but very hard neither had it any smell and this also i suppose was a cheat yet it is certain that in both these places there is ambergriese found  i was told by one john read a bristol man that he was prentice to a master who traded to these islands of cape verd and once as he was riding at an anchor at fogo another of these islands there was a lump of it swam by the ship and the boat being ashore he mist it but knew it to be ambergriese having taken up a lump swimming in the like manner the voyage before and his master having at several times bought pieces of it of the natives of the isle of fogo so as to enrich himself thereby and so at the necquebars english men have bought as i have been credibly informed great quantities of very good ambergriese yet the inhabitants are so subtle that they will counterfeit it both there and here and i have heard that in the gulf of florida whence much of it comes the native indians there use the same fraud  upon this occasion i cannot omit to tell my reader what i learnt from mr hill a chyrurgeon upon his showing me once a piece of ambergriese which was thus one mr benjamin berker a man that i have been long well acquainted with and know him to be a very diligent and observing person and likewise very sober and credible told this mr hill that being in the bay of honduras to procure logwood which grows there in great abundance and passing in a canoa over to one of the islands in that bay he found upon the shore on a sandy bay there a lump of ambergriese so large that when carried to jamaica he found it to weigh one hundred pound and upwards when he first found it it lay dry above the mark which the sea then came to at high water and he observed in it a great multitude of beetles it was of a dusky color toward black and about the hardness of mellow cheese and of a very fragrant smell this that mr hill showed me being some of it which mr barker gave him besides those already mentioned all the places where i have heard that ambergriese has been found at bermudas and the bahama islands in the west indies and that part of the coast of africa with its adjacent islands which reaches from mozambique to the red sea  we went from this island of sall to st nicholas another of the cape verd islands lying west south west from sall about    leagues we arrived there the next day after we left the other and anchored on the s e side of the island this is a pretty large island it is one of the biggest of all the cape verd and lies in a triangular form the largest side which lies to the east is about  0 leagues long and the other two above  0 leagues each it is a mountainous barren island and rocky all round toward the sea yet in the heart of it there are valleys where the portuguese which inhabit here have vineyards and plantations and wood for fewed here are many goats which are but poor in comparison with those in other places yet much better than those at sall there are likewise many asses the governor of this island came aboard us with   or   gentlemen more in his company who were all indifferently well clothed and accoutred with swords and pistols but the rest that accompanied him to the seaside which were about  0 or  0 men more were but in a ragged garb the governor brought aboard some wine made in the island which tasted much like madera wine it was of a pale color and looked thick he told us the chief town was in a valley    mile from the bay where we rode that he had there under him above one hundred families besides other inhabitants that lived scattering in valleys more remore they were all very swarthy the governor was the clearest of them yet of a dark tawny complexion  at this island we scrubbd the bottom of our ship and here also we dug wells ashore on the bay and filled all our water and after   or   days stay we went from hence to mayo another of the cape verd islands lying about  0 mile east and by south from the other arriving there the next day and anchoring on the n w side of the island we sent our boat on shore intending to have purchased some provision as beef or goats with which this island is better stocked than the rest of the islands but the inhabitants would not suffer our men to land for about a week before our arrival there came an english ship the men of which came ashore pretending friendship and seized on the governor with some others and carrying them aboard made them send ashore for cattle to ransom their liberties and yet after this set sail and carried them away and they had not heard of them since the english man that did this as i was afterward informed was one capt bond of bristol whether ever he brought back those men again i know not he himself and most of his men have since gone over to the spaniards and twas he who had like to have burnt our ship after this in the bay of panama as i shall have occasion to relate  this isle of mayo is but small and environed with sholes yet a place much frequented by shipping for its great plenty of salt and though there is but bad landing yet many ships lade here every year here are plenty of bulls cows and goats and at a certain season in the year may june july and august a sort of small sea tortoise come hither to lay their eggs but these turtle are not so sweet as those in the west indies the inhabitants plant corn yams potatoes and some plantains and breed a few fowls living very poor yet much better than the inhabitants of any other of these islands st jago excepted which lies   or   leagues to the westward of mayo and is the chief the most fruitful and best inhabited of all the islands of cape verd yet mountainous and much barren land in it  on the east side of the isle st jago is a good port which in peaceable times especially is seldom without ships for this has long been a place which ships have been wont to touch at for water and refreshments as those outwardbound to the east indies english french and dutch many of the ships bound to the coast of guinea the dutch to surinam and their own portuguese fleet going for braziel which is generally about the latter end of september but few ships call in here in their return for europe when any ships are here the country people bring down their commodities to sell to the seamen and passengers viz bullocks hogs goats fowls eggs plantains and coco nuts which they will give in exchange for shirts drawers handkerchiefs hats wastecoasts britches or in a manner for any sort of cloth especially linen for woollen is not much esteemed there they care not willingly to part with their cattle of any sort but in exchange for money or linen or some other valuable commodity travelers must have a care of these people for they are very thievish and if they see an opportunity will snatch any thing from you and run away with it we did not touch at this island in this voyage but i was there before this in the year    0 when i saw a fort here lying on the top of an hill and commanding the harbor  the governor of this island is chief over all the rest of the islands i have been told that there are two large towns on this island some small villages and a great many inhabitants and that they make a great deal of wine such as is that of st nicholas i have not been on any other of the cape verd islands nor near them but have seen most of them at a distance they seem to be mountainous and batren some of these beforementioned being the most fruitful and most frequented by strangers especilly st jago and mayo as to the rest of them fogo and brava are two small islands lying to the westward of st jago but of little note only fogo is remarkable for its being a vulcano it is all of it one large mountain of a good height out of the top whereof issue flames of fire yet only discerned in the night and then it may be seen a great way at sea yet this island is not without inhabitants who live at the foot of the mountain near the sea their substance is much the same as in the other islands they have some goats fowls plantains coconuts etc as i am informed of the plantains and coconuts i shall have occasion to speak when i come into the east indies and shall defer the giving an account of them till then  the remainder of these islands of cape verd are st anthonia st lucia st vincente and bonavista of which i know nothing considerable  our entrance among these islands was from the north east for in our passage from virginia we ran pretty far toward the coast of gualata in africa to preserve the tradewind lest we should be born off too much to the westward and so lose the islands we anchored at the south of sall and passing by the south of st nicholas anchored again at mayo as has been said where we made the shorter stay because we could get no flesh among the inhabitants by reason of the regret they had at their governor and his mens being carried away by captain bond so leaving the isles of cape verd we stood away to the southward with the wind at e n e intending to have touched no more till we came to the streights of magellan but when we came into the lat of  0 degrees north we met the wind at s by w and s s w therefore we altered our resolutions and steered away for the coast of guinea and in few days came to the mouth of the river of sherbor which is an english factory lying south of sierra liona we had one of our men who was well acquainted there and by his direction we went in among the shoals and came to an anchor  sherboro was a good way from us so i can give no account of the place or our factory there save that i have been informed that there is a considerable trade driven there for a sort of red wood for dying which grows in that country very plentifully  called by our people camwood a little within the shore where we anchored was a town of negroes natives of this coast it was skreend from our sight by a large grove of trees that grew between them and the shore but we went thither to them several times during the   or   days of our stay here to refresh our selves and they as often came aboard us bringing with them plantains sugarcanes palmwines rice fowls and honey which they sold us they were no way shy of us being well acquainted with the english by reason of our guinea factories and trade this town seemed pretty large the houses but low and ordinary but one great house in the midst of it where their chief men meet and receive strangers and here they treated us with palmwine as to their persons they are like other negroes while we lay he we scrubbd the bottom of our ship and then fill all our water casks and buying up two puncheo of rice for our voyage we departed from hen about the mle of november      prosecuti our inten  toward the streights of magelan  we had but little wind after we got out and very hot weather with some fierce tornadoes commonly rising out of the n e which brought thunder lightening and rain these did not last long sometimes not a quarter of an hour and then the wind would shuffle about to the southward again and fall flat calm for these tornadoes commonly come against the wind that is then blowing as our thunderclouds are often observed to do in england but the tornadoes i shall describe more largely in my chapter of winds in the appendix to this book at this time many of our men were taken with fevers yet we lost but one while we lay in the calms we caught several great sharks sometimes   or   in a day and eat them all boiling and squeezing them dry and then stewing them with vinegar pepper etc for we had but little flesh aboard we took the benefit of every tornado which came sometimes   or   in a day and carried what sail we could to get to the southward for we had but little wind when they were over and those all winds between the tornadoes were much ainst us at s by e and s s e till we past the uinorial line which we crossed about a degree to e eastward of the meridian of the isle of st jago e of the cape verd islands  at first we could scarce lie s w but being got a degree to the southward of the line the wind rd most easterly and then we stemmed s w y s and as we got farther to the southward so e wind came about to the eastward and freshened  us in the lat of   s we had the wind at  in the lat of   we had it at e s e where  stood a considerable time and blew a fresh topnt gale we then made the best use of it steerg on briskly with all the sail we could make  this wind by the   th of jan carried us into the  of  south in all this time we met with nothing worthy remark not so much as a fish except flying fish which have been so often described that i think it needless for me to do it  here we found the sea much changed from its natural greenness to a white or palish color which caused us to sound supposing we might strike ground for whenever we find the color of the sea to change we know we are not far from land or shoals which stretch out into the sea running from some land but here we found no ground with one hundred fathom line i was this day at noon by reckoning    d  0 m west from the lizard the variation by our morning amplitude    d  0 m east the variation increasing the  0th day one of our chyrurgeons died much lamented because we had but one more for such a dangerous voyage  january    we made the sibbel de wards which are   islands lying in the lat of    d    m south and longitude west from the lizard in england by my account    d    m the variation here we found to be    d  0 m i had for a month before we came hither endeavored to persuade captain cook and his company to anchor at these islands where i told them we might probably get water a i then thought and in case we should miss of i here yet by being good husbands of what we had we might reach john fernandos in the south seas before our water was spent this i urged to hinde their designs of going through the streights of magellan which i knew would prove very dangerou to us the rather because our men being privateers and so more wilful and less under command would not be so ready to give a watchful attendance in  passage so little known for although these men we more under command than i had ever seen an privateers yet i could not expect to find them a a minutes call in coming to an anchor or weigh ing anchor beside if ever we should have occasion to moor or cast out two anchors we had not a boat to carry out or weigh an anchor these islands of sibbel de wards were so named by the dutch they are all three rocky barren islands without any tree only some dildobushes growing on them and i do believe there is no water on any one of them for there was no appearance of any water the two northernmost we could not come near but the southermost we came close by but could not strike ground till within   cables length of the shore and there found it to be foul rocky ground  from the time that we were in  0 degrees south till we came to these islands we had the wind between e n e and the n n e fair weather and a brisk gale the day that we made these islands we saw great sholes of small lobsters which colored the sea red in spots for a mile in compass and we drew some of them out of the sea in our waterbuckets they were no bigger than the top of a mans little finger yet all their claws both great and small like a lobster i never saw any of this sort of fish naturally red but here for ours on the english coast which are black naturally are not red till they are boiled neither did i ever any where else meet with any fish of the lobstershape so small as these unless it may be shrimps or prawns capt swan and capt eaton met also with sholes of this fish in much the same latitude and longitude  leaving therefore the sibbel de wards islands as having neither good anchorage nor water we sailed on directing our course for the streights of magellan but the winds hanging in the wester board and blowing hard often put us by our topsails so that we could not fetch it the  th day of february we fell in with the streights le mair which is very high land on both sides and the streights very narrow we had the wind at n n w a fresh gale and seeing the opening of the streights we ran in with it till within four mile of the mouth and then it fell calm and we found a strong tide setting out of the streights to the northward and like to founder our ship but whether flood or ebb i know not only it made such a short cockling sea as if it had been in a race or place where two tides meet for it ran every way sometimes breaking in over our waste sometimes over our poop sometimes over our bow and the ship tossed like an eggshell so that i never felt such uncertain jerks in a ship at   a clock in the evening we had a small breeze at w n w and steered away to the eastward intending to go round the states island the east end of which we reached the next day by noon having a fresh breeze all night  the  th day at noon being off the east end of states island i had a good observation of the sun and found my self in lat    d    m south  at the east end of states island are three small islands or rather rocks pretty high and white with the dung of fowls wherefore having observed the sun we haled up south designing to pass round to the southward of cape horn which is the southermost land of terra del fuego the winds hung in the western quarter betwixt the n w and the west so that we could not get much to the westward and we never saw terra del fuego after that evening that we made the straight le mair i have heard that there have been smokes and fires on terra del fuego not on the tops of hills but in plains and valleys seen by those who have sailed through the streights of magellan supposed to be made by the natives  we did not see the sun at rising or setting in order to take an amplitude after we left the sibbel de wards till we got into the south sea therefore i know not whether the variation increased any more or no indeed i had an observation of the sun at noon in lat    d  0 m and we were then standing to the southward with the wind at w by n and that night the wind came about more to the southward of the west and we tackt i was then in lat  0 by reckoning which was the farthest south lat that ever i was in  the   th day of feb being in lat    and to the west of cape horn we had a violent storm which held us till the  d day of march blowing commonly s w and s w by w and w s w thick weather all the time with small drizling rain but not hard we made a shift however to save    barrels of rainwater besides what we dressed our victuals withal  march the  d the wind shifted at once and came about at south blowing a fierce gale of wind soon after it came about to the eastward and we stood into the south seas  the  th day having an observation of the sun not having seen it of late we found our selves in lat    d  0 m and the variation to be but    d  0 m east  the wind stood at s e we had fair weather and a moderate gale and the   th day we were in lat    by observation and then found the variation to be but   d east  the   th day when we looked out in the morning we saw a ship to the southward of us coming with all the sail she could make after us we lay uzled to let her come up with us for we supposed her to be a spanish ship come from baldivia bound to lima we being now to the northward of baldivia and this being the time of the year when ships that trade thence to baldivia return home they had the same opinion of us and therefore made sure to take us but coming nearer we both found ourmistakes this proved to be one capt eaton in a ship sent purposely from london for the south seas we haled each other and the capt came on board and told us of his actions on the coast of brazil and in the river of plate  he met captain swan one that came from england to trade here at the east entrance into the streights of magellan and they accompanied each other through the streights and were separated after they were through by the sto rm beforementioned both we and capt eaton being bound for john fernandos isle we kept company and we spared him bread and beef and he spared us water which he took in as he passed through the streights  march the   d      we came in sight of the island and the next day got in and anchored in a bay at the south end of the island in    fathom water not two cables lengths from the shore we presently got out our canoa and went ashore to see for a moskito indian whom we left here when we were chased hence by   spanish ships in the year      a little before we went to arica capt watlin being then our commander after capt sharp was turned out  this indian lived here alone above   years and although he was several time sought after by the spaniards who knew he was left on the island yet they could never find him he was in the woods hunting for goats when capt watlin drew off his men and the ship was under sail before he came back to shore he had with him his gun and a knife with a small horn of powder and a few shot which being spent he contrived a way by notching his knife to saw the barrel of his gun into small pieces wherewith he made harpoons lances hooks and a long knife heating the pieces first in the fire which he struck with his gunflint and a piece of the barrel of his gun which he hardened having learnt to do that among the english the hot pieces of iron he would hammer out and bend as he pleased with stones and saw them with his jagged knife or grind them to an edge by long labor and harden them to a good temper as there was occasion all this may seem strange to those that are not acquainted with the sagacity of the indians but it is no more than these moskito men are accustomed to in their own country where they make their own fishing and striking instruments without either forge or anvil though they spend a great deal of time about them  other wild indians who have not the use of iron which the moskito men have from the english make hatchets of a very hard stone with which they will cut down trees the cottontree especially which is a soft tender wood to build their houses or make canoas and though in working their canoas hollow they cannot dig them so neat and thin yet they will make them fit for their service this their digging or hatchetwork they help out by fire whether for the felling of the trees or for the making the inside of their canoa hollow these contrivances are used particularly by the savage indians of blewfields river described in the  d chapter whose canoas and stonehatchets i have seen these stonehatchets are about  0 inches long   bread and   inches thick in the middle they are grownd away flat and sharp at both ends right in the midst and clear round it they make a notch so wide and deep that a man might place his finger along it and taking a stick or with about   foot long they bind it round the hatchethead in that notch and so twisting it hard use it as an handle or helve the head being held by it very fast nor are other wild indians less ingenious those of patagonia particularly head their arrows with flint cut or ground which i have seen and admired but to return to our moskito man on the isle of j fernando with such instruments as he made in that manner he got such provision as the island afforded either goats or fish he told us that at first he was forced to eat seal which is very ordinary meat before he had made hooks but afterward he never killed any seals but to make lines cutting their skins into thongs he had a little house or hut half a mile from the sea which was lined with goats skin his couch or barbecu of sticks lying along about   foot distant from the ground was spread with the same and was all his bedding he had no clothes left having worn out those he brought from waltins ship but only a skin about his waste he saw our ship the day before we came to an anchor and did believe we were english and therefore killed   goats in the morning before we came to an anchor and dressed them with cabbage to treat us when we came ashore he came then to the sea side to cogratulate our safe arrival and when we landed a moskito indian named robin first leaped ashore and running to his brother moskito man threw himself flat on his face at his feet who helping him up and embracing him fell flat with his face on the ground at robins feet and was by him taken up also we stood with pleasure to behold the suprize and tenderness and solemnity of this interview which was exceedingly affectionate on both sides and when their ceremonies of civility were over we also that stood gazing at them drew near each of us embracing him we had found here who was overjoyed to see so many of his old friends come hither as he thought purposely to fetch him he was named will as the other was robin these were names given them by the english for they have no names among themselves and they take it as a great favor to be named by any of us and will complain for want of it if we do not appoint them some name when they are with us saying of themselves they are poor men and have no name  this island is in lat    d    m and about   0 leagues from the main it is about    leagues round full of high hills and small pleasant valleys which if manured would probably produce any thing proper for the climate the sides of the mountains are part savannahs part woodland savannahs are clear pieces of land without woods not because more barren than the woodland for they are frequently spots of as good land as any and often are intermixed with woodland in the bay of campeachy are very large savannahs which i have seen full of cattle but about the river of plate are the largest that every i heard of  0  0 or  00 miles in length and jamaica cuba and hispaniola have many savannahs intermixed with woods places cleared of wood by art and labor do not go by this name but those only which are found so in the uninhabited parts of america such as this isle of john fernandos or which were originally clear in other parts  the grass in these savannahs at john fernandos is not a long flaggy grass such as is usually in the savannahs in the west indies but a sort of kindly grass both thick and flourishing the biggest part of the year the woods afford diverse sorts of trees some large and good timber for building but none fit for masts the cabbage trees of this isle are but small and low yet afford a good head and the cabbage very sweet this tree i shall describe in the appendix in the bay of campeachy  the savannahs are stocked with goats in great herds but those that live on the east end of the island are not so fat as those on the west end for though there is much more grass and plenty of water in every valley nevertheless they thrive not so well here as on the west end where there is less food and yet there are found greater flocks and those too fatter and sweeter  that west end of the island is all high champion ground without any valley and but one place to land there is neither wood nor any fresh water and the grass short and dry  goats were first put on the island by john fernando who first discovered it in his voyage from lima to baldivia and discovered also another island about the same bigness  0 leagues to the westward of this from those goats these were propagated and the island has taken its name from this its first discoverer who when he returned to lima desired a patent for it designing to settle here and it was in his second voyage hither that he set ashore   or   goats which have since by their increase so well stocked the whole island but he could never get a patent for it therefore it lies still destitute of inhabitants though doubtless capable of maintaining   or  00 families by what may be produced off the land only i speak much within compass for the savannahs would at present feed  000 head of cattle  goats and the land being cultivated would probably bear corn or wheat and good pease yams or potatoes for the land in their valleys and sides of the mountains is of a good black fruitful mould the sea about it is likewise very productive of its inhabitants seals swarmas thick about this island as if they had no other place in the world to live in for there is not a bay nor rock that one can get ashore on but is full of them sea lions are here in great companies and fish particularly snappers and rockfish are so plentiful that two men in an hours time will take with hook and line as many as will serve  00 men  the seals are a sort of creatures pretty well known yet it may not be amiss to describe them they are as big as calves the head of them like a dog therefore called by the dutch the seahounds under each shoulder grows a long thick fin these serve them to swim with when in the sea and are instead of legs to them when on the land for raising their bodies up on end by the help of these fins or stumps and so having their tailparts drawn close under them they rebound as it were and throw their bodies forward drawing their hinder parts after them and then again rising up and springing forward with their foreparts alternately they lie tumbling thus up and down all the while they are moving on land from their shoulders to their tails they grow tapering like fish and have two small fins on each side the rump which is commonly covered with their fins these fins serve instead of a tail in the sea and on land they sit on them when they give suck to their young their hair is of diverse colors as black gray dun spotted looking very sleek and pleasant when they come first out of the sea for these at john fernandos have fine thick short furr the like i have not taken notice of any where but in these seas here are always thousands i might say possibly millions of them either sitting on the bays or going and coming in the sea round the island which is covered with them as they lie at the top of the water playing and sunning themselves for a mile or two from the shore when they come out of the sea they bleat like sheep for their young and though they pass through hundreds of others young ones before they come to their own yet they will not suffer any of them to suck the young ones are like puppies and lie much ashore but when beaten by any of us they as well as the old ones will make toward the sea and swim very swift and nimble though on shore they lie very sluggishly and will not go out of our ways unless we beat them but snap at us a blow on the nose soon kills them large ships might here load themselves with seals skins and traneoyl for thy are extraordinary fat seals are found as well in cold as hot climates and in the cold places they love to get on lumps of ice where they will lie and sun themselves as here on the land they are frequent in the northern parts of europe and america and in the southern parts of africa as about the cape of good hope and at the streights of magellan and though i never saw any in the west indies but in the bay of campeachy at certain islands called the alceranes and at others called the deserts yet they are over all the american coast of the southseas from terra del fuego up to the equinoctial line but to the north of the equinox again in these seas i never saw any till as far as    north lat nor did i ever see any in the east indies in general they seem to resort where there is plenty of fish for that is their food and fish such as they feed on as cods groopers etc are most plentiful on rocky coasts and such is mostly this western coast of the south america as i shall further relate  the sealion is a large creature about    or    foot long the biggest part of his body is as big as a bull it is shaped like a seal but   times as big the head is like a lions head it has a broad face with many long hairs growing about its lips like a cat it has a great goggle eye the teeth   inches long about the bigness of a mans thumb in capt sharps time some of our men made dice with them they have no hair on their bodies like the seal they are of a dun color and are all extraordinary fat one of them being cut up and boiled will yield a hogshead of oil which is very sweet and wholesome to fry meat withal the lean flesh is black and of a course grain yet indifferent good food they will lie a week at a time ashore if not disturbed where   or   or more of them come ashore together they huddle one on another like swine and grunt like them making a hideous noise they eat fish which i believe is their common food  the snapper is a fish much like a roach but a great deal bigger it has a large head and mouth and great gills the back is of a bright red the belly of a silver color the scales are as broad as a shilling the snapper is excellent meat they are in many places in the west indies and the southseas i have not seen them any where beside  the rockfish is called by seamen a grooper the spaniards call it a baccalao which is the name for cod because it is much like it it is rounder than the snapper of a dark brown color and has small scales no bigger than a silverpenny this fish is good sweet meat and is found in great plenty on all the coast of peru and chili  there are only two bays in the whole island where ships may anchor these are both at the east end and in both of them is a rivolet of good fresh water either of these bays may be fortified with little charge to that degree that  0 men in each may be able to keep off  000 and there is no coming into these bays from the west end but with great difficulty over the mountains where if   men are placed they may keep down as many as come against them on any side this was partly experienced by   englishmen that capt davis left here who defended themselves against a great body of spaniards who landed in the bays and came here to destroy them and though the second time one of their consorts deserted and fled to the spaniards yet the other   kept their ground and were afterward taken in from hence by capt strong of london  we remained at john fernandos    days our sick men were ashore all the time and one of captain eatons doctors for he had four in his ship tending and feeding them with goat and several herbs whereof here is plenty growing in the brooks and their diseases were chiefly scorbutic  chap v the author departs from john fernandos of

sea properly so called for though it be usual with our mapmakers to give that name to this whole ocean calling it mare australe mal del zur or mare pacificum yet in my opinion the name of the pacifick sea ought not to be extended from south to north farther than from  0 to about   degrees south latitude and from the american shore westward indefinitely with respect to my observation who have been in these parts   0 leagues or more from land and still had the sea very quiet from winds for in all this tract of water of which i have spoken there are no dark rainy clouds though often a thick horizon so as to hinder an observation of the sun with the quadrant and in the morning hazy weather frequently and thick mists but scarce able to wet one nor are there in this sea any winds but the tradewind no tempest no tornadoes or hurricanes though north of the equator they are met with as well in this ocean as in the atlantic yet the sea it self at the new and full of the moon runs with high large long surges but such as never break out at sea and so are safe enough unless that where they fell in and break upon the shore they make it bad landing  in this sea we made the best of our way toward the line till in the lat of    s where we fell in with the main land of the south america all this course of the land both of chili and pern is vastly high therefore we kept    or    leagues off from shore being unwilling to be seen by the spaniards dwelling there the land especially beyond this from    degrees s lat    and from    to  0 is of a most prodigious height it lies generally in ridges parallel to the shore and   or   ridges one with another each surpassing other in height and those that are farthest within land are much higher than others they always appear blue when seen at sea sometimes they are obscured with clouds but not so often as the high lands in other parts of the world for here are seldom or never any rains on these hills any more than in the sea near it neither are they subject to fogs these are the highest mountains that ever i saw far surpassing the pike of tenariffe or santa martha and i believe any mountains in the world  i have seen very high land in the lat of  0 south but not so high as in the latitudes before described in sir john narboroughs voyage also to baldivia a city on this coast mention is made of very high land seen near baldivia and the spaniards with whom i have discoursed have told me that there is a very high land all the way between coquimbo which lies in about  0 d south lat and baldivia which is in  0 south so that by all likelihood these ridges of mountains do run in a continued chain from one end of peru and chili to the other all along this south sea coast called usually the andes or sierra nuevada des andes the excessive height of these mountains may possibly be the reason that there are no rivers of note that fall into these seas some small rivers indeed there are but very few of them for in some places there is not one that comes out into the sea in   0 or  00 leagues and where they are thickest they are  0  0 or  0 leagues asunder and too little and shallow to be navigable besides some of these do not constantly run but are dry at certain seasons of the year as the river of ylo runs flush with a quick current at the latter end of january and so continues till june and then it decreaseth by degrees growing less and running slow till the latter end of september when it fails wholly and runs no more till january again this i have seen at both seasons in   former voyages i made hither and have been informed by the spaniards that other rivers on this coast are of the like nature being rather torrents or landfloods caused by their rains at certain seasons far within land than perennial streams  we kept still along in sight of this coast but at a good distance from it encountering with nothing of note till in the lat of   degrees  0 min south on the  d of may we descried a sail to the northward of us she was plying to windward we chased her and capt eaton being a head soon took her she came from guiaquil about a month before laden with timber and was bound to lima three days before we took her she came from santa whither she had gone for water and where they had news of our being in these seas by an express from baldivia for as we afterward heard capt swan had been at baldivia to seek a trade there and he having met capt eaton in the streights of magellan the spaniards of baldivia were doubtless informed of us by him suspecting him also to be one of us though he was not upon this news the viceroy of lima sent expresses to all the sea ports that they might provide themselves against our assaults  we immediately steered away for the island lobos which lies in lat   d    m south lat i took the elevation of it ashore with an astrolabe and it is   leagues from the main it is called lobos de la mar to distinguish it from another that is not far from it and extremely like it called lobos de la terra for it lies nearer the main lobos or lovos is the spanish name for a seal of which there are great plenty about these and several other islands in these seas that go by this name  the  th of may we arrived at this isle of lobos de la mar and came to an anchor with our prize this lobos consists indeed of two little islands each about a mile round of an indifferent height a small channel between fit for boats only and several rocks lying on the north side of the islands a little way from shore there is a small cove or sandybay sheltred from the winds at the west end of the eastermost island where ships may carreen the rest of the shore as well round the two islands as between them is a rocky coast consisting of small cliffs within land they are both of them partly rocky and partly sandy barren without any fresh water tree shrub grass or herbs or any land animals for the seals and sealions come ashore here but fowls of which there are great multitudes as boobies but mostly penguins which i have seen plentifully all over the south seas on the coast of newfoundland and of the cape of good hope they are a seafowl about as big as a duck and such feet but a sharp bill feeding on fish they do not fly but flutter having rather stumps like a young goslins than wings and these are instead of fins to them in the water their feathers are downy their flesh is but ordinary food but their eggs are good meat there is another sort of small black fowl that make holes in the sand for their night habitations whose flesh is good sweet meat i never saw any of them but here and at john fernandos  there is good riding between the eastermost island and the rocks in ten twelve or fourteen fathom for the wind is commonly at s or s s e and the eastermost island lying east and west shelters that road  here we scrubbd our ships and being in a readiness to sail the prisoners were examined to know if any of them could conduct us to some town where we might make some attempt for they had before informed us that we were descried by the spaniards and by that we knew that they would send no riches by sea so long as we were here many towns were considered on as guiaquil zana truxillo and others at last truxillo was pitched on as the most important therefore the likeliest to make us a voyage if we could conquer it which we did not much question though we knew it to be a very populous city but the greatest difficulty was in landing for guanchaquo which is the nearest seaport to it but   miles off is an ill place to land since sometimes the very fishermen that live there are not able to go in   or   days however the   th of may in the afternoon our men were mustered of both ships companies and their arms proved we were in all  0  men fit for service besides the sick and the next day we intended to sail and take the wood prize with us but the next day one of our men being ashore betimes on the island descried three sail bound to the northward two of them without the island to the westward the other between it and the continent  we soon got our anchors up and chased and captain eaton who drew the least draught of water put through between the westermostisland and the rocks and went after those two that were without the islands we in captain cooks ship went after the other which stood in for the mainland but we soon fetched her up and having taken her stood in again with her to the island for we saw that captain eaton wanted no help having taken both those that he went after he came in with one of his prizes but the other was so far to leeward and so deep that he could not then get her in but he hoped to get her in the next day but being deep laden as designed to go down before the wind to panama she would not bear sail  the  0th day she turned all day but got nothing nearer the island our moskitostrikers according to their custom went and struck six turtles for here are indifferent plenty of them these ships that we took the day before we came from guanchaquo all three laden with flower bound for panama two of them were laden as deep as they could swim the other was not above half laden but was ordered by the viceroy of lima to sail with the other two or else she should not sail till we were gone out of the seas for he hoped they might escape us by setting out early in the biggest ship was a letter to the president of panama from the viceroy of lima assuring him that there were enemies come into that sea for which reason he had dispatched these three ships with flower that they might not want for panama is supplied from peru and desired him to be frugal of it for he knew not when he should send more in this ship were likewise   or   tuns of marmalade of quinces and a stately mule sent to the president and a very large image of the virgin mary in wood carved and painted to adorn a new church at panama and sent from lima by the viceroy for this great ship came from thence not long before she brought also from lima  00000 pieces of eight to carry withher to panama but while she lay at guanchaco taking in her lading of flower the merchants hearing of capt swans being at baldivia ordered the money ashore again these prisoners likewise informed us that the gentlemen inhabitants of truxillo were building a fort at guanchaquo which is the seaport for truxillo close by the sea purposely to hinder the designs of any that should attempt to land there upon this news we altered our former resolutions and resolved to go with our three prizes to the gallapagos which are a great many large islands lying some under the equator others on each side of it i shall here omit the description of truxillo because in my appendix at the latter end of the book i intend to give a general relation of most of the towns of note on this coast from baldivia to panama and from thence toward california  the   th day in the evening we sailed from the island lobos with captain eaton in our company we carried the three flower prizes with us but our first prize laden with timber we left here at an anchor the wind was at s by e which is the common tradewind here and we steered away n w by n intending to run into the latitude of the isles gallapagos and steer off west because we did not know the certain distance and therefore could not shape a direct course to them when we came within  0 minutes of the equator we steered west having the wind at south a very moderate gentle gale it was the   st day of may when we first had sight of the islands gallapagos some of them appeared on our weatherbow some on our leebow others right a head we at first sight trimmed our sails and steered as nigh the wind as we could striving to get to the southermost of them but our prizes being deep laden their sails but small and thin and a very small gale they could not keep up with us therefore we likewise edged away again a point from the wind to keep near them and in the evening the ship that i was in and captain eaton anchored on the east side of one of the eastermost islands a mile from the shore in sixteen fathom water clean white hard sand  the gallapagos islands are a great number of uninhabited islands lying under and on both sides of the equator the fastermost of them are about   0 leagues from the main they are laid down in the longitude of     reaching to the westward as far as     therefore their longitude from england westward is about    degrees but i believe our hydrographers do not place them far enough to the westward the spaniards who first discovered them and in whose draughts alone they are laid down report them to be a great number stretching northwest from the line as far as   degrees n but we saw not above    or    they are some of them   or   leagues long and   or   broad they are of a good height most of them flat and even on the top   or   of the eastermost are rocky barren and hilly producing neither tree herb nor grass but a few dildotrees except by the sea side the dildotree is a green prickly shrub that grows about  0 or    foot high without either leaf or fruit it is as big as a mans leg from the root to the top and it is full of sharp prickles growing in thick rows from top to bottom this shrub is fit for no use not so much as to burn close by the sea there grows in some places bushes of burton wood which is very good firing this sort of wood grows in many places in the west indies especially in the bay of campeachy and in the sambaloes i did never see any in these seas but here there is water on these barren islands in ponds and holes among the rocks some other of these islands are mostly plain and low and the land more fertile producing trees of diverse sorts unknown to us some of the westermost of these islands are nine or ten leagues long and six or seven broad the mould deep and black these produce trees of great and tall bodies especially mammeetrees which grow here in great groves in these large islands there are some pretty big rivers and on many of the other lesser islands there are brooks of good water the spaniards when they first discovered these islands found multitudes of guanoes and landturtle or tortoise and named them the gallapagos islands i do believe there is no place in the world that is so plentifully stored with these animals the guanoes here are as fat and large as any that ever i saw they are so tame that a man may knock down twenty in an hours time with a club the landturtle are here so numerous that   or  00 men might subsist on them alone for several months without any other sort of provision they are extraordinary large and fat and so sweet that no pullet eats more pleasantly one of the largest of these creatures will weigh   0 or  00 weight and some of them are   foot or   foot   inches over the challapee or belly i did never see any but at this place that will weigh above  0 pound weight i have heard that at the isle of st lawrence or madagascar and at the english forest an island near it called also do mascarin and now possessed by the french there are very large ones but whether so big fat and sweet as these i know not there are   or   sorts of these creatures in the west indies one is called by the spaniards hecatee these live most in fresh waterponds and seldom come on land they weigh about  0 or    pound they have small legs and flat feet and small long necks another sort is called tenapen these are a great deal less than the hecatee the shell on their backs is all carved naturally finely wrought and well clouded the backs of these are rounder than those beforementioned they are otherwise much of the same form these delight to live in wet swampy places or on the land near such places both these sorts are very good meat they are in great plenty on the isle of pines near cuba there the spanish hunters when they meet them in the woods bring them home to their huts and mark them by notching their shells then let them go this they do to have them at hand for they never ramble far from thence when these hunters return to cubo after about a month or six weeks stay they carry with them   or  00 or more of these creatures to sell for they are very good meat and every man knows his own by their marks these tortoise in the gallapagos are more like the hecatee except that as i said before they are much bigger and they have very long small necks and little heads there are some green snakes on these islands but no other landanimal that i did ever see there are great plenty of turtledoves so tame that a man may kill   or   dozen in a forenoon with a stick they are somewhat less than a pigeon and are very good meat and commonly fat  there are good wide channels between these islands fit for ships to pass and in some places shole water where there grows plenty of turtlegrass therefore these islands are plentifully stored with seaturtle of that sort which is called the green turtle i have hitherto deferred the description of these creatures therefore i shall give it here there are   sorts of seaturtle viz the trunkturtle the loggerhead the hawksbill and the greenturtle the trunkturtle is commonly bigger than the other their backs are higher and rounder and their flesh rank and not wholesome the loggerhead is so called because it has a great head much bigger than the other sorts their flesh is likewise very rank and seldom eaten but in case of necessity they feed on moss that grows about rocks the hawksbill turtle is the leaft kind they are so called because their mouths are long and small somewhat resembling the bill of a hawk on the backs of these hawksbill turtle grows that shell which is so much esteemed for making cabinets combs and other things the largest of them may have three pound and an half of shell i have taken some that have had   pound  0 ounces but they commonly have a pound and half or two pound some not so much these are but ordinary food but generally sweeter than the loggerhead yet these hawksbills in some places are unwholesome causing them that eat them to purge and vomit excessively especially those between the sambaloes and portobel we meet with other fish in the west indies of the same malignant nature but i shall describe them in the appendix these hawksbill turtles are better or worse according to their feeding in some places they feed on grass as the green tortoise also does in other places they keep among rocks and feed on moss or seaweeds but these are not so sweet as those that eat grass neither is their shell so clear for they are commonly overgrown with barnacles which spoils the shell and their flesh is commonly yellow especially the fat  hawksbill turtle are in many places of the west indies they have islands and places peculiar to themselves where they lay their eggs and seldom come among any other turtle these and all other turtle lay eggs in the sand their time of laying is in may june july some begin sooner some later they lay three times in a season and at each time  0 or  0 eggs their eggs are as big as a hens egg and very round covered only with a white tough skin there are some bays on the northside of jamaica where these hawksbills resort to lay in the bay of honduras are islands which they likewise make their breeding places and many places along all the coast on the main of the west indies from trinidado to la vera cruz in the bay of nova hispania when a seaturtle turns out of the sea to lay she is at least an hour before she returns again for she is to go above high watermark and if it be low water when she comes a shore she must rest once or twice being heavy before she comes to the place where she lays when she has found a place for her purpose she makes a great hole with her fins in the sand wherein she lays her eggs then covers them two foot deep with the same sand which she threw out of the hole and so returns sometimes they come up the night before they intend to lay and take a view of the place and so having made a tour or semicircular march they return to the sea again and they never fail to come ashore the next night to lay near that place all sorts of turtle use the same methods in laying i knew a man in jamaica that made   pound sterling of the shell of these hawksbill turtle which he got in one season and in one small bay not half a mile long the manner of taking them is to watch the bay by walking from one part to the other all night making no noise nor keeping any sort of light when the turtle come ashore the man that watches for them turns them on their backs then hales them above high water mark and leave them till the morning a large green turtle with her weight and struggling will puzzle two men to turn her the hawksbill turtle are not only found in the west indies but on the coast of guinea and in the east indies i never saw any in the southseas  the green turtle are so called because their shell is greener than any other it is very thin and clear and better clouded than the hawksbill but it is used only for inlays being extraordinary thin these turtles are generally larger than the hawksbill one will weigh   or   hundred pound their backs are flatter than the hawksbill their heads round and small green turtle are the sweetest of all the kinds but there are degrees of them both in respect to their flesh and their bigness i have observed that at blanco in the west indies the green turtle which is the only kind there are larger than any other in the northseas there they commonly will weigh   0 or  00 pound their fat is yellow and the lean white and their flesh extraordinary sweet at boca toro west of portobel they are not so large their flesh not so white nor the fat so yellow those in the bays of honduras and campeachy are somewhat smaller still their fat is green and the lean of a darker color than those at bocatoro i heard of a monstrous green turtle once taken at port royal in the bay of campeachy that was four foot deep from the back to the belly and the belly   foot broad captain rochs son of about   or  0 years of age went in it as in a boat on board his fathers ship about a quarter of a mile from the shore the leaves of fat afforded   gallons of oil the turtle that live among the keys or small islands on the south side of cuba are a mixed sort some bigger some less and so their flesh is of a mixed color some green some dark some yellowish with these port royal in jamaica is constantly supplied by sloops that come hither with nets to take them they carry them alive to jamaica where the turtles have wires made with stakes in the sea to preserve them alive and the market is every day plentifully stored with turtle it being the common food there chiefly for the ordinary sort of people  green turtle live on grass which grows in the sea in       or   fathom water at most of the places beforementioned this grass is different from manateegrass for that is a small blade but this a quarter of an inch broad and six inches long the turtle of these islands gallapagos are a sort of a bastard green turtle for their shell is thicker than other green turtle in the west or east indies and their flesh is not so sweet they are larger than any other green turtle for it is common for these to be two or three foot deep and their callapees or bellies   foot wide but there are other green turtle in the southseas that are not so big as the smallest hawksbill these are seen at the island plata and other places thereabouts they feed on moss and are very rank but fat  both these sorts are different from any others for both he is and she is come ashore in the day time and lie in the sun but in other places none but the she is go ashore and that in the night only to lay their eggs the best feeding for turtle in the south seas is among these gallapago islands for here is plenty of grass  there is another sort of green turtle in the south seas which are but small yet pretty sweet these lie westward on the coast of mexico one thing is very strange and remarkable in these creatures that at the breeding time they leave for   or   months their common haunts where they feed most of the year and resort to other places only to lay their eggs and it is not thought that they eat any thing during this season so that both he is and she is grow very lean but the he is to that degree that none will eat them the most remarkable places that i did ever hear of for their breeding is at an island in the west indies called caimanes and the isle ascension in the western ocean and when the breeding time is past there are none remaining doubtless they swim some hundreds of leagues to come to those two places for it has been often observed that at caimanes at the breeding time there are found all those sorts of turtle before described the south keys of cuba are above  0 leagues from thence which is the nearest place that these creatures can come from and it is most certain that there could not live so many there as come here in one season  those that go to lay at ascension must needs travel much farther for there is no land nearer it than  00 leagues and it is certain that these creatures live always near the shore in the south sea likewise the gallapagos is the place where they live the biggest part of the year yet they go from thence at their season over to the main to lay their eggs which is  00 leagues the nearest place although multitudes of these turtle go from their common places of feeding and abode to those laying places yet they do not all go and at the time when the turtle resort to these places to lay their eggs they are accompanied with abundance of fish especially sharks the places which the turtle then leave being at that time destitute of fish which follow the turtle  when the she is go thus to their places to lay the male accompany them and never leave them till their return both male and female are fat the beginning of the season but before they return the male as i said are so lean that they are not fit to eat but the female are good to the very last yet not so fat as at the beginning of the season it is reported of these creatures that they are nine days engendring and in the water the male on the females back it is observable that the male while engendring do not easily forsake their female for i have gone and taken hold of the male when engendring and a very bad striker may strike them then for the male is not shy at all but the female seeing a boat when they rise to blow would make her escape but that the male grasps her with his two fore fins and holds her fast when they are thus coupled it is best to strike the female first then you are sure of the male also these creatures are thought to live to a great age and it is observed by the jamaica turtlers that they are many years before they come to their full growth  the air of these islands is temperate enough considering the clime here is constantly a fresh seabreeze all day and cooling refreshing winds in the night therefore the heat is not so violent here as in most places near the equator the time of the year for the rains is in november december and january then there is oftentimes excessive dark tempestuous weather mixed with much thunder and lightning sometimes before and after these months there are moderate refreshing showers but in may june july and august the weather is always very fair  we staid at one of these islands which lies under the equator but one night because our prizes could not get in to an anchor we refreshed our selves very well both with land and seaturtles and the next day we sailed from thence the next island of the gallapagos that we came to is but two leagues from this it is rocky and barren like this it is about five or six leagues long and four broad we anchored in the afternoon at the northside of the island a quarter of a mile from the shore in    fathom water it is steep all round this island and no anchoring only at this place here it is but ordinary riding for the ground is so steep that if an anchor starts it never holds again and the wind is commonly off from the land except in the night when the landwind comes more from the west for there it blows right along the shore though but faintly here is no water but in ponds and holes of the rocks that which we first anchored at has water on the northend falling down in a stream from high steep rocks upon the sandy bay where it may be taken up as soon as we came to an anchor we made a tent ashore for capt cook who was sick here we found the seaturtle lying ashore on the sand this is not customary in the west indies we turned them on their backs that they might not get away the next day more came up when we found it to be their custom to lie in the sun so we never took care to turn them afterward but sent ashore the cook every morning who killed as many as served for the day this custom we observed all the time we lay here feeding sometimes on landturtle sometimes on seaturtle there being plenty of either sort captain davis came hither again a second time and then he went to other islands on the west side of these there he found such plenty of landturtle that he and his men eat nothing else for   months that he staid there they were so fat that he saved sixty jars of oil out of those that he spent this oil served instead of butter to eat with doughboys or dumplins in his return out of these seas he found very convenient places to careen and good channels between the islands and very good anchoring in many places there he found also plenty of brooks of good fresh water and firewood enough there being plenty of trees fit for many uses capt harris one that we shall speak of hereafter came hither likewise and found some islands that had plenty of mammeetrees and pretty large rivers the sea about these islands is plentifully stored with fish such as are at john fernandos they are both large and fat and as plentiful here as at john fernandos here are particularly abundance of sharks the northpart of this second isle we anchored at lies    minutes north of the equator i took the height of the sun with an astrolabe these isles of the gallapagos have plenty of salt we stayed here but    days in which time we put ashore  000 packs of flower for a reserve if we should have occasion of any before we left these seas here one of our indian prisoners informed us that he was born at ria lexa and that he would engage to carry us thither he being examined of the strength and riches of it satisfied the company so well that they were resolved to go thither  having thus concluded the   th of june we sailed from hence designing to touch at the island cocos as well to put ashore some flower there as to see the island because it was in our way to ria lexa we steered north till in lat   d  0 min intending then to steer w by n for we expected to have had the wind at s by e or s s e as we had on the south side of the equator thus i had formerly found the winds near the shore in these latitudes but when we first parted from the gallapagos we had the wind at s and as we sailed farther north we had the winds at s by w then at s s w winds which we did not expect we thought at first that the wind would come about again to the south but when we came to sail off west to the island cocos we had the wind at s w by s and could lie but w by n yet we stood that course till we were in the lat   d  0 m n and then despairing as the winds were to find the island cocos we steered over to the main for had we seen the island then we could not have fetched it being so far to the north of it  the island cocos is so named by the spaniards because there are abundance of coconut trees growing on it they are not only in one or two places but grow in great groves all round the island by the sea this is an uninhabited island it is   or   leagues round and pretty high in the middle where it is destitute of trees but looks very green and pleasant with an herb called by the spaniards gramadael it is low land by the seaside  this island is in   d    m north of the equator it is environed with rocks which makes it almost inaccessible only at the n e end there is a small harbor where ships may safely enter and ride secure in this harbor there is a fine brook of fresh water running into the sea this is the account that the spaniards give of it and i had the same also from captain eaton who was there afterward  any who like us had not experienced the nature of the winds in these parts might reasonably expect that we could have sailed with a flown sheet to ria lexa but we found our selves mistaken for as we came nearer the shore we found the winds right in our teeth but i shall refer my reader to the chapter of winds in the appendix for a further account of this  we had very fair weather and small winds in this voyage from the gallapagos and at the beginning of july we fell in with cape blanco on the main of mexico this is so called from two white rocks lying off it when wear off at sea right against the cape they appear as part of the cape but being near the shore either to the eastward or westward of the cape they appear like two ships under sail at first view but coming nearer they are like two high towers they being small high and steep on all sides and they are about half a mile from the cape this cape is in lat   d    m it is about the height of beachyhead in england on the coast of sussex it is a full point with steep rocks to the sea the top of it is flat and even for about a mile then it gradually falls away on each side with a gentle descent it appears very pleasant being covered with great lofty trees from the cape on the n w side the land runs in n e for about   leagues making a small bay called by the spaniards caldera a league within cape blanco on the n w side of it and at the entrance of this bay there is a small brook of very good water running into the sea here the land is low making a saddling between   small hills it is very rich land producing large tall trees of many sorts the mould is black and deep which i have always taken notice of to be a fat soil about a mile from this brook toward the n e the woodland terminates here the savannah land begins and runs some leagues into the country making many small hills and dales these savannahs are not altogether clear of trees but are here and there sprinkled with small groves which render them very delightful the grass which grows here is very kindly thick and long i have seen none better in the west indies toward the bottom of the bay the land by the sea is low and full of mangroves but farther in the country the land is high and mountainous the mountains are part woodland part savannah the trees in those woods are but small and short and the mountain savannahs are clothed but with indifferent grass from the bottom of this bay it is but    or    leagues to the lake of nicaragua on the northsea coast the way between is somewhat mountainous but most savannah  capt cook who was taken sick at john fernandoes continued so till we came within   or   leagues of cape blanco and then died of a sudden though he seemed that morning to be as likely to live as he had been some weeks before but it is usual with sick men coming from the sea where they have nothing but the seaair to die off as soon as ever they come within the view of the land about   hours after we all came to an anchor namely the ship that i was in captain eaton and the great meal prize a league within the cape right against the brook of fresh water in    fathom clean hard sand presently after we came to an anchor capt cook was carried ashore to be buried    men carried there arms to guard those that were ordered to dig the grave for although we saw no appearance of inhabitants yet we did not know but the country might be thick inhabited and before capt cook was interred   spanish indians came to the place where our men were digging the grave and demanded what they were and from whence they came to whom our men answered they came from lima and were bound to ria lexa but that the capt of one of the ships dying at sea obliged them to come into this place to give him christian burial the   spanish indians who were very shy at first began to be more bold and drawing nearer asked many silly questions and our men did not stick to sooth them up with as many falsehoods purposely to draw them into their clutches our men often laughed at their temerity and asked them if they never saw any spaniards before they told them that they themselves were spaniards and that they lived among spaniards and that although they were born there yet they had never seen   ships there before our men told them that neither now might they have seen so many if it had not been on an urgent occasion at length they drilled them by discourse so near that our men laid hold on all three at once but before captain cook was buried one of them made his escape the other two were brought off aboard our ship captain eaton immediately came aboard and examined them they confessed that they came purposely to view our ship and if possible to inform themselves what we were for the president of panama not long before sent a letter of advice to nicoya informing the magistrates thereof that some enemies were come into these seas and that therefore it behoved them to be careful of themselves nicoya is a small mulatto town about    or    leagues east from hence standing on the banks of a river of that name it is a place very fit for building ships therefore most of the inhabitants are carpenters who are commonly employed in building new or repairing old ships it was here that capt sharp just after i left him in the year      got carpenters to six his ship before he returned for england and for that reason it behoved the spaniards to be careful according to the governor of panamas advice lest any men at other times wanting such necessaries as that place afforded might again be supplied there these spanish indians told us likewise that they were sent to the place where they were taken in order to view our ships as fearing these were those mentioned by the president of panama it being demanded of them to give an account of the estate and riches of the country they said that the inhabitants were most husbandmen who were employed either in planting and manuring of corn or chiefly about cattle they having large savannahs which were well stored with bulls cows and horses that by the seaside in some places there grew some redwood useful in dying of this they said there was little profit made because they were forced to send it to the lake of nicaragua which runs into the north seas that they sent thither also great quantities of bull and cow hides and brought from thence in exchange europe commodities as hats linen and woollen wherewith they clothed themselves that the flesh of the cattle turned to no other profit than sustenance for their families as for butter and cheese they make but little in those parts after they had given this relation they told us that if we wanted provision there was a beefestantion or farm of bulls or cows about   mile off where we might kill what we pleased this was welcome news for we had no sort of flesh since we left the gallapagos therefore    of us immediately entered into two boats taking one of these spanish indians with us for a pilot and went ashore about a league from the ship there we haled up our boats dry and marched all away following our guide who soon brought us to some houses and a large penn for cattle this penn stood in a large savannah about two mile from our boats there were a great many fat bulls and cows feeding in the savannahs some of us would have killed   or   to carry on board but others opposed it and said it was better to stay all night and in the morning drive the cattle into the penn and then kill  0 or  0 or as many as we pleased i was minded to return aboard and endeavored to persuade them all to go with me but some would not therefore i returned with    which was half and left the other    behind at this place i saw   or   tun of the redwood which i take to be that sort of wood called in jamaica bloodwood or nicaraguawood we who returned abroad met no one to oppose us and the next day we expected our consorts that we left ashore but none came therefore at   a clock in the afternoon  0 men went in our canoa to see what was become of them when they came to the bay where we landed to go to the estantion they found our men all on a small rock half a mile from the shore standing in the water up to their wastes these men had slept ashore in the house and turned out betimes in the morning to pen the cattle   or   went one way and as many another way to get the cattle to the pen and others stood at the pen to drive them in when they were thus scattered about  0 or  0 armed spaniards came in among them our men immediately called to each other and drew together in a body before the spaniards could attack them and marched to their boat which was haled up dry on the sand but when they came to the sandy bay they found their boat all in flames this was a very unpleasing sight for they knew not how to get aboard unless they marched by land to the place where capt cook was buried which was near a league the greatest part of the way was thick woods where the spaniards might easily lay an ambush for them at which they are very expert on the other side the spaniards now thought them secure and therefore came to them and asked them if they would be pleased to walk to their plantations with many other such flouts but our men answered never a word it was about half ebb when one of our men took notice of a rock a good distance from the shore just appearing above water he showed it to his consorts and told them it would be a good castle for them if they could get thither they all wished themselves there for the spaniards who lay as yet at a good distance from them behind the bushes as secure of their prey began to whistle now and then a shot among them having therefore well considered the place together with the danger they were in they proposed to send one of the tallest men to try if the sea between them and the rock were fordable this counsel they presently put in execution and found it according to their desire so they all marched over to the rock where they remained till the canoa came to them which was about   hours it was the latter part of the ebb when they first went over and then the rock was dry but when the tide of flood returned again the rock was covered and the water still flowing so that if our canoa had stayed but one hour longer they might have been in as great danger of their lives from the sea as before from the spaniards for the tide rises here about   foot the spaniards remained on the shore expecting to see them destroyed but never came from behind the bushes where they first planted themselves they having not above   or   handguns the rest of them being armed with lances the spaniards in these parts are very expert in heaving or darting the lance with which upon occasion they will do great feats especially in ambuscades and by their good will they care not for fighting otherwise but content themselves with standing a loof threatening and calling names at which they are as expert as the other so that if their tongues be quiet we always take it for granted they have said some ambush before night our canoa came aboard and brought our men all safe the next day two canoas were sent to the bottom of the bay to seek sor a large canoa which we were informed was there the spaniards have neither ships nor barks here and but a few canoas which they seldom use neither are there any fishermen here as i judge because fish is very scarce for i never saw any here neither could any of our men ever take any and yet wherever we come to an anchor we always send out our strikers and put our hooks and lines overboard to try for fish the next day our men returned out of the bay and brought the canoa with them which they were sent for and   or   days afterward the   canoas were sent out again for another which they likewise brought aboard these canoas were fitted with thoats or benhces straps and oars fit for service and one of these capt eaton had for his share and we the other which we sixth for landing men when occasion required while we lay here we filled our water and cut a great many looms or handles or staves for oars for here is plenty of lancewood which is most proper for that use i never saw any in the south seas but in this place there is plenty of it in jamaica especially at a place called blewfields not blewfields river which is on the main near the west end of that island the lancewood grows strait like our young ashes it is very hard tough and heavy therefore privateers esteem it very much not only to make looms for oars but scouringrods for their guns for they have seldom less than   or   spare rods for fear one should break and they are much better than rods made of ash  the day before we went from hence mr edward davis the companys quartermaster was made captain by consent of all the company for it was his place by succession the  0th day of july we sailed from this bay of caldera with capt eaton and our prize which we brought from gallapagos in company directing our course for ria lexa the wind was at north which although but an ordinary wind yet carried us in three days abrest of our intended port  ria lexa is the most remarkable land on all this coast for there is a high pecked burning mountain called by the spaniards volcanvejo or the old volcan this must be brought to bear n e then steer in directly with the mountain and that course will bring you to the harbor the sea winds are here at s s w therefore ships that come hither must take the seawinds for there is no going in with the landwind the volcan may be easily known because there is not any other so high a mountain near it neither is there any that appears in the like form all along the coast besides it smoaks all the day and in the night it sometimes sends forth flames of fire this mountain may be seen  0 leagues being within   leagues of the harbor the entrance into it may be seen there is a small flat low island which makes the harbor it is about a mile long and a quarter of a mile broad and is from the main about a mile and a half there is a channel at each end of the island the west channel is the widest and safest yet at the n w point of the island there is a shole which ships must take heed of going in being past that shole you must keep close to the island for there is a whole sandy point strikes over from the main almost half way the east channel is not so wide besides there runs a stronger tide therefore ships seldom or never go in that way this harbor is capable of receiving  00 sail of ships the best riding is near the main where there is   or   fathom water clean hard sand  ria lexa town is   leagues from hence and there are   creeks that run toward it the westermost comes near the backside of the town the other runs up to the town but neither ships nor barks can go so far these creeks are very narrow and the land on each side drowned and full of red mangrovetrees about a mile and half below the town on the banks of the east creek the spaniards had cast up a strong breastwork it was likewise reported they had another on the west creek both so advantageously placed that  0 men might with ease keep  00 men from landing i shall give a description of the town in my return hither and therefore forbear to do it here wherefore to resume the thread of our course we were now in sight of the volcan being by estimation   or   leagues from the shore and the mountain bearing n e we took in our topsails and haled up our courses intending to go with our canoas into the harbor in the night in the evening we had a very hard tornado out of the n e with much thunder lightning and rain the violence of the wind did not last long yet it was a    a clock at night before we got out our canoas and then it was quite calm we rowed in directly for the shore and thought to have reached it before day but it was   a clock in the morning before we got into the harbor when we came within a league of the island of ria lexa that makes the harbor we saw a house on it and coming nearer we saw   or   men who stood and looked on us till we came within half a mile of the island then they went into their canoa which lay on the inside of the island and rowed toward the main but we overtook them before they got over and brought them back again to the island there was a horseman right against us on the main when we took the canoa who immediately rode away toward the town as fast as he could the rest of our canoas rowed heavily and did not come to the island till    a clock therefore we were forced to stay for them before they came we examined the prisoners who told us that they were set there to watch for the governor of ria lexa received a letter about a month before wherein he was advised of some enemies come into the sea and therefore admonished to be careful that immediately thereupon the governor had caused a house to be built on this island and ordered   men to be continually there to watch night and day and if they saw any ship coming thither they were to give notice of it they said they did not expect to see boats or canoas but looked out for a ship at first they took us in our advanced canoa to be some men that had been cast away and lost our ship till seeing   or   canoas more they began to suspect what we were they told us likewise that the horseman which we saw did come to them every morning and that in less than an hours time he could be at the town when captain eaton and his canoas came ashore we told them what had happened it was now three hours since the horseman rode away and we could not expect to get to the town in less than two hours in which time the governor having notice of our coming might be provided to receive us at his breastworks therefore we thought it best to defer this design till another time  there is a fine spring of fresh water on the island there are some trees also but the biggest part is savannah whereon is good grass though there is no sort of beast to eat it this island is in lat    d  0 m north here we stayed till   a clock in the afternoon then our ships being come within a league of the shore we all went on board and steered for the gulf of amapalla intending there to careen our ships  the   th of july captain eaton came aboard our ship to consult with captain davis how to get some indians to assist us in careening it was concluded that when we came near the gulf captain davis should take two canoas well manned and go before and captain eaton should stay aboard according to this agreement captain davis went away for the gulf the next day  the gulf of amapalla is a great arm of the sea running   or  0 leagues into the country it is bounded on the south side of its entrance with point casivina and on the n w side with st michaels mount both these place are very remarkable point casivina is in lat    d  0 m north it is a high round point which at sea appears like an island because the land within it is very low st michaels mount is a very high peeked hill not very steep the land at the foot of it on the s e side is low and even for at least a mile from this low land the gulf of amapalla enters on that side between this low land and point casivina there are two considerable high islands the southermost is called mangera the other is called amapalla and they are two miles asunder  mangera is a high round island about   leagues in compass appearing like a tall grove it is environed with rocks all round only a small cove or sandy bay on the n e side the mold and soil of this island is black but not deep it is mixed with stones yet very productive of large tall timber trees in the middle of the island there is an indian town and a fair spanish church the indians have plantations of maiz round the town and some plantains they have a few cocks and hens but no other sort of tame fowl neithe have they any sort of beast but cats and dogs there is a path from the town to the sandy bay but the way is steep and rocky at this sandy bay there are always  0 or    canoas lie haled up dry except when they are in use  amapalla is a larger island than mangera the soil much the same there are two towns on i about two miles asunder one on the northsid the other on the east side that on the eastsid is not above a mile from the sea it stands on  plain on the top of a hill the path to it so stee and rocky that a few men might keep down  great number only with stones there is a ve fair church standing in the midst of the tow the other town is not so big yet it has a good handsome church one thing i have observed in all the indians towns under the spanish government as well in these parts as in the bay of campeachy and elsewhere that the images of the virgin mary and other saints with which all their churches were filled are still painted in an indian complexion and partly in that dress but in those towns which are inhabited chiefly by spaniards the saints also conform themselves to the spanish garb and complexion the houses here are but mean the indians of both plains have good field maiz remote from the town they have but few plantains but they have abundance of large hogplumbtrees growing about their houses the tree that bears this fruit is as big as our largest plumbtree the leaf is of a dark green color and as broad as the leaf of a plumbtree but they are shaped like the hawthorn leaf the trees are very brittle wood the fruit is oval and as big as a small horse plumb it is at first very green but when it is ripe one side is yellow the other red it has a great stone and but little substance about it the fruit is pleasant enough but i do not remember that ever i saw one thoroughly ripe that had not a maggot or two in it i do not remember that i did ever see any of this fruit in the south seas but at this place in the bay of campeachy they are very plentiful and in jamaica they plant them to fence their ground these indians have also some fowls as those at mangera no spaniards dwell among them but only one padre or priest who serves for all three town these two at amapalla and that at mangera they are under the governor of the town of st michaels at the foot of st michaels mount to whom they pay their tribute in maiz being extremely poor yet very contented they have nothing to make money of but their plantations of maiz and their fowls the padre or friar has his tenths of it and knows to a peck how much every man has and how many fowls of which they dare not kill one though they are sick without leave from him there was as i said never another white man on these islands but the friar he could speak the indian language as all friars must that live among them in this vast country of america there are diverse nations of indians different in their language therefore those friars that are minded to live among any nations of indians must learn the language of those people they propose to teach although these here are but poor yet the indians in many other places have great riches which the spaniards draw from them for trifles in such places the friars get plentiful incoms as particularly in the bay of campeachy where the indians have large cacaowalks or in other places where they plant cochoneel trees or silvestertrees or where they gather vinelloes and in such places where they gather gold in such places as these the friars do get a great deal of wealth there was but one of all the indians on both these islands that could speak spanish he could write spanish also being bred up purposely to keep their registers and books of account he was secretary to both islands they had a cosica too a small sort of magistrate the indians have amongst themselves but he could neither write nor speak spanish  there are a great many more islands in this bay but none inhabited as these there is one pretty large island belonging to a nunnery as the indians told us this was stocked with bulls and cows there were   or   indians lived there to look after the cattle for the sake of which we often frequented this island while we lay in the bay they are all low islands except amapalla and mangera there are two channels to come into this gulf one between point casivina and mangera the other between mangera and amapalla the latter is the best the riding place is on the east side of amapalla right against a spot of low ground for all the island except this one place is high land running in farther ships may anchor near the main on the n e side of the island amapalla this is the place most frequented by spaniards it is called the port of martin lopez this gulf or lake runs in some leagues beyond all the islands but it is shole water and not capable of ships  it was into this gulf that capt davis was gone with the two canoas to endeavor for a prisoner to gain intelligence if possible before our ships came in he came the first night to mangera but for want of a pilot did not know where to look for the town in the morning he found a great many canoas haled up on the bay and from that bay found a path which led him and his company to the town the indians saw our ships in the evening coming toward the island and being before informed of enemies in the sea they kept scouts out all night for fear who seeing captain davis coming run into the town and alarmed all the people when captain davis came thither they all run into the woods the friar happened to be there at this time who being unable to ramble into the woods fell into capt daviss hands there were two indian boys with him who were likewise taken captain davis went only to get a prisoner therefore was well satisfied with the friar and immediately came down to the seaside he went from thence to the island amapalla carrying the friar and the two indian boys with him these were his pilots to conduct him to the landing place where they arrived about noon they made no stay here but left   or   men to look after the canoas and captain davis with the rest marched to the town taking the friar with them the town as is before noted is about a mile from the landingplace standing in a plain on the top of a hill having a very steep ascent to go to it all the indians stood on the top of the hill waiting capt daviss coming  the secretary mentioned before had no great kindness for the spaniards it was he that persuaded the indians to wait captain davis his coming for they were all running into the woods but he told them that if any of the spaniards enemies came thither it was not to hurt them but the spaniards whose slaves they were and that their poverty would protect them this man with the casica stood more forward than the rest at the bank of the hill when captain davis with his company appeared beneath they called out therefore in spanish demanding of our men what they were and from whence they came to whom capt davis and his men replied they were biscayers and that they were sent thither by the king of spain to clear those seas from enemies that their ships were coming into the gulf to careen and that they came thither before the ships to seek a convenient place for it as also to desire the indians assistance the secretary who as i said before was the only man that could speak spanish told them that they we welcome for he had a great respect for any o spain men especially for the biscayers of whom  had heard a very honorable report therefore  desired them to come up to their town captai davis and his men immediately ascended the hil the friar going before and they were receiv with a great deal of affection by the indians t casica and secretary embraced captain davis a the other indians received his men with the  ceremony these salutations being ended they  marched toward the church for that is the place  all public meetings and all plays and pastimes are acted there also therefore in the churches belonging to indian towns they have all sorts of vizards and strange antic dresses both for men and women and abundance of musical hautboys and strumstrums the strumstrum is made somewhat like a cittern most of those that the indians use are made of a large goad cut in the midst and a thin board laid over the hollow and which is fastened to the sides this serves for the belly over which the strings are placed the nights before any holidays or the nights ensuing are the times when they all meet to make merry their mirth consists in singing dancing and sporting in those antic habits and using as many antic gestures if the moon shine they use but few torches if not the church is full of light they meet at these times all sorts of both sexes all the indians that i have been acquainted with who are under the spaniards seem to be more melancholy than other indians that are free and at these public meetings when they are in the greatest of their jollity their mirth seems to be rather forced than real their songs are very melancholy and doleful so is their muck but whether it be natural to the indians to be thus melancholy or the effect of their slavery i am not certain but i have always been prone to believe that they are then only condoling their misfortunes the loss of their country and liberties which although these that are now living do not know nor remember what it was to be free yet there seems to be a deep impression in their thoughts of the slavery which the spaniards have brought them under increased probably by some traditions of their ancient freedom  capt davis intended when they were all in the church to shut the doors and then make a bargain with them letting them know what he was and so draw them afterward by fair means to our assistance the friar being with him who had also promised to engage them to it but before they were all in the church one of capt davis his men pusht one of the indians to hasten him into the church the indian immediately ran away and all the rest taking the alarm sprang out of the church like deer it was hard to say which was first and captain davis who knew nothing of what happened was left in the church only with the friar when they were all fled captain davis his men fired and killed the secretary and thus our hopes perished by the indiscretion of one foolish fellow  in the afternoon the ships came into the gulf between point casivina and mangera and anchored near the island amapalla on the east side in ten fathom water clean hard sand in the evening captain davis and his company came aboard and brought the friar with them who told captain davis that if the secretary had not been killed he could have sent him a letter by one of the indians that was taken at mangera and persuaded him to come to us but now the only way was to send one of those indians to seek the casica and that himself would instruct him what to say and did not question but the casica would come in on his word the next day we sent ashore one of the indians who before night returned with the casica and   other indians who remained with us all the time that we staid here these indians did us good service especially in piloting us to an island where we killed beef whenever we wanted and for this their service we satisfied them to their hearts content it was at this island amapalla that a party of english men and french men came afterward and stayed a great while and at last landed on the main and marched over land to the cape river which disembogues into the north seas near cape gratia dios and is therefore called the cape river near the head of this river they made barklogs which i shall describe in the next chapter and so went into the north seas this was the way that captain sharp had proposed to go if he had been put to it for this way was partly known to privateers by the discovery that was made into the country about  0 years since by a party of english men that went up that river in canoas about as far as the place where these french men made their barklogs there they landed and marched to a town called segovia in the country they were near a month getting up the river for there were many cataracts where they were often forced to leave the river and hale their canoas a shore over the land till they were past the cataracts and then launched their canoas again into the river i have discoursed several men that were in that expedition and if i mistake not captain sharp was one of them but to return to our voyage in hand when both our ships were clean and our water filled captain davis and captain eaton broke off consortships captain eaton took aboard of his ships  00 packs of flower and sailed out of the gulf the second day of september  chap vi they depart

great advantage slipped that might have been made of a company of negroes taken in guiaquil river they go to plata again isle plata  the third day of september      we sent the friar ashore and left the indians in possession of the prize which we brought in hither though she was still half laden with flower and we sailed out with the land wind passing between amapalla and mangera when we were a league out we saw a canoa coming with sail and oars after us therefore we shortened sail and staid for her she was a canoa sent by the governor of st michaels town to our captain desiring him not to carry away the friar the messenger being told that the friar was set ashore again at amapalla he returned with joy and we made sail again having the wind at w n w we steered toward the coast of peru we had tornadoes every day till we made cape st francisco which from june to november are very common on these coasts and we had with the tornadoes weary much thunder lightning and rain when the tornadoes were over the winds which while they lasted was most from the south east came about again to the west and never failed us till we were in sight of cape st francisco where we found the wind at south with fair weather this cape is in lat 0   d 00 north it is a high bluff or full point of land clothed with tall great trees passing by this point coming from the north you will see a small low point which you might suppose to be the cape but you are then past it and presently afterward it appears with three points the land in the country within this cape is very high and the mountains commonly appear very black when we came in with this cape we overtook captain eaton plying under the shore he in his passage from amapalla while he was on that coast met with such terrible tornadoes of thunder and lightning that as he and all his men related they had never met with the like in any place they were very much affrightned by them the air smelling very much of sulphur and they apprehending themselves in great danger of being burnt by the lightning he touched at the island cocos and put ashore  00 packs of flower there and loaded his boat with coconuts and took in fresh water in the evening we separated again from captain eaton for he stood off to sea and we plied up under the shore making our best advantage both of sea and land winds the sea winds are here at south the land winds at s s e but some times when we came abrest of a river we should have the wind at s e  the  0th day of september we came to the island plata and anchored in    fathom we had very good weather from the time that we fell in with cape st francisco and were now fallen in again with the same places from whence i begin the account of this voyage in the first capter having now compassed in the whole continent of the south america  the island plata as some report was so named by the spaniards after sir francis drake took the cacafoga a ship chiefly laden with plate which they say he brought hither and divided it here with his men it is about   mile long and a mile and half broad and of a good height it is bounded with high steep cliffs clear round only at one place on the east side the top of it is flat and even the soil sandy and dry the trees it produces are but small bodied low and grow thin and there are only   or   sorts of trees all unknown to us i observed they were much overgrown with long moss there is good grass especially in the beginning of the year there is no water on this island but at one place on the east side close by the sea there it drills slowly down from the rocks where it may be received into vessels there was plenty of goats but they are now all destroyed there is no other sort of land animal that i did ever see here are plenty of boobies and men of war birds the anching place is on the east side near the middle of the island close by the shore within two cables lengths of the sandy bay there is about    or  0 fathom good fast oazy ground and smooth water for the s e point of the island shelters from the south winds which constantly blow here from the s e point there strikes out a small shole a quarter of a mile into the sea where there is commonly a great riplin or working of short waves during all the flood the tide runs pretty strong the flood to the south and the ebb to the north there is good landing on the sandy bay against the anchoring place from whence you may go up into the island and at no place besides there are   or   high steep small rocks at the s e point not a cables length from the island and another much bigger at the n e end it is deep water all round but at the anchoring place and at the shole at the s e point this island lies in lat 0   d  0 m south it is distant from cape st lorenzo   or   leagues bearing from it w s w and half a point westerly at this island are plenty of those small sea turtle spoken of in my last chapter  the   st day captain eaton came to an anchor by us he was very willing to have consorted with us again but captain daviss men were so unreasonable that they would not allow captain eatons men an equal share with them in what they got therefore captain eaton staid here but one night and the next day sailed from hence steering away to the southward we staid no longer then the day ensuing and then we sailed toward point st hellena intending there to land some men purposely to get prisoners for intelligence  point santa hellena bears south from the island plata it lies in lat   d    m south the point is pretty high flat and even at top overgrown with many great thistles but no sort of tree at a distance it appears like an island because the land within it is very low  this point strikes out west into the sea making a pretty large bay on the north side a mile within the point on the sandy bay close by the sea there is a poor small indian village called sancta hellena the land about it is low sandy and barren there are no trees nor grass growing near it neither do the indians produce any fruit grain or plant but watermelons only which are large and very sweet there is no fresh water at this place nor near it therefore the inhabitants are obliged to fetch all their water from the river colanche which is in the bottom of the bay about   leagues from it not far from this town on the bay close by the sea about   paces from high water mark there is a sort of bitumenous matter boils out of a little hole in the earth it is like thin tar the spaniards call it algatrane by much boiling it becomes hard like pitch it is frequently used by the spaniards instead of pitch and the indians that inhabit here save it in jars it boils up most at high water and then the indians are ready to receive it these indians are fishermen and go out to sea on barklogs their chief subsistence is maiz most of which they get from ships that come hither from algatrane there is good anchoring to leeward of the point right a against the village but on the west side of the point it is deep water and no anchoring the spaniards do report that there was once a very rich ship driven ashore here in calm for want of wind to work her as soon as ever she struck she heeld of to sea   or   fathom water where she lies to this day none having attempted to fish for her because she lies deep and there falls in here a great high sea when we were abrest of this point we sent away our canoas in the night to take the indian village they landed in the morning betimes close by the town and took some prisoners they took likewise a small bark which the indians had set on fire but our men quenched it and took the indian that did it who being asked wherefore he set the bark on fire said that there was an order from the viceroy lately set out commanding all seamen to burn their vessels if atttackd by us and betake themselves to their boats there was another bark in a small cove a mile from the village thither our men went thinking to take her but the seamen that were aboard set her in flames and fled in the evening our men came aboard and brought the small bark with them the fire of which they had quenched and then we returned again toward plata where we arrived the   th day of september  in the evening we sent out some men in our bark lately taken and canoas to an indian village called manta   or   leagues to the westward of cape st lorenzo hoping there to get other prisoners for we could not learn from those we took at point st hellena the reason why the viceroy should give such orders to burn the ships they had a fresh seabreez till    a clock at night and then it proved calm wherefore they rowed away with their canoas as near to the town as they thought convenient and lay still till day  manta is a small indian village on the main distant from the island plata   or   leagues it stands so advantageously to be seen being built on a small ascent that it makes a very fair prospect to the sea yet but a few poor scattering indian houses there is a very fine church adorned with a great deal of carved work it was formerly a habitation of spaniards but they are all removed from hence now the land about it is dry and sandy bearing only a few shrubby trees these indians plant no manner of grain or root but are supplied from other places and commonly keep a stock of provision to relieve ships that want for this is the first settlement that ships can touch at which come from panama bound to lima or any other port in pern the land being dry and sandy is not fit to produce crops of maiz which is the reason they plant none there is a spring of good water between the village and the seas  on the back of the town a pretty way up in the country there is a very high mountain towering up like a sugar loaf called montechristo it is a very good seamark for there is none like it on all the coast the body of this mountain bears due south from manta about a mile and half from the shore right against the village there is a rock which is very dangerous because it never appears above water neither does the sea break on it because here is seldom any great sea yet it is now so well known that all ships bound to this place do easily avoid it a mile within this rock there is good anchoring in     or  0 fathom water good hard sand and clear ground and a mile from the road on the west side there is a shoal running out a mile into the sea from manta to cape st lorenzo the land is plain and even of an indifferent height see a further account of these coasts in the appendix  as soon as ever the day appeared our men landed and marched toward the village which was about a mile and a half from their land place some of the indians who were stirring saw them coming and alarmed their neighbors so that all that were able got away they took only two old women who both said that it was reported that a great many enemies were come over land through the country of darien into the south seas and that they were at present in canoas and periagoes and that the viceroy upon this news had set out the forementioned order for burning their own ships our men found no sort of provision here the viceroy having likewise sent orders to all seaports to keep no provision but just to supply themselves these women also said that the manta indians were sent over to the island plata to destroy all the goats there which they performed about a month agone with this news our men returned again and arrived at plata the next day  we lay still at the island plata being not resolved what to do till the  d day of october and then capt swan in the cygnet of london arrived there he was fitted out by very eminent merchants of that city on a design only to trade with the spaniards or indians having a very considerable cargo well sorted for these parts of the world but meeting with diverse disappointments and being out of hopes to obtain a trade in these seas his men forced him to entertain a company of privateers which he met with near nicoya a town whither he was going to seek a trade and these privateers were bound thither in boats to get a ship these were the men that we had heard of at manta they came over land under the command of capt peter harris nephew to that capt harris who was killed before panama capt swan was still commander of his own ship and capt harris commanded a small bark under capt swan there was much joy on all sides when they arrived and immediately hereupon capt davis and capt swan consorted wishing for capt eaton again our little bark which was taken at santa hellena was immediately sent out to cruize while the ships were fitting for capt swans ship being full of goods was not fit to entertain his new guest till the goods were disposed of therefore he by the consent of the supercargos got up all his goods on deck and sold to any one that would buy upon trust the rest was thrown over board into the sea except fine goods as silks muslins stockins etc and  the iron whereof he had a good quantity  wrought and in bars this was saved for ballast  the third day after our bark was sent to cruize she brought in a prize of  00 tuns laden with timber they took her in the bay of guiaquil she came from a town of that name and was bound to lima the commander of this prize said that it was generally reported and believed at guiaquil that the viceroy was fitting out  0 sail of frigots to drive us out of the seas this news made our unsettled crew wish that they had been persuaded to accept of captain eatons company on reasonable terms capt davis and capt swan had some discourse concerning capt eaton they at last concluded to send our small bark toward the coast of lima as far as the island lobos to seek capt eaton this being approved by all hands she was cleaned the next day and sent away manned with  0 men  0 of capt daviss and  0 of swans men and capt swan writ a letter directed to capt eaton desiring his company and the isle of plata was appointed for the general rendezvous when this bark was gone we turned another bark which we had into a fireship having   or   carpenters who soon fixed her and while the carpenters were at work about the fireship we scrubbed and cleaned our men of war as well as time and place would permit  the   th day of oct we finished our business and the  0th day we sailed toward the island lobos where our bark was ordered to stay for us or meet us again at plata we had but litte wind therefore it was the   d day before we passed by point st hellena the   th day we crossed over the bay of guiaquil the  0th day we doubled cape blanco this cape is in lat   d    m it is counted the worst cape in all the south seas to double passing to the southward for in all other places ships may stand off to sea  0 or  0 leagues off if they find they cannot get any thing under the shore but here they dare not do it for by relation of the spaniards they find a current setting n w which will carry a ship off more in two hours than they can run in again in five besides setting to the northward they lose ground therefore they always beat up in under the shore which ofttimes they find very difficult because the wind commonly blows very strong at s s w or s by w without altering for here are never any landwinds this cape is of an indifferent height it is fenced with white rocks to the sea for which reason i believe it has this name the land in the country seems to be full of high steep rugged and barren rocks  the  d day of november we got as high as payta we lay about six leagues off shore all the day that the spaniards might not see us and in the evening sent our canoas ashore to take it manned with   0 men  payta is a small spanish seaport town in the lat of   d    m it is built on the sand close by the sea in a nook elbow or small bay under a pretty high hill there are not above    or  0 houses and two churches the houses are but low and ill built the building in this country of peru is much alike on all the seacoast the walls are built of brick made with earth and straw kneaded together they are about three foot long two foot broad and a foot and a half thick they never burn them but lay them a long time in the sun to dry before they are used in building in some places they have no roofs only poles laid across from the side walls and covered with matts and then those walls are carried up to a considerable height but where they build roofs upon their houses the walls are not made so high as i said before the houses in general all over this kingdom are but meanly built one chief reason with the common people especially is the want of materials to build withal for however it be more within land yet here is neither stone nor timber to build with nor any materials but such brick as i have described and ever the stone which they have in some places is so brittle that you may rub it into sand with your fingers another reason why they build so meanly is because it never rains therefore they only endeavor to fence themselves from the sun yet their walls which are built but with an ordinary sort of brick in comparison with what is made in other parts of the world continue a long time as firm as when first made having never any winds nor rains to rot moulder or shake them however the richer sort have timber which they make use of in building but it is brought from other places  this dry country commences to the northward from about cape blanco to coquimbo in about  0 d s having no rain that i could ever observe or hear of nor any green thing growing in the mountains neither yet in the valleys except where here and there watered with a few small rivers dispersed up and down so that the northermost parts of this tract of land are supplied with timber from guiaquil galleo tornato and other places that are watered with rains where there are plenty of all sorts of timber in the south parts as about guasco and coquimbo they fetch their timber from the island chiloe or other places thereabouts the walls of churches and rich mens houses are whitened with lime both within and without and the doors and posts are very large and adorned with carved work and the beams also in the churches the inside of the houses are hung round with rich embroidered or painted cloths they have likewise abundance of fine pictures which adds no small ornament to their house these i suppose they have from old spain but the houses of payta are none of them so richly furnished the churches were large and fairly carved at one end of the town there was a small fort close by the sea but no great guns in it this fort only with muskets will command all the bay so as to hinder any boats from landing there is another fort on the top of the hill just over the town which commands both it and the lower fort there is neither wood nor water to be had there they fetch their water from an indian town called colan about   leagues n n e from payta for at colan there is a small river of fresh water which runs out into the sea from whence ships that touch at payta are supplied with water and other refreshments as fowls hogs plantains yams and maiz payta being destitute of all these things only as they fetch them from colon as they have occasion  the indians of colan are all fishermen they go out to sea and fish for barklogs barklogs are made of many round logs of wood in manner of a raft and very different according to the use that they are designed for or the humor of the people that make them or the matter that they are made of if they are made for fishing then they are only   or   logs of light wood of   or   foot long placed by the side of each other pinned fast together with wooden pins and bound hard with withes the logs are so placed that the middlemost are longer than those by the sides especially at the head or forepart which grows narrower gradually into an angle or point the better to cut through the water others are made to carry goods the bottom of these is made of  0 or  0 great trees of about  0  0 or  0 foot long fastened like the other side to side and so shaped on the top of these they place another shorter row of trees across them pinned fast to each other and then pinned to the undermost row this double row of planks makes the bottom of the float and of a considerable breadth from this bottom the raft is raised to about  0 foo higher with rows of posts sometimes set upright and supporting a floor or two but those i observed were raised by thick trees laid across each other as in woodpiles only not close together as in the bottom of the float but at the ends and sides only so as to leave the middle all hollow like a chamber except that here and there a beam goes across it to keep the float more compact in this hollow at about   foot height from the beams at the bottom they lay small poles along and close together to make a floor for another room on the top of which also they lay another such floor made of poles and the enterances in both these rooms is only by creeping between the great traverse trees which make the walls of this seahouse the lowest of these stories serves as a cellar there they lay great stones for ballast and their jars of fresh water closed up and whatever may bear being wet for by the weight of the ballast and cargo the bottom of this room and of the whole vessel is sunk so deep as to lie   or   feet within the surface of the water the second story is for the seamen and their necessaries above this second story the goods are stowed to what height they please usually about   or  0 feet and kept together by poles set upright quite round only there is a little space abaft for the steersman for they have a large rudder and before for the firehearth to dress their victuals especially when they make long voyages as from lima to truxillo or guiaquil or panama which last voyage is   or  00 leagues in the midst of all among the goods rises a mast to which is fastened a large sail as in our westcountry barges in the thames they always go before the wind being unable to ply against it and therefore are fit only for these seas where the wind is always in a manner the same not varying above a point or two all the way from lima till such time as they come into the bay of panama and even there they meet with no great sea but sometimes northerly winds and then they lower their sails and drive before it waiting a change all their care then is only to keep off from shore for they are so made that they cannot sink at sea these rafts carry  0 or  0 tuns of goods and upwards their cargo is chiefly wine oil flower sugar quito cloth soap goat skins dressed etc the float is managed usually by   or   men who being unable to return with it against the tradewind when they come to panama dispose of the goods and bottom together getting a passage back again for themselves in some ship or boat bound to the port they came from and there they make a new barklog for their next cargo  the smaller sort of barklogs described before which lie flat on the water and are used for fishing or carrying water to ships or the like half a tun or a tun at a time are more governable than the other though they have masts and sails too with these they go out at night by the help of the landwind which is seldom wanting on this coast and return back in the day time with the seawind  this sort of floats are used in many places both in the east and west indies on the coast of coromandel in the east indies they call them catamarans these are but one log or two sometimes of a sort of light wood and are made without sail or rudder and so small that they carry but one man whose legs and breech are always in the water and he manages his log with a paddle appearing at a distance like a man sitting on a fishs back  the country about payta is mountainous and barren like all the rest of the kingdom of peru there is no towns of consequence nearer it than piura which is a large town in the country  0 miles distant it lies by report of our spanish prisoners in a valley which is watered with a small river that disembogues it self into the bay of chirapee in about   d of north latitude this bay is nearer to piura than payta yet all goods imported by sea for piura are landed at payta for the bay of chirapee is full of dangerous sholes and therefore not frequented by shipping the road of payta is one of the best on the coast of peru it is sheltered from the southwest by a point of land which makes a large bay and smooth water for ships to ride in there is room enough for a good fleet of ships and good anchoring in any depth from   fathom water to  0 fathom right against the town the nearer the town the shallower the water and the smoother the riding it is clean sand all over the bay most ships passing either to the north or the south touch at this place for water for though here is none at the town yet those indian fishermen of colan will and do supply all ships very reasonably and good water is much prized on all this coast through the scarcity of it  november the  d at   a clock in the morning our men landed about   miles to the south of the town and took some prisoners that were sent thiher to watch for fear of us and these prisoners said that the governor of piura came with  00 rmed men to payta the night before purposely to ppose our landing there if we should attempt it  our men marched directly to the fort on the ill and took it without the loss of one man hereupon the governor of piura with all his men and he inhabitants of the town ran away as fast as hey could then our men entered the town and ound it emptied both of money and goods there was not so much as a meal of victuals left for them the prisoners told us a ship had been here a little before and burnt a great ship in the road but did not land their men and that here they put ashore all their prisoners and pilots we knew this must be captain eatons ship which had done this and by these circumstances we supposed he was gone to the east indies it being always designed by him the prisoners told us also that since capt eaton was here a small bark had been off the harbor and taken a pair of barklogs a fishing and made the fishermen bring aboard  0 or  0 jars of fresh water this we supposed was our bark that was sent to the lobos to seek capt eaton  in the evening we came in with our ships and anchored before the town in  0 fathom water near a mile from the shore here we staid till the sixth day in hopes to get a ransom for the town our captains demanded  00 packs of flower  000 pound of sugar    jars of wine and  000 jars of water to be brought off to us but we got nothing of it therefore captain swan ordered the town to be fired which was presently done then all our men came aboard and captain swan ordered the bark which captain harris commanded to be burnt because she did not sail well  at night when the landwind came off we sailed from hence toward lobos the  0th day in the evening we saw a sail bearing n w by n as far as we could well discern her on our deck we immediately chased separating our selves the better to meet her in the night but we mist her therefore the next morning we again trimmed sharp and made the best of our way to the lobos de la mar  the   th day we had sight of the island lobos de terra it bore east from us we stood in toward it and betwixt   and   a clock in the night came to an anchor at the n e end of the island in   fathom water this island at sea is of an indifferent height and appears like lobos de la mar about a quarter of a mile from the northend there is a great hollow rock and a good channel between where there is   fathom water the   th day we went ashore and found abundance of penguins and boobies and seal in great quantities we sent aboard of all these to be dressed for we had not tasted any flesh in a great while before therefore some of us did eat very heartily capt swan to encourage his men to eat this course flesh would commend it for extraordinary good food comparing the seal to a roasting pig the boobies to hens and the penguins to ducks this he did to train them to live contentedly on course meat not knowing but we might be forced to make use of such food before we departed out of these seas for it is generally seen among privateers that nothing emboldens them sooner to mutiny than want which we could not well suffer in a place where there are such quantities of these animals to be had if men could be persuaded to be content with them  in the afternoon we sailed from lobos de terra with the wind at s by e and arrived at lobos de la mar on the   th day here we found a letter left by our bark that was sent to seek capt eaton by which we understood that captain eaton had been there but was gone before they arrived and had left no letter to advise us which way he was gone and that our bark was again returned to plata in hopes to find us there or meet us by the way else resolving to stay for us there we were sorry to hear that capt eaton was gone for now we did not expect to meet with him any more in these seas  the   st day we sent out our moskito strikers for turtle who brought aboard enough to serve both ships companies and this they did all the time that we abode here while we lay at this island capt swan made new yards squarer than those he had before and made his sails larger and our ships company in the mean time split plank for firewood and put aboard as many planks as we could conveniently stow for other uses here being plank enough of all sorts which we had brought hither in the first prize that we took and left here  the   th day in the evening we saw a small bark about   leagues n n w from the island but we supposing her to be our own bark did not go after her the next morning she was two leagues south of the island standing off to sea but we did not now chase her neither although we knew she was not our bark for being to windward of us she could have made her escape if we had chaced her this bark as we were afterward informed was sent out purposely to see if we were at this island her orders were not to come too near only to appear in ight they supposing that if we were here we should soon be after her as indeed it was a wonder we had not chaced her but our not doing so and lying close under the island undiscerned by them was a great occasion of our coming upon puna afterward unexectedly they being now without fear of any enemy so near them  the   th day we scrubbed our ships bottom intending to sail the next day toward guiaquil it being concluded upon to attempt that town before we returned again to plata accordingly on the   th day in the morning we loosed from hence steering directly for the bay of guiaquil this bay runs in between cape blanco on the south side and point chandy on the north about    leagues from c blanco near the bottom of the bay there is a small island called santa clara which lies east and west it is of an indifferent length and it appears like a dead man stretched out in a shroud the east end represents the head and the west end the feet ships that are bound into the river of guiaquil pass on the south side to avoid the sholes which lie on the northside of it whereon for  ships have heen lost it is reported by the spaniards that there is a very rich wreck lies on the northside of that island not far from it and that some of the plate has been taken up by one who came from old spain with a patent from the king to fish in those seas for wrecks but he dying the project ceased and the wreck still remains as he left it only the indians by stealth do sometimes take up some of it and they might have taken up much more if it were not for the catfish which swarms hereabouts  the catfish is much like a whiting but the head is flatter and bigger it has a great wide mouth and certain small strings pointing out from each side of it like cats whiskers and for that reason it is called a catfish it has three fins one growing on the top of his back and one on either side each of these fins have a stiff sharp bone which is very venomous if it strikes into a mans flesh therefore it it is dangerous diving where many of these fish are the indians that adventured to search this wreck have to their sorrow experienced it some having lost their lives others the use of their limbs by it this we were informed by an indian who himself had been fishing on it by stealth i my self have known some white men that have lost the use of their hands only by a small prick with the fin of these fish therefore when we catch them with a hook we tread on them to take the hook out of their mouths for otherwise in flurting about as all fish will when first taken they might accidentally strike their sharp fins into the hands of those that caught them some of these fish are   or   pound weight some again in some particular places are none of them bigger than a mans thumb but their fins are all alike venomous they use to be at the mouths of rivers or where there is much mud and oaze and they are found all over the american coast both in the north and south sea at least in the hot countries as also in the east indies where sailing with captain minchin among certain islands near the streights of malacca he pointed to an island at which he told me he lost the use of his hand by one of these only in going to take the hook out of its mouth the wound was scarce visible yet his hand was much swollen and the pain lasted about   weeks during most part of which the raging heat of it was almost ready to distract him however though the bony fins of these fish are so venomous yet the bones in their bodies are not so at least we never perceived any such effect in eating the fish and their flesh is very sweet delicious and wholesome meat  from the island santa clara to punta arena is   leagues e n e this punta arena or sandy point is the westermost point of the island puna here all ships bound into the river of guiaquil anchor and must wait for a pilot the entrance being very dangerous for strangers  the island puna is a pretty large flat low island stretching east and west about    or    leagues long and about   or   leagues wide the tide runs very strong all about this island but so many different ways by reason of the branches creeks and rivers that run into the sea near it that it casts up many dangerous sholes on all sides of it there is in the island only one indian town on the southside of it close by the sea and   leagues from point arena which town is also called puna the indians of this town are all seamen and are the only pilots in these seas especially for this river their chiefest employment when they are not at sea is fishing these men are obliged by the spaniards to keep good watch for ships that anchor at point arena which as i said before is   leagues from the town puna the place where they keep this watch is at a point of land on the island puna that starts out into the sea from whence they can see all ships that anchor at point arena the indians come thither in the morning and return at night on horseback from this watching point to point arena it is   leagues all drowned mangroveland and in the midway between these two points is another small point where these indians are obliged to keep another watch when they fear an enemy the sentinel goes thither in a canoa in the morning and returns at night for there is no coming thither by land through that mangrove marshy ground the middle of the island puna is savannah or pasture there are some ridges of good woodland which is of a light yellow or sandy mould producing large tall trees most unknown even to travelers but there are plenty of palmetotrees which because i am acquainted with i shall descibe the palmetotree is about the bigness of an ordinary ash it is about  0 foot high the body straight without any limb or branch or leaf except at the head only where it spreads forth into many small branches not half so big as a mans arm some no bigger than ones finger these branches are about   or   foot long clear from any knot at the end of the branch there grows one broad leaf about the bigness of a large fan this when it first shoots forth grows in folds like a fan when it is closed and still as it grows bigger so it opens till it becomes like a fan spread abroad it is strengthened toward the stalk with many small ribs springing from thence and growing into the leaf which as they grow near the end of the leaf grow thinner and smaller the leaves that make the brush part of the flagbrooms which are brought into england grow just in this manner and are indeed a small kind of palmeto for there are of them of several dimensions in bermudas and elsewhere they make hats baskets brooms fans to blow the fire instead of bellows with many other houseimplements of palmetoleaves on the ridges where these trees grow the indians have here and there plantations of maiz yams and potatoes  there are in the town of puna about  0 houses and a small church the houses stand all on posts  0 or    foot high with ladders on the outside to go up into them i did never see the like building any where but among the malayans in the east indies they are thatched with palmetoleaves and their chambers well boarded in which last they exceed the malayans the best place for ships to lie at an anchor is against the middle of the town there is   fathom water within a cables length of the shore and good soft deep oaze where ships may careen or hale ashore it stows    or    foot water up and down  from puna to guiaquil is reckoned   leagues it is   league before you come to the river of guiaquils mouth where it is above two mile wide from thence upwards the river lies pretty straight without any considerable turnings both sides of the river are low swampy land overgrown with red mangroves so that there is no landing four mile before you come to the town of guiaquil there is a low island standing in the river this island divides the river into two parts making   very fair channels for ships to pass up and down the s w channel is the widest the other is as deep but narrower and narower yet by reason of many trees and bushes which spread over the river both from the main and from the island and there are also several great stumps of trees standing upright in the water on either side the island is above a mile long from the upper part of the island to the town of guiaquil is almost a league and near as much from one side of the river to the other in that spacious place ships of the greatest burden may ride afloat but the best place for ships is nearest to that part of the land where the town stands and this place is seldom without ships guiaquil stands facing the island close by the river partly on the side and partly at the foot of a gentle hill declining toward the river by which the lower part of it is often overflown there are two forts one standing on the low ground the other on the hill this town makes a very fine prospect it being beautified with several churches and other good buildings here lives a governor who as i have been informed has his patent from the king of spain guiaquil may be reckoned one of the chiefest seaports in the south seas the commodities which are exported from hence are cacao hides tallow sarsaparilla and other drugs and woollencloth commonly called cloth of quito  the cacao grows on both sides of the river above the town it is a small nut like the campeachy nut i think the smallest of the two they produce as much cacoa here as serves all the kingdom of peru and much of it is sent to acapulco and from thence to the phillipine islands  sarsaparilla grows in the water by the sides of the river as i have been informed  the quito cloth comes from a rich town in the country within land called quito there is a great deal made both serges and broadcloth this cloth is not very fine but is worn by the common sort of people throughout the whole kingdom of peru this and all other commodities which come from quito are shipped off at guiaquil for other parts and all imported goods for the city of quito pass by guiaquil by which it may appear that guiaquil is a place of no mean trade  quito as i have been informed is a very populous city seated in the heart of the country it is inhabited partly by spaniards but the major part of its inhabitants are indians under the spanish government  it is environed with mountains of a vast height from whose bowels many great rivers have their rise these mountains abound in gold which by violent rains is washed with the sand into the adjacent brooks where the indians resort in troops washing away the sand and putting up the golddust in their calabashes or gourd shells but for the manner of the gathering the gold i refer you too mr wafers book only i shall remark here that quito is the place in all the kingdom of peru that abounds most with this rich metal as i have been often informed  the country is subject to great rains and very thick fogs especially the valleys for that reason it is very unwholesome and sickly the chiefest distempers are fevers violent headache pains in the bowels and fluxes i know no place where gold is found but what is very unhealthy as i shall more particularly relate when i come to speak of acbin in the isle of sumatra in the east indies guiaquil is not so sickly as quito and other towns farther within land yet in comparison with the towns that are on the coast of mare pacifico south of cape blanco it is very sickly  it was to this town of guiaquil that we were bound therefore we left our ships off cape blanco and ran into the bay of guiaquil with our bark and canoas steering in for the island santa clara where we arrived the next day after we left our ships and from thence we sent away two canoas the next evening to point arena at this point there are abundance of oysters and other shellfish as cockles and muscles therefore the indians of puna often come hither to get these fish our canoas got over before day and absconded in a creek to wait for the coming of the puna indians the next morning some of them according to their custom came thither on barklogs at the latter part of the ebb and were all taken by our men the next day by their advice the two watchmen of the indian town puna were taken by our men and all its inhabitants not one escaping the next ebb they took a small bark laden with quitocloth she came from guiaquil that tide and was bound to lima they having advice that we were gone off the coast by the bark which i said we saw while we lay at the island lobos the master of this clothbark informed our men that there were   barks coming from guiaquil laden with negroes he said they would come from thence the next tide the same tide of ebb that they took the clothbark they sent a canoa to our bark where the biggest part of the men were to hasten them away with speed to the indian town the bark was now riding at point arena and the next flood she came with all the men and the rest of the canoas to puna the tide of flood being now far spent we lay at this town till the last of the ebb and then rowed away leaving   men aboard our bark who were ordered to lie still till   a clock the next morning and not to fire at any boat or bark but after that time they might fire at any object for it was supposed that before that time we should be masters of guiaquil we had not rowed above   mile before we met and took one of the three barks laden with negroes the master of her said that the other two would come from guiaquil the next tide of ebb we cut her mainmast down and left her at an anchor it was now strong flood and therefore we rowed with all speed toward the town in hopes to get thither before the flood was down but we found it farther than we did expect it to be or else our canoas being very full of men did not row so fast as we would have them the day broke when we were two leagues from the town and then we had not above an hours flood more therefore our captains desired the indian pilot to direct us to some creek where we might abscond all day which was immediately done and one canoa was sent toward puna to our bark to order them not to move nor fire till the next day but she came too late to countermand the first orders for the two barks before mentioned laden with negroes came from the town the last quarter of the evening tide and lay in the river close by the shore on one side and we rowed upon the other side and mist them neither did they see nor hear us as soon as the flood was spent the two barks weighed and went down with the ebb toward puna our bark seeing them coming directly toward them and both full of men supposed that we by some accident had been destroyed and that the two barks were manned with spanish soldiers and sent to take our ships and therefore they fired   guns at them a league before they came near the two spanish barks immediately came to an anchor and the masters got into their boats and rowed for the shore but our canoa that was sent from us took them both the firing of these   guns made a great disorder among our advanced men for most of them did believe they were heard at guiaquil and that therefore it could be no profit to lie still in the creek but either row away to the town or back again to our ships it was now quarter ebb therefore we could not move upwards if we had been disposed so to do at length captain davis said he would immediately land in the creek where they lay and march directly to the town if but  0 men would accompany him and without saying more words he landed among the mangroves in the marshes those that were so minded followed him to the number of  0 or  0 captain swan lay still with the rest of the party in the creek for they thought it impossible to do any good that way captain davis and his men were absent about   hours and then returned all wet and quite tired and could not find any passage out into the firm land he had been so far that he almost despaired of getting back again for a man cannot pass through those red mangroves but with very much labor when capt davis was returned we concluded to be going toward the town the beginning of the next flood and if we found that the town was alarmed we purposed to return again without attempting any thing there as soon as it was flood we rowed away and passed by the island through the n e channel which is the narrowest there are so many stumps in the river that it is very dangerous passing in the night and that is the time we always take for such attempts for the river runs very swift and one of our canoas stuck on a stump and had certainly overset if she had not been immediately rescued by others when we were come almost to the end of the island there was a musket fired at us out of the bushes on the main we then had the town open before us and presently saw lighted torches or candles all the town over whereas before the gun was fired there was but one light therefore we now concluded we were discovered yet many of our men said that it was a holy day the next day as it was indeed and that therefore the spaniards were making fireworks which they often do in the night against such times we rowed therefore a little farther and found firm land and captain davis pitched his canoa ashore and landed with his men captain swan and most of his men did not think it convenient to attempt any thing seeing the town was alarmed but at last being upbraided with cowardice captain swan and his men landed also the place where we landed was about   mile from the town it was all overgrown with woods so thick that we could not march through in the night and therefore we sat down waiting for the light of the day we had two indian pilots with us one that had been with us a month who having received some abuses from a gentleman of guiaquil to be revenged offered his service to us and we found him very faithful the other was taken by us not above   or   days before and he seemed to be as willing as the other to assist us this latter was led by one of captain daviss men who showed himself very forward to go to the town and upbraided others with faintheartedness yet this man as he afterward confessed notwithstanding his courage privately cut the string that the guide was made fast with and let him go to the town by himself not caring to follow him but when he thought the guide was got far enough from us he cried out that the pilot was gone and that some body had cut the cord that tied him this put every man in a moving posture to seek the indian but all in vain and our consternation was great being in the dark and among woods so the design was wholly dashed for not a man after that had the heart to speak of going farther here we staid till day and then rowed out into the middle of the river where we had a fair view of the town which as i said before makes a very pleasant prospect we lay still about half an hour being a mile or something better from the town they did not fire one gun at us nor we at them thus our design on guiaquil failed yet captain townely and capt francois gronet took it a little while after this when we had taken a full view of the town we rowed over the river where we went ashore to a beef estantion or farm and killed a cow which we dressed and eat we staid there till the evening tide of ebb and then rowed down the river and the  th day in the morning arrived at pima in our way thither we went aboard the   barks laden with negroes that lay at their anchor in the river and carried the barks away with us there were  000 negroes in   barks all lusty young men and women when we came to puna we sent a canoa to point arena to see if the ships were come thither the   th day she returned again with tidings that they were both there at anchor therefore in the afternoon we all went aboard of our ships and carried the clothbark with us and about  0 of the stoutest negromen leaving their   barks with the rest and out of these also capt davis and capt swan chose about    or    apiece and turned the rest ashore  there was never a greater opportunity put into the hands of men to enrich themselves than we had to have gone with these negroes and settled our selves at santa maria on the isthmus of darien and employed them in getting gold out of the mines there which might have been done with ease for about   months before this capt harris who was now with us coming over land from the north seas with his body of privateers had routed the spaniards away from the town and goldmines of santa maria so that they had never attempted to settle there again since add to this that the indian neighborhood who were mortal enemies to the spaniards and had been flusht by their successes against them through the assistance of the privateers for several years were our fast friends and ready to receive and assist us we had as i have said  000 negroes to work for us we had  00 tun of flower that lay at the gallapagos there was the river of santa maria where we could careen and fit our ships and might fortify the mouth so that if all the strength the spaniards have in p had come against us we could have kept them out if they lay with guardships of strength to keep us in yet we had a great country to live in and a great nation of indians that were our friends beside which was the principal thing we had the north seas to befriend us from whence we could export our selves or effects or import goods or men to our assistance for in a short time we should have had assistance from all parts of the west indies many thousands of privateers from jamaica and the french islands especially would have flockt over to us and long before this time we might have been masters not only of those mines the richest goldmines ever yet found in america but of all the coast as high as quito and much more than i say might then probably have been done  but these may seem to the reader but golden dreams to leave them therefore the   th day we sailed from point arena toward plata to seek our bark that was sent to the island lobos in search of captain eaton we were   ships in company and   barks and the   th day we arrived at plata but found no bark there nor any letter the next day we went over to the main to fill water and in our passage met our bark she had been a second time at the island lobos and not finding us was coming to plata again they had been in some want of provision since they left us and therefore they had been at santa hellena and taken it where they got as much maize as served them   or   days and that with some fish and turtle which they struck lasted them till they came to the island lobos de terra they got boobies and penguins eggs of which they laid in a store and went from thence to lobos de la mar where they replenished their stock of eggs and salted up a few young seal for fear they should want and being thus victualled they returned again toward plata when our water was filled we went over again to the island plata there we parted the cloths that were taken in the clothbark into two lots or shares captain davis and his men had one part and captain swan and his men had the other part the bark which the cloth was in captain swan kept for a tender at this time here were at plata a great many large turtles which i judge came from the gallapagos for i had never seen any here before though i had been here several times this was their couplingtime which is much sooner in the year here than in the west indies properly so called our strikers brought aboard every day more than we could eat captain swan had no striker and therefore had no turtle but what was sent him from captain davis and all his flower too he had from captain davis but since our disappointment at guiaquil capt daviss men murmured against captain swan and did not willingly give him any provision because he was not so forward to go thither as capt davis however at last these differences were made up and we concluded to go into the bay of panama to a town called la velia but because we had not canoas enough to land our men we were resolved to search some rivers where the spaniards have no commerce there to get indian canoas  chap vii they leave the isle of

privateers and the engagement between them  the   d day of december      we sailed from the island plata toward the bay of panama the wind at s s e a fine brisk gale and fine weather the next morning we past by cape passao this cape is in lat 00 d 0  m south of the equator it runs out into the sea with a high round point which seems to be divided in the midst it is bald against the sea but within land and on both sides it is full of short trees the land in the country is very high and mountainous and it appears to be very woody between cape passao and cape st francisco the land by the sea is full of small points making as many little sandy bays between them and is of an indifferent height covered with trees of diverse sorts so that sailing by this coast you see nothing but a vast grove or wood which is so much the more pleasant because the trees are of several forms both in respect to their growth and color  our design was as i said in my first chapter to search for canoas in some river where the spaniards have neither settlement nor trade with the native indians we had spanish pilots and indians bred under the spaniards who were able to carry us into any harbor or river belonging to the spaniards but were wholly unacquainted with those rivers which were not frequented by the spaniards there are many such unsrequented rivers between plata and panama indeed all the way from the line to the gulf of st michaels or even to panama it self the coast is not inhabited by any spaniards nor are the indians that inhabit there any way under their subjection except only near the isle gallo where on the banks of a gold river or two there are some spaniards who work there to find gold  now our pilots being at a loss on these less frequented coasts we supplied that defect out of the spanish pilotbooks which we took in their ships these we found by experience to be very good guides yet nevertheless the country in many places by the sea being low and full of openings creeks and rivers it is somewhat difficult to find any particular river that a man designs to go to where he is not well acquainted  this however could be no discouragement to us for one river might probably be as well furnished with indian canoas as another and if we found them it was to us indifferent where yet we pitched on the river st jago not because the  were not other rivers as large and as likely to be inhabited with indians as it but because that river was not far from gallo an island where our ships could anchor safely and ride securely we past by cape st francisco meeting with great and continued rains the land by the sea to the north of the cape is low and extraordinary woody the trees are very thick and seem to be of a prodigious height and bigness from cape st francisco the land runs more easterly into the bay of panama i take this cape to be its bounds on the south side and the isles of cobaya or quibo to bound it on the n side between this cape and the isle gallo there are many large and navigable rivers we passed by them all till we came to the river st jago  this river is near   d north of the equator it is large and navigable some leagues up and   leagues from the sea it divides it self into two parts making an island that is   leagues wide against the sea the widest branch is that on the s w side of the island both branches are very deep but the mouth of the narrower is so choakt with sholes that at low water even canoas cannot enter above the island it is a league wide and the stream runs pretty straight and very swift the tide flows about   leagues up the river but to what height i know not probably the river has its original from some of the rich mountains near the city quito and it runs through a country as rich in soil as perhaps any in the world especially when it draws within  0 or    leagues of the sea the land there both on the island and on the both sides of the river is of a black deep mold producing extraordinary great tall trees of many sorts such as usually grow in these hot climates i shall only give an account of the cotton and cabbagetrees whereof there is great plenty and they are as large of their kinds as ever i saw  there are two sorts of cottontrees one is called the red the other the white cottontree the white cottontree grows like an oak but generally much bigger and taller than our oaks the body is straight and clear from knots or boughs to the very head there it spreads forth many great limbs just like an oak the bark is smooth and of a gray color the leaves are as big as a large plumb leaf jagged at the edge they are oval smooth and of a dark green color some of these trees have their bodies much bigger    or  0 foot high than nearer the ground being big bellied like ninepins they bear a very fine sort of cotton called silk cotton when this cotton is ripe the trees appear like our apple trees in england when full of blossoms if i do not mistake the cotton falls down in november or december then the ground is covered white with it this is not substantial and continuous like that which grows upon the cottonshrubs in plantations but like the down of thistles so that i did never know any use made of it in the west indies because it is not worth the labor of gathering it but in the east indies the natives gather and use it for pillows it has a small black seed among it the leaves of this tree fall off the beginning of april while the old leaves are falling off the young ones spring out and in a weeks time the tree casts off her old robes and is clothed in a new pleasant garb the red cottontree is like the other but hardly so big it bears no cotton but its wood is somewhat harder of the two yet both sorts are soft spungy wood fit for no use that i know but only for canoas which being straight and tall they are very good for but they will not last long especially if not drawn ashore often and tarred otherwise the worm and the water soon rot them they are the biggest trees or perhaps weeds rather in the west indies they are common in the east and west indies in good fat land  as the cotton is the biggest tree in the woods so the cabbagetree is the tallest the body is not very big but very high and straight i have measured one in the bay of campeachy   0 feet long as it lay on the ground and there are some much higher it has no limbs nor boughs but at the head there are many branches bigger than a mans arm these branches are not covered but flat with sharp edges they are    or    foot long about two foot from the trunk the branches shoot forth small long leaves about aninch broad which grow so regularly on both sides of the branch that the whole branch seems to be but one leaf made up of many small ones the cabbage fruit shoots out in the midst of these branches from the top of the tree it is invested with many young leaves or branches which are ready to spread abroad as the old branches drop and fall down the cabbage it self when it is taken out of the leaves which it seems to be folded in is as big as the small of a mans leg and a foot long it is as white as milk and as sweet as a nut if eaten raw and it is very sweet and wholesome if boiled besides the cabbage it self there grow out between the cabbage and the large branhes small twigs as of a shrub about two foot long from their stump at the end of those twigs which grows very thick together there hang berries hard and round and as big as a cherry these the trees shed every year and they are very good for hogs for this reason the spaniards fine any who shall cut down any of these in their woods the body of the tree is full of rings round it half a foot asunder from the bottom to the top the bark is thin and brittle the wood is black and very hard the heart or middle of the tree is white pith they do not climb to get the cabbage but cut them down for should they gather it off the tree as it stands yet its head being gone it soon dies these trees are much used by planters in jamaica to board the sides of the houses for it is but splitting the trunk into   parts with an axe and there are so many planks those trees appear very pleasant and they beautify the whole wood spreading their green branches above all other trees  all this country is subject to very great rains so that this part of peru pays for the dry weather which they have about lima and all that coast i believe that is one reason why the spaniards have made such small discoveries in this and other rivers on this coast another reason may be because it lies not so directly in their way for they do not coast it along in going from panama to lima but first go westward as far as to the keys or isles of cobaya for a westerly wind and from thence stand over toward cape st francisco not touching any where usually till they come to manta near cape st lorenzo in their return indeed from lima to panama they may keep along the coast hereabouts but then their ships are always laden whereas the light ships that go from panama are most at leisure to make discoveries a third reason may be the wildness and enmity of all the natives on this coast who are naturally fortified by their rivers and vast woods from whence with their arrows they can easily annoy any that shall land there to assault them at this river particularly there are no indians live within   leagues of the sea and all the country so far is full of impassable woods so that to get at the indians or the mines and mountains there is no way but by rowing up the river and if any who are enemies to the natives attempt this as the spaniards are always hated by them they must all the way be exposed to the arrows of those who would lie purposely in ambush in the woods for them these wild indians have small plantations of maiz and good plantaingardens for plantains are their chiefest food they have also a few fowls and hogs  it was to this river that we were bound to seek for canoas therefore the   th supposing our selves to be abrest of it we went from our ships with   canoas the   th day in the morning we entered at half flood into the smaller branch of that river and rowed up   leagues before we met any inhabitants there we found two small huts thatched with palmeto leaves the indians seeing us rowing toward their houses got their wives and little ones with their household stuff into their canoas and paddled away faster than we could row for we were forced to keep in the middle of the river because of our oars but they with their paddles kept close under the banks and so had not the strength of the stream against them as we had these huts were close by the river on the east side of it just against the end of the island we saw a great many other houses a league from us on the other side of the river but the main stream into which we were now come seemed to be so swift that we were afraid to put over for fear we should not be abe to get back again we found only a hog some fowls and plantains in the huts we killed the hog and the fowls which were dressed presently their hogs they got as i suppose from the spaniards by some accident or from some neighboring indians who converse with the spaniards for this that we took was of their european kind which the spaniards have introduced into america very plentifully especially into the islands jamaica hispaniola and cuba above all being very largely stored with them where they feed in the woods in the day time and at night come in at the sounding of a conchshell and are put up in their crauls or pens and yet some turn wild which nevertheless are often decoyed in by the other which being all marked whenever they see an unmarked hog in the pen they know it is a wild one and shoot him presently these crauls i have not seen on the continent where the spaniards keep them tame at home among the wild indians or in their woods are no hogs but pecary and warree a sort i have mentioned before  after we had refreshed our selves we returned toward the mouth of the river it was the evening when we came from thence and we got to the rivers mouth the next morning before day our ships when we left them were ordered to go to gallo where they were to stay for us gallo is a small uninhabited island lying in between two and   degrees north lat it lies in a wide bay about   leagues from the mouth of the river tomaco and   leagues and half from a small indian village called tomaco the island gallo is of an indifferent height it is clothed with very good timber trees and is therefore often visited with barks from guiaquil and other places for most of the timber carried from guiaquil to lima is first fetched from gallo there is a spring of good water at the n e end at that place there is a small fine sandy bay where there is good landing the road for ships is against this bay where there is good secure riding in   or   fathom water and here ships may careen it is but shoal water all about this island yet there is a channel to come in at where there is no less than   fathom water you must go in with the tide of flood and come out with ebb sounding all the way  tomaco is a large river that takes its name from an indian village so called it is reported to spring from the rich mountains about quito it is thick inhabited with indians and there are some spaniards that live there who traffic with the indians for gold it is shoal at the mouth of the river yet barks may enter  this village tomaco is but small and is seated not far from the mouth of the river it is a place to entertain the spanish merchants that come to gallo to load timber or to traffic with the indians for gold at this place one doleman with   or   men more once of captain sharps crew were killed in the year    0 from the branch of the river st jago where we now lay to tomaco is about   leagues the land low and full of creeks so that canoas may pass within land through those creeks and from thence into tomaco river  the   th day we left the river of st jago crossing some creeks in our way with our canoas and came to an indian house where we took the  and all his family we staid here till the aftern and then rowed toward tomaco with the m this house for our guide we arrived at tomaco about    a clock at night here we took all the ihabitants of the village and a spanish knight called don diego de pinus this knight came in a ship from lima to lade timber the ship was riding in a creek about a mile off and there were only one spaniard and   indians aboard we went in a canoa with   men and took her she had no goods but    or    jars of good wine which we took out and the next day let the ship go here an indian canoa came aboard with three men in her these men could not speak spanish neither could they distinguish us from spaniards the wild indians usually thinking all white men to be spaniards we gave them   or four callabashes of wine which they freely drank they were straight bodies and well limbed men of a mean height their hair black long visagd small noses and eyes and were thin faced ill looked men of a very dark copper color a little before night captain swan and all of us returned to tomaco and left the vessel to the seamen the   st day two of our canoas who had been up the river of tomaco returned back again to the village they had rowed   or   leagues up and found but one spanish house which they were told did belong to a lady who lived at lima she had servants here that traded with the indians for gold but they seeing our men coming ran away yet our men found there several ounces of gold in callabashes  january      we went from tomaco toward gallo we carried the knight with us and too small canoas which we took there and while we were rowing over one of our canoas took a pacquetboat that was sent from panama to lima the spaniards threw the packet of letters overboard with a line and a buoy to it but our men seeing it took it up and brought the letters and all the prisoners aboard our ships that were then at an anchor at gallo here we staid till the  th day reading the letters by which we understood that the armada from old spain was come to portabel and that the president of panama had sent this packet on purpose to hasten the plate fleet thither from lima  we were very joyful of this news and therefore sent away the pacquetboat with all her letters and we altered our former resolutions of going to lavelia we now concluded to careen our ships as speedily as we could that we might be ready to intercept this fleet the properest place that we could think on for doing it was among the kings islands or pearl keys because they are near panama and all ships bound to panama from the coast of lima pass by them so that being there we could not possibly miss the fleet according to these resolutions we sailed the next morning in order to execute what we designed we were   ships and   barks in company viz captain davis captain swan a fireship and   small barks as tenders one on captain daviss ship the other on captai swans we weighed before day and got out all bu captain swans tender which never budged for the men were all asleep when we went out and the tide of flood coming on before they waked w were forced to stay for them till the next day  the  th day in the morning we descried a sai to the west of us the wind was at south and w chased her and before noon took her she was a ship of about  0 tun laden with flower she cam from truxillo and was bound to panama thi ship came very opportunely to us for flower began to grow scarce and captain davis his me grudged at what was given to captain swan who as i said before had none but what he had from captain davis  we jogged on after this with a gentle gale toward gorgonia an island lying about    leagues from the island gallo the  th day we anchored at gorgonia on the west side of the island in    fathom clean ground not   cables length from the shore gorgonia is an uninhabited island in lat about   degrees north it is a pretty high island and very remarkable by reason of   saddles or risings and fallings on the top it is about   leagues long and a league broad and it is   leagues from the main at the west end is another small island the land against the anchoringplace is low there is a small sandy bay and good landing the soil or mould of it is black and deep in the low ground but on the side of the high land it is a kind of a red clay this island is very well clothed with large trees of several sorts that are flourishing and green all the year it is very well watered with small brooks that issue from the high land here are a great many little black monkeys some indian conies and a few snakes which are all the land animals that i know there it is reported of this island that it rains on every day in the year more or less but that i can disprove however it is a very wet coast and it rains abundantly here all the year long there are but few fair days for there is little difference in the seasons of the year between the wet and dry only in that season which should be the dry time the rains are less frequent and more moderate than in the wet season for then it pours as out of a sieve it is deep water and no anchoring any where about this island only at the west side the tide rises and falls   or   foot up and down here are a great many perewincles and muscles to be had at low water then the monkeys come down by the seaside and catch them digging them out of their shells with their claws  here are pearloysters in great plenty they grow to the loose rocks in     or   fathom water by beards or little small roots as a muscle these oysters are commonly flatter and thinner than other oysters otherwise much alike in shape the fish is not sweet nor very wholesome it is as slimy as a shellsnail they taste very copperish if eaten raw and are best boiled the indians who gather them for the spaniards hang the meat of them on strings like jewsears and dry them before they eat them the pearl is found at the head of the oyster lying between the meat and the shell some will have  0 or  0 small seedpearl some none at all and some will have   or   pretty large ones the inside of the shell is more glorious than the pearl it self i did never see any in the south seas but here it is reported there are some at the southend of callifornia in the west indies the rancho reys or rancheria spoken of in chap   is the place where they are found most plentifully it is said there are some at the island margarita  st augustine a town in the gulf of florida  the east indies the island ainam near the southend of china is said to have plenty of these oysters more productive of large round pearl than those in other places they are found also in other parts of the east indies and on the persian coast  at this island gorgona we rummaged our prize and found a few boxes of marmalade and   or   jars of brandy which were equally shared between capt davis capt swan and their men here we filled all our water and capt swan furnished himself with flower afterward we turned ashore a great many prisoners but kept the chiefest to put them ashore in a better place  the   th day we sailed from hence toward the kings islands we were now   sail   men of war   tenders a fireship and the prize we had but little wind but what we had was the common trade at south the land we sailed by on the main is very low toward the seaside but in the country there are very high mountains  the   th day we passed by cape corrientes this cape is in lat   d  0 m it is high bluff land with   or   small hillocks on the top it appears at a distance like an island here we found a strong current running to the n but whether it be always so i know not the day after we passed by the cape we saw a small white island which we chaced supposing it had been a sail till coming near we found our error  the   st day we saw point garachina this point is in lat   d  0 m north it is pretty high land rocky and destitute of trees yet within land it is woody it is fenced with rocks against the sea within the point by the sea at low water you may find store of oysters and muscles  the kings islands or pearl keys are about    leagues distant from this point between point garachina and them there is a small low flat barren island called gallera at which captain harris was sharing with his men the gold he took in his pillaging sancta maria which i spoke of a little before when on a sudden   spanish barks fitted out on purpose at panama came upon him but he fought them so stoutly with one small bark he had and some few canoas boarding their admiral particularly that they were all glad to leave him by this island we anchored and sent our boats to the kings island for a good careening place  the kings islands are a great many low woody islands lying n w by n and s e by s they are about   leagues from the main and    leagues in length and from panama about    leagues why they are called the kings islands i know not they are sometimes and mostly in maps called the pearl islands i cannot imagine wherefore they are called so for i did never see one pearl oyster about them nor any pearl oystershells but on the other oysters i have made many a meal there the northermost island of all this range is called pachea or pacheque this is but a small island distant from panama    or    leagues the southermost of them is called st pauls besides these two i know no more that are called by any particular name though there are many that far exceed either of the two in bigness some of these islands are planted with plantains and bonanas and there are fields of rice on others of them the gentlemen of panama to whom they belong keep negroes there to plant weed and husband the plantations many of them especially the largest are wholly untilled yet very good fat land full of large trees these unplanted islands shelter many runawaynegroes who abscond in the woods all day and in the night boldly pillage the plantain walks betwixt these islands and the main is a channel of   or   leagues wide there is good depth of water and good anchoring all the way the islands border thick on each other yet they make many small narrow deep channels fit only for boats to pass between most of them at the s e end about a league from st pauls island there is a good place for ships to careen or hale ashore it is surrounded with the land and has a good deep channel on the north side to go in at the tide rises here about  0 foot perpendicular  we brought our ships into this place the   th day but were forced to tarry for a spring tide before we could have water enough to clean them therefore we first cleaned our barks that they might cruise before panama while we lay here the   th day our barks being clean we sent them out with  0 men in each the  th day after they returned with a prize laden with maiz or indian corn saltbeef and fowls she came from lavelia and was bound to panama lavelia is a town we once designed to attempt it is pretty large and stands on the bank of a river on the north side of the bay of panama   or   leagues from the sea  nata is another such town standing in a plain near another branch of the same river in these towns and some others on the same coast they breed hogs fowls bulls and cows and plant maiz purposely for the support of panama which is supplied with provision mostly from other towns and the neigbouring islands  the beef and fowl our men took came to us in a good time for we had eaten but little flesh since we left the island plata the harbor where we careend was encompassed by three islands and our ships rode in the middle that on which we haled our ships ashore was a little island on the north side of the harbor there was a fine small sandy bay but all the rest of the island was environed with rocks on which at low water we did use to gather oysters clams muscles and limpits the clam is a sort of oyster which grows so fast to the rock that there is no separating it from thence therefore we did open it where it grows and take out the meat which is very large fat and sweet here are a few common oysters such as we have in england of which sort i have met with none in these seas but here at point garachina at puna and on the mexican coast in the lat of    d north i have a manuscript of mr teat capt swans chief mate which gives an account of oysters plentifully found in port st julian on the east side and somewhat to the north of the streights of magellan but there is no mention made of what oysters they are here are some guanoes but we found no other sort of landanimal here are also some pigeons and turtledoves the rest of the islands that incompass this harbor had of all these sorts of creatures our men therefore did every day go over in canoas to them to fish fowl or hunt for guanoes but having one man surprised once by some spaniards lying there in ambush and carried off by them to panama we were after that more cautious of straggling  the   th day of feb      we made an end of cleaning our ship filled all our water and stocked our selves with firewood the   th day we went out from among the islands and anchored in the channel between them and the main in    fathom water soft oazy ground the platefleet was not yet arrived therefore we intended to cruise before the city of panama which is from this place about    leagues the next day we sailed toward panama passing in the channel between the kings islands and the main it is very pleasant sailing here having the main on one side which appears in diverse forms it is beautified with many small hills clothed with woods of diverse sorts of trees which are always green and flourishing there are some few small high islands within a league of the main scattering here and there one these are partly woody partly bare and they as well as the main appear very pleasant the kings islands are on the other side of this channel and make also a lovely prospect as you sail by them these as i have already noted are low and flat appearing in several shapes according as they are naturally formed by many small creeks and branches of the sea the   th day we anchored at pacheque in    fathom water about a leagne from the island and sailed from thence the next day with the wind at n n e directing our course toward panama  when we came abrest of old panama we anchored and sent our canoa ashore with our prisoner don diego de pinas with a letter to the governor to treat about an exchange for our man they had spirited away as i said and another captain harris left in the river of st maria the year before coming over land don diego was desirous to go on this errand in the name and with the consent of the rest of our spanish prisoners but by some accident he was killed before he got ashore as we heard afterward  old panama was formerly a famous place but it was taken by sir henry morgan about the year      and at that time great part of it was burned to ashes and it was never reedified since  new panama is a very fair city standing close by the sea about   mile from the ruins of the old town it gives name to a large bay which is famous for a great many navigable rivers some whereof are very rich in gold it is also very pleasantly sprinkled with islands that are not only profitable to their owners but very delightful to the passengers and seamen that sail by them some of which i have already described it is encompassed on the backside with a pleasant country which is full of small hills and valleys beautified with many groves and spots of trees that appear in the savannahs like so many little islands this city is all compassed with a high stone wall the houses are said to be of brick their roofs appear higher than the top of the city wall it is beautified with a great many fair churches and religious houses besides the presidents house and other eminent buildings which altogether make one of the finest objects that i did ever see in america especially there are a great many guns on her walls most of which look toward the land they had none at all against the sea when i first entered those seas with captain sawkins captain coxon captain sharp and others for till then they did not fear any enemy by sea but since then they have planted guns clear round this is a flourishing city by reason it is a thoroughfair for all imported or exported goods and treasure to and from all parts of peru and chili whereof their storehouses are never empty the road also is seldom or never without ships besides once in   years when the spanish armada comes to portobel then the platefleet also from lima comes hither with the kings treasure and abundance of merchant ships full of goods and plate at that time the city is full of merchants and gentlemen the seamen are busy in landing the treasure and goods and the carriers or caravan masters employed in carrying it over land on mules in vast droves every day to portobel and bringing back european goods from thence though the city be then so full yet during this heat of business there is no hiring of an ordinary slave under a piece of eight a day houses also chambers beds and victuals are then extraordinary dear  now i am on this subject i think it will not be amiss to give the reader an account of the progress of the armada from old spain which comes thus every three years into the indies its first arrival is at carthagena from whence as i have been told an express is immediately sent over land to lima through the southern continent and another by sea to portobel with two pacquets of letters one for the viceroy of lima the other for the viceroy of mexico i know not which wa that of mexico goes after its arrival at portobel whether by land or sea but i believe  sa to la vera cruz that for lima is sent by land to panama and from thence by sea to lima  upon mention of these pacquets i shall digress yet a little further and acquaint my reader that before my first going over into the south seas with captain sharp and indeed before any privateers at least since drake and oxengham had gone that way which we afterward went except la sound a french captain who by captain wrights instructions had ventured as far as cheapo town with a body of men but was driven back again i being then on board capt coxen in company with   or   more privateers about   leagues to the east of portobel we took the pacquets bound thither from carthagena we opened a great quantity of the merchants letters and found the contents of many of them to be very surprising the merchants of several parts of old spain thereby informing there correspondents of panama and elsewhere of a certain prophecy that went about spain that year the tenor of which was that there would be english privateers that year in the west indies who would make such great discoveries as to open a door into the south seas which they supposed was fastest shut and the letters were accordingly full of cautions to their friends to be very watchful and careful of their coasts  this door they spoke of we all concluded must b the passage over land through the country of the indians of d who were a little before this becom our friends and ad lately fallen out with the spaniards breaking off the intercourse which for some time they had with them and upon calling also to mind the frequent invitations we had from those indians a little before this time to pass through their country and fall upon the spaniards in the south seas we from hence forward began to entertain such thoughts in earnest and soon came to a resolution to make those attempts which we afterward did with capt sharp coxen etc so that the taking these letters gave the first life to those bold undertakings and we took the advantage of the fears the spaniards were in from that prophecy or probable conjecture or whatever it were for we sealed up most of the letters again and sent them ashore to portobel  the occasion of this our late friendship with those indians was thus about    years before this time capt wright being cruising near that coast and going in among the samballoes isles to strike fish and turtle took there a young indian lad as he was paddling about in a canoa he brought him aboard his ship and gave him the name of john great clothing him and intending to breed him among the english but his moskito strikers taking a fancy to the boy begged him of capt wright and took him with them at their return into their own country where they taught him their art and he married a wife among them and learnt their language as he had done some broken english while he was with capt wright which he improved among the moskitoes who corresponding so much with us do all of them smatter english after a sort but his own language he had almost forgot thus he lived among them for many years till about   or   months before our taking these letters capt wright being again among the samballoes took thence another indian boy about  0 or    years old the son of a man of some account among those indians and wanting a striker he went away to the moskitos country where he took john great who was now very expert at it john great was much pleased to see a lad there of his own country and it came into his mind to persuade capt wright upon this occasion to endeavor a friendship with those indians a thing our privateers had long coveted but never durst attempt having such dreadful apprehensions of their numbers and fierceness but john great offered the captain that he would go ashore and negotiate the matter who accordingly sent him in his canoa till he was near the shore which of a sudden was covered with indians standing ready with their bows and arrows john great who had only a clout about his middle as the fashion of the indians is leapt then out of the boat and swam the boat retiring a little way back and the indians ashore seeing him in that habit and hearing him call to them in their own tongue which he had recovered by conversing with the boy lately taken suffered him quietly to land and gathered all about to hear how it was with him he told them particularly that he was one of their countrymen and how he had been taken many years ago by the english who had used him very kindly that they were mistaken in being so much afraid of that nation who were not enemies to them but to the spaniards to confirm this he told them how well the english treated another young lad of theirs they had lately taken such a ones son for this he had learnt of the youth and his father was one of the company that was got together on the shore he persuaded them therefore to make a league with these friendly people by whose help they might be able to quell the spaniards assuring also the father of the boy that if he would but go with him to the ship which they saw at anchor at an island there it was golden island the eastermost of the samballoes a place where there is good striking for turtle he should have his son restored to him and they might all expect a very kind reception upon these assurances  0 or  0 of them went off presently in   or   canoas laden with plantains bonanoes fowls etc and capt wright having treated them on board went ashore with them and was entertained by them and presents were made on each side captain wright gave the boy to his father in a very handsome english dress which he had caused to be made purposely for him and an agreement was immediately struck up between the english and these indians who invited the english through their country into the south seas  pursuant to this agreement the english when they came upon any such design or for traffic with them were to give a certain signal which they pitched upon whereby they might be known but it happened that mr la sound the french captain spoken of a little before being then one of captain wrights men learnt this signal and staying ashore at petitguavres upon captain wrights going thither soon after who had his commission from thence he gave the other french there such an account of the agreement beforementioned and the easiness of entering the south seas thereupon that he got at the head of about   0 of them who made that unsuccessful attempt upon cheapo as i said making use of the signal they had learnt for passing the indians country who at that time could not distinguish so well between the several nations of the europeans as they can since  from such small beginnings arose those great stirs that have been since made over the south seas viz from the letters we took and from the friendship contracted with these indians by means of john great yet this friendship had like to have been stifled in its infancy for within few months after an english trading sloop came on this coast from jamaica and john great who by this time had advanced himself a a grandee among these indians together with   or   more of that quality went off to the sloop in their long gowns as the custom is for such to wear among them being received aboard they expected to find every thing friendly and john great talked to them in english but these english men having no knowledge at all of what had happened endeavored to make them slaves as is commonly done for upon carrying them to jamaica they could have sold them for  0 or    pound a piece but john great and the rest perceiving this leapt all overboard and were by the others killed every one of them in the water the indians on shore never came to the knowledge of it if they had it would have endangered our correspondence several times after upon our conversing with em they enquired of us what was become of their countrymen but we told them we knew not as indeed it was a great while after that we heard this story so they concluded the spaniards had met with them and killed or taken them  but to return to the account of the progress of the armada which we left at cartagena after an appointed stay there of about  0 days as i take it it goes thence to portobel where it lies  0 days and no longer therefore the viceroy of lima on notice of the armadas arrival at cartagena immediately sends away the kings treasure to panama where it is landed and lies ready to be sent to portobel upon the first news of the armadas arrival there this is the reason partly of their sending expresses so early to lima that upon the armadas first coming to portobel the treasure and goods may lie ready at panama to be sent away upon the mules and it requires some time for the lima fleet to unlade because the ships ride not at panama but at perica which are   small islands   leagues from thence the kings treasure is said to amount commonly to about   000000 of pieces of eight besides abundance of merchants money all this treasure is carried on mules and there are large stables at both places to lodge them sometimes the merchants to steal the custom pack up money among goods and send it to venta de cruzes on the river chagre from thence down the river and afterward by sea to portobel in which passage i have known a whole fleet of periagos and canoas taken the merchants who are not ready to sail by the  0th day after the armadas arrival are in danger to be left behind for the ships all weigh the  0th day precisely and go to the harbors mouth yet sometimes on great importunity the admiral may stay a week longer for it is impossible that all the merchants should get ready for want of men when the armada departs from portobel it returns again to cartagena by which time all the kings revenue which comes out of the country is got ready there here also meets them again a great ship called the pattache one of the spanish galeons which before their first arrival at cartagena goes from the rest of the armada on purpose to gather the tribute of the coast touching at the magaritas and other places in her way thence to cartagena as punta de guaira moracaybo riode la hacha and sancta martha and at all these places takes in treasure for the king after the set stay at cartagena the armada goes away to the havana in the isle of cuba to meet there the flota which is a small number of ships that go to la vera cruz and there takes in the effects of the city and country of mexico and what is brought thither in the ship which comes thither every year from the philippine islands and having joined the rest at the havana the whole armada sets sail for spain through the gulf of florida the ships in the south seas lie a great deal longer at panama before they return to lima the merchants and gentlemen which come from lima stay as little time as they can at portobel which is at the best but a sickly place and at this time is very full of men from all parts but panama as it is not overcharged with men so unreasonably as the other though very full so it enjoys a good air lying open to the seawind which rises commonly about  0 or    a clock in the morning and continues till   or   a clock at night then the landwind comes and blows till   or   in the morning  there are no woods nor marshes near panama but a brave dry champion land not subject to fogs nor mists the wet season begins in the latter end of may and continues till november at that time the seabreezes are at s s w and the landwinds at n at the dry season the winds are most betwixt the e n e and the n yet off in the bay they are commonly at south but of this i shall be more particular in my chapter of winds in the appendix the rains are not so excessive about panama it self as on either side of the bay yet in the months of june july and august they are severe enough gentlemen that come from peru to panama especially in these months cut their hair close to preserve them from fevers for the place is sickly to them because they come out of a country which never has any rains or fogs but enjoys a constant serenity but i am apt to believe this city is healthy enough to any other people thus much for panama  the  0th day we went and anchored within a league of the islands perico which are only   little barren rocky islands in expectation of the president of panamas answer to the letter i said we sent him by don diego treating about exchange of prisoners this being the day on which he had given us his parole to return with an answer the   st day we took another bark laden with hogs fowl salt beef and molossoes she came from lavelia and was going to panama in the afternoon we sent another letter ashore by a young mastiso a mixtbreed of indians and europeans directed to the president and   or   copies of it to be dispersed abroad among the common people this letter which was full of threats together with the young mans managing the business wrought so powerfully among the common people that the city was in an uproar the president immediately sent a gentleman aboard who demanded the flowerprize that we took off of gallo and all the prisoners for the ransom of our two men but our captains told him they would exchange man for man the gentleman said he had not orders for that but if he would stay till the next day he would bring the governors answer the next day he brought aboard our two men and had about  0 prisoners in exchange  the   th day we run over to the island tabago tabago is in the bay and about   leagues south of panama it is about   mile long and   broad a high mountainous island on the northside it declines with a gentle descent to the sea the land by the sea is of a black mold and deep but toward the top of the mountain it is strong and dry the northside of this island makes a very pleasant show it seems to be a garden of fruit enclosed with many high trees the chiefest fruits are plantains and bonanas they thrive very well from the foot to the middle of it but those near the top are but small as wanting moisture close by the sea there are many coconuttrees which make a very pleasant sight within the coconuttrees there grow many mammet trees the mammet is a large tall and straitbodied tree clean without knots or limbs for   or  0 foot or more the head spreads abroad into many small limbs which grow pretty thick and close together the bark is of a dark gray colom thick and rough full of large chops the fruit is bigger than quince it is round and covered with a thick rind of a gray color when the fruit is ripe the rind is yellow and though and it will then peel off like leather but before it is ripe it is brittle the juice is then white and clammy but when ripe not so the ripe fruit under the rind is yellow as a carrot and in the middle are two large rough stones flat and each of them much bigger than an almond the fruit smells very well and the taste is answerable to the smell the s w end of the island has never been cleared but is full of firewood and trees of diverse sorts there is a very fine small brook of fresh water that springs out of the side of the mountain and gliding through the grove of fruit trees falls into the sea on the northside there was a small town standing by the sea with a church at one end but now the biggest part of it is destroyed by the privateers there is good anchoring right against the town about a mile from the shore where you may have    or    fathom water soft oazy ground there is a small island close by the n w end of this called tabogilla with a small channel to pass between there is another woody island about a mile on the n e side of tabago and a good channel between them this island has no name that ever i heard  while we lay at tabago we had like to have had a scurvy trick played us by a pretended merchant from panama who came as by stealth to traffic with us privately a thing common enough with the spanish merchants both in the north and south seas notwithstanding the severe prohibitions of the governors who yet sometimes connive at it and will even trade with the privateers themselves our merchant was by agreement to bring out his bark laden with goods in the night and we to go and anchor at the south of perico out he came with a fireship instead of a bark and approached very near haling us with the watchword we had agreed upon we suspecting the worst called to them to come to an anchor and upon their not doing so fired at them when immediately their men going out into the canoas set fire to their ship which blew up and burnt close by us so that we were forced to cut our cables in all haste and scamper away as well as we could  the spaniard was not altogether so politic in appointing to meet us at perico for there we had searoom whereas had he come thus upon us at tabago the landwind bearing hard upon us as it did we must either have been burnt by the fireship or upon loosing our cables have been driven ashore but i suppose they chose perico rather for the scene of their enterprise partly because they might there best sculk among the islands and partly because if their exploit failed they could thence escape best from our canoas to panama but   leagues off  during this exploit capt swan whose ship was less than ours and so not so much aimed at by the spaniards lay about a mile off with a canoa at the buoy of his anchor as fearing some treachery from our pretended merchant and a little before the bark blew up he saw a small float on the water and as it appeared a man on it making toward his ship but the man dived and disappeared of a sudden as thinking probably that he was discovered  this was supposed to be one coming with some combustible matter to have stuck about the rudder for such a trick captain sharp was served at coquimbo and his ship had like to have been burnt by it if by mere accident it had not been discovered i was then aboard captain sharps ship captain swan seeing the blaze by us cut his cables as we did his bark did the like so we kept under sail all the night being more scared than hurt the bark that was on fire drove burning toward tabago but after the first blast she did not burn clear only made a smother for she was not well made though capt bond had the framing and management of it  this capt bond was he of whom i made mention in my  th chapter he after his being at the isles of cape verd stood away for the south seas at the instigation of one richard morton who had been with capt sharp in the south seas in his way he met with capt eaton and they two consorted a day or two at last morton went aboard capt eaton and persuaded him to lose capt bond in the night which capt eaton did morton continuing aboard of capt eaton as finding his the better ship capt bond thus losing both his consort eaton and morton his pilot and his ship being but an ordinary sailer he despaired of getting into the south seas and had played such tricks among the caribbee isles as i have been told that he did not dare to appear at any of the english islands therefore he persuaded his men to go to the spaniards and they consented to do any thing that he should propose so he presently steered away into the west indies and the first place where he came to an anchor was at portabel he presently declared to the governor that there were english ships coming into the south seas and that if they questioned it he offered to be kept a prisoner till time should discover the truth of what he said but they believed him and sent him away to panama where he was in great esteem this several prisoners told us  the spaniards of panama could not have fitted out their fireship without this capt bonds assistance for it is strange to say how grossly ignorant the spaniards in the west indies but especially in the south seas are of seaaffairs they build indeed good ships but this is a small matter for any ship of a good bottom will serve for these seas on the south coast they rig their ships but untowardly have no guns but in   or   of the kings ships and are meanly furnished with warlike provisions and much at a loss for the making any fireships or other less usual machines nay they have not the sense to have their guns run within the sides upon their discharge but have platforms without for the men to stand on to charge them so that when we come near we can fetch them down with small shot out of our boats a main reason of this is that the native spaniards are too proud to be seamen but use the indians for all those offices one spaniard it may be going in the ship to command it and himself of little more knowledge than those poor ignorant creatures nor can they gain much experience seldom going far off to sea but coasting along the shores  but to proceed in the morning when it was light we came again to an anchor close by our buoys and strove to get our anchors again but our buoyropes being rotten broke while we were puzling about our anchors we saw a great many canoas full of men pass between tabago and the other island this put us into a new consternation we lay still some time till we saw that they came directly toward us then we weighed and stood toward them and when we came within hale we found that they were english and french privateers come out of the north seas through the isthmus of darien they were   0 men in    canoas  00 of them french the rest english they were commanded by capt gronet and capt lequie we presently came to an anchor again and all the canoas came aboard these men told us that there were   0 english men more under the command of capt towneley in the country of darien making canoas as these men had been to bring them into these seas all the english men that came over in this party were immediately entertained by capt davis and capt swan in their own ships and the french men were ordered to have our flowerprize to carry them and capt gronet being the eldest commander was to command them there and thus they were all disposed of to their hearts content capt gronet to retalliate this kindness offered capt davis and capt swan each of them a new commission from the governor of petit guavres it has been usual for many years past for the governor of p cuavres to send blank commissions to sea by many of his captains with orders to dispose of them to whom they saw convenient those of petit guavres by this means making themselves the sanctuary and asylum of all people of desperate fortunes and increasing their own wealth and the strength and reputation of their party thereby capt davis accepted of one having before only an old commission which fell to him by inheritance at the decease of capt cook who took it from capt tristian together with his bark as is before mentioned but capt swan refused it saying he had an order from the duke of york neither to give offense to the spaniards nor to receive any affront from them and that he had been injured by them at baldivia where they had killed some of his men and wounded several more so that he thought he had a lawful commission of his own to right himself i never read any of these french commissions while i was in these seas nor did i then know the import of them but i have learnt since that the tenor of them is to give a liberty to fish fowl and hunt the occasion of this is that the island hispaniola where the garrison of petitguavres is belongs partly to the french and partly to the spaniards and in time of peace these commissions are given as a warrant to those of each side to protect them from the adverse party but in effect the french do not restrain them to hispaniola but make them a pretense for a general ravage in any part of america by sea or land  having thus disposed of our associates we intended to sail toward the gulf of st michael to seek capt townley who by this time we thought might be entering into these seas accordingly the second day of march      we sailed from hence toward the gulf of st michael this gulf lies near  0 leagues from panama toward the s e the way thither from panama is to pass between the kings islands and the main it is a place where many great rivers having finished their courses are swallowed up in the sea it is bounded on the s with point garachina which lies in north lat   d  0 m and on the north side with cape st lorenzo where by the way i must correct a gross error in our common maps which giving no name at all to the south cape which yet is the most considerable and is the true point garachina do give that name to the north cape which is of small remark only for those whose business is into the gulf and the name st lorenzo which is the true name of this northern point is by them wholly omitted the name of the other point being substituted into its place the chief rivers which run into this gulf of st michael are santa maria sambo and congos the river congos which is the river i would have persuaded our men to have gone up as their nearest way in our journey over land mentioned chap   comes directly out of the country and swallows up many small streams that fall into it from both sides and at last loses it self on the north side of the gulf a league within cape st lorenzo it is not very wide but deep and navigable some leagues within land there are sands without it but a channel for ships it is not made use of by the spaniards because of the neighborhood of santa maria river where they have most business on account of the mines  the river of sambo seems to be a great river for there is a grear tide at its mouth but i can say nothing more of it having never been in it this river falls into the sea on the south side of the gulf near point garachina between the mouths of these   rivers on either side the gulf runs in toward the land somewhat narrower and makes   or   small islands which are clothed with great trees green and flourishing all the year and good channels between the islands beyond which further in still the shore on each side closes so near with   points of low mangrove land as to make a narrow or straight scarce half a mile wide this serves as a mouth or entrance to the innerpart of the gulf which is a deep bay   or   leagues over every way and about the east end thereof are the mouths of several rivers the chief of which is that of santa maria there are many outlets or creeks besides this narrow place i have described but none navigable beside that for this reason the spanish guardship mentioned in chap   chose to lie between these two points as the only passage they could imagine we should attempt since this is the way that the privateers have generally taken as the nearest between the north and south seas the river of santa maria is the largest of all the rivers of this gulf it is navigable   or   leagues up for so high the tide flows beyond that place the river is divided into many branches which are only fit for canoas the tide rises and falls in this river about    foot  about   leagues from the rivers mouth on the south side of it the spaniards about  0 years ago upon their first discovery of the gold mines here built the town santa maria of the same name with the river this town was taken by captain coxen captain harris and captain sharp at their entrance into these seas it being then but newly built since that time it is grown considerable for when captain harris the nephew of the former took it as is said in chap   he found in it all sorts of tradesmen with a great deal of flower and wine and abundance of iron crows and pickaxes these were instruments for the slaves to work in the gold mines for besides what gold and sand they take up together they often find greatlumps wedged between the rocks as if it naturally grew there i have seen a lump as big as a hens egg brought by captain harris from thence who took   0 pound there and he told me that there were lumps a great deal bigger but these they were forced to beat in pieces that they might divide them these lumps are not so solid but that they have crevises and pores full of earth and dust this town is not far from the mines where the spaniards keep a great many slaves to work in the dry time of the year but in the rainy season when the rivers do overflow they cannot work so well yet the mines are so nigh the mountains that as the rivers soon rise so they are soon down again and presently after the rain is the best searching for gold in the sands for the violent rains do wash down the gold into the rivers where much of it settles to the bottom and remains then the native indians who live hereabouts get most and of them the spaniards buy more gold than their slaves get by working i have been told that they get the value of   shillings a day one with another the spaniards withdraw most of them with their slaves during the wet season to panama at this town of st maria captain townley was lying with his party making canoas when captain gronet came into the seas for it was then abandoned by the spaniards  there is another small new town at the mouth of the river called the scuchaderoes it stands on the north side of the open place at the mouth of the river of st maria where there is more air than at the mines or at santa maria town where they are in a manner stifled with heat for want of air  all about these rivers especially near the sea the land is low it is deep black earth and the trees it produces are extraordinary large and high thus much concerning the gulf of st michael whither we were bound  the second day of march as is said before we weighed from perico and the same night we anchored again at pacheque the third day we sailed from thence steering toward the gulf captain swan undertook to fetch off capt townley and his men therefore he kept near the main but the rest of the ships stood nearer the kings islands captain swan desired this office because he intended to send letters overland by the indians to jamaica which he did ordering the indians to deliver his letters to any english vessel in the other seas at   a clock we were again near the place where we cleaned our ships there we saw   ships coming out who proved to be captain townley and his men they were coming out of the river in the night and took   barks bound for panama the one was laden with flower the other with wine brandy sugar and oil the prisoners that he took declared that the lima fleet was ready to sail we went and anchored among the kings islands and the next day captain swan returned out of the river of santa maria being informed by the indians that captain townley was come over to the kings islands at this place captain townley put out a great deal of his goods to make room for his men he distributed his wine and brandy some to every ship that it might be drunk out because he wanted the jars to carry water in the spaniards in these seas carry all their wine brandy and oil in jars that hold   or   gallons when they lade at pisco a place about  0 leagues to the southward of lima and famous for wine they bring nothing else but jars of wine and they stow one tier on the top of another so artificially that we could hardly do the like without breaking them yet they often carry in this manner   00 or  000 or more in a ship and seldom break one the  0th day we took a small bark that came from guiaquil she had nothing in her but ballast the   th day there came an indian canoa out of the river of santa maria and told us that there were  00 english and french men more coming overland from the northseas the   th day we met a bark with   or   english men in her that belonged to captain knight who had been in the south seas   or   months and was now on the mexican coast there he had spied this bark but not being able to come up with her in his ship he detached these   or   men in a canoa who took her but when they had done could not recover their own ship again losing company with her in the night and therefore they came into the bay of panama intending to go overland back into the north seas but that they luckily met with us for the isthmus of darien was now become a common road for privateers to pass between the north and south seas at their pleasure this bark of captain knights had in her  0 or  0 jars of brandy she was now commanded by mr henry more but captain swan intending to promote captain harris caused mr more to be turned out alleging that it was very likely these men were run away from their commander mr more willingly resigned her and went aboard of captain swan and became one of his men  it was now the latter end of the dry season here and the water at the kings or pearl islands of which there was plenty when we first came hither was now dried away therefore we were forced to go to point garachina thinking to water our ships there captain harris being now commander of the new bark was sent into the river of santa maria to see for those men that the indians told us of whilst the rest of the ships sailed toward point garachina where we arrived the   st day and anchored   mile from the point and found a strong tide running out of the river sambo the next day we run within the point and anchored in   fathom at low water the tide rises here   or   foot the flood sets n n e the ebb s s w the indians that inhabit in the river sambo came to us in canoas and brought plantains and bonanoes they could not speak nor understand spanish therefore i believe they have no commerce with the spaniards we found no fresh water here neither so we went from hence to portopinas which is   leagues s by w from hence  portopinas lies in lat   d north it is so called because there are many pinetrees growing there the land is pretty high rising gently as it runs into the country this country near the sea is all covered with pretty high woods the land that bounds the harbor is low in the middle but high and rocky on both sides at the mouth of the harbor there are   small high islands or rather barren rocks the spaniards in their pilot books commend this for a good harbor but it lies all open to the s w winds which frequently blow here in the wet season beside the harbor within the islands is a place of but small extent and has a very narrow going in what depth of water there is in the harbor i know not  the   th day we arrived at this harbor of pines but did not go in with our ship finding it but an ordinary place to lie at we sent in our boats to search it and they found a stream of good water running into the sea but there were such great swelling surges came into the harbor that we could not conveniently fill our water there the   th day we returned to point garachina again in our way we took a small vessel laden with cacao she came from guiaquil the   th day we arrived at point garachina there we found captain harris who had been in the river of santa maria but he did not meet the men that he went for yet we was informed again by the indians that they were making canoas in one of the branches of the river of santa maria here we shared our cacao lately taken  because we could not fill our water here we designed to go to tabago again where we were sure to be supplied accordingly on the  0th day we set sail being now   ships in company and had a small wind at s s e the first day of april being in the channel between the kings islands and the main we had much thunder lightning and some rain this evening we anchored at the island pacheque and immediately sent   canoas before us to the island tabago to take some prisoners for information and we followed the next day the  d day in the evening we anchored by perica and the next morning went to tabago where we found our   canoas they arrived there in the night and took a canoa that came as is usual from panama for plantains there were in the canoa   indians and a mulata the mulata because he said he was in the fireship that came to burn us in the night was immediately hanged these prisoners confirmed that one capt bond an english man did command her  here we filled our water and cut firewood and from hence we sent   canoas over to the main with one of the indians lately taken to guide them to a sugarwork for now we had cacao we wanted sugar to make chocolate but the chiefest of their business was to get coppers for each ship having now so many men our pots would not boil victuals fast enough though we kept them boiling all the day about   or   days after they returned aboard with   coppers  while we lay here captain davis his bark went to the island otoque this is another inhabited island in the bay of panama not so big as tabago yet there are good plantainwalks on it and some negroes to look after them these negroes rear fowls and hogs for their masters who live at panama as at the kings islands it was for some fowls or hogs that our men went thither but by accident they met also with an express that was sent to panama with an account that the lima fleet was at sea most of the letters were thrown overboard and lost yet we found some that said positively that the fleet was coming with all the strength that they could make in the kingdom of peru yet were ordered not to fight us except they were forced to it though afterward they chose to fight us having first landed their treasure at lavelia and that the pilots of lima had been in consultation what course to steer to miss us  for the satisfaction of those who may be curious to know i have here inserted the resolutions taken by the committee of pilots as one of our company translated them out of the spanish of two of the letters we took the first letter as follows sir having been with his excellency and heard the letter of captain michael sanches de tena read wherein he says there should be a meeting of the pilots of panama in the said city they say it is not time putting for objection the gallapagoes to which i answered that it was fear of the enemy and that they might well go that way i told this to his excellency who was pleased to command me to write the course which is as follows  the day for sailing being come go forth to the west south west from that to the west till you are forty leagues off at sea then keep at the same distance to the n w till you come under the line from whence the pilot must shape his course for moro de porco and for the coast of lavelia and natta where you may speak with the people and according to the information they give you may keep the same course for otoque from thence to tabago and so to panama this is what offers as to the course     the letter is obscure but the reader must make what he can of it the directions in the other letter were to this effect the surest course to be observed going forth from malabrigo is thus you must sail w by s that you may avoid the sight of the islands of lobos and if you should chance to see them by reason of the breezes and should fall to leward of the lat of malabrigo keep on a wind as near as you can and if necessary go about and stand in for the shore then tack and stand off and be sure keep your latitude and when you are  0 leagues to the westward of the island lobos keep that distance till you come under the line and then if the general wind follows you farther you must sail n n e till you come into   degrees north and if in this lat you should find the breezes make it your business to keep the coast and so sail for panama if in your course you should come in sight of the land before you are abrest of cape st francisco be sure to stretch off again out of sight of land that you may not be discovered by the enemy     the last letter supposes the fleets setting out from malabrigo in about   degrees south lat as the other does its going immediately from lima   degrees further south and from hence is that caution given of avoiding lobos as near malabrigo in their usual way to panama ahd hardly to be kept out of sight as the winds are thereabouts yet to be avoided by the spanish fleet at this time because as they had twice before heard of the privateers lying at lobos de la mar they knew not but at that time we might be there in expectation of them  the  0th day we sailed from tabago toward the kings island again because our pilots told us that the kings ships did always come this way the   th day we anchored at the place where we careend here we found captain harris who had gone a second time into the river of santa maria and fetched the body of men that last came over land as the indians had informed us but they fell short of the number they told us of the   th day we sent   0 men in    canoas to the river cheapo to take the town of cheapo the   st day all our ships but captain harris who staid to clean his ships followed after the   d day we arrived at the island chepelio  chepelio is the pleasantest island in the bay of panama it is but   leagues from the city of panama and a league from the main this island is about   mile long and almost so broad it is low on the northside and rises by a small ascent toward the south side the soil is yellow a kind of clay the high side is stony the low land is planted with all sorts of delicate fruits viz sapadilloes avogatopears mammees mammeesappotas starapples etc the middle of the island is planted with plantaintrees which are not very large but the fruit extraordinary sweet  the sapadillotree is as big as a large pear tree the fruit much like to a bergomapear both in color shape and size but on some trees the fruit is a little longer when it is green or first gathered the juice is white and clammy and it will stick like glue then the fruit is hard but after it has been gathered   or   days it grows soft and juicy and then the juice is clear as spring water and very sweet in the midst of the fruit are   or   black stones or seeds about the bigness of a pumkinseed this is an excellent fruit  the avogato pear tree is as big as most pear trees and is commonly pretty high the skin or bark black and pretty smooth the leaves large of an oval shape and the fruit as big as a large limon it is of a green color till it is ripe and then it is a little yellowish they are seldom fit to eat till they have been gathered   or   days then they become soft and the skin or rind will peel off the substance in the inside is green or a little yellowish and as soft as butter within the substance there is a stone as big as a horseplumb this fruit has no taste of it self and therefore it is usually mixed with sugar and limejuice and beaten together in a plate and this is an excellent dish the ordinary way is to eat it with a little salt and a roasted plantain and thus a man that is hungry may make a good meal of it it is very wholesome eaten any way it is reported that this fruit provokes to lust and therefore is said to be much esteemed by the spaniards and i do believe they are much esteemed by them for i have met with plenty of them in many places in the northseas where the spaniards are settled as in the bay of campeachy on the coast of cartagena and the coast of caraccos and there are some in jamaica which were planted by the spaniards when they possessed that island  the mammeesappotatree is different from the mammee described at the island tabago in this chapter it is not so big or so tall neither is the fruit so big or so round the rind of the fruit is thin and brittle the inside is a deep red and it has a rough flat long stone this is accounted the principal fruit of the west indies it is very pleasant and wholesome i have not seen any of these on jamaica but in many places in the west indies among the spaniards there is another sort of mammeetree which is called the wild mammee this bears a fruit which is of no value but the tree is straight tall and very tough and therefore principally used for making masts  the starappletree grows much like the quincetree but much bigger it is full of leaves and the leaf is broad of an oval shape and of a very dark green color the fruit is as big as a large apple which is commonly so covered with leaves that a man can hardly see it they say this is a good fruit i did never taste any but have seen both of the trees and fruit in many place on the main on the northside of the continent and in jamaica when the spaniards possessed that island they planted this and other sorts of fruit as the sapadillo avogatopear and the like and of these fruits there is still in jamaica in those plantations that were first settled by the spaniards as at the angels at   mile walk and    mile walk there i have seen these trees which were planted by the spaniards but i did never see any improvement made by the english who seem in that little curious the road for ships is on the northside where there is good anchoring half a mile from the shore there is a well close by the sea on the north side and formerly there were   or   houses close by it but now they are destroyed this island stands right against the mouth of the river cheapo  the river cheapo springs out of the mountains near the north side of the country and it being penned up on the south side by other mountains bends its course to the westward between both till finding a passage on the s w it makes a kind of a half circle and being swelled to a considerable bigness it runs with a slow motion into the sea   leagues from panama this river is very deep and about a quarter of a mile broad but the mouth of it is choked up with sands so that no ships can enter but barks may there is a small spanish town of the same name within   leagues of the sea it stands on the left hand going from the sea this is it which i said captain la sound attempted the land about it is champion with many small hills clothed with woods but the biggest part of the country is savannah on the south side of the river it is all woodland for many leagues together it was to this town that our   0 men were sent the   th day they returned out of the river having taken the town without any opposition but they found nothing in it by the way going thither they took a canoa but most of the men escaped ashore upon one of the kings islands she was sent out well appointed with armed men to watch our motion the   th day captain harris came to us having cleaned his ship the   th day we went again toward tabago our fleet now upon captain harris joining us again consisted of  0 sail we arrived at tabago the   th day there our prisoners were examined concerning the strength of panama for now we thought our selves strong enough for such an enterprise being near  000 men out of these on occasion we could have landed  00 but our prisoners gave us small enconragement to it for they assured us that all the strength of the country was there and that many men were come from portobel besides its own inhabitants who of themselves were more in number than we these reasons together with the strength of the place which has a high wall deterred us from attempting it while we lay here at tabago some of our men burnt the town on the island  the  th of may we sailed hence again bound for the kings islands and there we continued cruising from one end of these islands to the other till on the   d day capt davis and capt gronet went to pacheque leaving the rest of the fleet at anchor at st pauls island from pacheque we sent   canoas to the island chepelio in hopes to get a prisoner there the   th day our canoas returned from chepelio with three prisoners which they took there they were seamen belonging to panama who said that provision was so scarce and dear there that the poor were almost starved being hindered by us from those common and daily supplies of plantains which they did formerly enjoy from the islands especially from those two of chepelia and tabago that the president of panama had strictly ordered that none should adventure to any of the islands for plantains but necessity had obliged them to trespass against the presidents order they farther reported that the fleet from lima was expected every day for it was generally talked that they were come from lima and that the report at panama was that king charles ii of england was dead and that the duke of york was crowned king the   th day capt swan and capt townley also came to pacheque where we lay but captain swans bark was gone in among the kings islands for plantains the island pacheque as i have before related is the northermost of the kings islands it is a small low island about a league round on the south side of it there are   or   small islands neither of them half a mile round between pacheque and these islands is a small channel not above   or   paces wide and about a mile long through this captain townley made a bold run being pressed hard by the spaniards in the fight i am going to speak of though he was ignorant whether there was a sufficient depth of water or not on the east side of this channel all our fleet lay waiting for the lima fleet which we were in hopes would come this way  the   th day we had a very wet morning for the rains were come in as they do usually in may or june sooner or later so that may is here a very uncertain month hitherto till within a few days we had good fair weather and the wind at n n e but now the weather was altered and the wind at s s w  however about eleven a clock it cleared up and we saw the spanish fleet about   leagues w n w from the island pacheque standing close on a wind to the eastward but they could not fetch the island by a league we were riding a league s e from the island between it and the main only captain gronet was about a mile to the northward of us near the island he weighed so soon as they came in sight and stood over for the main and we lay still expecting when he would tack and come to us but he took care to keep himself out of harms way  captain swan and townley came aboard of captain davis to order how to engage the enemy who we saw came purposely to fight us they being in all    sail besides periagoes rowing with    and    oars apiece six sail of them were ships of good force first the admiral    guns   0 men the vice admiral  0 guns  00 men the rearadmiral    guns   0 men a ship of    guns  00 men one of    guns   0 men and one of eight guns  00 men   great fireships   ships only with small arms having  00 men on board them all besides   or   hundred men in periagoes this account of their strength we had afterward from captain knight who being to the windward on the coast of pern took prisoners of whom he had this information being what they brought from lima besides these men they had also some hundreds of old spain men that came from portobe and met them at lavelia from whence they now came and their strength of men from lima wa  000 men being all the strength they could mak in that kingdom and for greater security they had first landed their treasure at lavelia  our fleet consisted of  0 sail first captain davis    guns     men most english captain swan    guns   0 men all english these were the only ships of force that we had the rest having none but small arms captain townley had   0 men all english captain gronet  0  men all french captain harris  00 men most english captain branly    men some english some french davis his tender   men swans tender   men townleys bark  0 men and a small bark of thirty tuns made a fireship with a canoas crew in her we had in all   0 men but captain gronet came not to us till all was over yet we were not discouraged at it but resolved to fight them for being to windward of the enemy we had it at our choice whether we would fight or not it was   a clock in the afternoon when we weighed and being all under sail we bore down right before the wind on our enemies who kept close on a wind to come to us but night came on without any thing beside the exchanging of a few shot on each side when it grew dark the spanish admiral put out a light as a signal for his fleet to come to an anchor we saw the light in the admirals top which continued about half an hour and then it was taken down in a short time after we saw the light again and being to windward we kept under sail supposing the light had been in the admirals top but as it proved this was only a stratagem of theirs for this light was put out the second time at one of their barks topmasthead and then she was sent to leeward which deceived us for we thought still the light was in the admirals top and by that means thought our selves to windward of them  in the morning therefore contrary to our expectation we found they had got the weathergage of us and were coming upon us with full sail so we ran for it and after a running fight all day and having taken a turn almost round the bay of panama we came to an anchor again at the isle of pacheque in the very same place from whence we set out in the morning  thus ended this days work and with it all that we had been projecting for   or   months when instead of making our selves masters of the spanish fleet and treasure we were glad to escape them and owed that too in a great measure to their want of courage to pursue their advantage  the  0th day in the morning when we looked out we saw the spanish fleet all together   leagues to leeward of us at an anchor it was but little wind till  0 a clock and then sprung up a small breeze at south and the spanish fleet went away to panama what loss they had i know not we lost but one man and having held a consult we resolved to go to the keys of quibo or cohaya to seek capt harris who was forced away from us in the fight that being the place appointed for our rendezvous upon any such accident as for gronet he said his men would not suffer him to join us in the fight but we were not satisfied with that excuse so we suffered him to go with us to the isles of quiboa and there cashiered our cowardly companion some were for taking from him the ship which we had given him but at length he was suffered to keep it with his men and we sent them away in it to some other place  chap viii they set out from tabago isle of church the mountain called moro de porcos the coast to the westward of the bay of panama isles of quibo quicaro rancheria the palmamariatree the isles canales and cantarras they build canoas for a new expedition and take puebla nova captain knight joins them canoas how made the coast and winds between quibo and nicoya volcan vejo again tornadoes and the sea rough ria

guatulco village the coast adjoining capt townley marches to the river capalita turtle at guatulco an indian settlement the vinello plant and fruit  according to the resolutions we had taken we set out june the first      passing between point garachina and the kings islands the wind was ot s s w rainy weather with tornadoes of thunder and lightning the  d day we passed by the island chuche the last remainder of the isles in the bay of panama this is a small low round woody island uninhabited lying   leagues s s w from pacheca  in our passage to quibo captain branly lost his mainmast therefore he and all his men left his bark and came aboard captain davis his ship captain swan also sprung his maintopmast and got up another but while he was doing it and we were making the best of our way we lost sight of him and were now on the north side of the bay for this way all ships must pass from panama whether bound toward the coast of mexico or peru the  0th day we passed by moro de porcos or the mountain of hogs why so called i know not it is a high round hill on the coast of lavelia  this side of the bay of panama runs out westerly to the islands of quibo there are on this coast many rivers and creeks but none so large as those on the south side of the bay it is a coast that is partly mountainous partly low land and very thick of woods bordering on the sea but a few leagues within land it consists mostly of savannahs which are stocked with bulls and cows the rivers on this side are not wholly destitute of gold though not so rich as the rivers on the other side of the bay the coast is but thinly inhabited for except the rivers that lead up to the towns of nata and lavelia i know of no other settlement between panama and puebla nova the spaniards may travel by land from panama through all the kingdom of mexico as being full of savannahs but toward the coast of peru they cannot pass further than the river cheapo the land there being so full of thick woods and watered with so many great rivers besides less rivers and creeks that the indians themselves who inhabit there cannot travel far without much trouble  we met with very wet weather in our voyage to quibo and with s s w and sometimes s w winds which retarded our course it was the   th day of june when we arrived at quibo and found there captain harris whom we sought the island quibo or cobaya is in lat   d    m north of the equator it is about   or   leagues long and   or   broad the land is low except only near the n e end it is all over plentifully stored with great tall flourishing trees of many sorts and there is good water on the east and northeast sides of the island here are some deer and plenty of pretty large black monkies whose flesh is sweet and wholesome besides a few guanoes and some snakes i know no other sort of land animal on the island there is a shole runs out from the s e point of the island half a mile into the sea and a league to the north of this shole point on the east side there is a rock about a mile from the shore which at the last quarter ebb appears above water besides these two places there is no danger on this side but ships may run within a quarter of a mile of the shore and anchor in      0 or    fathom good clean sand and oaze  there are many other islands lying some on the s w side others on the n and n e sides of this island as the island quicaro which is a pretty large island s w of quibo and on the north of it is a small island called the rancheria on which island are plenty of palmamaria trees the palmamaria is a tall straight bodied tree with a small head but very unlike the palm tree notwithstanding the name it is greatly esteemed for making masts being very tongh as well as of a good length for the grain of the wood runs not straight along it but twisting gardually about it these trees grow in many places of the west indies and are frequently used both by the english and spaniards there for that use the islands canales and cantarras are small islands lying on the n e of rancheria these have all channels to pass between and good anchoring about them and they are as well stored with trees and water as quibo sailing without them all they appear to be part of the main the island quibo is the largest and most noted for although the rest have names yet they are seldom used only for distinction sake these and the rest of this knot passing all under the common name of the keys of quibo captain swan gave to several of these islands the names of those english merchants and gentlemen who were owners of his ship  june   th captain swan came to an anchor by us and then our captains consulted about new methods to advance their fortunes and because they were now out of hopes to get any thing at sea they resolved to try what the land would afford they demanded of our pilots what towns on the coast of mexico they could carry us to the city of leon being the chiefest in the country any thing near us though a pretty way within land was pitched on but now we wanted canoas to land our men and we had no other way but to cut down trees and make as many as we had occasion for these islands affording plenty of large trees fit for our purpose while this was doing we sent   0 men to take puebla nova a town upon the main near the innermost of these islands to get provision it was in going to take this town that captain sawkins was killed in the year    0 who was succeeded by sharp our men took the town with much ease although there was more strength of men than when captain sawkins was killed they returned again the   th day but got no provision there they took an empty bark in their way and brought her to us  the  th day of july captain knight mentioned in my last chapter came to us he had been cruising a great way to the westward but got nothing beside a good ship at last he went to the southward as high as the bay of guiaquil where he took a barklog or pair of barklogs as we call it laden chiefly with flower she had other goods as wine oil brandy sugar soap and leather of goat skins and he took out as much of each as he had occasion for and then turned her away again the master of the float told him that the kings ships were gone from lima toward panama that they carried but half the kings treasure with them for fear of us although they had all the strength that the kingdom could afford that all the merchants ships which should have gone with them were laden and lying at payta where they were to wait for further orders captain knight having but few men did not dare to go to payta where if he had been better provided he might have taken them all but he made the best of his way into the bay of panama in hopes to find us there enriched with the spoils of the lima fleet but coming to the kings islands he had advice by a prisoner that we had engaged with their fleet but were worsted and since that made our way to the westward and therefore he came hither to seek us he presently consorted with us and set his men to work to make canoas every ships company made for themselves but we all helped each other to launch them for some were made a mile from the sea  the manner of making a canoa is after cutting down a large long tree and squaring the uppermost side and then turning it upon the flat side to shape the opposite side for the bottom then again they turn her and dig the inside boring also three holes in the bottom one before one in the middle and one abast thereby to gage the thickest of the bottom for otherwise we might cut the bottom thinner than is convenient we left the bottoms commonly about   inches thick and the sides   inches thick below and one and an half at the top one or both of the ends we sharpen to a point  capt davis made two very large canoas one was    foot long and   or   feet wide the other    foot long and near as wide as the other in a months time we finished our business and were ready to sail here capt harris went to lay his ship aground to clean her but she being old and rotten fell in pieces and therefore he and all his men went aboard of capt davis and capt swan while we lay here we struck turtle every day for they were now very plentiful but from august to march here are not many the   th day of july john rose a frenchman and    men more belonging to capt gronet having made a new canoa came in her to capt davis and desired to serve under him and capt davis accepted of them because they had a canoa of their own  the  0th day of july we sailed from quibo bending our course for ria lexa which is the port for leon the city that we now designed to attempt we were now   0 men in   sail of ships commanded by capt davis capt swan capt townley and capt knight with a fireship and three tenders which last had not a constant crew we past out between the river quibo and the rancheria leaving quibo and quicaro on our larboard side and the rancheria with the rest of the islands and the main on our starboard side the wind at first was at south south west we coasted along shore passing by the gulf of nicoya the gulf of dulce and by the island caneo all this coast is low land overgrown with thick woods and there are but few inhabitants near the shore as we sailed to the westward we had variable winds sometimes s w and at w s w and sometimes at e n e but we had them most commonly at s w we had a tornado or two every day and in the evening or in the night we had landwinds at n n e  the  th day of august being in the lat of    d  0 m by my observation we saw a high hill in the country towering up like a sugar loaf which bore n e by n we supposed it to be volcan vejo by the smoke which ascended from its top therefore we steered in north and made it plainer and then knew it to be that volcan which is the seamark for the harbor for ria lexa for as i said before in chapter the  th it is a very remarkable mountain when we had brought this mountain to bear n e we got out all our canoas and provided to embark into them the next day  the  th day in the morning being about   leagues from the shore we left our ships under the charge of a few men and   0 of us went away in    canoas towing toward the harbor of ria lexa we had fair weather and little wind till   a clock in the afternoon then we had a tornado from the shore with much thunder lightning and rain and such a gust of wind that we were all like to be foundred in this extremity we put right before the wind every canoas crew making what shift they could to avoid the threatening danger the small canoas being most light and buoyant mounted nimbly over the surges but the great heavy canoas lay like logs in the sea ready to be swallowed by every foaming billow some of our canoas were half full of water yet kept two men constantly heaving it out the fierceness of the wind continued about half an hour and abated by degrees and as the wind died away so the fury of the sea abated for in all hot countries as i have observed the sea is soon raised by the wind and as soon down again when the wind is gone and therefore it is a proverb among the seamen up wind up sea down wind down sea at   a clock in the evening it was quiet calm and the sea as smooth as a millpond then we tugged to get into the shore but finding we could not do it before day we rowed off again to keep our selves out of sight by that time it was day we were   leagues from the land which we thought was far enough off shore here we intended to lie till the evening but at   a clock in the afternoon we had another tornado more fierce than that which we had the day before this put us in greater peril of our lives but did not last so long as soon as the violence of the tornado was over we rowed in for the shore and entered the harbor in the night the creek which leads toward leon lies on the s e side of the harbor our pilot being very well acquainted here carried us into the mouth of it but could carry us no farther till day because it is but a small creek and there are other creeks like it the next morning as soon as it was light we rowed into the creek which is very narrow the land on both sides lying so low that every tide it is overflown with the sea this sort of land produces red mangrovetrees which are here so plentiful and thick that there is no passing through them beyond these mangroves on the firm land close by the side of the river the spaniards have built a brestwork purposely to hinder an enemy from the landing when we came in sight of the brestwork we rowed as fast as we could to get ashore the noise of our oars allarmed the indians who were set to watch and presently they ran away toward the city of leon to give notice of our approach we landed as soon as we could and marched after them   0 men were drawn out to march to the town and i was left with    men more to stay and guard the canoas till their return  the city of leon is  0 mile up in the country the way to it plain and even through a champion country of long grassy savannahs and spots of high woods about   mile from the landingplace there is a sugarwork   mile farther there is another and   mile beyond that there is a fine river to ford which is not very deep besides which there is no water in all the way till you come to an indian town which is   mile before you come to the city and from thence it is a pleasant straight sandy way to leon this city stands in a plain not far from a high pecked mountain which oftentimes casts forth fire and smoke from its top it may be seen at sea and it is called the volcan of leon the houses of leon are not high built but strong and large with gardens about them the walls are stone and the covering of pantile there are   churches and a cathedral which is the head church in these parts our countryman mr gage who traveled in these parts recommends it to the world as the pleasantest place in all america and calls it the paradise of the indies indeed if we consider the advantage of its situation we may find it surpassing most places for health and pleasure in america for the country about it is of a sandy soil which soon drinks up all the rain that falls to which these parts are much subject it is encompassed with savannahs so that they have the benefit of the breezes coming from any quarter all which makes it a very healthy place it is a place of no great trade and therefore not rich in money their wealth lies in their pastures and cattle and plantations of sugar it is said that they make cordage here of hemp but if they have any such manufactory it is at some distance from the town for here is no sign of any such thing  thither our men were now marching they went from the canoas about   a clock captain townley with  0 of the briskest men marched before captain swan with  00 men marched next and captain davis with   0 men marched next and captain knight brought up the rear captain townley who was near   mile a head of the rest met about  0 horsemen   mile before he came to the city but they never stood him about   a clock captain townley only with his  0 men entered the town and was briskly charged in a broad street with   0 or  00 spanish horsemen but   or   of their leaders being knocked down the rest fled their foot consisted of about  00 men which were drawn up in the parade for the spaniards in these parts make a large square in every town though the town it self be small the square is called the parade commonly the church makes one side of it and the gentlemens houses with their galleries about them the other but the foot also seeing their horse retire left an empty city to captain townley beginning to save themselves by flight captain swan came in about   a clock captain davis with his men about   and captain knight with as many men as he could encourage to march came in about   but he left many men tired on the road these as is usual came dropping in one or two at a time as they were able the next morning the spaniards killed one of our tired men he was a stout old greyheaded man aged about    who had served under oliver in the time of the irish rebellion after which he was at jamaica and had followed privateering ever since he would not accept of the offer our men made him to tarry ashore but said he would venture as far as the best of them and when surrounded by the spaniards he refused to take quarter but discharged his gun amongst them keeping a pistol still charged so they shot him dead at a distance his name was swan he was a very merry hearty old man and always used to declare he would never take quarter but they took mr smith who was tired also he was a merchant belonging to captain swan and being carried before the governor of leon was known by a mulatta woman that waited on him mr smith had lived many years in the canaries and could speak and write very good spanish and it was there this mulatta woman remembered him he being examined how many men we were said  000 at the city and  00 at the canoas which made well for us at the canoas who straggling about every day might easily have been destroyed but this so daunted the governor that he did never offer to molest our men although he had with him above  000 men as mr smith guessed he sent in a flag of truce about noon pretending to ransom the town rather than let it be burnt but our captains demanded  00000 pieces of eight for its ransom and as much provision as would victual  000 men   months and mr smith to be ransomed for some of their prisoners but the spaniards did not intend to ransom the town but only capitulated day after day to prolong time till they had got more men our captains therefore considering the distance that they were from the canoas resolved to be marching down the   th day in the morning they ordered the city to be set on fire which was presently done and then they came away but they took more time in coming down than in going up the   th day in the morning the spaniards sent in mr smith and had a gentlewoman in exchange then our captains sent a letter to the governor to acquaint him that they intended next to visit ria lexa and desired to meet him there they also released a gentleman on his promise of paying   0 beefs for his ransom and to deliver them to us at ria lexa and the same day our men came to their canoas where having staid all night the next morning we all entered our canoas and came to the harbor of ria lexa and in the afternoon our ships came thither to an anchor  the creek that leads to ria lexa lies from the n w part of the harbor and it runs in northerly it is about   leagues from the island in the harbors mouth to the town two thirds of the way it is broad then you enter a narrow deep creek bordered on both sides with red mangrove trees whose limbs reach almost from one side to the other a mile from the mouth of the creek it turns away west there the spaniards have made a very strong brestwork fronting toward the mouth of the creek in which were placed  00 soldiers to hinder us from landing and  0 yards below that brestwork there was a chain of great trees placed cross the creek so that  0 men could have kept off  00 or  000  when we came in sight of the brestwork we fired but two guns and they all run away and we were afterward near half an hour cutting the boom or chain here we landed and marched to the town of ria lexa or rea lejo which is about a mile from hence this town stands on a plain by a small river it is a pretty large town with   churches and an hospital that has a fine garden belonging to it besides many large fair houses they all stand at a good distance one from another with yards about them this is a very sickly place and i believe has need enough of an hospital for it is seated so nigh the creeks and swamps that it is never free from a noisome smell the land about it is a strong yellow clay yet where the town stands it seems to be sand here are several sort of fruits as guavos pineapples melons and pricklepears the pineapple and melon are well known  the guavafruit grows on a hard scrubbed shrub whose bark is smooth and whitish the branches pretty long and small the leaf somewhat like the leaf of hazel the fruit much like a pear with a thin rind it is full of small hard seeds and it may be eaten while it is green which is a thing very rare in the indies for most fruit both in the east or west indies is full of clammy white unsavory juice before it is ripe though pleasant enough afterward when this fruit is ripe it is yellow soft and very pleasant it bakes as well as a pear and it may be coddled and it makes good pies there are of diverse sorts different in shape taste and color the inside of some is yellow of others red when this fruit is eaten green it is binding when ripe it is loosening  the pricklepear bush or shrub of about   or   foot high grows in many places of the west indies as at jamaica and most other islands there and on the main in several places this prickly shrub delights most in barren sandy grounds and they thrive best in places that are near the sea especially where the sand is saltish the tree or shrub is   or   foot high spreading forth several branches and on each branch   or   leaves these leaves if i may call them so are round as broad every way as the palm of a mans hand and as thick their substance like houseleek these leaves are fenced round with strong prickles above an inch long the fruit grows at the farther edge of the leaf it is as big as a large plumb growing small near the leaf and big toward the top where it opens like a medlar this fruit at first is green like the leaf from whence it springs with small prickles about it but when ripe it is of a deep red color the inside is full of small black seeds mixed with a certain red pulp like thick syrup it is very pleasant in taste cooling and refreshing but if a man eats    or  0 of them they will color his water making it look like blood this i have often experienced yet found no harm by it  there are many sugarworks in the country and estantions or beef farms there is also a great deal of pitch tar and cordage made in the country which is the chief of their trade this town we approached without any opposition and found nothing but empty houses besides such things as they could not or would not carry away which were chiefly about  00 packs of flower brought hither in the great ship that we left at amapalla and some pitch tar and cordage these things we wanted and therefore we sent them all aboard here we received   0 beefs promised by the gentleman that was released coming from leon besides we visited the beeffarms every day and the sugarworks going in small companies of  0 or  0 men and brought away every man his load for we found no horses which if we had yet they ways were so wet and dirty that they would not have been serviceable to us we stayed here from the   th till the   th day and then some of our destructive crew set fire to the houses i know not by whose order but we marched away and left them burning at the brestwork we embarked into our canoas and returned aboard our ships  the   th day capt davis and capt swan broke off consortship for capt davis was minded to return again on the coast of peru but capt swan desired to go farther to the westward i had till this time been with capt davis but now left him and went aboard of capt swan it was not from any dislike to my old captain but to get some knowledge of the northern parts of this continent of mexico and i knew that capt swan determined to coast it as far north as he thought convenient and then pass over for the east indies which was a way very agreeable to my inclination capt townley with his two barks was resolved to keep us company but capt knight and capt harris followed captain davis the   th day in the morning capt davis with his ships went out of the harbor having a fresh land wind they were in company capt daviss ship with capt harris in her capt daviss bark and fireship and capt knight in his own ship in all   sail capt swan took his last farewell of him by firing    guns and he fired    in return of the civility  we stayed here some time afterward to fill our water and cut firewood but our men who had been very healthy till now began to fall down apace in fevers whether it was the badness of the water or the unhealthiness of the town was the cause of it we did not know but of the two i rather believe it was a distemper we got at ria lexa for it was reported that they had been visited with a malignant fever in that town which had occasioned many people to abandon it and although this visitation was over with them yet their houses and goods might still retain somewhat of the infection and communicate the same to us  i the rather believe this because it afterward raged very much not only among us but also among capt davis and his men as he told me himself since when i met him in england himself had like to have died as did several of his and our men the  d day of september we turned ashore all our prisoners and pilots they being unacquainted further to the west which was the coast that we designed to visit for the spaniards have very little trade by sea beyond the river lempa a little to the north west of this place  about  0 a clock in the morning the same day we went from hence steering westward being in company   sail as well as they who left us viz captain swan and his bark and capt townley and his bark and about   0 men  we met with very bad weather as we sailed along this coast seldom a day past but we had one or two violent tornadoes and with them very frightful flashes of lightnings and claps of thunder i did never meet with the like before nor since these tornadoes commonly came out of the n e the wind did not last long but blew very fierce for the time when the tornadoes were over we had the wind at w sometimes at w s w and s w and sometimes to the north of the west as far as the n w  we kept at a good distance off shore and saw no land till the   th day but then being in lat    d  0 m the volcan of guatimala appeared in sight this is a very high mountain with two peeks or heads appearing like two sugarloaves it often belches forth flames of fire and smoke from between the two heads and this as the spaniards do report happens chiefly in tempestuous weather it is called so from the city guatimala which stands near the foot of it about   leagues from the south sea and by report  0 or  0 leagues from the gulf of matique in the bay of honduras in the north seas this city is famous for many rich commodities that are produced thereabouts some almost peculiar to this country and yearly sent into europe especially   rich dies indico otta or anatta silvester and cochineel  indico is made of an herb which grows a foot and half or two foot high full of small branches and the branches full of leaves resembling the leaves which grow on flax but more thick and substantial they cut this herb or shrub and cast it into a large cistern made in the ground for that purpose which is half full of water the indico stalk or herb remains in the water till all the leaves and i think the skin rind or bark rot off and in a manner dissolve but if any of the leaves should stick fast they force them off by much labor tossing and tumbling the mass in the water till all the pulpy substance is dissolved then the shrub or woody part is taken out and the water which is like ink being disturbed no more settles and the indico falls to the bottom of the cistern like mud when it is thus settled they draw off the water and take the mud and lay it in the sun to dry which there becomes hard as you see it brought home  otta or anatta is a red sort of dye it is made of a red flower that grows on shrubs   or   foot high it is thrown into a cistern of water as the indico is but with this difference that there is no stalk nor so much as the head of the flower but only the flower it self pulled off from the head as you peel roseleaves from the bud this remains in the water till it rots and by much jumbling it dissolves to a liquid substance like the indico and being settled and the water drawn off the red mud is made up into rolls or cakes and laid in the sun to dry i did never see any made but at a place called the angels in jamaica at sir tho muddifords plantations about  0 years since but was grubbd up while i was there and the ground otherwise employed i do believe there is none any where else on jamaica and even this probably was owing to the spaniards when they had that island indico is common enough in jamaica i observed they planted it most in sandy ground they sow great fields of it and i think they sow it every year but i did never see the seeds it bears indico is produced all over the west indies on most of the caribbe islands as well as the main yet no part of the main yields such great quantities both of indico and otta as this country about guatimala i believe that otta is made now only by the spaniards for since the destroying that at the angels plantation in jamaica i have not heard of any improvement made of this commodity by our countrymen any where and as to jamaica i have since been informed that it is wholly left off there i know not what quantities either of indico or otta are made at cuba or hispaniola but the place most used by our jamaica sloops for these things is the island porto rico where our jamaica traders did use to buy indico for   rials and otta for   rials the pound which is but   s   d of our money and yet at the same time otta was worth in jamaica   s the pound and indico   s   d the pound and even this also paid in goods by which means alone they got  0 or  0 per cent our traders had not then found the way of trading with the spaniards in the bay of honduras but captain coxon went thither as i take it at the beginning of the year      under pretense to cut logwood and went into the gulf of matique which is in the bottom of that bay there he landed with his canoas and took a whole storehouse full of indico and otta in chests piled up in several parcels and marked with different marks ready to be shipped off aboard two ships that then lay in the road purposely to take it in but these ships could not come at him it being sholewater he opened some of the chests of indico and supposing the other chests to be all of the same species ordered his men to carry them away they immediately set to work and took the nearest at hand and having carried out one heap of chests they seized on another great pile of a different mark from the rest intending to carry them away next but a spanish gentleman their prisoner knowing that there was a great deal more than they could carry away desired them to take only such as belonged to the merchants whose marks he undertook to show them and to spare such as had the same mark with those in that great pile they were then entering upon because he said those chests belonged to the ship captains who following the seas as themselves did he hoped they would for that reason rather spare their goods than the merchants they consented to his request but upon their opening their chests which was not before they came to jamaica whereby connivance they were permitted to sell them they found that the don had been to sharp for them the few chests which they had taken of the same mark with the great pile proving to be otto of greater value by far than the other whereas they might as well have loaded the whole ship with otto as with indico  the cochineel is an insect bred in a sort of fruit much like the pricklepear the tree or shrub that bears it is like the pricklepear tree about   foot high and so prickly only the leaves are not quite so big but the fruit is bigger on the top of the fruit there grows a red flower this flower when the fruit is ripe falls down on the top of the fruit which then begins to open and covers it so that no rain nor dew can wet the inside the next day or two days after its falling down the flower being then scorched away by the heat of the sun the fruit opens as broad as the mouth of a pint pot and the inside of the fruit is by this time sull of small red insects with curious thin wings as they were bred here so here they would die for want of food and rot in their husks having by this time eaten up their mother fruit did not the indians who plant large fields of these trees when once they perceive the fruit open take care to drive them out for they spread under the branches of the tree a large linen cloth and then with sticks they shake the branches and so disturb the poor insects that they take wing to be gone yet hovering still over the head of their native tree but the heat of the sun so disorders them that they presently fall down dead on the cloth spread for that purpose where the indians let them remain   or   days longer till they are thoroughly dry when they fly up they are red when they fall down they are black and when first they are quite dry they are white as the sheet wherein they lie though the color change a little after these yield the much esteemed scarlet the cochineeltrees are called by the spaniard toonas they are planted in the country about guatimala and about cheap and guaxaca all   in the kingdom of mexico the silvester is a red grain growing in a fruit much resembling the cochineelfruit as does also the tree that bears it there first shoots forth a yellow flower then comes the fruit which is longer than the cochineel fruit the fruit being ripe opens also very wide the inside being full of these small seeds or grains they fall out with the least touch or shake the indians that gather them hold a dish under to receive the seed and then shake it down these trees grow wild and   or  0 of these fruits will yield an ounce of seed but of the cochineelfruits   or   will yield an ounce of insects the silvester gives a color almost as fair as the cochineel and so like it as to be often mistaken for it but it is not near so valuable i often made enquiry how the silvester grows and of the cochineel but was never fully satisfied till i met a spanish gentleman that had lived  0 years in the west indies and some years where these grow and from him i had these relations he was a very intelligent person and pretended to be well acquainted in the bay of campeachy therefore i examined him in many particulars concerning that bay where i was well acquainted my self living there   years he gave very true and pertinent answers to all my demands so that i could have no distrust of what he related  when we first saw the mountain of guatimala we were by judgment    leagues distance from it as we came nearer the land it appeared higher and plainer yet we saw no fire but a little smoke proceeding from it the land by the sea was of a good height yet but low in comparison with that in the country the sea for about   or  0 leagues from the shore was full of floating trees or driftwood as it is called of which i have seen a great deal but no where so much as here and pumicestones floating which probably are thrown out of the burning mountains and washed down to the shore by the rains which are very violent and frequent in this country and on the side of honduras it is excessively wet  the   th day we were in lat    d  0 m north and the weather more settled then captain townley took with him  0  men in   canoas and went away to the westward where he intended to land and romage in the country for some refreshment for our sick men we having at this time near half our men sick and many were dead since we left ria lexa we in the ships lay still with our topsails furled and our corses or lower sails haled up this day and the next that captain townley might get the start of us  the   th day we made sail again coasting to the westward having the wind at north and fair weather we ran along by a tract of very high land which came from the eastward more within land than we could see after we fell in with it it bare us company for about  0 leagues and ended with a pretty gentle descent toward the west  there we had a perfect view of a pleasant low country which seemed to be rich in pasturage for cattle it was plentifully furnished with groves of green trees mixed among the grassy savannahs here the land was fenced from the sea with high sandy hills for the waves all along this coast run high and beat against the shore very boisterously making the land wholly unapproachable in boats or canoas so we coasted still along by this low land   or   leagues farther keeping close to the shore for fear of missing captain townley we lay by in the night and in the day made an easy sail  the  d day of october captain townley came aboard he had coasted along shore in his canoas seeking for an entrance but found none at last being out of hopes to find any bay creek or river into which he might safely enter he put ashore on a sandy bay but overset all his canoas he had one man drowned and several lost all their arms and some of them that had not waxt up their cartrage or catouche boxes wet all their powder captain townley with much ado got ashore and dragged the canoas up dry on the bay then every man searched his catouchebox and drew the wet powder out of his gun and provided to march into the country but finding it full of great creeks which they could not ford they were forced to return again to their canoas in the night they made good fires to keep themselves warm the next morning  00 spaniards and indians fell on them but were immediately repulsed and made greater speed back than they had done forward captain townley followed them but not far for fear of his canoas these men came from teguantapeque a town that captain townley went chiefly to seek because the spanish books make mention of a large river there but whether it was run away at this time or rather captain townley and his men were shortsighted i know not but they could not find it  upon his return we presently made sail coasting still westward having the wind at e n e fair weather and a fresh gale we kept within   mile of the shore sounding all the way and found at   miles distance from land    fathom at   miles distance    fathom gross sand we saw no opening nor sign of any place to land at so we sailed about  0 leagues farther and came to a small high island called tangola were there is good anchoring the island is indifferently well furnished with wood and water and lies about a league from the shore the main against the island is pretty high champion savannah land by the sea but   or   leagues within land it is higher and very woody  we coasted a league farther and came to guatulco this port is in lat    d  0 m it is one of the best in all this kingdom of mexico near a mile from the mouth of the harbor on the east side there is a little island close by the shore and on the west side of the mouth of the harbor there is a great hollow rock which by the continual working of the sea in and out makes a great noise which may be heard a great way every surge that comes in forces the water out of a little hole on its top as out of a pipe from whence it flies out just like the blowing of a whale to which the spaniards also liken it they call this rock and spout the buffadore upon what account i know not even in the calmest seasons the sea beats in there making the water spout out at the hole so that this is always a good mark to find the harbor by the harbor is about   mile deep and one mile broad it runs in n w but the west side of the harbor is best to ride in for small ships for there you may ride landlocked whereas any where else you are open to the s w winds which often blow here there is good clean ground any where and good gradual soundings from    to   fathom it is bounded with a smooth sandy shore very good to land at and at the bottom of the harbor there is a fine brook of fresh water running into the sea here formerly stood a small spanish town or village which was taken by sir francis drake but now there is nothing remaining of it beside a little chapel standing among the trees about  00 paces from the sea the land appears in small short ridges parallel to the shore and to each other the innermost still gradually higher than that nearer the shore and they are all clothed with very high flourishing trees that it is extraordinary pleasant and delightful to behold at a distance i have no where seen any thing like it  at this place captain swan who had been very sick came ashore and all the sick men with him and the surgeon to tend them captain townley again took a company of men with him and went into the country to seek for houses or inhabitants he marched away to the eastward and came to the river capalita which is a swift river yet deep near the mouth and is about a league from guatulco there   of his men swam over the river and took   indians that were placed there as sentinels to watch for our coming these could none of them speak spanish yet our men by signs made them understand that they desired to know if there was any town or village near who by the signs which they made gave our men to understand that they could guide them to a settlement but there was no understanding by them whether it was a spanish or indian settlement nor how far it was thither they brought these indians aboard with them and the next day which was the  th day of october captain townley with   0 men of whom i was one went ashore again taking one of these indians with us for a guide to conduct us to to this settlement our men that stayed aboard filled our water and cut wood and mended our sails and our moskito men struck   or   turtle every day they were a small sort of turtle and not very sweet yet very well esteemed by us all because we had eaten no flesh a great while the  th day we returned out of the country having been about  miles directly within land before we came to any settlement there we found a small indian village and in it a great quantity of vinellos drying in the sun  the vinello is a little cod full of small black seeds it is   or   inches long about the bigness of the stem of a tobacco leaf and when dried much resembling it so that our privateers at first have often thrown them away when they took any wondering why the spaniards should lay up tobacco stems this cod grows on a small vine which climbs about and supports it self by the neighboring trees it first bears a yellow flower from whence the cod afterward proceeds it is first green but when ripe it turns yellow then the indians whose manufacture it is and who sell it cheap to the spaniards gather it and lay it in the sun which makes it soft then it changes to a chestnut color then they frequently press it between their fingers which makes it flat if the indians do any thing to them beside i know not but i have seen the spaniards sleek them with oil  these vines grow plentifully at boccatoro where i have gathered and tried to cure them but could not which makes me think that the indians have some secret that i know not of to cure them i have often asked the spaniards how they were cured but i never could meet with any could tell me one mr cree also a very curious person who spoke spanish well and had been a privateer all his life and   years a prisoner among the spaniards at portobel and cartagena yet upon all his enquiry could not find any of them that understood it could we have learnt the art of it several of us would have gone to boccatoro yearly at the dry season and cured them and freighted our vessel we there might have had turtle enough for food and store of vinellos mr cree first showed me those at boccatoro at or near a town also called caihooca in the bay of campeachy these cods are found they are commonly sold for   pence a cod among the spaniards in the west indies and are sold by the druggist for they are much used among chocolate to perfume it some will use them among tobacco for it gives a delicate scent i never heard of any vinellos but here in this country about caihooca and at boccatoro  the indians of this village could speak but little spanish they seemed to be a poor innocent people and by them we understood that here are very few spaniards in these parts yet all the indians hereabout are under them the land from the sea to their houses is black earth mixed with some stones and rocks all the way full of very high trees  the  0th day we sent   canoas to the westward who were ordered to lie for us at port angels where we were in hopes that by some means or other they might get prisoners that might give us a better account of the country than at present we could have and we followed them with our ships all our men being now pretty well recovered of the fever which had raged amongst us ever since we departed from ria

ill success on the mexican coast and departure thence for the east indies  it was the   th of october      when we set out of the harbor of guatulco with our ships the land here lies along west and a little southerly for about  0 or  0 leagues and the seawinds are commonly at w s w sometimes at s w the landwinds at n we had now fair weather and but little wind we coasted along to the westward keeping as near the shole as we could for the benefit of the landwinds for the seawinds were right against us and we found a current setting to the eastward which kept us back and obliged us to anchor at the island sacrificio which is a small green island about half a mile long it lies about a league to the west of guatulco and about half a mile from the main there seems to be a fine bay to the west of the island but it is full of rocks the best riding is between the island and the main there you will have   or   fathom water here runs a pretty strong tide the sea rises and falls   or   foot up and down  the   th day we sailed from hence coasting to the westward after our canoas we kept near the shore which was all sandy bays the country pretty high and woody and a great sea tumbling in upon the shore the   d day   of our canoas came aboard and told us they had been a great way to the westward but could not find port angels they had attempted to land the day before at a place where they saw a great many bulls and cows feeding in hopes to get some of them but the sea run so high that they overset both canoas and wet all their arms and lost   guns and had one man drowned and with much ado got off again they could give no account of the other   canoas for they lost company the first night that they went from guatulco and had not seen them since  we were now abrest of port angels though our men in the canoas did not know it therefore we went in and anchored there this is a broad open bay with   or   rocks at the west side here is good anchoring all over the bay in  0 or  0 or    fathom water but you must ride open to all winds except the landwinds till you come into    or    fathom water then you are sheltered from the w s w which are the common tradewinds the tide rises here about   foot the flood sets to the n e and the ebb to the s w the landing in this bay is bad the place of landing is close by the west side behind a few rocks here always goes a great swell the spaniards compare this harbor for goodness to guatulco but there is a great difference between them for cuatulco is almost landlocked and this an open road and no one would easily know it by their character of it but by its marks and its latitude which is    d north for this reason our canoas which were sent from guatulco and ordered to tarry here for us did not know it not thinking this to be that fine harbor and therefore went farther  of them as i said before returned again but the other   were not yet come to us the land that bounds this harbor is pretty high the earth sandy and yellow in some places red it is partly woodland partly savannahs the trees in the woods are large and tall and the savannahs are plentifully stored with very kindly grass two leagues to the east of this place is a beef farm belonging to don diego de la rosa  the    day we landed about  00 men and marched thither where we found plenty of of fat bulls and cows feeding in the savannahs and in the house good store of salt and maiz and some hogs and cocks and hens but the owners or overseers were gone we lay here   or   days feasting on fresh provision but could not contrive to carry any quantity aboard because the way was so long and our men but weak and a great wide river to ford therefore we returned again from thence the   th day and brought every one a little beef or pork for the men that stayed aboard the two nights that we stayed ashore at this place we heard great droves of jaccals as we supposed them to be barking all night long not far from us none of us saw these but i do verily believe they were jaccals though i did never see those creatures in america nor hear any but at this time we could not think that there were less than  0 or  0 in a company we got aboard in the evening but did not yet hear any news of our two canoas  the   th day in the morning we sailed from hence with the landwind at n by w the seawind came about noon at w s w and in the evening we anchored in    fathom water by a small rocky island which lies about half a mile from the main and   leagues westward from port angels the spaniards give no account of this island in their pilotbook the   th day we sailed again with the landwind in the afternoon the seabreez blew hard and we sprung our main topmast this coast is full of small hills and valleys and a great sea falls in upon the shore in the night we met with the other two of our canoas that went from us at guatulco they had been as far as acapulco to seek port angels coming back from thence they went into a river to get water and were encountered by   0 spaniards yet they filled their water in spite of them but had one man shot through the thigh afterward they went into a lagune or lake of salt water where they found much dried fish and brought some aboard we being now abrest of that place sent in a canoa manned with    men for more fish the mouth of this lagune is not pistolshotwide and on both sides are pretty high rocks so conveniently placed by nature that many men may abscond behind and within the rock and lagune opens wide on both sides the spaniards being alarmed by our two canoas that had been there two or three days before came armed to this place to secure their fish and seeing our canoa coming they lay snug behind the rocks and suffered the canoa to pass in then they fired their volley and wounded five of our men our people were a little surprised at this sudden adventure yet fired their guns and rowed farther into the lagune for they durst not adventure to come out again through the narrow entrance which was near a quarter of a mile in length therefore they rowed into the middle of the lagune where they lay out of gunshot and looked about to see if there was not another passage to get out at broader than that by which we entered but could see none so they lay still two days and three nights in hopes that we should come to seek them but we lay off at sea about three leagues distant waiting for their return supposing by their long absence that they had made some greater discovery and were gone farther than the fishrange because it is usual with privateers when they enter upon such designs to search farther than they proposed if they meet any encouragement but capt townley and his bark being nearer the shore heard some guns fired in the lagune so he manned his canoa and went toward the shore and beating the spaniards away from the rocks made a free passage for our men to come out of their pound where else they must have been starved or knocked on the head by the spaniards they came aboard their ships again the   st of october this lagune is about the lat of    d  0 m north  from hence we made sail again coasting to the westward having fair weather and a current setting to the west the second day of november we past by a rock called by the spaniards the algatross the land hereabout is of an indifferent height and woody and more within the country mountainous here are   or   white cliffs by the sea which are very remarkable because there are none so white and so thick together on all the coast they are five or six mile to the west of the algatross rock there is a dangerous shoal lies s by w from these cliffs four or five mile off at sea two leagues to the west of these cliffs there is a pretty large river which forms a small island at its mouth the channel on the east side is but shoal and sandy but the west channel is deep enough for canoas to enter on the banks of this channel the spaniards have made a brestwork to hinder an enemy from landing or filling water  the  d day we anchored abrest of this river in    fathom water about a mile and a half off shore the next morning we manned our canoas and went ashore to the brestwork with little resistance although there were about  00 men to keep us off they fired about  0 or  0 guns at us but seeing we were resolved to land they quitted the place one chief reason why the spaniards are so frequently routed by us although many times much our superiors in numbers and in many places fortified with brestworks is their want of small firearms for they have but few on all the sea coasts unless near their larger garrisons here we found a great deal of salt brought hither as i judge for to salt fish which they take in the lagunes the fish i observed here mostly were what we call snooks neither a seafish nor fresh waterfish but very numerous in these salt lakes this fish is about a foot long and round and as thick as the small of a mans leg with a pretty long head it has scales of a whitish color and is good meat how the spaniards take them i know not for we never found any nets hooks or lines neither yet any bark boat or canoa among them on all this coast except the ship i shall mention at acapulco  we marched two or three leagues into the country and met with but one house where we took a mulatto prisoner who informed us of a ship that was lately arrived at acapulco she came from lima captain townley wanting a good ship thought now he had an opportunity of getting one if he could persuade his men to venture with him into the harbor of acapulco and fetch this lima ship out therefore he immediately proposed it and found not only all his own men willing to assist him but many of captain swans men also captain swan opposed it because provision being scares with us he thought our time might be much better employed in first providing our selves with rood and here was plenty of maiz in the river where we now were as we were informed by the same prisoner who offered to conduct us to the place where it was but neither the present necessity nor captain swans persuasion availed any thing no nor yet their own interest for the great design we had then in hand was to lie and wait for a rich ship which comes to acapulco every year richly laden from the philippine islands but it was necessary we should be well stored with provisions to enable us to cruise about and wait the time of her coming however townleys party prevailing we only filled our water here and made ready to be gone so the fifth day in the afternoon we sailed again coasting to the westward toward acapulco the  th day in the afternoon being about twelve leagues from the shore we saw the high land of acapulco which is very remarkable for there is a round hill standing between two other hills the westermost of which is the biggest and highest and has two hillocks like two paps on its top the eastermost hill is higher and sharper than the middlemost from the middle hill the land declines toward the sea ending in a high round point there is no land shaped like this on all the coast in the evening captain townley went away from the ships with   0 men in    canoas to try to get the lima ship out of acapulco harbor  acapulco is a pretty large town    degrees north of the equator it is the seaport for the city of mexico on the west side of the continent as la vera cruz or st john d ulloa in the bay of nova hispania is on the north side this town is the only place of trade on all this coast for there is little or no traffic by sea on all the n w part of this vast kingdom here being as i have said neither boats barks nor ships that i could ever see unless only what come hither from other parts and some boats near the s e end of california as i guess by the intercourse between that and the main for pearlfishing  the ships that trade hither are only three two that constantly go once a year between this and manila in luconia one of the philippine islands and one ship more every year to and from lima this from lima commonly arrives a little before christmas she brings them quicksilver cacao and pieces of eight here she stays till the manila ships arrive and then takes in a cargo of spices silks callicoes and muslins and other east india commodities for the use of peru and then returns to lima this is but a small vessel of  0 guns but the two manila ships are each said to be above  000 tun these make their voyages alternately so that one or other of them is always at the manilas when either of them sets out from acapulco it is at the latter end of march or the beginning of april she always touches to refresh at guam one of the ladrone islands in about  0 days space after she sets out there she stays but two or three days and then prosecutes her voyage to manila where she commonly arrives some time in june by that time the other is ready to sail from thence laden with east india commodities she stretches away to the north as far as    or sometimes into  0 degrees of north lat before she gets a wind to stand over to the american shore she falls in first with the coast of california and then coasts along the shore to the south again and never misses a wind to bring her away from thence quite to acapulco when she gets the length of cape st lucas which is the southermost point of california she stretches over to cape corientes which is in about the  0th degree of north lat from thence she coasts along till she comes to sallagua and there she sets ashore passengers that are bound to the city of mexico from thence she makes her best way coasting still along shore till she arrives at acapulco which is commonly about christmas never more than   or  0 days before or after upon the return of this ship to the manila the other which stays there till her arrival takes her turn back to acapulco sir john narborough therefore was imposed on by the spaniards who told him that there were   sail or more that used this trade  the port of acapulco is very commodious for the reception of ships and so large that some hundreds may safely ride there without damnifying each other there is a small low island crossing the mouth of the harbor it is about a mile and a half long and half a mile broad stretching east and west it leaves a good wide deep channel at each end where ships may safely go in or come out taking the advantage of the winds they must enter with the seawind and go out with the landwind for these winds seldom or never fail to succeed each other alternately in their proper season of the day or night the westermost channel is the narrowest but so deep there is no anchoring and the manila ships pass in that way but the ships from lima enter on the s w channel this harbor runs in north about   miles then growing very narrow it turns short about to the west and runs about a mile farther where it ends the town stands on the n w side at the mouth of this narrow passage close by the sea and at the end of the town there is a platform with a great many guns opposite to the town on the east side stands a high strong castle said to have  0 guns of a very great bore ships commonly ride near the bottom of the harbor under the command both of the castle and the platform  captain townly who as i said before with   0 men left our ships on a design to fetch the lima ship out of the harbor had not rowed above   or   leagues before the voyage was like to end with all their lives for on a sudden they were encountered with a violent tornado from the shore which had like to have foundered all the canoas but they escaped that danger and the second night got safe into port marquis port marquis is a very good harbor a league to the east of acapulco harbor here they staid all the next day to dry themselves their clothes their arms and ammunition and the next night they rowed softly into acapulco harbor and because they would not be heard they haled in their oars and paddled as softly as if they had been seeking manatee they paddled close to the castle then struck over to the town and found the ship riding between the brestwork and the fort within about  00 yards of each when they had well viewed her and considered the danger of the design they thought it not possible to accomplish it therefore they paddled softly back again till they were out of command of the forts and then they went to land and fell in among a company of spanish soldiers for the spaniards having seen them the day before had set guards along the coast who immediately fired at them but did them no damage only made them retire farther from the shore they lay afterward at the mouth of the harbor till it was day to take a view of the town and castle and then returned aboard again being tired hungry and sorry for their disappointment  the   th day we made sail again further on to the westward with the land wind which is commonly at n e but the sea winds are at s w we passed by a long sandy bay of above  0 leagues all the way along it the sea falls with such force on the shore that it is impossible to come near it with boat or canoa yet it is good clean ground and good anchoring a mile or two from the shore the land by the sea is low and indifferent fertile producing many sorts of trees especially the spreading  which grows in spots from one end of the bay to the other  the p tree is as big as an ordinary ash growing about  0 or  0 foot high the body is clear from boughs or branches till just at the head there it spreads forth many large green branches not much unlike the cabbage tree before described these branches also grow in many places as in jamaica darien the bay of campeachy etc from a stump not above a foot or two high which is not the remains of a tree cut down for none of these sort of trees will ever grow again when they have once lost their head but these are a sort of dwarfpalm and the branches which grow from the stump are not so large as those that grow on the great tree these smaller branches are used both in the east and west indies for thatching houses they are very lasting and serviceable much surpassing the palmeto for this thatch if well laid on will endure five or six years and this is called by the spaniards the palmeto royal the english at jamaica give it the same name whether this be the same which they in guinea get the palm wine from i know not but i know that it is like this  the land in the country is full of small pecked barren hills making as many little valleys which appear flourishing and green at the west end of this bay is the hill of petaplan in lat    d  0 m n this is a round point stretching out into the sea at a distance it seems to be an island a little to the west of this hill are several round rocks which we left without us steering in between them and the round point where we had    fathom water we came to an anchor on the n w side of the hill and went ashore about   0 men of us and marched into the country    or    miles there we came to a poor indian village that did not afford us a meal of victuals the people all fled only a mulatto woman and three or four small children who were taken and brought aboard she told us that a carrier one who drives a caravan of mules was goin to acapulco laden with flower and other goods but stopped in the road for fear of us a little to the west of this village for he had heard of our being on this coast and she thought he still remained there and therefore it was we kept the woman to be our guide to carry us to that place at this place where we now lay our moskitomen struck some small turtle and many small jewfish  the jewfish is a very good fish and i judge so called by the english because it has scales and fins therefore a clean fish according to the levitical law and the jews at jamaica buy them and eat them very freely it is a very large fish shaped much like a cod but a great deal bigger one will weigh   or   or   hundred weight it has a large head with great fins and scales as big as an halfcrown answerable to the bigness of his body it is very sweet meat and commonly fat this fish lives among rocks there are plenty of them in the west indies about jamaica and the coast of caraccos but chiefly in these seas especially more westward  we went from hence with our ships the   th day and steered west about two leagues farther to a place called chequetan a mile and half from the shore there is a small key and within it is a very good harbor where ships may careen there is also a small river of fresh water and wood enough  the   th day in the morning we went with    men in six canoas to seek for the carrier taking the mulattowoman for our guide but captain townley would not go with us before day we landed at a place called estapa a league to the west of chequeton the woman was well acquainted here having been often at this place for muscles as she told us for here are great plenty of them they seem in all respects like our english muscles she carried us through the pathless wood by the side of a river for about a league then we came into a savannah full of bulls and cows and here the carrier beforementioned was lying at the estantionhouse with his mules not having dared to advance all this while as not knowing where we lay so his own fear made him his mules and all his goods become a prey to us he had  0 packs of flower some chocolate a great many small cheeses and abundance of earthen ware the eatables we brought away but the earthen vessels we had no occasion for and therefore left them the mules were about  0 we brought our prize with them to the shore and so turned them away here we also killed some cows and brought with us to our canoas in the afternoon our ships came to an anchor half a mile from the place where we landed and then we went aboard captain townley seeing our good success went ashore with his men to kill some cows for here were no inhabitants near to oppose us the land is very woody of a good fertile soil watered with many small rivers yet it has but few inhabitants near the sea capt townley killed    beefs and after he came aboard our men contrary to captain swans inclination gave capt townley part of the flower which we took ashore afterward we gave the woman some clothes for her and her children and put her and two of them ashore but one of them a very pretty boy about   or   years old capt swan kept the woman cried and begged hard to have him but capt swan would not but promised to make much of him and was as good as his word he proved afterward a very fine boy for wit courage and dexterity i have often wondered at his expressions and actions  the   st day in the evening we sailed hence with the landwind the landwinds on this part of the coast are at n and the seawinds at w s w we had fair weather and coasted along to the westward the land is high and full of ragged hills and west from these ragged hills the land makes many pleasant and fruitful valleys among the mountains the   th day we were abrest of a very remarkable hill which towering above the rest of its fellows is divided in the top and makes two small parts it is in lat    d   m north the spaniards make mention of a town called thelupan near this hill which we would have visited if we could have found the way to it the   th day captain swan and capt townley with  00 men of whom i was one went in our canoas to seek for the city of colima a rich place by report but how far within land i could never learn for as i said before here is no trade by sea and therefore we could never get guides to inform us or conduct us to any town but one or two on this coast and there is never a town that lies open to the sea but acapulco and therefore our search was commonly fruitless as now for we rowed above  0 leagues along shore and found it a very bad coast to land we saw no house nor sign of inhabitants although we past by a fine valley called the valley of maguella only at two places the one at our first setting out on this expedition and the other at the end of it we saw a horseman set as we supposed as a sentinel to watch us at both places we landed with difficulty and at each place we followed the track of the horse on the sandy bay but where they entered the woods we lost the track and although we diligently searched for it yet we could find it no more so we were perfectly at a loss to find out the houses or town they came from the   th day being tired and hopeless to find any town we went aboard our ships that were now come abrest of the place where we were for always when we leave our ships we either order a certain place of meeting or else leave them a sign to know where we are by making one or more great smoaks yet we had all like to have been ruined by such a signal as this in a former voyage under captain sharp when we made that unfortunate attempt upon arica which is mentioned in the history of the buccaneers for upon the routing our men and taking several of them some of those so taken told the spaniards that it was agreed between them and their companions on board to make two great smoaks at a distance from each other as soon as the town should be taken as a signal to the ship that it might safely enter the harbor the spaniards made these smoaks presently i was then among those who staid on board and whether the signal was not so exactly made or some other discouragement happened i remember not but we forbore going in till we saw our scattered crew coming off in their canoas had we entered the port upon the false signal we must have been taken or sunk for we must have past close by the fort and could have had no wind to bring us out till the landwind should rise in the night  but to our present voyage after we came aboard we saw the volcan of colima this is a very high mountain in about    d    m north standing   or   leagues from the sea in the midst of a pleasant valley it appears with two sharp peeks from each of which there do always issue flames of fire or smoke the valley in which this volcan stands is callel the valley of colima from the town it self which stands there not far from the volcan the town is said to be great and rich the chief of all its neighborhood and the valley in which it is seated by the relation which the spaniards give of it is the most pleasant and fruitful valley in all the kingdom of mexico this valley is about ten or twelve leagues wide by the sea where it makes a small bay but how far the vale runs into the country i know not it is said to be full of cacoagardens fields of corn wheat and plantainwalks the neighboring sea is bounded with a sandy shore but there is no going ashore for the violence of the waves the land within it is low all along and woody for about two leagues from the east side at the end of the woods there is a deep river runs out into the sea but it has such a great bar or sandy shoal that when we were here no boat or canoa could possibly enter the sea running so high upon the bar otherwise i judge we should have made some farther discovery into this pleasant valley on the west side of the river the savannah land begins and runs to the other side of the valley we had but little wind when we came aboard therefore we lay off this bay that afternoon and the night ensuing  the   th day our captains went away from our ships with  00 men intending at the first convenient place to land and search about for a path for the spanish books make mention of   or   other towns hereabouts especially one called sallagua to the west of this bay our canoas rowed along as near the shore as they could but the sea went so high that they could not land about  0 or    a clock two horsemen came near the shore and one of them took a bottle out of his pocket and drank to our men while he was drinking one of our men snatched up his gun and let drive at him and killed his horse so his consort immediately set spurs to his horse and rode away leaving the other to come after afoot but he being booted made but slow haste therefore two of our men stripped themselves and swam ashore to take him but he had a macheat or long knife wherewith he kept them both from seizing him they having nothing in their hands wherewith to defend themselves or offend him the  0th day our men came all aboard again for they could not find any place to land in  the first day of december we passed by the port of sallagua this port is in lat    d    m it is only a pretty deep bay divided in the middle with a rocky point which makes as it were two harbors ships may ride securely in either but the west harbor is the best there is good anchoring any where in  0 or    fathom and a brook of fresh water runs into the sea here we saw a great new thatched house and a great many spaniards both horse and foot with drums beating and colors flying in defiance of us as we thought we took no notice of them till the next morning and then we landed about  00 men to try their courage but they presently withdrew the foot never stayed to exchange one shot but the horsemen stayed till two or three were knocked down and then they drew off our men pursuing them at last two of our men took two horses that had lost their riders and mounting them rode after the spaniards full drive till they came among them thinking to have taken a prisoner for intelligence but had like to have been taken themselves for four spaniards surrounded them after they had discharged their pistols and unhorsed them and if some of our best footmen had not come to their rescue they must have yielded or have been killed they were both cut in two or three places but their wounds were not mortal the four spaniards got away before our men could hurt them and mounting their horses speeded after their consorts who were marched away into the country our men finding a broad road leading into the country followed it about four leagues in a dry stony country full of short wood but finding no sign of inhabitants they returned again in their way back they took two mullattos who were not able to march as fast as their consorts therefore they had skulked in the woods and by that means thought to have escaped our men these prisoners informed us that this great road did lead to a great city called oarrha from whence many of those horsemen before spoken of came that this city was distant from hence as far as a horse will go in four days and that there is no place of consequence nearer that the country is very poor and thinly inhabited they said also that these men came to assist the philippine ship that was every day expected here to put ashore passengers for mexico the spanish pilotbooks mention a town also called sallogua hereabouts but we could not find it nor hear any thing of it by our prisoners  we now intended to cruise off the cape corrientes to wait for the philippine ship so the  th day of december we set sail coasting to the westwards toward cape corrientes we had fair weather and but little wind the seabreezes at n w and the land wind at n the land is of an indifferent height full of ragged points which at a distance appear like islands the country is very woody but the trees are not high nor very big  here i was taken sick of a fever and ague that afterward turned to a dropsy which i labored under a long time after and many of our men died of this distemper though our surgeons used their greatest skill to preserve their lives the dropsy is a general distemper on this coast and the natives say that the best remedy they can find for it is the stone or cod of an allegator of which they have   one near each leg within the flesh pulverized and drunk in water this receipt we also found mentioned in an almanac made at mexico i would have tried it but we found no allegators here though there are several  there are many good harbors between sallagua and cape corrientes but we passed by them all as we drew near the cape the land by the sea appeared of an indifferent height full of white cliffs but in the country the land is high and barren and full of sharp pecked hills unpleasant to the sight to the west of this ragged land is a chain of mountains running parallel with the shore they end on the west with a gentle descent but on the east side they keep their height ending with a high steep mountain which has three small sharp pecked tops somewhat resembling a crown and therefore called by the spaniards coronada the crown land  the   th day we were fair in sight of cape corrientes it bore n by w and the crown land bore north the cape is of an indifferent height with steep rocks to the sea it is flat and even on the top clothed with woods the land in the country is high and doubled this cape lies in  0 d    m north i find its longitude from tenariff to be   0 d    m but i keep my longitude westward according to our course and according to this reckoning i find it is from the lizard in england     d    m so that the difference of time is eight hours and almost six minutes  here we had resolved to cruize for the philippine ship because she always makes this cape in her voyage homeward we were as i have said four ships in company captain swan and his tender captain townley and his tender it was so ordered that captain swan should lie eight or ten leagues off shore and the rest about a league distant each from other between him and the cape that so we might not miss the philippine ship but we wanted provision and therefore we sent capt townleys bark with  0 or  0 men to the west of the cape to search about for some town or plantations where we might get provision of any sort the rest of us in the mean time cruising in our stations the   th day the bark came to us again but had got nothing for they could not get about the cape because the wind on this coast is commonly between the n w and the s w which makes it very difficult getting to the westward but they left four canoas with    men at the cape who resolved to row to the westward the   th day we sailed to the keys of chametly to fill our water these keys or islands of chametly are about    or    leagues to the eastward of cape corrientes they are small low and woody environed with rocks there are five of them lying in the form of an half moon not a mile from the shore and between them and the main is very good riding secure from any wind the spaniards do report that here live fishermen to fish for the inhabitants of the city of purification this is said to be a large town the best hereabouts but is    leagues up in the country  the  0th instant we entered within these islands passing in on the s e side and anchored between the islands and the main in five fathom clean sand here we found good fresh water and wood and caught plenty of rockfish with hook and line a sort of fish i described at the isle of john fernando but we saw no sign of inhabitants besides three or four old hutts therefore i do believe that the spanish or indian fishermen come hither only at lent or some other such season but that they do not live here constantly the   st day captain townley went away with about  0 men to take an indian village   or   leagues from hence to the westward more toward the cape and the next day we went to cruise off the cape where captain townley was to meet us the   th day as we were cruising off the cape the four canoas beforementioned which captain townleys bark left at the cape came off to us they after the bark left them past to the west of the cape and rowed into the valley valderas or perhaps val d iris for it signifies the valley of flags  this valley lies in the bottom of a pretty deep bay that runs in between cape corrientes on the s e and the point of pontique on the n vv which two places are about  0 leagues asunder the valley is about   leagues wide there is a level sandy bay against the sea and good smooth landing in the midst of the bay is a fine river whereinto boats may enter but it is brackish at the latter end of the dry season which is in february march and part of april i shall speak more of the seasons in my chapter of winds in the appendix this valley is bounded within land with a small green hill that makes a very gentle descent into the valley and affords a very pleasant prospect to seaward it is enriched with fruitful savannahs mixed with groves of trees fit for any uses besides fruit trees in abundance as guavas oranges and limes which here grow wild in such plenty as if nature had designed it only for a garden the savannahs are full of fat bulls and cows and some horses but no house in sight  when our canoas came to this pleasant valley they landed    men and marched into the country seeking for some houses they had not gone past three mile before they were attackt by   0 spaniards horse and foot there was a small thin vvood close by them into which our men retreated to secure themselves from the fury of the horse yet the spaniards rode in among them and attackt them very furiously till the spanish captain and    more tumbled dead off their horses then the rest retreated being many of them wounded we lost four men and had two desperately wounded in this action the foot who were armed with lances and swords and were the greatest number never made any attack the horsemen had each a brace of pistols and some short guns if the foot had come in they had certainly destroyed all our men when the skirmish was over our men placed the two wounded men on horses and came to their canoas there they killed one of the horses and dressed it being afraid to venture into the savannah to kill a bullock of which there was store when they had eaten and satisfied themselves they returned aboard the   th day being christmas we cruised in pretty near the cape and sent in   canoas with the strikers to get fish being desirous to have a christmas dinner in the afternoon they returned aboard with three great jew fish which feasted us all and the next day we sent ashore our canoas again and got three or four more  captain townley who went from us at chametly came aboard the   th day and brought about  0 bushels of maiz he had landed to the eastward of cape corrientes and marched to an indian village that is   or   leagues in the country the indians seeing him coming set two houses on fire that were full of maiz and run away yet he and his men got in other houses as much as they could bring down on their backs which he brought aboard  january      and then made toward the valley valderas to hunt for beef and before night we anchored in the bottom of the bay in  0 fathom water a mile from the shore here we stayed hunting till the  th day and captain swan and captain townley went ashore every morning with about   0 men and marched to a small hill where they remained with  0 or  0 men to watch the spaniards who appeared in great companies on other hills not far distant but did never attempt any thing against our men here we killed and salted above two months meat besides what we spent fresh and might have killed as much more if we had been better stored with salt our hopes of meeting the philippine ship were now over for we did all conclude that while we were necessitated to hunt here for provisions she was past by to the eastward as indeed she was as we did understand afterward by prisoners so this design failed through captain townleys eagerness after the lima ship which he attempted in acapulco harbor as i have related for though we took a little flower hard by yet the same guide which told us of that ship would have conducted us where we might have had store of beef and maiz but instead thereof we lost both our time and the opportunity of providing our selves and so we were forced to be victualling when we should have been cruising off cape corrientes in expectation of the manila ship  hitherto we had coasted along here with two different designs the one was to get the manila ship which would have enriched us beyond measure and this captain townley was most for sir tho cavendish formerly took the manila ship off cape st lucas in california where we also would have waited for her had we been early enough stored with provisions to have met her there and threw much rich goods overboard the other design which captain swan and our crew were most for was to search along the coast for rich towns and mines chiefly of gold and silver which we were assured were in this country and we hoped near the shore not knowing as we afterward found that it was in effect an inland country its wealth remote from the south sea coast and having little or no commerce with it its trade being driven eastward with europe by la vera cruz yet we had still some expectation of mines and so resolved to steer on farther northward but captain townley who had no other design in coming on this coast but to meet this ship resolved to return again toward the coast of peru  in all this voyage on the mexican coast we had with us a captain and two or three of his men of our friendly indians of the isthmus of darien who having conducted over some parties of our privateers and expressing a desire to go along with us were received and kindly entertained aboard our ships and we were pleased in having by this means guides ready provided should we be for returning over land as several of us thought to do rather than sail round about but at this time we of captain swans ship designing farther to the northwest and captain townley going back we committed these our indian friends to his care to carry them home so here we parted he to the eastward and we to the westward intending to search as far to the westward as the spaniards were settled  it was the  th day of january in the morning when we sailed from this pleasant valley the wind was at n e and the weather fair at    a clock the seawind came at n w before night we passed by point pontique this is the west point of the bay of the valley of valderas and is distant from cape corrientes  0 leagues this point is in lat  0 d  0 m north it is high round rocky and barren at a distance it appears like an island a league to the west of this point are two small barren islands called the islands of pontique there are several high sharp white rocks that lie scattering about them we passed between these rocky islands on the left and the main on the right for there is no danger the seacoast beyond this point runs northward for about    leagues making many ragged points with small sandy bays between them the land by the seaside is low and pretty woody but in the country full of high sharp barren rugged unpleasant hills  the   th day we had sight of a small white rock which appears very much like a ship under sail this rock is in lat    d    m it is   leagues from the main there is a good channel between it and the main where you will have    or    fathom water near the island but running nearer the main you will have gradual soundings till you come in with the shore at night we anchored in six fathom water near a league from the main in good ouzy ground we caught a great many catfish here and at several places on this coast both before and after this  from this island the land runs more northerly making a fair sandy bay but the sea falls in with such violence on the shore that there is no landing but very good anchoring on all the coast and gradual soundings about a league off shore you will havo   fathom and   mile off shore you will have   fathom water we came to an anchor every evening and in the mornings we sailed off with the landwind which we found at n e and the seabreezes at n w  the  0th day we anchored about three miles on the east side of the islands chametly different from those of that name beforementioned for these are six small islands in lat    d    m a little to the south of the tropic of cancer and about   leagues from the main where a salt lake has its outlet into the sea these isles are of an indifferent height some of them have a few shrubby bushes the rest are bare of any sort of wood they are rocky round by the sea only one or two of them have sandy bays on the north side there is a sort of fruit growing on these islands called penguins and it is all the fruit they have  the penguin fruit is of two sorts the yellow and the red the yellow penguin grows on a green stem as big as a mans arm above a foot high from the ground the leaves of this stalk are half a foot long and an inch broad the edges full of sharp prickles the fruit grows at the head of the stalk in   or   great clusters    or  0 in a cluster the fruit is as big as a pullets egg of a round form and in color yellow it has a thick skin or rind and the inside is full of small black seeds mixed among the fruit it is sharp pleasant fruit the red penguin is of the bigness and color of a small dry onion and is in shape much like a ninepin for it grows not on a stalk or stem as the other but one end on the ground the other standing upright sixty or seventy grow thus together as close as they can stand one by another and all from the same root or cluster of roots these penguins are encompassed or fenced with long leaves about a foot and an half or two foot long and prickly like the former and the fruit too is much alike they are both wholesome and never offend the stomach but those that eat many will find a heat or tickling in their fundament they grow so plentifully in the bay of campeachy that there is no passing for their high prickly leaves  there are some guanoes on these islands but no other sort of land animal the bays about the islands are sometimes visited with seals and this was the first place where i had seen any of these animals on the north side of the equator in these seas for the fish on this sandy coast lie most in the lagunes or saltlakes and mouths of rivers but the seals come not so much there as i judge for this being no rocky coast where fish resort most there seems to be but little food for the seals unless they will venture upon catfish  capt swan went away from hence with  00 men in our canoas to the northward to seek for the river coolecan possibly the same with the river of pastla which some maps lay down in the province or region of cullacan this river lies in about    d n lat we were informed that there is a fair rich spanish town seated on the east side of it with savannahs about it full of bulls and cows and that the inhabitants of this town pass over in boats to the island california where they fish for pearl i have been told since by a spaniard that said he had been at the island california that there are great plenty of pearl oysters there and that the native indians of california near the pearlfishery are mortal enemies to the spaniards our canoas were absent   or   days and said they had been above  0 leagues but found no river that the land by the sea was low and all sandy bay but such a great sea that there was no landing they met us in their return in the lat    d  0 m coasting along shore after them toward cullacan so we returned again to the eastward this was the farthest that i was to the n on this coast  six or seven leagues n n w from the isles of chametly there is a small narrow entrance into a lake which runs about    leagues easterly parallel with the shore making many small low mangrove islands the mouth of this lake is in lat about    d  0 m it is called by the spaniards rio de sall for it is a salt lake there is water enough for boats and canoas to enter and smooth landing after you are in on the west side of it there is an house and an estantion or farm of large cattle our men went into the lake and landed and coming to the house found   or   bushels of maiz but the cattle were driven away by the spaniards yet there our men took the owner of the estantion and brought him aboard he said that the beefs were driven a great way in the country for fear we should kill them while we lay here capt swan went into this lake again and landed   0 men on the n e side and marched into the country about a mile from the landingplace as they were entering a dry salina or saltpond they fired at two indians that crossed the way before them one of them being wounded in the thigh fell down and being examined he told our men that there was an indian town   or   leagues off and that the way which they were going would bring them thither while they were in discourse with the indian they were attacked by  00 spanish horsemen who came with a design to scare them back but wanted both arms and hearts to do it  our men past on from hence and in their way marched through a savannah of long dry grass this the spaniards set on fire thinking to burn them but that did not hinder our men from marching forward though it did trouble them a little they rambled for want of guides all this day and part of the next before they came to the town the indian spoke of there they found a company of spaniards and indians who made head against them but were driven out of the town after a short dispute here our surgeon and one man more were wounded with arrows but none of the rest were hurt when they came into the town they found two or three indians wounded who told them that the name of the town was massaclan that there were a few spaniards living in it and the rest were indians that five leagues from this town there were two rich gold mines where the spaniards of compostella which is the chiefest town in these parts kept many slaves and indians at work for gold here our men lay that night and the next morning packt up all the maiz that they could find and brought it on their backs to the canoas and came aboard  we lay here till the  d of february and then captain swan went away with about  0 men to the river rosario where they landed and marched to an indian town of the same name they found it about   mile from the sea the way to it fair and even this was a fine little town of about  0 or  0 houses with a fair church and it was chiefly inhabited with indians they took prisoners there which told them that the river rosario is rich in gold and that the mines are not above two leagues from the town captain swan did not think it convenient to go to the mines but made haste aboard with the maiz which he took there to the quantity of about  0 or  0 bushels and which to us in the scarcity we were in of provisions was at that time more valuable than all the gold in the world and had he gone to the mines the spaniards would probably have destroyed the corn before his return the  d of february we went with our ships also toward the river rosario and anchored the next day against the rivers mouth   fathom good ouzy ground a league from the shore this river is in lat   d    m n when you are at an anchor against this river you will see a round hill like a sugar loaf a little way within land right over the river and bearing n e by n to the westward of that hill there is another pretty long hill called by the spaniards caput cavalli or the horses head  the  th day captain swan came a board with the maiz which he got this was but a small quantity for so many men as we were especially considering the place we were in being strangers and having no pilots to direct or guide us into any river and we being without all sort of provision but what we were forced to get in this manner from the shore and though our pilotbook directed us well enough to find the rivers yet for want of guides to carry us to the settlements we were forced to search   or   days before we could find a place to land for as i have said before besides the seas being too rough for landing in many places they have neither boat bark nor canoa that we could ever see or hear of and therefore as there are no such landing places in these rivers as there are in the north seas so when we were landed we did not know which way to go to any town except we accidentally met with a path indeed the spaniards and indians whom we had aboard knew the names of several rivers and towns near them and knew the towns when they saw them but they knew not the way to go to them from the sea  the  th day captain swan sent about  0 men to seek for the river oleta which is to the eastward of the river rosario the next day we followed after with the ships having the wind at w n w and fair weather in the afternoon our canoas came again to us for they could not find the river oleta therefore we designed next for the river st jago to the eastward still the   th day in the evening we anchored against the mouth of the river in   fathom water good soft ouzy ground and about two mile from the shore there was a high white rock without us called maxentelbo this rock at a distance appears like a ship under sail it bore from us w n w distant about   leagues the hill zelisco bore s e which is a very high hill in the country with a saddle or bending on the top the river st jago is in lat    d    m it is one of the principal rivers on this coast there is  0 foot water on the bar at low water but how much it flows here i know not the mouth of this river is near half a mile broad and very smooth entering within the mouth it is broader for there are three or four rivers more meet there and issue all out together is fresh water is brackish a great way up yet there the water is to be had by digging or making wells in the sandy bay two or three foot deep just at the mouth of the river  the   th day captain swan sent  0 men in four canoas into this river to seek a town for although we had no intelligence of any yet the country appearing very promising we did not question but they would find inhabitants before they returned they spent two days in rowing up and down the creeks and rivers at last they came to a large field of maiz which was almost ripe they immediately fell to gathering as fast as they could and intended to lade the canoas but seeing an indian that was set to watch the corn they quitted that troublesome and tedious work and seized him and brought him aboard in hopes by his information to have some more easy and expedite way of a supply by finding corn ready cut and dried he being examined said that there was a town called santa pecaque four leagues from the place where he was taken and that if we designed to go thither he would undertake to be our guide captain swan immediately ordered his men to make ready and the same evening went away with eight canoas and   0 men taking the indian for their guide  he rowed about five leagues up the river and landed the next morning the river at this place was not above pistolshot wide and the banks pretty high on each side and the land plain and even he left    men to guard the canoas and marched with the rest to the town he set out from the canoas at six a clock in the morning and reached the town by  0 the way through which he passed was very plain part of it woodland part savannahs the savannahs were full of horses bulls and cows the spaniards seeing him coming run all away so he entered the town without the least opposition  this town of santa pecaque stands on a plain in a savannah by the side of a wood with many fruit trees about it it is but a small town but very regular after the spanish mode with a parade in the midst the houses fronting the parade had all balconies there were two churches one against the parade the other at the end of the town it is inhabited most with spaniards their chiefest occupation is husbandry there are also some carriers who are employed by the merchants of compostella to trade for them to and from the mines  compostella is a rich town about    leagues from hence it is the chiefest in all this part of the kingdom and is reported to have  0 white families which is a great matter in these parts for it may be that such a town has not less than  00 families of coppercoloured people besides the white the silver mines are about five or six leagues from santa pecaque where as we were told the inhabitants of compostella had some hundreds of slaves at work the silver here and all over the kingdom of mexico is said to be finer and richer in proportion than that of potosi or peru though the oar be not so abundant and the carriers of this town of santa pecaque carry the oar to compostella where it is refined these carriers or sutlers also furnish the slaves at the mines with maiz whereof here was great plenty now in the town designed for that use here was also sugar salt and saltfish  captain swans only business at santa pecaque was to get provision therefore he ordered his men to divide themselves into two parts and by turns carry down the provision to the canoas one half remaining in the town to secure what they had taken while the other half were going and coming in the afternoon they caught some horses and the next morning being the   th day    men and some horses went laden with maiz to the canoas they found them and the men left to guard them in good order though the spaniards had given them a small diversion and wounded one man but our men of the canoas landed and drove them away these that came loaded to the canoas left   men more there so that now they were  0 men to guard the canoas at night the other returned and the   th day in the morning that half which staid the day before at the town took their turn of going with every man his burden and    horsesladen before they returned captain swan and his other men at the town caught a prisoner who said that there were near a thousand men of all colors spaniards and indians negroes and mulattos in arms at a place called st jago but   leagues off the chief town on this river that the spaniards were armed with guns and pistols and the coppercoloured with swords and lances captain swan fearing the ill consequence of separating his small company was resolved the next day to march away with the whole party and therefore he ordered his men to catch as many horses as they could that they might carry the more provision with them accordingly the next day being the   th day of february      captain swan called out his men betimes to be gone but they refused to go and said that they would not leave the town till all the provision was in the canoas therefore he was forced to yield to them and suffered half the company to go as before they had now    horses laden which captain swan ordered to be tied one to another and the men to go in two bodies    before and as many behind but the men would go at their own rate every man leading his horse the spaniards observed their manner of marching and laid an ambush about a mile from the town which they managed with such success that falling on our body of men who were guarding the corn to the canoas they killed them every one capt swan hearing the report of their guns ordered his men who were then in the town with him to march out to their assistance but some opposed him despising their enemies till two of the spaniards horses that had lost their riders came galloping into the town in a great fright both bridled and saddled with each a pair of holsters by their sides and one had a carbine newly discharged which was an apparent token that our men had been engaged and that by men better armed than they imagined they should meet with therefore captain swan immediately marched out of the town and his men all followed him and when he came to the place where the engagement had been he saw all his men that went out in the morning lying dead they were stripped and so cut and mangled that he scarce knew one man captain swan had not more men then with him than those were who lay dead before him yet the spaniards never came to oppose him but kept at a great distance for it is probable the spaniards had not cut off so many men of ours but with the loss of a great many of their own so he marched down to the canoas and came aboard the ship with the maiz that was already in the canoas we had about  0 men killed and among the rest my ingenious friend mr ringrose was one who wrote that part of the history of the buccaneers which relates to captain sharp he was at this time capemerchant or supercargo of captain swans ship he had no mind to this voyage but was necessitated to engage in it or starve  this loss discouraged us from attempting any thing more hereabouts therefore captain swan proposed to go to cape st lucas on california to careen he had two reasons for this first that he thought he could lie there secure from the spaniards and next that if he could get a commerce with the indians there he might make a discovery in the lake of california and by their assistance try for some of the plate of new mexico  this lake of california for so the sea channel or straight between that and the continent is called is but little known to the spaniards by what i could ever learn for their drafts do not agree about it some of them do make california an island but give no manner of account of the tides flowing in the lake or what depth of water there is or of the harbors rivers or creeks that border on it whereas on the west side of the island toward the asiatick coast their pilotbook gives an account of the coast from cape st lucas to  0 d north some of their drafts newly made do make california to join to the main i do believe that the spaniards do not care to have this lake discovered for fear lest other european nations should get knowledge of it and by that means visit the mines of new mexico we heard that not long before our arrival here the indians in the province of new mexico made an insurrection and destroyed most of the spaniards there but that some of them flying toward the gulf or lake of california made canoas in that lake and got safe away though the indians of the lake of california seem to be at perfect enmity with the spaniards we had an old intelligent spaniard now aboard who said that he spoke with a friar that made his escape among them  new mexico by report of several english prisoners there and spaniards i have met with lies n w from old mexico between four and  00 leagues and the biggest part of the treasure which is found in this kingdom is in that province but without doubt there are plenty of mines in other parts as well in this part of the kingdom where we now were as in other places and probably on the main bordering on the lake of california although not yet discovered by the spaniards who have mines enough and therefore as yet have no reason to discover more  in my opinion here might be very advantageous discoveries made by any that would attempt it for the spaniards have more than they can well manage i know they would lie like the dog in the manger although not able to eat themselves yet they would endeavor to hinder others but the voyage thither being so far i take that to be one reason that has hindered the discoveries of these parts yet it is possible that a man may find a nearer way hither than we came i mean by the north west  i know there have been diverse attempts made about a north west passage and all unsuccessful yet i am of opinion that such a passage may be found all our countrymen that have gone to discover the n w passage have endeavored to pass to the westward beginning their search along daviss or hudsons bay but if i was to go on this discovery i would go first into the south seas bend my course from thence along by california and that way seek a passage back into the west seas for as others have spent the summer in first searching on this more known side nearer home and so before they got through the time of the year obliged them to give over their search and provide for a long course back again for fear of being left in the winter on the contrary i would search first on the less known coast of the south seaside and then as the year past away i should need no retreat for i should come farther into my knowledge if i succeeded in my attempt and should be without that dread and fear which the others must have in passing from the known to the unknown who for ought i know gave over their search just as they were on the point of accomplishing their desires  i would take the same method if i was to go to discover the northeast passage i would winter about japan corea or the northeast part of china and taking the spring and summer before me i would make my first trial on the coast of tartary wherein if i succeeded i should come into some known parts and have a great deal of time before me to reach archangel or some other port captain wood indeed says this n east passage is not to be found for ice but how often do we see that sometimes designs have been given over as impossible and at another time and by other ways those very things have been accomplished but enough of this  the next day after that fatal skirmish near santa pecaque capt swan ordered all our water to be filled and to get ready to sail the   st day we sailed from hence directing our course toward california we had the wind at n w and w n w a small gale with a great sea out of the west we past by   islands called the marias after we past these islands we had much wind at n n w and n w and at n with thick rainy weather we beat till the  th day of february but it was against a brisk wind and proved labor in vain for we were now within reach of the land tradewind which was opposite to us but would we go to california upon the discovery or otherwise we should bear  0 or  0 leagues off from the shore where we should avoid the landwinds and have the benefit of the true easterly tradewind  finding therefore that we got nothing but rather lost ground being then    d   m n we steered away more to the eastward again for the islands marias and the  th day we came to an anchor at the east end of the middle island in   fathom water good clean sand  the marias are three uninhabited islands in lat    d  0 m they are distant from cape st lucas on california  0 leagues bearing east south east and they are distant from cape corrientes  0 leagues bearing upon the same points of the compass with cape st lucas they stretch n w and s e about    leagues there are   or   small high rocks near them the westermost of them is the biggest island of the three and they are all three of an indifferent height the soil is stony and dry the land in most places is covered with a shrubby sort of wood very thick and troublesome to pass through in some places there is plenty of straight large cedars though speaking of the places where i have found cedars chap   i forgot to mention this place the spaniards make mention of them in other places but i speak of those which i have seen all round by the seaside it is sandy and there is produced a green prickly plant whose leaves are much like the penguinleaf and the root like the root of a sempervive but much larger this root being baked in an oven is good to eat and the indians on california as i have been informed have great part of their subsistence from these roots we made an oven in a sandy bank and baked of these roots and i eat of them but none of us greatly cared for them they taste exactly like the roots of our english burdock boiled of which i have eaten here are plenty of guanoes and raccoons a large sort of rat and indian conies and abundance of large pigeons and turtledoves the sea is also pretty well stored with fish and turtle or tortoise and seal this is the second place on this coast where i did see any seal and this place helps to confirm what i have observed that they are seldom seen but where there is plenty of fish captain swan gave the middle island the name of prince georges island  the  th day we run nearer the island and anchored in five fathom and moored head and stern and unriggd both ship and bark in order to careen here capt swan proposed to go into the east indies many were well pleased with the voyage but some thought such was their ignorance that he would carry them out of the world for about two thirds of our men did not think there was any such way to be found but at last he gained their consents  at our first coming hither we did eat nothing but seal but after the first   or   days our strikers brought aboard turtle every day on which we fed all the time that we lay here and saved our maiz for our voyage here also we measured all our maiz and found we had about  0 bushels this we divided into three parts one for the bark and two for the ship our men were divided also  00 men aboard the ship and  0 aboard the bark besides three or four slaves in each  i had been a long time sick of a dropsy a distemper whereof as i said before many of our men died so here i was laid and covered all but my head in the hot sand i endured it near half an hour and then was taken out and laid to sweat in a tent i did sweat exceedingly while i was in the sand and i do believe it did me much good for i grew well soon after  we staid here till the   th day and then both vessels being clean we sailed to the valley of balderas to water for we could not do it here now in the wet season indeed here is water enough for the brooks then run down plentifully but now though there was water yet it was bad filling it being a great way to fetch it from the holes where it lodged the   th day we anchored in the bottom of the bay in the valley of balderas right against the river where we watered before but this river was brackish now in the dry season and therefore we went   or   leagues nearer cape corrientes and anchored by a small round island not half a mile from the shore the island is about four leagues to the northward of the cape and the brook where we filled our water is just within the island upon the main here our strikers struck   or  0 jewfish some we did eat and the rest we salted and the   th day we filled    tuns of very good water  having thus provided our selves we had nothing more to do but to put in execution our intended expedition to the east indies in hopes of some better success there than we had met with on this little frequented coast we came on it full of expectations for besides the richness of the country and the probability of finding some seaports worth visiting we persuaded our selves that there must needs be shipping and trade here and that acapulca and la vera cruz were to the kingdom of mexico what panama and portobel are to that of peru viz marts for carrying on a constant commerce between the south and north seas as indeed they are but whereas we expected that this commerce should be managed by sea we found our selves mistaken that of mexico being almost wholly a landtrade and managed more by mules than by ships so that instead of profit we met with little on this coast besides fatigues hardships and losses and so were the more easily induced to try what better fortune we might have in the east indies but to do right to captain swan he had no intention to be as a privateer in the east indies but as he has often assured me with his own mouth he resolved to take the first opportunity of returning to england so that he feigned a compliance with some of his men who were bent upon going to cruise at manila that he might have leisure to take some favorable opportunity of quitting the privateer trade  chap x their departure from cape corrientes for the ladrone islands and the east indies their course thither and accidents by the way with a table of each days run etc of the different accounts of the breadth of these seas guam one of the ladrone islands the coconut tree fruit etc the toddi or arack that distills from it with other uses that are made of it coire cables the lime or crab limon the breadfruit the native indians of guam their proes a remarkable sort of boats and of those used in the east indies the state of guam and the provisions with which they were furnished there  i have given an account in the last chapter of the resolutions we took of going over to the east indies but having more calmly considered on the length of our voyage from hence to guam one of the ladrone islands which is the first place that we could toch at and there also being not certain to find provisions most of our men were almost daunted at the thoughts of it for we had not  0 days provision at a little more than half a pint of maiz a day for each man and no other provision except   meals of salted jewfish and we had a great many rars aboard which we could not hinder from eating part of our maiz beside the great distance between cape corrientes and guam which is variously set down the spaniards who have the greatest reason to know best make it to be between   00 and   00 leagues our books also reckon it differently between  0 and  00 degrees which all comes short indeed of  000 leagues but even that was a voyage enough to frighten us considering our scanty provisions captain swan to encourage his men to go with him persuaded them that the english books did give the best account of the distance his reasons were many although but weak he urged among the rest that sir thomas candish and sir francis drake did run it in less than  0 days and that he did not question but that our ships were better sailers than those which were built in that age and that he did not doubt to get there in little more than  0 days this being the best time in the year for breezes which undoubtedly is the reason that the spaniards set out from acapulco about this time and that although they are  0 days in their voyage it is because they are great ships deep laden and very heavy sailers besides they wanting nothing are in no great haste in their way but sail with a great deal of their usual caution and when they come near the island guam they lie by in the night for a week before they make land in prudence we also should have contrived to lie by in the night when we came near land for otherwise we might have run ashore or have outsailed the islands and lost sight of them before morning but our bold adventures seldom proceed with such wariness when in any straights  but of all captain swans arguments that which prevailed most with them was his promising them as i have said to cruise off the manilas so he and his men being now agreed and they encouraged with the hope of gain which works its way through all difficulties we set out from cape corrientes march the   st      we were   ships in company captain swans ship and a bark commanded under captain swan by captain teat and we were   0 men  00 aboard of the ship and  0 aboard the bark beside slaves as i said  we had a small landwind at e n e which carried us   or   leagues then the seawind came at w n w a fresh gale so we steered away s w by   a clock in the evening we were about   leagues s w from the cape then we met a landwind which blew fresh all night and the next morning about  0 a clock we had the seabreez at n n e so that at noon we were  0 leagues from the cape it blew a fresh gale of wind which carried us off into the true tradewind of the difference of which tradewinds i shall speak in the chapter of winds in the appendix for although the constant seabreez near the shore is at w n w yet the true trade off at sea when you are clear of the landwinds is at e n e at first we had it at n n e so it came about northerly and then to the east as we run off at   0 leagues distance from the shore we had it at e n e and there it stood till we came within  0 leagues of guam when we had eaten up our   meals of salted jewfish in so many days time we had nothing but our small allowance of maiz  after the   st day of march we made great runs every day having very fair clear weather and a fresh trade wind which we made use of with all our sails and we made many good observations of the sun at our first setting out we steered into the lat of    degrees which is near the lat of guam then we steered west keeping in that lat by that time we had sailed  0 days our men seeing we made such great runs and the wind like to continue repined because they were kept at such short allowance captain swan endeavored to persuade them to have a little patience yet nothing but an augmentation of their daily allowance would appease them captain swan though with much reluctance gave way to a small enlargement of our commons for now we had not above  0 spoonfuls of boiled maiz a man once a day whereas before we had  i do believe that this short allowance did me a great deal of good though others were weakened by it for i found that my strength increased and my dropsy wore off yet i drank   times every    hours but many of our men did not drink in   or  0 days time and some not in    days one of our men did not drink in    days time and said he was not adry when he did drink yet he made water every day more or less one of our men in the midst of these hardships was found guilty of theft and condemned for the same to have  blows from each man in the ship with a   inch and a half rope on his bare back captain swan began first and struck with a good will whose example was followed by all of us  it was very strange that in all this voyage we did not see one fish not so much as a flyingfish nor any sort of fowl but at one time when we were by my account      miles west from cape corrientes then we saw a great number of boobies which we supposed came from some rocks not far from us which were mentioned in some of our seacarts but we did not see them  after we had run the   00 leagues by our reckoning which made the english account to guam the men began to murmur against captain swan for persuading them to come this voyage but he gave them fair words and told them that the spanish account might probably be the truest and seeing the gale was likely to continue a short time longer would end our troubles  map of the east indies a map of the east indies   as we drew nigh the island we met with some small rain and the clouds settling in the west were an apparent token that we were not far from land for in these climates betwixt or near the tropicks where the tradewind blows constantly the clouds which fly swift over head yet seem near the limb of the horizon to hang without much motion or alteration where the land is near i have often taken notice of it especially if it is high land for you shall then have the clouds hang about it without any visible motion  the  0th day of may our bark being about   leagues ahead of our ship sailed over a rocky shole on which there was but   fathom water and abundance of fish swimming about the rocks they imagined by this that the land was not far off so they clapped on a wind with the barks head to the north and being past the shole lay by for us when we came up with them captain teat came aboard us and related what he had seen we were then in lat    d    m steering west the island guam is laid down in lat    d n by the spaniards who are masters of it keeping it as a baitingplace as they go to the philippine islands therefore we clapped on a wind and stood to northward being somewhat troubled and doubtful whether we were right because there is no shole laid down in the spanish drafts about the island guam at   a clock to our great joy we saw the island guam at about   leagues distance  it was well for captain swan that we got sight of it before our provision was spent of which we had but enough for   days more for as i was afterward informed the men had contrived first to kill captain swan and eat him when the victuals was gone and after him all of us who were accessory in promoting the undertaking this voyage this made captain swan say to me after our ararrival at guam ah dampier you would have made them but a poor meal for i was as lean as the captain was lusty and fleshy the wind was at e n e and the land bore at n n e therefore we stood to the northward till we brought the island to bear east and then we turned to get in to an anchor  the account i have given hitherto of our course from cape corrientes in the kingdom of mexico for i have mentioned another cape of that name in peru south of the bay of panama to guam one of the ladrone islands has been in the gross but for the satisfaction of those who may think it serviceable to the fixing the longitudes of these parts or

lat and takes   from my meridian did so that the island is in lat       and the merid did from corrientes   0  miles which reduced into degrees makes     d    m  the table consists of   columns the first is of the days of the month the  d column contains each days course or the point of the compass we ran upon the  d gives the distance or length of such course in italian or geometrical miles at the rate of  0 to a degree or the progress the ship makes every day and is reckoned always from noon to noon but because the course is not always made upon the same rumb in a direct line therefore the  th and  th columns show how many miles we ran to the south every day and how many to the west which last was our main run in this voyage by the   th of april we were got pretty near into the latitude of guam and our course then lying along that parallel our northing and southing consequently were but little according as the ship deviated from its direct course and such deviation is thenceforward expressed by n or s in the  th column and the ships keeping straight on the west rumb by 0 that is to say no northing or southing the  th column shows the lat we were in every day where r signifies the dead reckoning by the running of the logs and ob shows the lat by observation the  th column shows the wind and weather  to these i would have added an  th column to show the variation of the needle but as it was very small in this course so neither did we make any observation of it above once after we were set out from the mexican coast at our departure from cape corrientes we found it to be   d    m easterly and the observation we made of it afterward when we had gone about a third of the voyage showed it to be so near the same to be decreasing neither did we observe it at guam for captain swan who had the instruments in his cabin did not seem much to regard it yet i am inclined to think that at guam the variation might be either none at all or even increasing to the westward  to conclude may  0th at noon when we begin to call it   st we were in lat    d  0 m n by r having run since the noon before     miles directly west we continued the same course till two that afternoon for which i allow ten miles more west still and then finding the parallel we ran upon to be too much southerly we clapped on a wind and sailed directly north till five in the afternoon having in that time run   miles and increased our latitude so many minutes making it    d    m we then saw the island guam bearing n n e distant from us about   leagues which gives the latitude of the island    d  0 m and according to the account foregoing its longitude is     d    m west from the cape corrientes on the coast of mexico allowing    and    italian miles to a degree in these latitudes at the common rate of  0 miles to a degree of the equator as before computed  as a corollary from hence it will follow that upon a supposal of the truth of the general allowance seamen make of  0 italian miles to an equinoctial degree that the south sea must be of a greater breadth by    degrees than it is commonly reckoned by hydrographers who make it only about  00 more or less for since we found as i shall have occasion to say the distance from guam to the eastern parts of asia to be much the same with the common reckoning it follows by way of necessary consequence from hence that the    degrees of longitude or thereabouts which are underreckoned in the distance between america and the east indies westward are overreckoned in the breadth of asia and africa the atlantic sea or the american continent or all together and so that tract of the terraqueous globe must be so much shortened and for a further confirmation of the fact i shall add that as to the aethiopick or indian sea its breadth must be considerably less than it is generally calculated to be if it be true what i have heard over and over from several able seamen whom i have conversed with in these parts that ships sailing from the cape of good hope to new holland as many ships bound to java or thereabouts keep that latitude find themselves there and sometimes to their cost running aground when they have thought themselves to be a great way off and it is from hence possibly that the dutch call that part of this coast the land of indraught as if it magnetically drew ships too fast to it and give cautions to avoid it but i rather think it is the nearness of the land than any whirlpool or the like that surprises them as to the breadth of the atlantic sea i am from good hands assured that it is overreckoned by six seven eight or ten degrees for besides the concurrent accounts of several experienced men who have confirmed the same to me mr canby particularly who has sailed as a mate in a great many voyages from cape lopez on the coast of guinea to barbados and is much esteemed as a very sensible man has often told me that he constantly found the distance to be between  0 and    degrees whereas it is laid down in        0 and    degrees in the common draughts  as to the supposition it self which our seamen make in the allowing but  0 miles to a degree i am not ignorant how much this has been canvased of late years especially and that the prevailing opinion has been that about  0 or upwards should be allowed but till i can see some better grounds for the exactness of those trials that have been made on land by mr norwood and others considering the inequality of the earths surface as well as the obliquity of the way in their allowing for which i am somewhat doubtful of their measures upon the whole matter i cannot but adhere to the general seacalculation confirmed as to the main by daily experience till some more certain estimate shall be made than those hitherto attempted for we find our selves when we sail north or south to be brought to our intended place in a time agreeable enough with what we expect upon the usual supposition making all reasonable allowance for the little unavoidable deviations east or west and there seems no reason why the same estimate should not serve us in crossing the meridians which we find so true in sailing under them as to this course of ours to guam particularly we should rather increase than shorten our estimate of the length of it considering that the easterly wind and current being so strong and bearing therefore our log after us as is usual in such cases should we therefore in casting up the run of the log make allowance for so much space as the log it self drove after us which is commonly   or   miles in  00 in so brisk a gale as this was we must have reckoned more than     degrees but in this voyage we made no such allowance though it be usual to do it so that how much soever this computation of mine exceeds the common draughts yet is it of the shortest according to our experiment and calculation  but to proceed with our voyage the island guam or guahon as the native indians pronounce it is one of the ladrone islands belongs to the spaniards who have a small fort with six guns in it with a governor and  0 or  0 soldiers they keep it for the relief and refreshment of their philippine ships that touch here in their way from acapulco to manila but the winds will not so easily let them take this way back again the spaniards of late have named guam the island maria it is about    leagues long and   broad lying n and s it is pretty high champain land  the   st day of may      at    a clock in the evening we anchored near the middle of the island guam on the west side a mile from the shore at a distance it appears flat and even but coming near it you will find it stands shelving and the east side which is much the highest is fenced with steep rocks that oppose the violence of the sea which continually rage against it being driven with the constant tradewind and on that side there is no anchoring the west side is pretty low and full of small sandy bays divided with as many rocky points the soil of the island is reddish dry and indifferent fruitful the fruits are chiefly rice pineapples watermelons muskmelons oranges and limes coconuts and a sort of fruit called by us breadfruit  the coconut trees grow by the sea on the western side in great groves   or   miles in length and a mile or two broad this tree is in shape like the cabbagetree and at a distance they are not to be known each from other only the coconut tree is fuller of branches but the cabbagetree generally is much higher though the coconut trees in some places are very high  the nut or fruit grows at the head of the tree among the branches and in clusters  0 or    in a cluster the branch to which they grow is about the bigness of a mans arm and as long running small toward the end it is of a yellow color full of knots and very tough the nut is generally bigger than a mans head the outer rind is near two inches thick before you come to the shell the shell it self is black thick and very hard the kernel in some nuts is near an inch thick sticking to the inside of the shell clear round leaving a hollow in the middle of it which contains about a pint more or less according to the bigness of the nut for some are much bigger than others  this cavity is full of sweet delicate wholesome and resreshing water while the nut is growing all the inside is full of this water without any kernel at all but as the nut grows toward its maturity the kernel begins to gather and settle round on the inside of the shell and is soft like cream and as the nut ripens it increases in substance and becomes hard the ripe kernel is sweet enough but very hard to digest therefore seldom eaten unless by strangers who know not the effects of it but while it is young and soft like pap some men will eat it scraping it out with a spoon after they have drunk the water that was within it i like the water best when the nut is almost ripe for it is then sweetest and briskest  when these nuts are ripe and gathered the outside rind becomes of a brown rusty color so that one would think that they were dead and dry yet they will sprout out like onions after they have been hanging in the sun   or   months or thrown about in a house or ship and if planted afterward in the earth they will grow up to a tree before they thus sprout out there is a small spungy round knob grows in the inside which we call an apple this at first is no bigger than the top of ones finger but increases daily sucking up the water till it is grown so big as to fill up the cavity of the coconut and then it begins to sprout forth by this time the nut that was hard begins to grow oily and soft thereby giving passage to the sprout that springs from the apple which nature has so contrived that it points to the hole in the shell of which there are three till it grows ripe just where it is fastened by its stalk to the tree but one of these holes remains open even when it is ripe through which it creeps and spreads forth its branches you may let these teeming nuts sprout out a foot and half or two foot high before you plant them for they will grow a great while like an onion out of their own substance  beside the liquor or water in the fruit there is also a sort of wine drawn from the tree called toddy which looks like whey it is sweet and very pleasant but it is to be drunk within    hours after it is drawn for afterward it grows sour those that have a great many trees draw a spirit from the sour wine called arack arack is distilled also from rice and other things in the east indies but none is so much esteemed for making punch as this sort made of toddy or the sap of the coconut tree for it makes most delicate punch but it must have a dash of brandy to hearten it because this arack is not strong enough to make good punch of it self this sort of liquor is chiefly used about goa and therefore it has the name of goa arack the way of drawing the toddy from the tree is by cutting the top of a branch that would bear nuts but before it has any fruit and from thence the liquor which was to feed its fruit distills into the hole of a callabash that is hung upon it  this branch continues running almost as long as the fruit would have been growing and then it dries away the tree has usually three fruitful branches which if they be all tappd thus then the tree bears no fruit that year but if one or two only be tappd the other will bear fruit all the while the liquor which is thus drawn is emptied out of the callabash duly morning and evening so long as it continues running and is sold every morning and evening in most towns in the east indies and great gains are produced from it even this way but those that distill it and make arack reap the greatest profit there is also great profit made of the fruit both of the nut and the shell  the kernel is much used in making broth when the nut is dry they take off the husk and giving two good blows on the middle of the nut it breaks in two equal parts letting the water fall on the ground then with a small iron rasp made for the purpose the kernel or nut is rasped out clean which being put into a little fresh water makes it become white as milk in this milky water they boil a fowl or any other sort of flesh and it makes very savory broth english seamen put this water into boiled rice which they eat instead of ricemilk carrying nuts purposely to sea with them this they learn from the natives  but the greatest use of the kernel is to make oil both for burning and for frying the way to make the oil is to grate or rasp the kernel and steep it in fresh water then boil it and scum off the oil at top as it rises but the nuts that make the oil ought to be a long time gathered so as that the kernel may be turning soft and oily  the shell of this nut is used in the east indies for cups dishes ladles spoons and in a manner for all eating and drinking vessels well shaped nuts are often brought home to europe and much esteemed the husk of the shell is of great use to make cables for the dry husk is full of small strings and threads which being beaten become soft and the other substance which was mixed among it falls away like sawdust leaving only the strings these are afterward spun into long yarns and twisted up into balls for convenience and many of these ropeyarns joined together make good cables this manufactory is chiefly used at the maldiveislands and the threads sent in balls into all places that trade thither purposely for to make cables i made a cable at achin with some of it these are called coire cables they will last very well but there is another sort of coire cables as they are called that are black and more strong and lasting and are made of strings that grow like horsehair at the heads of certain trees almost like the coconut tree this sort comes most from the island timor in the south seas the spaniards do make oakam to chalk their ships with the husk of the coconut which is more serviceable than that made of hemp and they say it will never rot i have been told by captain knox who wrote the relation of ceylon that in some places of india they make a sort of course cloth of the husk of the coconut which is used for sails i my self have seen a sort of course sailcloth made of such a kind of substance but whether the same or no i know not  i have been the longer on this subject to give the reader a particular account of the use and profit of a vegetable which is possibly of all others the most generally serviceable to the conveniences as well as the necessities of humane life yet this tree that is of such great use and esteemed so much in the east indies is scarce regarded in the west indies for want of the knowledge of the benefit which it may produce and it is partly for the sake of my countrymen in our american plantations that i have spoken so largely of it for the hot climates there are a very proper soil for it and indeed it is so hardy both in the raising it and when grown that it will thrive as well in dry sandy ground as in rich land i have found them growing very well in low sandy islands on the west of sumatra that are overflowed with the sea every springtide and though the nuts there are not very big yet this is no loss for the kernel is thick and sweet and the milk or water in the inside is more pleasant and sweet than of the nuts that grow in rich ground which are commonly large indeed but not very sweet these at guam grow in dry ground are of a middle size and i think the sweetest that i did ever taste thus much for the coconut  the lime is a sort of bastard or crab limon the tree or bush that bears it is prickly like a thorn growing full of small boughs in jamaica and other places they make of the lime bush fences about gardens or any other enclosure by planting the seeds close together which growing up thick spread abroad and make a very good hedge the fruit is like a limon but a smaller the rind thin and the enclosed substance full of juice the juice is very tart yet of a pleasant taste sweetened with sugar it is chiefly used for making punch both in the east and west indies as well ashore as at sea and much of it is for that purpose yearly brought home to england from out west india plantations it is also used for a particular kind of sauce which is called peppersauce and is made of codpepper commonly called guineapepper boiled in water and then pickled with salt and mixed with limejuice to preserve it limes grow plentiful in the east and west indies within the tropicks  the breadfruit as we call it grows on a large tree as big and high as our largest apple trees it has a spreading head full of branches and dark leaves the fruit grows on the boughs like apples it is as big as a pennyloaf when wheat is at five shillings the bushel it is of a round shape and has a thick tugh rind when the fruit is ripe it is yellow and soft and the taste is sweet and pleasant the natives of this island use it for bread they gather it when full grown while it is green and hard then they bake it in an oven which scorcheth the rind and makes it black but they scrape off the outside black crust and there remains a tender thin crust and the inside is soft tender and white like the crumb of a penny loaf there is neither seed nor stone in the inside but all is of a pure substance like bread it must be eaten new for if it is kept above    hours it becomes dry and eats harsh and choaky but it is very pleasant before it is too stale this fruit lasts in season   months in the year during which time the natives eat no other sort of food of breadkind i did never see of this fruit any where but here the natives told us that there is plenty of this fruit growing on the rest of the ladrone islands and i did never hear of any of it any where else  they have here some rice also but the island being of a dry soil and therefore not very proper for it they do not sow very much fish is scarce about this island yet on the shole that our bark came over there was great plenty and the natives commonly go thither to fish  the natives of this island are strong bodied large limbed and wellshapd they are coppercoloured like other indians their hair is black and long their eyes meanly proportioned they have pretty high noses their lips are pretty full and their teeth indifferent white they are long visaged and stern of countenance yet we found them to be affable and courteous they are many of them troubled with a kind of a leprosy this distemper is very common at mindanao therefore i shallspeak more of it in my next chapter they of guam are otherwise very healthy especially in the dry season but in the wet season which comes in in june and holds till october the air is more thick and unwholesome which occasions fevers but the rains are not violent nor lasting for the island lies so far westerly from the philippine islands or any other land that the westerly winds do seldom blow so far and when they do they do not last long but the easterly winds do constantly blow here which are dry and healthy and this island is found to be very healthful as we were informed while we lay by it the natives are very ingenious beyond any people in making boats or proes as they are called in the east indies and therein they take great delight these are built sharp at both ends the bottom is of one piece made like the bottom of a little canoa very neatly dug and left of a good substance this bottom part is instead of a keel it is about    or    foot long the under part of this keel is made round but inclining to a wedge and smooth and the upper part is almost flat having a very gentle hollow and is about a foot broad from hence both sides of the boat are carried up to about   foot high with narrow plank not above   or   inches broad and each end of the boat turns up round very prettily but what is very singular one side of the boat is made perpendicular like a wall while the other side is rounding made as other vessels are with a pretty full belly just in the middle it is about   or   foot broad aloft or more according to the length of the boat the mast stands exactly in the middle with a long yard that  up and down like a mizenyard one end of it reaches down to the end or head of the boat where it is placed in a notch that is made there purposely to receive it and keep it fast the other end hangs over the stern to this yard the sail is fastened at the foot of the sail there is another small yard to keep the sail out square and to roll up the sail on when it blows hard for it serves instead of a reef to take up the sail to what degree they please according to the strength of the wind along the bellyside of the boat parallel with it at about   or   foot distance lies another small boat or canoa being a log of very light wood almost as long as the great boat but not so wide being not above a foot and an half wide at the upper part and very sharp like a wedge at each end and there are two bamboas of about   or  0 foot long and as big as ones leg placed over the great boats side one near each end of it and reaching about   or   foot from the side of the boat by the help of which the little boat is made firm and contiguous to the other these are generally called by the dutch and by the english from them outlayers the use of them is to keep the great boat upright from oversetting because the wind here being in a manner constantly east or if it were at west it would be the same thing and the range of these islands where their business lies to and fro being mostly north and south they turn the flat side of the boat against the wind upon which they sail and the bellyside consequently with its little boat is upon the lee and the vessel having a head at each end so as to sail with either of them foremost indifferently they need not tack or go about as all our vessels do but each end of the boat serves either for head or stern as they please when they ply to windward and are minded to go about he that steers bears away a little from the wind by which means the stern comes to the wind which is now become the head only by shifting the end of the yard this boat is steered with a broad paddle instead of a rudder i have been the more particular in describing these boats because i do believe they sail the best of any boats in the world i did here for my own satisfaction try the swistness of one of them sailing by our log we had    knots on our reel and she run it all out before the half minuteglass was half out which if it had been no more is after the rate of    mile an hour but i do believe she would have run    mile an hour it was very pleasant to see the little boat running a long so swift by the others side  the native indians are no less dextrous in managing than in building these boats by report they will go from hence to another of the ladrone islands about  0 leagues off and there do their business and return again in less than    hours i was told that one of these boats was sent express to manila which is above  00 leagues and performed the voyage in   days time there are of these proes or boats used in many places of the east indies but with a belly and a little boat on each side only at mindanao i saw one like these with the belly and a little boat only on one side and the other flat but not so neatly built  the indians of guam have neat little houses very handsomely thatched with palmetothatch they inhabit together in villages built by the sea on the west side and have spanish priests to instruct them in the christian religion  the spaniards have a small fort on the west side near the south end with six guns in it there is a governor and  0 or  0 spanish soldiers there are no more spaniards on this island beside   or   priests not long before we arrived here the natives rose on the spaniards to destroy them and did kill many but the governor with his soldiers at length prevailed and drove them out of the fort so when they found themselves disappointed of their intent they destroyed the plantations and stock and then went away to other islands there were then   or  00 indians on this island but now there are not above  00 for all that were in this conspiracy went away as for these who yet remain if they were not actually concerned in that broil yet their hearts also are bent against the spaniards for they offered to carry us to the fort and assist us in the conquest of the island but c swan was not for molesting the spaniards here  before we came to an anchor here one of the priests came aboard in the night with   indians they first haled us to know from whence we came and what we were to whom answer was made in spanish that we were spaniards and that we came from acapulco it being dark they could not see the make of our ship nor very well discern what we were therefore we came aboard but perceiving the mistake they were in in taking us for a spanish ship they endeavored to get from us again but we held their boat fast and made them ome in capt swan received the priest with much civility and conducting him into the great cabin declared that the reason of our coming to this island was want of provison and that he came not in any hostile manner but as a friend to purchase with his money what he wanted and therefore desired the priest to write a letter to the governor to inform him what we were and on what account we came for having him now aboard the captain was willing to detain him as an hostage till we had provision the padre told captain swan that provision was now scarce on the island but he would engage that the governor would do his utmost to furnish us  in the morning the indians in whose boat or proe the friar came aboard were sent to the governor with two letters one from the friar and another very obliging one from captain swan and a present of four yards of scarletcloath and a piece of broad silver and gold lace the governor lives near the south end of the island on the west side which was about   leagues from the place where we were therefore we did not expect an answer till the evening not knowing then how nimble they were therefore when the indian canoa was dispatched away to the governor we hoised out   of our canoas and sent one a fishing and the other ashore for coconuts our fishing canoa got nothing but the men that went ashore for coconuts came off laden  about    a clock that same morning the governor of the island sent a letter to capt swan complimenting him for his present and promising to support us with as much provision as he could possibly spare and as a token of his gratitude he sent a present of   hogs of a small sort most excellent meat the best i think that ever i eat they are fed with coconuts and their flesh is hard as brisket beef they were doubtless of that breed in america which came originally from spain he sent also    muskmelons larger than ours in england and as many watermelons both sorts here being a very excellent fruit and sent an order to the indians that lived in a village not far from our ship to bake every day as much of the breadfruit as we did desire and to assist us in getting as many dry coconuts as we would have which they accordingly did and brought off the breadfruit every day hot as much as we could eat after this the governor sent every day a canoa or two with hogs and fruit and desired for the same powder shot and arms which was sent according to his request we had a delicate large english dog which the governor did desire and had it given him very freely by the captain though much against the grain of many of his men who had a great value for that dog captain swan endeavored to get this governors letter of recommendation to some merchants at manila for he had then a design to go to fort st george and from thence intended to trade to manila but this his design was concealed from the company while we lay here the acapulco ship arrived in sight of the island but did not come in the sight of us for the governor sent an indian proe with advice of our being here therefore she stood off to the southward of the island and coming foul of the same shole that our bark had run over before was in great danger of being lost there for she struck off her rudder and with much ado got clear but not till after three days labor for though the shole be so near the island and the indians go off and fish there every day yet the master of the acapulco ship who should one would think know these parts was utterly ignorant of it this their striking on the shole we heard afterward when we were on the coast of manila but these indians of guam did speak of her being in sight of the island while we lay there which put our men in a great heat to go out after her but captain swan persuaded them out of that humor for he was now wholly averse to any hostile action  the  0th day of may the governor sent his last present which was some hogs a jar of pickled mangoes a jar of excellent pickled fish and a jar of fine rusk or bread of fine wheat flower baked like biscuit but not so hard he sent besides   or   packs of rice desiring to be excused from sending any more provision to us saying he had no more on the island that he could spare he sent word also that the west monsoon was at hand that therefore it behoved us to be jogging from hence unless we were resolved to return back to america again captain swan returned him thanks for his kindness and advice and took his leave and the same day sent the friar ashore that was seized on at our first arrival and gave him a large brass clock an astrolable and a large telescope for which present the friar sent us aboard six hogs and a roasting pig   or   bushels of potatoes and  0 pound of manila tobacco then we prepared to be gone being pretty well furnished with provision to carry us to mindanao where we designed next to touch we took aboard us as many coconuts as we could well stow and we had a good stock of rice and about  0 hogs in salt  chap xi they resolve to go to mindanao their departare from guam of the philippine islands the isle luconia and its chief town and port manilo manila or manilbo of the rich trade we might establish with these islands st johns island they arrive at mindanao the island described its fertility the libby trees and the sago made of them the plantain tree fruit liquor and cloth a smaller plantain at mindanao the bonano of the clove bark cloves and nutmegs and the methods taken by the dutch to monopolize the spices the betelnut and arektree the durian and the jacatree and fruit the beasts of mindanao centapees or forty legs a venomous insect and others their fowls fish etc the temperature of the climate with the course of the winds tornadoes rain and temper of the air throughout the year  while we lay at guam we took up a resolution of going to mindanao one of the philippine islands being told by the friar and others that it was exceedingly well stored with provisions that the natives were mahometans and that they had formerly a commerce with the spaniards but that now they were at wars with them this island was therefore thought to be a convenient place for us to go to for besides that it was in our way to the east indies which we had resolved to visit and that the westerly monsoon was at hand which would oblige us to shelter somewhere in a short time and that we could not expect good harbors in a better place than in so large an island as mindanao besides all this i say the inhabitants of mindanao being then as we were told though falsely at wars with the spaniards our men who it should seem were very squeamish of plundering without license derived hopes from thence of getting a commission there from the prince of the island to plunder the spanish ships about manila and so to make mindanao their common rendezvous and it captain swan was minded to go to an english port yet his men who thought he intended to leave them hoped to get vessels and pilots at mindanao fit for their turn to cruize on the coast of manila as for captain swan he was willing enough to go thither as best suiting his own design and therefore this voyage was concluded on by general consent  accordingly june  d      we left guam bound for mindanao we had fair weather and a pretty smart gale of wind at east for   or   days and then it shifted to the s w being rainy but it soon came about again to the east and blew a gentle gale yet it often shuffled about to the s e for though in the east indies the winds shift in april yet we found this to be the shifting season for the winds here the other shifting season being in october sooner or later all over india as to our course from guam to the philippine islands we found it as i intimated before agreeable enough with the account of our common draughts  the   st day of june we arrived at the island st john which is one of the philippine islands the philippines are a great company of large islands taking up about    degrees of lat in length reaching near upon from   d of north lat to the   th degree and in breadth about   degrees of longitude they derive this name from philip ii king of spain and even now they do most of them belong to that crown  the chiefest island in this range is luconia which lies on the north of them all at this island magellan died on the voyage that he was making round the world for after he had past those streights between the south end of america and terra del fuego which now bear his name and had ranged down in the south seas on the back of america from thence stretching over to the east indies he fell in with the ladrone islands and from thence steering east still he fell in with these philippine islands and anchored at luconia where he warred with the native indians to bring them in obedience to his master the king of spain and was by them killed with a poisoned arrow it is now wholly under the spaniards who have several towns there the chief is manilo which is a large seaport town near the s e end opposite to the island mindora it is a place of great strength and trade the two great acapulco ships before mentioned fetching from hence all sorts of east india commodities which are brought hither by foreigners especially by the chinese and the portuguese sometimes the english merchants of fort st george send their ships hither as it were by stealth under the charge of portuguese pilots and mariners for as yet we cannot get the spaniards there to a commerce with us or the dutch although they have but few ships of their own this seems to arise from a jealousy or fear of discovering the riches of these islands for most if not all the philippine islands are rich in gold and the spaniards have no place of much strength in all these islands that i could ever hear of besides manilo it self yet they have villages and towns on several of the islands and padres or priests to instruct the native indians from whom they get their gold  the spanish inhabitants of the smaller islands especially would willingly trade with us if the government was not so severe against it for they have no goods but what are brought from manilo at an extraordinary dear rate i am of the opinion that if any of our nations would seek a trade with them they would not lose their labor for the spaniards can and will smuggle as our seamen call trading by stealth as well as any nation that i know and our jamaicans are to their profit sensible enough of it and i have been informed that captain goodlud of london in a voyage which he made from mindanao to china touched at some of these islands and was civilly treated by the spaniards who bought some of his commodities giving him a very good price for the same  there are about    or    more large islands lying to the southward of luconia most of which as i said before are inhabited by the spaniards besides these there are an infinite number of small islands of no account and even the great islands many of them are without names or at least so variously set down that i find the same islands named by diverse names  the island st john and mindanao are the southermost of all these islands and are the only islands in all this range that are not subject to the spaniards  st johns island is on the east side of the mindanao and distant from it   or   leagues it is in lat about   or   north this island is in length about    leagues stretching n n w and s s e and it is in breadth about    leagues in the middle of the island the northermost end is broader and the southermost is narrower this island is of a good height and is full of many small hills the land at the southeast end where i was ashore is of a black fat mould and the whole island seems to partake of the same fatness by the vast number of large trees that it produces for it looks all over like one great grove  as we were passing by the s e end we saw a canoa of the natives under the shore therefore one of our canoas went after to have spoken with her but she run away from us seeing themselves chaced put their canoa ashore leaving her fled into the woods nor would be allured to come to us although we did what we could to entice them besides these men we saw no more here nor sign of any inhabitants at this end  when we came aboard our ship again we steered away for the island mindanao which was now fair in sight of us it being about  0 leagues distant from this part of st johns the   d day we came within a league of the east side of the island mindanao and having the wind at s e we steered toward the northend keeping on the east side till we came into the lat of   d  0 m and there we anchored in a small bay about a mile from the shore in  0 fathom water rocky foul ground  some of our books gave us an account that mindanao city and isle lies in   d  0 m we guest that the middle of the island might lie in this lat but we were at a great loss where to find the city whether on the east or west side indeed had it been a small island lying open to the eastern wind we might probably have searched first on the west side for commonly the islands within the tropicks or within the bounds of the tradewinds have their harbors on the west side as best sheltered but the island mindanao being guarded on the east side by st johns island we might as reasonably expect to find the harbor and city on this side as any where else but coming into the lat in which we judged the city might be found no canoas or people that might give us any umbrage of a city or place of trade near at hand though we coasted within a league of the shore  the island mindanao is the biggest of all the philippine islands except luconia it is about  0 leagues long and  0 or  0 broad the south end is in about   d n and the n w end reaches almost to   d n it is a very mountainous island full of hills and valleys the mould in general is deep and black and extraordinary fat and fruitful the sides of the hills are stony yet productive enough of very large tall trees in the heart of the country there are some mountains that yield good gold the valleys are well moistened with pleasant brooks and small rivers of delicate water and have trees of diverse sorts flourishing and green all the year the trees in general are very large and most of them are of kinds unknown to us  there is one sort which deserves particular notice called by the natives libbytrees these grow wild in great groves of   or   miles long by the sides of the rivers of these trees sago is made which the poor country people eat instead of bread   or   months in the year this tree for its body and shape is much like the palmetotree or the cabbagetree but not so tall as the latter the bark and wood is hard and thin like a shell and full of white pith like the pith of an elder this tree they cut down and split it in the middle and scrape out all the pith which they beat iustily with a wooden pestle in a great mortar or trough and then put it into a cloth or strainer held over a trough and pouring water in among the pith they stir it about in the cloth so the water carries all the substance of the pith through the cloth down into the trough leaving nothing in the cloth but a light sort of husk which they throw away but that which falls into the trough settles in a short time to the bottom like mud and then they draw off the water and take up the muddy substance wherewith they make cakes which being baked proves very good bread  the mindanao people live   or   months of the year on this food for their bread kind the native indians of teranate and tidore and all the spice islands have plenty of these trees and use them for food in the same manner as i have been informed by mr caril rofy who is now commander of one of the kings ships he was one of our company at this time and being left with captain swan at mindanao went afterward to teranate and lived there among the dutch a year or two the sago which is transported into other parts of the east indies is dried in small pieces like little seeds or comfits and commonly eaten with milk of almonds by those that are troubled with the flux for it is a great binder and very good in that distemper  in some places of mindanao there is plenty of rice but in the hilly land they plant yams potatoes and pumkins all which thrive very well the other fruits of this island are watermelons muskmelons plaintains bonanoes guavas nutmegs cloves betelnuts durians jacks or jacas coconuts oranges etc  the plantain i take to be the king of all fruit not except the coco it self the tree that bears this fruit is about   foot or   foot and an half round and about  0 or    foot high these trees are not raised from seed for they seem not to have any but from the roots of other old trees if these young suckers are taken out of the ground and planted in another place it will be    months before they bear but if let stand in their own native soil they will bear in    months as soon as the fruit is ripe the tree decays but then there are many young ones growing up to supply its place when this tree first springs out of the ground it comes up with two leaves and by that time it is a foot high two more springs up in the inside of them and in a short time after two more within them and so on by that time the tree is a month old you may perceive a small body almost as big as ones arm and then there are eight or ten leaves some of them four or five foot high the first leaves that it shoots forth are not above a foot long and half a foot broad and the stem that bears them no bigger than ones finger but as the tree grows higher the leaves are larger as the young leaves spring up up in the inside so the old leaves spread off and their tops droop downward being of a greater length and breadth by how much they are nearer the root and at last decay and rot off but still there are young leaves spring up out of the top which makes the tree look always green and flourishing when the tree is full grown the leaves are   or   foot long and a foot and half broad toward the end they are smaller and end with a round point the stem of the leaf is as big as a mans arm almost round and about a foot in length between the leaf and the body of the tree that part of the stem which comes from the tree if it be the outside leaf seems to enclose half the body as it were with a thick hide and right against it on the other side of the tree is another such answering to it the next two leaves in the inside of these grow opposite to each other in the same manner but so that if the two outward grow north and south these grow east and west and those still within them keep the same order thus the body of this tree seems to be made up of many thick skins growing one over another and when it is full grown there springs out of the top a strong stem harder in substance than any other part of the body this stem shoots forth at the heart of the tree is as big as a mans arm and as long and the fruit grows in clusters round it first blossoming and then shooting forth the fruit it is so excellent that the spaniards give it the preeminence of all other fruit as most conducing to life it grows in a cod about   or   inches long and as big as a mans arm the shell rind or cod is soft and of a yellow color when ripe it resembles in shape a hogsgut pudding the enclosed fruit is no harder than butter in winter and is much of the color of the purest yellow butter it is of a delicate taste and melts in ones mouth like marmalet it is all pure pulp without any seed kernel or stone this fruit is so much esteemed by all europeans that settle in america that when they make a new plantation they commonly begin with a good plantainwalk as they call it or a field of plantains and as their family increases so they augment the plantainwalk keeping one man purposely to prune the trees and gather the fruit as he sees convenient for the trees continue bearing some or other most part of the year and this is many times the whole food on which a whole family subsists they thrive only in rich fat ground for poor sandy will nor bear them the spaniards in their towns in america as at havana cartagena portabel etc have their markets full of plantains it being the common food for poor people their common price is half a riol or   d a dozen when this fruit is only used for bread it is roasted or boiled when it is just full grown but not yet ripe or turned yellow poor people or negroes that have neither fish nor flesh to eat with it make sauce with codpepper salt and limejuice which makes it eat very savory much better than a crust of bread alone sometimes for a change they eat a roasted plantain and a ripe raw plantain together which is instead of bread and butter they eat very pleasant so and i have made many a good meal in this manner sometimes our english take   or   ripe plantains and mashing them together make them into a lump and boil them instead of a bagpudding which they call a buffjacket and this is a very good way for a change this fruit makes also very good tarts and the green plantains sliced thin and dried in the sun and grated will make a sort of flour which is very good to make puddings a ripe plantain sliced and dried in the sun may be preserved a great while and then eats like figs very sweet and pleasant the darien indians preserve them a long time by drying them gently over the fire mashing them first and moulding them into lumps the moskito indians will take a ripe plantain and roast it then take a pint and half of water in a calabash and squeeze the plantain in pieces with their hands mixing it with the water then they drink it all off together this they call mishlaw and it is pleasant and sweet and nourishing somewhat like lambswool as it is called made with apples and ale and of this fruit alone many thousands of indian families in the west indies have their whole subsistence when they make drink with them they take  0 or    ripe plantains and mash them well in a trough then they put   gallons of water among them and this in   hours time will ferment and froth like wort in   hours it is fit to drink and then they bottle it and drink it as they have occasion but this will not keep above    or  0 hours those therefore that use this drink brew it in this manner every morning when i went first to jamaica i could relish no other drink they had there it drinks brisk and cool and is very pleasant this drink is windy and so is the fruit eaten raw but boiled or roasted it is not so if this drink is kept above  0 hours it grows sharp but if then it be put out into the sun it will become very good vinegar this fruit grows all over the west indies in the proper climates at guinea and in the east indies  as the fruit of this tree is of great use for food so is the body no less serviceable to make clothes but this i never knew till i came to this island the ordinary people of mindanao do wear no other cloth the tree never bearing but once and so being felled when the fruit is ripe they cut it down close by the ground if they intend to make cloth with it one blow with a hachet or long knife will strike it asunder then they cut off the top leaving the trunk   or  0 foot long stripping off the outer rind which is thickest toward the lower end having stripped   or   of these rinds the trunk becomes in a manner all of one bigness and of a whitish color then they split the trunk in the middle which being done they split the two halves again as near the middle as they can this they leave in the sun   or   days in which time part of the juicy substance of the tree dries away and then the ends will appear full of small threads the women whose employment it is to make the cloth take hold of those threads one by one which rend away easily from one end of the trunk to the other in bigness like whited brownthread for the threads are naturally of a determinate bigness as i observed their cloth to be all of one substance and equal fineness but it is stubborn when new wears out soon and when wet feels a little slimy they make their pieces   or   yards long their warp and woof all one thickness and substance  there is another sort of plantains in that island which are shorter and less than the others which i never saw any where but here these are full of black seeds mixed quite through the fruit they are binding and are much eaten by those that have fluxes the country people gave them us for that use and with good success  the bonano tree is exactly like the plantain for shape and bigness nor easily distinguishable from it but by its fruit which is a great deal smaller and not above half so long as a plantain being also more mellow and soft less luscious yet of a more delicate taste they use this for the making drink oftener than plantains and it is best when used for drink or eaten as fruit but it is not so good for bread nor does it eat well at all when roasted or boiled so it is only necessity that makes any use it this way they grow generally where plantains do being set intermixed with them purposely in their plantainwalks they have plenty of clovebark of which i saw a ship load and as for cloves raja laut whom i shall have occasion to mention told me that if the english would settle there they could order matters so in a little time as to send a shipload of cloves from thence every year i have been informed that they grow on the boughs of a tree about as big as a plumbtree but i never happened to see any of them  i have not seen the nutmegtrees any where but the nutmegs this island produces are sair and large yet they have no great store of them being unwilling to propagate them or the cloves for fear that should invite the dutch to visit them and bring them into subjection as they have done the rest of the neighboring islands where they grow for the dutch being seated among the spiceislands have monopolized all the trade into their own hands and will not suffer any of the natives to dispose of it but to themselves alone nay they are so careful to preserve it in their own hands that they will not suffer the spice to grow in the uninhabited islands but send soldiers to cut the trees down captain rofy told me that while he lived with the dutch he was sent with other men to cut down the spicetrees and that he himself did at several times cut down   or  00 trees yet although the dutch take such care to destroy them there are many uninhabited islands that have great plenty of spicetrees as i have been informed by dutch men that have been there particularly by a captain of a dutch ship that i met with at achin who told me that near the island banda there is an island where the cloves falling from the trees do lie and rot on the ground and they are at the time when the fruit falls   or   inches thick under the trees he and some others told me that it would not be a hard matter for an english vessel to purchase a ships cargo of spice of the natives of some of these spiceislands  he was a free merchant that told me this for by that name the dutch and english in the east indies distinguish those merchants who are not servants to the company the free merchants are not suffered to trade to the spiceislands nor to many other places where the dutch have factories but on the other hand they are suffered to trade to some places where the dutch company themselves may not trade as to achin particularly for there are some princes in the indies who will not trade with the company for fear of them the seamen that go to the spiceislands are obliged to bring no spice from thence for themselves except a small matter for their own use about a pound or two yet the masters of those ships do commonly so order their business that they often secure a good quantity and send it ashore to some place near batavia before they come into that harbor for it is always brought thither first before it is sent to europe and if they meet any vessel at sea that will buy their cloves they will sell  0 or    tuns out of  00 and yet seemingly carry their complement to batavia for they will pour water among the remaining part of their cargo which will swell them to that degree that the ships hold will be as full again as it was before any were sold this trick they use whenever they dispose of any clandestinely for the cloves when they first take them in are extraordinary dry and so will imbibe a great deal of moisture this is but one instance of many hundreds of little deceitful arts the dutch seamen have in these parts among them of which i have both seen and heard several i believe there are no where greater thieves and nothing will persuade them to discover one another for should any do it the rest would certainly knock him on the head but to return to the products of mindanao  the betelnut is much esteemed here as it is in most places of the east indies the beteltree grows like the cabbagetree but it is not so big nor so high the body grows strait about    or    foot high without leaf or branch except at the head there it spreads forth long branches like other trees of the like nature as the cabbagetree the coconut tree and the palm these branches are about  0 or    foot long and their stems near the head of the tree as big as a mans arm on the top of the tree among the branches the betelnut grows on a tough stem as big as a mans finger in clusters much as the coconuts do and they grow  0 or  0 in a cluster this fruit is bigger than a nutmeg and is much like it but rounder it is much used all over the east indies their way is to cut it in four pieces and wrap one of them up in an arek leaf which they spread with a soft paste made of lime or plaster and then chew it altogether every man in these parts carries his limebox by his side and dipping his finger into it spreads his betel and arek leaf with it the arek is a small tree or shrub of a green bark and the leaf is long and broader than a willow they are packt up to sell into parts that have them not to chew with the betel the betelnut is most esteemed when it is young and before it grows hard and then they cut it only in two pieces with the green husk or shell on it it is then exceeding juicy and therefore makes them spit much it tastes rough in the mouth and dies the lips red and makes the teeth black but it preserves them and cleanses the gums it is also accounted very wholesome for the stomach but sometimes it will cause great giddiness in the head of those that are not used to chew it but this is the effect only of the old nut for the young nuts will not do it i speak of my own experience  this island produces also durians and jacks the trees that bear the durians are as big as apple trees full of boughs the rind is thick and rough the fruit is so large that they grow only about the bodies or on the limbs near the body like the cacao the fruit is about the bigness of a large pumkin covered with a thick green rough rind when it is ripe the rind begins to turn yellow but it is not fit to eat till it opens at the top then the fruit in the inside is ripe and sends forth an excellent scent when the rind is opened the fruit may be split into four quarters each quarter has several small cells that enclose a certain quantity of the fruit according to the bigness of the cell for some are larger than others the largest of the fruit may be as big as a pullets egg it is as white as milk and as soft as cream and the taste very delicious to those that are accustomed to them but those who have not been used to eat them will dislike them at first because they smell like roasted onions this fruit must be eaten in its prime for there is no eating of it before it is ripe and even then twill not keep above a day or two before it putrifies and turns black or of a dark color and then it is not good within the fruit there is a stone as big as a small bean which has a thin shell over it those that are minded to eat the stones or nuts roast them and then a thin shell comes off which incloses the nut and it eats like a chestnut  the jack or jaca is much like the durian both in bigness and shape the trees that bear them also are much a like and so is their manner of the fruits growing but the inside is different for the fruit of the durian is white that of the jack is yellow and fuller of stones the durian is most esteemed yet the jack is very pleasant fruit and the stones or kernels are good roasted  there are many other sorts of grain roots and fruits in this island which to give a particular description of would fill up a large volume  in this island are also many sorts of beasts both wild and tame as horses bulls and cows buffaloes goats wild hogs deer monkies guanos lizards snakes etc i never saw or heard of any beasts of prey here as in many other places the hogs are ugly creatures they have all great knobs growing over their eyes and there are multitudes of them in the woods they are commonly very poor yet sweet deer are here very plentiful in some places where they are not disturbed  of the venomous kind of creatures here are scorpions whose sting is in their tail and centapees called by the english  0 legs both which are also common in the west indies in jamaica and elsewhere these centapees are   or   inches long as big as a goosequill but flattish of a dun or reddish color on the back but belly whitish and full of legs on each side the belly their sting or bite is more raging than the scorpion they lie in old houses and dry timber there are several sorts of snakes some very poisonous there is another sort of creature like a guano both in color and shape but four times as big whose tongue is like a small harpoon having two beards like the beards of a fishook they are said to be very venomous but i know not their names i have seen them in other places also as at pulo condore or the island condore and at achin and have been told that they are in the bay of bengal  the fowls of this country are ducks and hens other tame fowl i have not seen nor heard of any the wild fowl are pigeons parrots parakits turtle doves and abundance of small fowls there are bats as big as a kite  there are a great many harbors creeks and good bays for ships to ride in and rivers navigable for canoas proes or barks which are all plentifully stored with fish of diverse sorts so is also the adjacent sea the chiefest fish are bonetas snooks cavallys bremes mullets  0 pounders etc here are also plenty of sea turtle and small manatee which are not near so big as those in the west indies the biggest that i saw would not weigh above  00 pound but the flesh both of the turtle and manatee are very sweet  the weather at mindanao is temperate enough as to heat for all it lies so near the equator and especially on the borders near the sea there they commonly enjoy the breezes by day and cooling land winds at night the winds are easterly one part of the year and westerly the other the easterly winds begin to blow in october and it is the middle of november before they are settled  these winds bring fair weather the westerly winds begin to blow in may but are not settled till a month afterward the west winds always bring rain tornadoes and very tempestuous weather at the first coming in of these winds they blow but faintly but then the tornadoes rise one in a day sometimes two these are thundershowers which commonly come against the wind bringing with them a contrary wind to what did blow before after the tornadoes are over the wind shifts about again and the sky becomes clear yet then in the valleys and the sides of the mountains there rises a thick fog which covers the land the tornadoes continue thus for a week or more then they come thicker two or three in a day bringing violent gusts of wind and terrible claps of thunder at last they come so fast that the wind remains in the quarter from whence these tornadoes do rise which is out of the west and there it settles till october or november when these westward winds are thus settled the sky is all in mourning being covered with black clouds pouring down excessive rains some times mixed with thunder and lightning that nothing can be more dismal the winds raging to that degree that the biggest trees are torn up by the roots and the rivers swell and overflow their banks and drown the low land carrying great trees into the sea thus it continues sometimes a week together before the sun or stars appear the fiercest of this weather is in the latter end of july and in august for then the towns seem to stand in a great pond and they go from one house to another in canoas at this time the water carries away all the filth and nastiness from under their houses whilst this tempestuous season lasts the weather is cold and chilly in september the weather is more moderate and the winds are not so fierce nor the rain so violent the air thenceforward begins to be more clear and delightsome but then in the morning there are thick fogs continuing till  0 or    a clock before the sun shines out especially when it has rained in the night in october the easterly winds begin to blow again and bring fair weather till april thus much concerning the natural state of mindanao  chap xii of the inhabitants and civil state of the isle of mindanao the mindanayans hilanoones sologues and alfoorees of the mindanayans properly so called their manners and habits the habits and manners of their women a comical custom at mindanao their houses their diet and washings the languages spoken there and transactions with the spaniards their fear of the dutch and seeming desire of the english their handycrafts and peculiar sort of smiths bellows their shipping commodities and trade the mindanao and manila tobacco a sort of leprosy there and other distempers their marriages the sultan of mindano his poverty power family etc the proes or boats here raja laut the general brother to the sultan and his family their way of fighting their religion raja lauts devotion a clock or drum in their mosques of their circumcision and the solemnity then used of other their religious observations and superstitions their abhorrence of swines flesh etc  this island is not subject to one prince neither is the language one and the same but the people are much alike in color strength and stature they are all or most of them of one religion which is mahometanism and their customs and manner of living are alike the mindanao people more particularly so called are the greatest nation in the island and trading by sea with other nations they are therefore the more civil i shall say but little of the rest being less known to me but so much as has come to my knowledge take as follows there are besides the mindanayans the hilanoones as they call them or the mountaneers the sologues and alsoores  the hilanoones live in the heart of the country they have little or no commerce by sea yet they have proes that row with    or    oars apiece they enjoy the benefit of the gold mines and with their gold buy foreign commodities of the mindanao people they have also plenty of beeswax which they exchange for other commodities  the sologues inhabit the n w end of the island they are the least nation of all they trade to manila in proes and to some of the neighboring islands but have no commerce with the mindanao people  the alsoores are the same with the mindanayans and were formerly under the subjection of the sultan of mindanao but were divided between the sultans children and have of late had a sultan of their own but having by marriage contracted an alliance with the sultan of mindanao this has occasioned that prince to claim them again as his subjects and he made war with them a little after we went away as i afterward understood  the mindanayans properly so called are men of mean statures small limbs straight bodies and little heads their faces are oval their foreheads flat with black small eyes short low noses pretty large mouths their lips thin and red their teeth black yet very sound their hair black and straight the color of their skin tawney but inclining to a brighter yellow than some other indians especially the women they have a custom to wear their thumbnails very long especially that on their left thumb for they do never cut it but scrape it often they are endued with good natural wits are ingenious nimble and active when they are minded but generally very lazy and thievish and will not work except forced by hunger this laziness is natural to most indians but these peoples laziness seems rather to proceed not so much from their natural inclinations as from the severity of their prince of whom they stand in awe for he dealing with them very arbitrarily and taking from them what they get this damps their industry so they never strive to have any thing but from hand to mouth they are generally proud and walk very stately they are civil enough to strangers and will easily be acquainted with them and entertain them with great freedom but they are implacable to their enemies and very revengeful if they are injured frequently poisoning secretly those that have affronted them  they wear but few clothes their heads are circled with a short turbat fringed or laced at both ends it goes once about the head and is tied in a knot the laced ends hanging down they wear frocks and breeches but no stockings nor shoes  the women are fairer than the men and their hair is black and long which they tie in a knot that hangs back in their poles they are more round visaged than the men and generally well featured only their noses are very small and so low between their eyes that in some of the female children the rising that should be between the eyes is scarce discernable neither is there any sensible rising in their foreheads at a distance they appear very well but being nigh these impediments are very obvious they have very small limbs they wear but two garments a frock and a sort of petticoat the petticoat is only a piece of cloth sowed both ends together but it is made two foot too big for their wastes so that they may wear either end uppermost that part that comes up to their wastes because it is so much to big they gather it in their hands and twist it till it sits close to their wastes tucking in the twisted part between their waste and the edge of the petticoat which keeps it close the frock sits loose about them and reaches down a little below the waste the sleeves are a great deal longer than their arms and so small at the end that their hands will scarce go through being on the sleeve sits in folds about the wrist wherein they take great pride  the better sort of people have their garments made of long cloth but the ordinary sort wear cloth made of plantaintree which they call saggen by which name they call the plantain they have neither stocking or shoe and the women have very small feet  the women are very desirous of the company of strangers especially of white men and doubtless would be very familiar if the custom of the country did not debar them from that freedom which seems coveted by them yet from the highest to the lowest they are allowed liberty to converse with or treat strangers in the fight of their husbands  there is a kind of begging custom at mindanao that i have not met elsewhere with in all my travels and which i believe is owing to the little trade they have which is thus when strangers arrive here the mindanao men will come aboard and invite them to their houses and inquire who has a comrade which word i believe they have from the spaniards or a pagally and who has not a comrade is a familiar malefriend a pagally is an innocent platonic friend of the other sex all strangers are in a manner obliged to accept of this acquaintance and familiarity which must be first purchased with a small present and afterward confirmed with some gift or other to continue the acquaintance and as often as the stranger goes ashore he is welcome to his comrade or pagallys house where he may be entertained for his money to eat drink or sleep and complimented as often as he comes ashore with tobacco and betelnut which is all the entertainment he must expect gratis the richest mens wives are allowed the freedom to converse with her pagally in public and may give or receive presents from him even the sultans and the generals wives who are always coopt up will yet look out of their cages when a stranger passes by and demand of him if he wants a pagally and to invite him to their friendship will send a present of tobacco and betelnut to him by their servants  the chiefest city on this island is called by the same name of mindanao it is seated on the south side of the island in lat   d  0 m n on the banks of a small river about two mile from the sea the manner of building is somewhat strange yet generally used in this part of the east indies their houses are all built on posts about          or  0 foot high these posts are bigger or less according to the intended magnificence of the superstructure they have but one floor but many partitions or rooms and a ladder or stairs to go up out of the streets the roof is large and covered with palmeto or palmleaves so there is a clear passage like a piazza but a filthy one under the house some of the poorer people that keep ducks or hens have a fence made round the posts of their houses with a door to go in and out and this underroom serves for no other use some use this place for the common draught of their houses but building mostly close by the river in all parts of the indies they make the river receive all the filth of their house and at the time of the landfloods all is washed very clean  the sultans house is much bigger than any of the rest it stands on about   0 great posts or trees a great deal higher than the common building with great broad stairs made to go up in the first room he has about  0 iron guns all saker and minion placed on fieldcarriages the general and other great men have some guns also in their houses about  0 paces from the sultans house there is a small low house built purposely for the reception of ambassadors or merchant strangers this also stands on posts but the floor is not raised above three or four foot above the ground and is neatly matted purposely for the sultan and his council to sit on for they use no chairs but sit crossleggd like tailors on the floor  the common food at mindanao is rice or sago and a small fish or two the better sort eat buffalo or fowls ill dressed and abundance of rice with it they use no spoons to eat their rice but every man takes a handful out of the platter and by wetting his hand in water that it may not stick to his hand squeezes it into a lump as hard as possibly he can make it and then crams it into his mouth they all strive to make these lumps as big as their mouths can receive them and seem to vie with each other and glory in taking in the biggest lump so that sometimes they almost choke themselves they always wash after meals or if they touch any thing that is unclean for which reason they spend abundance of water in their houses this water with the washing of their dishes and what other filth they make they pour down near their fireplace for their chambers are not boarded but floored with split bamboes like lathe so that the water presently falls underneath their dwelling rooms where it breeds maggots and makes a prodigious stink besides this filthiness the sick people ease themselves and make water in their chambers there being a small hole made purposely in the floor to let it drop through but healthy sound people commonly ease themselves and make water in the river for that reason you shall always see abundance of people of both sexes in the river from morning till night some easing themselves others washing their bodies or clothes if they come into the river purposely to wash their clothes they strip and stand naked till they have done then put them on and march out again both men and women take great delight in swimming and washing themselves being bred to it from their infancy i do believe it is very wholesome to wash mornings and evenings in these hot countries at least three or four days in the week for i did use my self to it when i lived afterward at bencooly and found it very refreshing and comfortable it is very good for those that have fluxes to wash and stand in the river mornings and evenings i speak it experimentally for i was brought very low with that distemper at achin but by washing constantly mornings and evenings i found great benefit and was quickly cured by it  in the city of mindanao they speak two languages indifferently their own mindanao language and the malaya but in other parts of the island they speak only their proper language having little commerce abroad they have schools and instruct the children to read and write and bring them up in the mohammedan religion there fore many of the words especially their prayers are in arabic and many of the words of civility the same as in turkey and especially when they meet in the morning or take leave of each other they express themselves in that language  many of the old people both men and women can speak spanish for the spaniards were formerly settled among them and had several forts on this island and then they sent two friars to the city to convert the sultan of mindanao and his people at that time these people began to learn spanish and the spaniards incroached on them and endeavored to bring them into subjection and probably before this time had brought them all under their yoke if they themselves had not been drawn off from this island to manila to resist the chiness who threatened to invade them there when the spaniards were gone the old sultan of mindanao father to the present in whose time it was razed and demolished their forts brought away their guns and sent away the friars and since that time will not suffer the spaniards to settle on the islands  they are now most afraid of the dutch being sensible how they have inslaved many of the neighboring islands for that reason they have a long time desired the english to settle among them and have offered them any convenient place to build a fort in as the general himself told us giving this reason that they do not find the english so incroaching as the dutch or spanish the dutch are no less jealous of their admitting the english for they are sensible what detriment it would be to them if the english should settle here  there are but few tradesmen at the city of mindanao the chiefest trades are goldsmiths blacksmiths and carpenters there are but two or three goldsmiths these will work in gold or silver and make any thing that you desire but they have no shop furnished with ware ready made for sale here are several blacksmiths who work very well considering the tools that they work with their bellows are much different from ours they are made of a wooden cylinder the trunk of a tree about three foot long bored hollow like a pump and set upright on the ground on which the fire it self is made near the lower end there is a small hole in the side of the trunk next the fire made to receive a pipe through which the wind is driven to the fire by a great bunch of fine feathers fastened to one end of the stick which closing up the inside of the cylinder drives the air out of the cylinder through the pipe two of these trunks or cylinders are placed so nigh together that a man standing between them may work them both at once alternately one with each hand they have neither vice nor anvil but a great hard stone or a piece of an old gun to hammer upon yet they will perform their work making both common utensils and ironworks about ships to admiration they work altogether with charcoal every man almost is a carpenter for they can work with the ax and adds their ax is but small and so made that they can take it out of the helve and by turning it make an adds of it they have no saws but when they make plank they split the tree in two and make a plank of each part plaining it with the ax and adds this requires much pains and takes up a great deal of time but they work cheap and the goodness of the plank thus hewed which has its grain preserved entire makes amends for their cost and pains  they build good and serviceable ships or barks for the sea some for trade others for pleasure and some ships of war their trading vessels they send chiefly to manila thither they transport beeswax which i think is the only commodity besides gold that they vend there the inhabitants of the city of mindanao get a great deal of beeswax themselves but the greatest quantity they purchase is of the mountaneers from whom they also get the gold which they send to manila and with these they buy their calicoes muslins and china silk they send sometimes their barks to borneo and other islands but what they transport thither or import from thence i know not the dutch come hither in sloops from ternate and tidore and buy rice beeswax and tobacco for here is a great deal of tobacco grows on this island more than in any island or country in the east indies that i know of manila only excepted it is an excellent sort of tobacco but these people have not the art of managing this trade to their best advantage as the spaniards have at manila i do believe the seeds were first brought hither from manila by the spaniards and even thither in all probability from america the difference between the mindanao and manila tobacco is that the mindanao tobacco is of a darker color and the leaf larger and grosser than the manila tobacco being propagated or planted in a fatter soil the manila tobacco is of a bright yellow color of an indifferent size not strong but pleasant to smoke the spaniards at manila are very curious about this tobacco having a peculiar way of making it up nearly in the leaf for they take two little sticks each about a foot long and flat and placing the stalks of the tobacco leaves in a row  0 or  0 of them between the two sticks they bind them hard together so that the leaves hang dangling down one of these bundles is sold for a rial at fort st george but you may have  0 or    pound of tobacco at mindanao for a rial and the tobacco is as good or rather better than the manila tobacco but they have not that vent for it as the spaniards have  the mindanao people are much troubled with a sort of leprosy the same as we observed at guam this distemper runs with a dry scurf all over their bodies and causes great itching in those that have it making them frequently scratch and scrub themselves which raises the outer skin in small whitish flakes like the scales of little fish when they are raised on end with a knife this makes their skin extraordinary rough and in some you shall see broad white spots in several parts of their body i judge such have had it but are cured for their skins were smooth and i did not perceive them to scrub themselves yet i have learnt from their own mouths that these spots were from this distemper whether they use any means to cure themselves or whether it goes away of it self i know not but i did not perceive that they made any great matter of it for they did never refrain any company for it none of our people caught it of them for we were afraid of it and kept off they are sometimes troubled with the small pox but their ordinary distempers are fevers agues fluxes with great pains and gripings in their guts the country affords a great many drugs and medicinal herbs whose virtues are not unknown to some of them that pretend to cure the sick  the mindanao men have many wives but what ceremonies are used when they marry i know not there is commonly a great feast made by the bridegroom to entertain his friends and the most part of the night is spent in mirth  the sultan is absolute in his power over all his subjects he is but a poor prince for as i mentioned before they have but little trade and therefore cannot be rich if the sultan understands that any man has money if it be but  0 dollars which is a great matter among them he will send to borrow so much money pretending urgent occasions for it and they dare not deny him sometimes he will send to sell one thing or another that he has to dispose of to such whom he knows to have money and they must buy it and give him his price and if afterward he has occasion for the same thing he must have it if he sends for it he is but a little man between  0 or  0 years old and by relation very good natured but overruled by those about him he has a queen and keeps about    women or wives more in whose company he spends most of his time he has one daughter by his sultaness or queen and a great many sons and daughters by the rest these walk about the streets and would be always begging things of us but it is reported that the young princess is kept in a room and never stirs out and that she did never see any man but her father and raja laut her uncle being then about fourteen years old  when the sultan visits his friends he is carried in a small couch on four mens shoulders with eight or ten armed men to guard him but he never goes far this way for the country is very woody and they have but little paths which renders it the less commodious when he takes his pleasure by water he carries some of his wives along with him the proes that are built for this purpose are large enough to entertain  0 or  0 persons or more the hull is neatly built with a round head and stern and over the hull there is a small slight house built with bamboes the sides are made up with split bamboes about four foot high with little windows in them of the same to open and shut at their pleasure the roof is almost flat neatly thatched with palmeto leaves this house is divided into two or three small partitions or chambers one particularly for himself this is neatly matted underneath and round the sides and there is a carpit and pillows for him to sleep on the second room is for his women much like the former the third is for the servants who tend them with tobacco and betelnut for they are always chewing or smoking the fore and afterparts of the vessel are for the mariners to sit and row besides this they have outlayers such as those i described at guam only the boats and outlayers here are larger these boats are more round like the half moon almost and the bamboes or outlayers that reach from the boat are also crooked besides the boat is not flat on one side here as at guam but has a belly and outlayers on each side and whereas at guam there is a little boat fastened to the outlayers that lies in the water the beams or bamboes here are fastened traversewise to the outlayers on each side and touch not the water like boats but     or   foot above the water and serve for the barge men to sit and row and paddle on the inside of the vessel except only just before and abaft being taken up with the apartments for the passengers there run across the outlayers two tire of beams for the padlers to sit on on each side the vessel the lower tire of these beams is not a bove a foot from the water so that upon any the least reeling of the vessel the beams are dipped in the water and the men that sit are wet up to their waste their feet seldom escaping the water and thus as all our vessels are rowed from within these are paddled from without  the sultan has a brother called raja laut a brave man he is the second man in the kingdom all strangers that come hither to trade must make their address to him for all sea affairs belong to him he licenceth strangers to import or export any commodity and it is by his permission that the natives themselves are suffered to trade nay the very fishermen must ache a permit from him so that there is no man can come into the river or go out but by his leave he is two or three years younger than the sultan and a little man like him he has eight women by some of whom he has issue he has only one son about twelve or fourteen years old who was circumcised while we were there his eldest son died a little before we came hither for whom he was still in great heaviness if he had lived a little longer he should have married the young princess but whether this second son must have her i know not for i did never hear any discourse about it raja laut is a very sharp man he speaks and writes spanish which he learned in his youth he has by often conversing with strangers got a great sight into the customs of other nations and by spanish books has some knowledge of europe he is general of the mindanayans and is accounted an expert soldier and a very stout man and the women in their dances sing many songs in his praise  the sultan of mindanao sometimes makes war with his neighbors the mountaneers or alfoores their weapons are swords lances and some handcressets the cresset is a small thing like a baggonet which they always wear in war or peace at work or play from the greatest of them to the poorest or the meanest persons they do never meet each other so as to have a pitched battle but they build small works or forts of timber wherein they plant little guns and lie in sight of each other   or   months skirmishing every day in small parties and sometimes surprising a brestwork and whatever side is like to be worsted if they have no probability to escape by flight they sell their lives as dear as they can for there is seldom any quarter given but the conqueror cuts and hacks his enemies to pieces  the religion of these people is mahometanism friday is their sabbath but i did never see any difference that they make between this day and any other day only the sultan himself goes then to the mosque twice raja laut never goes to the mosque but prays at certain hours eight or ten times in a day where ever he is he is very punctual to his canonical hours and if he be aboard will go ashore on purpose to pray for no business nor company hinders him from this duty whether he is at home or abroad in a house or in the field he leaves all his company and goes about  00 yards off and there kneels down to his devotion he first kisses the ground then prays aloud and diverse times in his prayers he kisses the ground and does the same when he leaves off his servants and his wives and children talk and sing or play how they please all the time but himself is very serious the meaner sort of people have little devotion i did never see any of them at their prayers or go into a mosque  in the sultans mosque there is a great drum with but one head called a gong which is instead of a clock this gong is beaten at    a clock at     and   a man being appointed for that service he has a stick as big as a mans arm with a great knob at the end bigger than a mans fist made with cotton bound fast with small cords with this he strikes the gong as hard as he can about  0 strokes beginning to strike leisurely the first   or   strokes then he strikes faster and at last strikes as fast as he can and then he strikes again slower and slower so many more strokes thus he rises and falls three times and then leaves off till three hours after this is done night and day  they circumcise the males at    or    years of age or older and many are circumcised at once this ceremony is performed with a great deal of solemnity there had been no circumcision for some years before our being here and then there was one for raja lauts son they choose to have a general circumcision when the sultan or general or some other great person has a son fit to be circumcised for with him a great many more are circumcised there is notice given about   or  0 days before for all men to appear in arms and great preparation is made against the solemn day in the morning before the boys are circumcised presents are sent to the father of the child that keeps the feast which as i said before is either the sultan or some great person and about  0 or    a clock the mohammedan priest does his office he takes hold of the foreskin with two sticks and with a pair of scissors snips it off after this most of the men both in city and country being in arms before the house begin to act as if they were engaged with an enemy having such arms as i described only one acts at a time the rest make a great ring of   or  00 yards round about him he that is to exercise comes into the ring with a great shriek or two and a horrid look then he fetches two or three large stately strides and falls to work he holds his broad sword in one hand and his lance in the other and traverses his ground leaping from one side of the ring to the other and in a menacing posture and look bids defiance to the enemy whom his fancy frames to him for there is nothing but air to oppose him then he stamps and shakes his head and grinning with his teeth makes many ruful faces then he throws his lance and nimbly snatches out his cresset with which he hacks and hews the air like a madman often shrieking at last being almost tired with motion he flies to the middle of the ring where he seems to have his enemy at his mercy and with two or three blows cuts on the ground as if he was cutting off his enemys head by this time he is all of a sweat and withdraws triumphantly out of the ring and presently another enters with the like shrieks and gesture thus they continue combating their imaginary enemy all the rest of the day toward the conclusion of which the richest men act and at last the general and then the sultan concludes this ceremony he and the general with some other great men are in armor but the rest have none after this the sultan returns home accompanied with abundance of people who wait on him there till they are dismissed but at the time when we were there there was an after game to be played for the generals son being then circumcised the sultan intended to give him a second visit in the night so they all waited to attend him thither the general also provided to meet him in the best manner and therefore desired captain swan with his men to attend him accordingly captain swan ordered us to get our guns and wait at the generals house till further orders so about  0 of us waited till eight a clock in the evening when the general with captain swan and about  000 men went to meet the sultan with abundance of torches that made it as light as day the manner of the march was thus first of all there was a pageant and upon it two dancing women gorgeously apparelled with coronets on their heads full of glistering spangles and pendants of the same hanging down over their breast and shoulders these are women bred up purposely for dancing their feet and legs are but little employed except sometimes to turn round very gently but their hands arms head and body are in continual motion especially their arms which they turn and twist so strangely that you would think them to be made without bones besides the two dancing women there were two old women in the pageant holding each a lighted torch in their hands close by the two dancing women by which light the glittering spangles appeared very gloriously this pageant was carried by six lusty men then came six or seven torches lighting the general and captain swan who marched side by side next and we that attended captain swan followed close after marching in order six and six abrest with each man his gun on his shoulder and torches on each side after us came twelve of the generals men with old spanish matchlocks marching four in a row after them about forty lances and behind them as many with great swords marching all in order after them came abundance only with cressers by their fides who marched up close without any order when we came near the sultans house the sultan and his men met us and we wheeled off to let them pass the sultan had three pageants went before him in the first pageant were four of his sons who were about  0 or    years old they had gotten abundance of small stones which they roguishly threw about on the peoples heads in the next were four young maidens nieces to the sultan being his sisters daughters and in the  d there were three of the sultans children not above six years old the sultan himself followed next being carried in his couch which was not like your indian palankins but open and very little and ordinary a multitude of people came after without any order but as soon as he was past by the general and captain swan and all our men closed in just behind the sultan and so all marched together to the generals house we came thither between  0 and    a clock where the biggest part of the company were immediately dismissed but the sultan and his children and his nieces and some other persons of quality entered the generals house they were met at the head of the stairs by the generals women who with a great deal of respect conducted them into the house captain swan and we that were with him followed after it was not long before the general caused his dancing women to enter the room and divert the company with that pastime i had forgot to tell you that they have none but vocal music here by what i could learn except only a row of a kind of bells without clappers    in number and their weight increasing gradually from about three to ten pound weight these were set in a row on a table in the generals house where for seven or eightdays together before the circumcision day they were struck each with a little stick for the biggest part of the day making a great noise and they ceased that morning so these dancing women sung themselves and danced to their own music after this the generals women and the sultans sons and his nieces danced two of the sultans nieces were about    or    years old the other two were three or four years younger these young ladies were very richly dressed with loose garments of silk and small coronets on their heads they were much fairer than any women that i did ever see there and very well featured and their noses though but small yet higher than the other womens and very well proportioned when the ladies had very well diverted themselves and the company with dancing the general caused us to fire some skyrockets that were made by his and captain swans order purposely for this nights solemnity and after that the sultan and his retinue went away with a few attendants and we all broke up and thus ended this days solemnity but the boys being sore with their amputation went stradding for a fortnight after  they are not as i said before very curious or strict in observing any days or times of particular devotions except it be ramdam time as we call it the ramdam time was then in august as i take it for it was shortly after our arrival here in this time they fast all day and about seven a clock in the evening they spend near an hour in prayer toward the latter end of their prayer they loudly invoke their prophet for about a quarter of an hour both old and young bawling out very strangely as if they intended to fright him out of his sleepiness or neglect of them after their prayer is ended they spend some time in feasting before they take their repose thus they do every day for a whole month at least for sometimes it is two or three days longer before the ramdam ends for it begins at the new moon and lasts till they see the next new moon which sometimes in thick hazy weather is not till three or four days after the change as it happened while i was at achin where they continued the ramdam till the new moons appearance the next day after they have seen the new moon the guns are all discharged about noon and then the time ends  a main part of their religion consists in washing often to keep themselves from being defiled or after they are defiled to cleanse themselves again they also take great care to keep themselves from being polluted by tasting or touching any thing that is accounted unclean therefore swines flesh is very abominable to them nay any one that has either tasted of swines flesh or touched those creatures is not permitted to come into their houses in many days after and there is nothing will scare them more than a swine yet there are wild hogs in the islands and those so plentiful that they will come in troops out of the woods in the night into the very city and come under their houses to romage up and down the filth that they find there the natives therefore would even desire us to lie in wait for the hogs to destroy them which we did frequently by shooting them and carrying them presently on board but were prohibited their houses afterward  and now i am on this subject i cannot omit a story concerning the general he once desired to have a pair of shoes made after the english fashion though he did very seldom wear any so one our men made him a pair which the general liked very well afterward some body told him that the thread wherewith the shoes were sowed were pointed with hogsbristles this put him into a great passion so he sent the shoes to the man that made them and sent him withal more leather to make another pair with threads pointed with some other hair which was immediately done and then he was well pleased  chap xiii their coasting along

swan and some of his men several others poisoned there  having in the two last chapters given some account of the natural civil and religious state of mindanao i shall now go on with the prosecution of our affairs during our stay there  twas in a bay on the n east side of the island that we came to an anchor as has been said we lay in this bay but one night and part of the next day yet there we got speech with some of the natives who by signs made us to understand that the city mindanao was on the west side of the island we endeavored to persuade one of them to go with us to be our pilot but he would not therefore in the afternoon we loosed from hence steering again to the south east having the wind at s w when we came to the s e end of the island mindanao we saw two small islands about three leagues distant from it we might have passed between them and the main island as we learnt since but not knowing them nor what dangers we might encounter there we chose rather to sail to the eastward of them but meeting very strong westerly winds we got nothing forward in many days in this time we first saw the islands meangis which are about    leagues distant from the mindanao bearing s e i shall have occasion to speak more of them hereafter  the  th day of july we got into a deep bay four leagues n w from the two small islands before mentioned but the night before in a violent tornado our bark being unable to beat any longer bore away which put us in some pain for fear she was overset as we had like to have been our selves we anchored on the south west side of the bay in fifteen fathom water about a cables length from the shore here we were forced to shelter our selves from the violence of the weather which was so boisterous with rains and tornadoes and a strong westerly wind that we were very glad to find this place to anchor in being the only shelter on this side from the west winds  this bay is not above two mile wide at the mouth but farther in it is three leagues wide and seven fathom deep running in n n w there is a good depth of water about four or five leagues in but rocky foul ground for about two leagues in from the mouth on both sides of the bay except only in that place where we lay about three leagues in from the mouth on the eastem side there are fair sandy bays and very good anchoring in four five and six fathom the land on the east side is high mountainous and woody yet very well watered with small brooks and there is one river large enough for canoes to enter on the west side of the bay the land is of a mean height with a large savannah bordering on the sea and stretching from the mouth of the bay a great way to the westward  this savannah abounds with long grass and it is plentifully stocked with deer the adjacent woods are a covert for them in the heat of the day but mornings and evenings they feed in the open plains as thick as in our parks in england i never saw any where such plenty of wild deer though i have met with them in several parts of america both in the north and south seas  the deer live here pretty peaceably and unmolested for there are no inhabitants on that side of the bay we visited this savannah every morning and killed as many deer as we pleased sometimes    or    in a day and we did eat nothing but venison all the time we staid here  we saw a great many plantations by the sides of the mountains on the east side of the bay and we went to one of them in hopes to learn of the inhabitants whereabouts the city was that we might not oversail it in the night but they fled from us  we lay here till the   th day before the winds abated of their fury and then we sailed from hence directing our course to the westward in the morning we had a land wind at north at    a clock the sea breeze came at west just in our teeth but it being fair weather we kept on our way turning and taking the advantage of the land breezes by night and the sea breezes by day  being now past the s e part of the island we coasted down on the south side and we saw abundance of canoas a fishing and now and then a small village neither were these inhabitants afraid of us as the former but came aboard yet we could not understand them nor they us but by signs and when we mentioned the word mindanao they would point toward it  the   th day of july we arrived before the river of mindanao the mouth of which lies in lat   d    m n and is laid in     d    m longitude west from the lizard in england we anchored right against the river in    fathom water clear hard sand about   miles from the shore and   or   miles from a small island that lay without us to the southward we fired   or   guns i remember not well which and were answered again with   from the shore for which we gave one again immediately after our coming to an anchor raja laut and one of the sultans sons came off in a canoa being rowed with  0 oars and demanded in spanish what we were and from whence we came mr smith he who was taken prisoner at leon in mexico answered in the same language that we were english and that we had been a great while out of england they told us that we were welcome and asked us a great many questions about england especially concerning our east india merchants and whether we were sent by them to settle a factory here mr smith told them that we came hither only to buy provision they seemed a little discontented when they understood that we were not come to settle among them for they had heard of our arrival on the east side of the island a great while before and entertained hopes that we were sent purposely out of england hither to settle a trade with them which it should seem they are very desirous of for capt goodlud had been here not long before to treat with them about it and when he went away told them as they said that in a short time they might expect an ambassador from england to make a full bargain with them  indeed upon mature thoughts i should think we could not have done better than to have complied with the desire they seemed to have of our settling here and to have taken up our quarters among them for as thereby we might better have consulted our own profit and satisfaction than by the other loose roving way of life so it might probably have proved of public benefit to our nation and been a means of introducing an english settlement and trade not only here but through several of the spiceislands which lie in its neighborhood  for the islands meangis which i mentioned in the beginning of this chapter lie within twenty leagues of mindanao these are three smalls islands that abound with gold and cloves if i may credit my author prince jeoly who was born on one of them and was at that time a slave in the city of mindanao he might have been purchased by us of his master for a small matter as he was aftewards by mr moody who came hither to trade and laded a ship with clovebark and by transporting him home to his own country we might have gotten a trade there but of prince jeoly i shall speak more hereafter these islands are as yet probably unknown to the dutch who as i said before endeavor to ingross all the spice into their own hands  there was another opportunity offered us here of settling on another spiceisland that was very well inhabited for the inhabitants fearing the dutch and understanding that the english were settling at mindanao their sultan sent his nephew to mindanao while we were there to invite us thither captain swan conferred with him about it diverse times and i do believe he had some inclination to accept the offer and i am sure most of the men were for it but this never came to a head for want of a true understanding between captain swan and his men as may be declared hereafter  beside the benefit which might accrue from this trade with meangis and other the spice islands the philippine islands themselves by a little care and industry might have afforded us a very beneficial trade and all these trades might have been managed from mindanao by settling there first for that island lies very convenient for trading either to the spiceislands or to the rest of the philippine islands since as its soil is much of the same nature with either of them so it lies as it were in the center of the gold and spice trade in these parts the islands north of mindanao abounding most in gold and those south of meangis in spice  as the island mindanao lies very convenient for trade so considering its distance the way thither may not be overlong and tiresome the course that i would choose should be to set out of england about the latter end of august and to pass round terra del fuego and so stretching over toward new holland coast it along that shore till i came near to mindanao or first i would coast down near the american shore as far as i found convenient and then direct my course accordingly for the island by this i should avoid coming near any of the dutch settlements and he sure to meet always with a constant brisk easterly trade wind after i was once past terra del fuego whereas in passing about the cape of good hope after you are shot over the eastindian ocean and are come to the islands you must pass through the streights of malacca or sandy or else some other streights east from java where you will be sure to meet with countrywinds go on which side of the equator you please and this would require ordinarily   or   months for the voyage but the other i should hope to perform in   or   at most in your return from thence also you must observe the same rule as the spaniards do in going from manila to acapulco only as they run toward the north pole for variable winds so you must run to the southward till you meet with a wind that will carry you over to terra del fuego there are places enough to touch at for refreshment either going or coming you may touch going thither on either side of terra patagonica or if you please at the gallapagoes islands where there is refreshment enough and returning you may probably touch somewhere on new holland and so make some profitable discovery in these places without going out of your way and to speak my thoughts freely i believe it is owing to the neglect of this easy way that all that vast tract of terra australis which bounds the south sea is yet undiscovered those that cross that sea seeming to design some business on the peruvian or mexican coast and so leaving that at a distance to confirm which i shall add what captain davis told me lately that after his departure from us at the haven of ria lexa as is mentioned in the  th chap he went after several traverses to the gallapagoes and that standing thence southward for wind to bring him about terra del fuego in the lat of    south about  00 leagues from copayapo on the coast of coili he saw a small sandy island just by him and that they saw to the westward of it a long tract of pretty high land tending away toward the north west out of sight this might probably be the coast of terra australis incognita  but to return to mindanao as to the capacity we were then in of settling our selves at mindanao although we were not sent out of any such design of settling yet we were as well provided or better considering all circumstances than if we had for there was scarce any useful trade but some or other of us understood it we had sawyers carpenters joyners brickmakers bricklayers shoemakers tailors etc we only wanted a good smith for great work which we might have had at mindanao we were very well provided with iron lead and all sorts of tools as saws axes hammers etc we had powder and shot enough and very good small arms if we had designed to build a fort we could have spared   or  0 guns out of our ship and men enough to have managed it and any affair of trade beside we had also a great advantage above raw men that are sent out of england into these places who proceed usually too cautiously coldly and formally to compass any considerable design which experience better teaches than any rules whatsoever besides the danger of their lives in so great and sudden a change of air whereas we were all inured to hot climates hardened by many fatigues and in general daring men and such as would not be easily baffled to add one thing more our men were almost tired and began to desire a quietus est and therefore they would gladly have seated themselves any where we had a good ship too and enough of us beside what might have been spared to manage our new settlement to bring the news with the effects to the owners in england for captain swan had already  000 l in gold which he and his merchants received for goods sold mostly to captain harris and his men which if he had laid but part of it out in spice as probably he might have done would have satisfied the merchants to their hearts content so much by way of digression  to proceed therefore with our first reception at mindanao raja laut and his nephew sat still in their canoa and would not come aboard us because as they said they had no orders for it from the sultan after about half an hours discourse they took their leaves first inviting captain swan ashore and promising him to assist him in getting provision which they said at present was scarce but in three or four months time the rice would be gathered in and then he might have as much as he pleased and that in the mean time he might secure his ship in some convenient place for fear of the westerly winds which they said would be very violent at the latter end of this month and all the next as we found them  we did not know the quality of these two persons till after they were gone else we should have fired some guns at their departure when they were gone a certain officer under the sultan came aboard and measured our ship a custom derived from the chinese who always measure the length and breadth and the depth of the hold of all ships that come to load there by which means they know how much each ship will carry but for what reason this custom is used either by the chinese or mindanao men i could never learn unless the mindanaians design by this means to improve their skill in shipping against they have a trade  captain swan considering that the season of the year would oblige us to spend some time at this island thought it convenient to make what interest he could with the sultan who might afterward either obstruct or advance his designs he therefore immediately provided a present to send ashore to the sultan viz   yards of scarlet cloth   yards of broad gold lace a turkish scimiter and a pair of pistols and to raja laut he sent   yards of scarlet cloth and   yards of silver lace this present was carried by mr henry more in the evening he was first conducted to raja lauts house where he remained till report thereof was made to the sultan who immediately gave order for all things to be made ready to receive him  about nine a clock at night a messenger came from the sultan to bring the present away then mr more was conducted all the way with torches and armed men till be came to the house where the sultan was the sultan with eight or ten men of his council were seated on carpets waiting his coming the present that mr more brought was laid down before them and was very kindly accepted by the sultan who caused mr more to sit down by them and asked a great many questions of him the discourse was in spanish by an interpreter this conference lasted about an hour and then he was dismissed and returned again to raja lauts house there was a supper provided for him and the boats crew after which he returned aboard  the next day the sultan sent for capt swan he immediately went ashore with a flag flying in the boats head and two trumpets sounding all the way when he came ashore he was met at his landing by two principal officers guarded along with soldiers and abundance of people gazing to see him the sultan waited for him in his chamber of audience where captain swan was treated with tobacco and betel which was all his entertainment  the sultan sent for two english letters for captain swan to read purposely to let him know that our east india merchants did design to settle here and that they had already sent a ship hither one of these letters was sent to the sultan from england by the east india merchants the chiefest things contained in it as i remember for i saw it afterward in the secretaries hand who was very proud to show it to us was to desire some privileges in order to the building of a fort there this letter was written in a very fair hand and between each line there was a gold line drawn the other letter was left by captain goodlud directed to any english men who should happen to come thither this related wholly to trade giving an account at what rate he had agreed with them for goods of the island and how european goods should be sold to them with an account of their weight and measures and their difference from ours  the rate agreed on for mindanao gold was    spanish dollars which is a current coin all over india the english ounce and    dollars the mindanao ounce but for beeswax and clovebark i do not remember the rate neither do i well remember the rates of europe commodities but i think the rate of iron was not above four dollars a hundred captain goodluds letter concluded thus trust none of them for they are all thieves but tace is latin for a candle we understood afterward that captain goodlud was robbed of some goods by one of the generals men and that he that robbed him was fled into the mountains and could not be found while captain goodlud was here but the fellow returning back to the city some time after our arrival here raja laut brought him bound to captain swan and told him what he had done desiring him to punish him for it as he pleased but captain swan excused himself and said it did not belong to him therefore he would have nothing to do with it however the general raja laut would not pardon him but punished him according to their own custom which i did never see but at this time  he was stripped stark naked in the morning at sunrising and bound to a post so that he could not stir hand nor foot but as he was moved and was placed with his face eastward against the sun in the afternoon they turned his face toward the west that the sun might still be in his face and thus he stood all day parcht in the sun which shines here excessively hot and tormented with the moskitos or gnats after this the general would have killed him if captain swan had consented to it i did never see any put to death but i believe they are barbarous enough in it the general told us himself that he put two men to death in a town where some of us were with him but i heard not the manner of it their common way of punishing is to strip them in this manner and place them in the sun but sometimes they lay them flat on their backs on the sand which is very hot where they remain a whole day in the scorching sun with the moskitos biting them all the time  this action of the general in offering captain swan the punishment of the thief caused captain swan afterward to make him the same offer of his men when any had offended the mindanao men but the general left such offenders to be punished by captain swan as he thought convenient so that for the least offense captain swan punished his men and that in the sight of the mindanaians and i think sometimes only for revenge as he did once punish his chief mate mr teat he that came captain of the bark to mindanao indeed at that time captain swan had his men as much under command as if he had been in a kings ship and had he known how to use his authority he might have led them to any settlement and have brought them to assist him in any design he had pleased  captain swan being dismissed from the sultan with abundance of civility after about two hours discourse with him went thence to raja lauts house raja laut had then some difference with the sultan and therefore he was not present at the sultans reception of our captain but waited his return and treated him and all his men with boiled rice and fowls he then told captain swan again and urged it to him that it would be best to get his ship into the river as soon as he could because of the usual tempestuous weather at this time of the year and that he should want no assistance to further him in any thing he told him also that as we must of necessity stay here some time so our men would often come ashore and he therefore desired him to warn his men to be careful to give no afront to the natives who he said were very revengeful that their customs being different from ours he feared that captain swans men might some time or other offend them though ignorantly that therefore he gave him this friendly warning to prevent it that his house should always be open to receive him or any of his men and that he knowing our customs would never be offended at any thing after a great deal of such discourse he dismissed the captain and his company who took their leave and came aboard  captain swan having seen the two letters did not doubt but that the english did design to settle a factory here therefore he did not much scruple the honesty of these people but immediately ordered us to get the ship into the river the river upon which the city of mindanao stands is but small and has not above  0 or    foot water on the bar at a springtide therefore we lightened our ship and the spring coming on we with much ado got her into the river being assisted by  0 or  0 mindanaian fishermen who lived at the mouth of the river raja laut himself being aboard our ship to direct them we carried her about a quarter of a mile up within the mouth of the river and there moored her head and stern in a hole where we always rode afloat after this the citizens of mindanao came frequently aboard to invite our men to their houses and to offer us pagallies twas a long time since any of us had received such friendship and therefore we were the more easily drawn to accept of their kindnesses and in a very short time most of our men got a comrade or two and as many pagallies especially such of us as had good cloths and ore of gold as many had who were of the number of those that accompanied captain harris over the isthmus of darien the rest of us being poor enough nay the very poorest and meanest of us could hardly pass the streets but we were even haled by force into their houses to be treated by them although their treats were but mean viz tobacco or betelnut or a little sweet spiced water yet their seeming sincerity simplicity and the manner of bestowing these gifts made them very acceptable when we came to their houses they would always be praising the english as declaring that the english and mindanaians were all one this they expressed by putting their two forefingers close together and saying that the english and mindanaians were samo samo that is all one then they would draw their forefingers half a foot asunder and say the dutch and they were bugeto which signifies so that they were at such distance in point of friendship and for the spaniards they would make a greater representation of distance than for the dutch fearing these but having felt and smarted from the spaniards who had once almost brought them under  captain swan did seldom go into any house at first but into raja lauts there he dined commonly every day and as many of his men as were ashore and had no money to entertain themselves resorted thither about twelve a clock where they had rice enough boiled and well dressed and some scraps of fowls or bits of buffaloe dressed very nastily captain swan was served a little better and his two trumpeters sounded all the time that he was at dinner after dinner raja laut would sit and discourse with him most part of the afternoon it was now the ramdam time therefore the general excused himself that he could not entertain our captain with dances and other pastimes as he intended to do when this solemn time was past besides it was the very height of the wet season and therefore not so proper for pastimes  we had now very tempestuous weather and excessive rains which so swelled the river that it overflowed its banks so that we had much ado to keep our ship safe for every now and then we should have a great tree come floating down the river and sometimes lodge against our bows to the endangering the breaking our cables and either the driving us in over the banks or carrying us out to sea both which would have been very dangerous to us especially being without ballast  the city is about a mile long of no great breadth winding with the banks of the river on the right hand going up though it has many houses on the other side too but at this time it seemed to stand as in a pond and there was no passing from one house to another but in canoas this tempestuous rainy weather happened the latter end of july and lasted most part of august  when the bad weather was a little assuaged captain swan hired a house to put our sails and goods in while we carrend our ship we had a great deal of iron and lead which was brought ashore into this house of these commodities captain swan sold to the sultan or general eight or ten tuns at the rates agreed on by captain goodlud to be paid in rice the mindanaians are no good accomptants theresore the chinese that live here do cast up their accounts for them after this captain swan bought timber trees of the general and set some of our men to saw them into planks to sheath the ships bottom he had two whipsaws on board which he brought out of england and four or five men that knew the use of them for they had been sawyers in jamaica  when the ramdam time was over and the dry time set in a little the general to oblige captain swan entertained him every night with dances the dancing women that are purposely bred up to it and make it their trade i have already described but beside them all the women in general are much addicted to dancing they dance  0 or  0 at once and that standing all round in a ring joined hand in hand and singing and keeping time but they never budge out of their places nor make any motion till the chorus is sung then all at once they throw out one leg and bawl out aloud and sometime they only clap their hands when the chorus is sung captain swan to retaliate the generals favors sent for his violins and some that could dance english dances wherewith the general was very well pleased they commonly spent the biggest part of the night in these sort of pastimes  among the rest of our men that did use to dance thus before the general there was one john thacker who was a seaman bred and could neither write nor read but had formerly learnt to dance in the musickhouses about wapping this man came into the south seas with captain harris and getting with him a good quantity of gold and being a pretty good husband of his share had still some left besides what he laid out in a very good suit of clothes the general supposed by his garb and his dancing that he had been of noble extraction and to be satisfied of his quality asked of one of our men if he did not guess aright of him the man of whom the general asked this question told him he was much in the right and that most of our ships company were of the like extraction especially all those that had fine clothes and that they came abroad only to see the world having money enough to bear their exexpences wherever they came but that for the rest those that had but mean clothes they were only common seamen after this the general showed a great deal of respect to all that had good clothes but especially to john thacker till captain swan came to know the business and marred all undeceiving the general and drubbing the nobleman for he was so much incensed against john thacker that he could never endure him afterward though the poor fellow knew nothing of the matter  about the middle of november we began to work on our ships bottom which we found very much eaten with the worm for this is a horrid place for worms we did not know this till after we had been in the river a month and then we found our canoas bottoms eaten like honeycombs our bark which was a single bottom was eaten through so that she could not swim but our ship was sheathed and the worm came no farther than the hair between the sheathing plank and the main plank we did not mistrust the generals knavery till now for when he came down to our ship and found us ripping off the sheathing plank and saw the firm bottom underneath he shook his head and seemed to be discontented saying he did never see a ship with two bottoms before we were told that in this place where we now lay a dutch ship was earen up in two months time and the general had all her guns and it is probable he did expect to have had ours which i do believe was the main reason that made him so forward in assisting us to get our ship into the river for when we went out again we had no assistance from him we had no worms till we came to this place for when we careend at the marias the worm had not touched us nor at guam for there we scrubbd nor after we came to the island mindanao for at the s e end of the island we heeld and scrubbd also the mindanaians are so sensible of these destructive insects that whenever they come from sea they immediately hale their ship into a dry dock and burn her bottom and there let her lie dry till they are ready to get to sea again the canoas or proes they hale up dry and never suffer them to be long in the water it is reported that those worms which get into a ships bottom in the salt water will die in the fresh water and that the fresh water worms will die in salt water but in brackish water both sorts will increase prodigiously now this place where we lay was sometimes brackish water yet commonly fresh but what sort of worm this was i know not some men are of opinion that these worms breed in the plank but i am persuaded they breed in the sea for i have seen millions of them swimming in the water particularly in the bay of panama for there captain davis captain swan and my self and most of our men did take notice of them diverse times which was the reason of our cleaning so often while we were there and these were the largest worms that i did ever see i have also seen them in virginia and in the bay of campeachy in the latter of which places the worms eat prodigiously they are always in bays creeks mouths of rivers and such places as are near the shore being never found far out at sea that i could ever learn yet a ship will bring them lodged in its plank for a great way  having thus ripped off all our wormeaten plank and clapped on new by the beginning of december      our ships bottom was sheathed and tallowed and the  0th day went over the bar and took aboard the iron and lead that we could not sell and began to fill our water and fetch aboard rice for our voyage but c swan remained ashore still and was not yet determined when to sail or whither but i am well assured that he did never intend to cruise about manila as his crew designed for i did once ask him and he told me that what he had already done of that kind he was forced to but now being at liberty he would never more engage in any such design for said he there is no prince on earth is able to wipe off the stain of such actions what other designs he had i know not for he was commonly very cross yet he did never propose doing any thing else but only ordered the provision to be got aboard in order to sail and i am confident if he had made a motion to go to any english factory most of his men would have consented to it though probably some would have still opposed it however his authority might soon have overswayd those that were refractory for it was very strange to see the awe that these men were in of him for he punished the most stubborn and daring of his men yet when we had brought the ship out into the road they were not altogether so submissive as while it lay in the river though even then it was that he punished captain teat  i was at that time a hunting with the general for beef which he had a long time promised us but now i saw that there was no credit to be given to his word for i was a week out with him and saw but four cows which were so wild that we did not get one there were five or six more of our company with me these who were young men and had dalilahs there which made them fond of the place all agreed with the general to tell captain swan that there were beeves enough only they were wild but i told him the truth and advised him not to be too credulous of the generals promises he seemed to be very angry and stormed behind the generals back but in his presence was very mute being a man of small courage  it was about the  0th day of december when we returned from hunting and the general designed to go again to another place to hunt for beef but he stayed till after christmas day because some of us designed to go with him and captain swan had desired all his men to be aboard that day that we might keep it solemnly together and accordingly he sent aboard a buffaloe the day before that we might have a good dinner so the   th day about  0 a clock captain swan came aboard and all his men who were ashore for you must understand that near a third of our men lived constantly ashore with their comrades and pagallies and some with women servants whom they hired of their masters for concubines some of our men also had houses which they hired or bought for houses are very cheap for five or six dollars for many of them having more money than they knew what to do with eased themselves here of the trouble of telling it spending it very lavishly their prodigality making the people impose upon them to the making the rest of us pay the dearer for what we bought and to the endangering the like impositions upon such englishmen as may come here hereafter for the mindanaians knew how to get our squires gold from them for we had no silver and when our men wanted silver they would change now and then an ounce of gold and could get for it no more than  0 or    dollars for a mindanao ounce which they would not part with again under    dollars yet this and the great prices the mindanaians set on their goods were not the only way to lessen their stocks for their pagallies and comrades would often be begging somewhat of them and our men were generous enough and would bestow half an ounce of gold at a time in a ring for their pagallies or in a silver wristband or hoop to come about their arms in hopes to get a nights lodging with them  when we were all aboard on christmas day captain swan and his two merchants i did expect that captain swan would have made some proposals or have told us his designs but he only dined and went ashore again without speaking any thing of his mind yet even then i do think that he was driving on a design of going to one of the spice islands to load with spice for the young man before mentioned who i said was sent by his uncle the sultan of a spice island near ternate to invite the english to their island came aboard at this time and after some private discourse with captain swan they both went ashore together this young man did not care that the mindanaians should be privy to what he said i have heard captain swan say that he offered to load his ship with spice provided he would build a small fort and leave some men to secure the island from the dutch but i am since informed that the dutch have now got possession of the island  the next day after christmas the general went away again and five or six englishmen with him of whom i was one under pretense of going a hunting and we all went together by water in his proe together with his women and servants to the hunting place the general always carried his wives and children his servants his money and goods with him so we all embarked in the morning and arrived there before night i have already described the fashion of their proes and the rooms made in them we were entertained in the generals room or cabin our voyage was not so far but that we reached our port before night  at this time one of the generals servants had offended and was punished in this manner he was bound fast flat on his belly on a bamboe belonging to the proe which was so near the water that by the vessels motion it frequently delved under water and the man along with it and sometimes when hoisted up he had scarce time to blow before he would be carried under water again  when we had rowed about two leagues we entered a pretty large deep river and rowed up a league further the water salt all the way there was a pretty large village the houses built after the country fashion we landed at this place where there was a house made ready immediately for us the general and his women lay at one end of the house and we at the other end and in the evening all the women in the village danced before the general  while he staid here the general with his men went out every morning betimes and did not return till four or five a clock in the afternoon and he would often complement us by telling us what good trust and confidence he had in us saying that he left his women and goods under our protection and that he thought them as secure with us six for we had all our arms with us as if he had left  00 of his own men to guard them yet for all this great confidence he always left one of his principal men for fear some of us should be too familiar with his women  they did never stir out of their own room when the general was at home but as soon as he was gone out they would presently come into our room and sit with us all day and ask a thousand questions of us concerning our english women and our customs you may imagine that before this time some of us had attained so much of their language as to understand them and give them answers to their demands i remember that one day they asked how many wives the king of england had we told them but one and that our english laws did not allow of any more they said it was a strange custom that a man should be consined to one woman some of them said it was a very bad law but others again said it was a good law so there was a great dispute among them about it but one of the generals women said positively that our law was better than theirs and made them all silent by the reason which she gave for it this was the war queen as we called her for she did always accompany the general when ever he was called out to engage his enemies but the rest did not  by this familiarity among the women and by often discoursing them we came to be acquainted with their customs and privileges the general lies with his wives by turns but she by whom he had the first son has a double portion of his company for when it comes to her turn she has him two nights whereas the rest have him but one she with whom he is to lie at night seems to have a particular respect shown her by the rest all the precedent day and for a mark of distinction wears a striped silk handkerchief about her neck by which we knew who was queen that day  we lay here about five or six days but did never in all that time see the least sign of any beef which was the business we came about neither were we suffered to go out with the general to see the wild kine but we wanted for nothing else however this did not please us and we often importuned him to let us go out among the cattle at last he told us that he had provided a jar of ricedrink to be merry with us and after that we should go with him    the next day we went out with the general into the savannah where he had near  00 men making of a large pen to drive the cattle into for that is the manner of their hunting having no dogs but i saw not above   or  0 cows and those as wild as deer so that we got none this day yet the next day some of his men brought in   heifers which they killed in the savannah with these we returned aboard they being all that we got there  captain swan was much vexed at the generals actions for he promised to supply us with as much beef as we should want but now either could not or would not make good his promise besides he failed to perform his promise in a bargain of rice that we were to have for the iron which he sold him but he put us off still from time to time and would not come to any account neither were these all his tricks for a little before his son was circumcised of which i spoke in the foregoing chapter he pretended a great straight for money to defray the charges of that day and therefore desired captain swan to lend him about  0 ounces of gold for he knew that captain swan had a considerable quantity of gold in his possession which the general thought was his own but indeed had none but what belonged to the merchants however he lent it the general but when he came to an account with captain swan he told him that it was usual at such solemn times to make presents and that he received it as a gift he also demanded payment for the victuals that our captain and his men did eat at his house these things startled captain swan yet how to help himself he knew not but all this with other inward troubles lay hard on our captains spirits and put him very much out of humor for his own company also were pressing him every day to be gone because now was the height of the easterly monsoon the only wind to carry us farther into the indies  about this time some of our men who were weary and tired with wandering ran away into the country and absconded they being assisted as was generally believed by raja laut there were others also who fearing we should not go to an english port bought a canoa and designed to go in her to borneo for not long before a mindanao vessel came from thence and brought a letter directed to the chief of the english factory at mindanao this letter the general would have captain swan have opened but he thought it might come from some of the east india merchants whose affairs he would not intermeddle with and therefore did not open it i since met with captain bowry at achin and telling him this story he said that he sent that letter supposing that the english were settled there at mindanao and by this letter we also thought that there was an english factory at borneo so here was a mistake on both sides but this canoa wherewith some of them thought to go to borneo captain swan took from them and threatened the undertakers very hardly however this did not so far discourage them for they secretly bought another but their designs taking air they were again frustrated by captain swan  the whole crew were at this time under a general disaffection and full of very different projects and all for want of action the main division was between those that had money and those that had none there was a great difference in the humors of these for they that had money lived ashore and did not care for leaving mindanao whilst those that were poor lived aboard and urged capt swan to go to sea these began to be unruly as well as dissatisfied and sent ashore the merchants iron to sell for rack and honey to make punch wherewith they grew drunk and quarelsome which disorderly actions deterred me from going aboard for i did ever abhor drunkenness which now our men that were aboard abandoned themselves wholly to  yet these disorders might have been crushed if capt swan had used his authority to suppress them but he with his merchants living always ashore there was no command and therefore every man did what he pleased and encouraged each other in his villainies now mr harthop who was one of captain swans merchants did very much importune him to settle his resolutions and declare his mind to his men which at last he consented to do therefore he gave warning to all his men to come aboard the   th day of january       we did all earnestly expect to hear what captain swan would propose and therefore were very willing to go aboard but unluckily for him two days before this meeting was to be captain swan sent aboard his gunner to fetch something ashore out of his cabin the gunner rummaging to find what he was sent for among other things took out the captains journal from america to the island guam and laid down by him this journal was taken up by one john read a bristol man whom i have mentioned in my  th chapter he was a pretty ingenious young man and of a very civil carriage and behavior he was also accounted a good artist and kept a journal and was now prompted by his curiosity to peep into captain swans journal to see how it agreed with his own a thing very usual among seamen that keep journals when they have an opportunity and especially young men who have no great experience at the first opening of the book he light on a place in which captain swan had inveighed bitterly against most of his men especially against another john reed a jamaica man this was such stuff as he did not seek after but hitting so pat on this subject his curiosity led him to pry farther and therefore while the gunner was busy he conveyed the book away to look over it at his leisure the gunner having dispatched his business locked up the cabbindoor not missing the book and went ashore then john reed showed it to his namesake and to the rest that were aboard who were by this time the biggest part of them ripe for mischief only wanting some fair pretense to set themselves to work about it therefore looking on what was written in this journal to be matter sufficient for them to accomplish their ends captain teat who as i said before had been abused by captain swan laid hold on this opportunity to be revenged for his injuries and aggravated the matter to the height persuading the men to turn out captain swan from being commander in hopes to have commanded the ship himself as for the seamen they were easily persuaded to any thing for they were quite tired with this long and tedious voyage and most of them despaired of ever getting home and therefore did not care what they did or whither they went it was only want of being busied in some action that made them so uneasy therefore they consented to what teat proposed and immediately all that were aboard bound themselves by oath to turn captain swan out and to conceal this design from those that were ashore until the ship was under sail which would have been presently if the surgeon or his mate had been aboard but they were both ashore and they thought it no prudence to go to sea without a surgeon therefore the next morning they sent ashore one john cookworthy to hasten off either the surgeon or his mate by pretending that one of the men in the night broke his leg by falling into the hold the surgeon told him that he intended to come aboard the next day with the captain and would not come before but sent his mate herman coppinger  this man sometime before this was sleeping at his pagallies and a snake twisted himself about his neck but after wards went away without hurting him in this country it is usual to have the snakes come into the houses and into the ships too for we had several came aboard our ship when we lay in the river but to proceed herman coppinger provided to go aboard and the next day being the time appointed for captain swan and all his men to meet aboard i went aboard with him neither of us mistrusted what was designing by those aboard till we came thither then we found it was only a trick to get the surgeon off for now having obtained their desires the canoa was sent ashore again immediately to desire as many as they could meet to come aboard but not to tell the reason left captain swan should come to hear of it  the   th day in the morning they weighed and fired a gun capt swan immediately sent aboard mr nelly who was now his chief mate to see what the matter was to him they told all their grievances and showed him the journal he persuaded them to stay till the next day for an answer from captain swan and the merchants so they came to an anchor again and the next morning mr harthop came aboard he persuaded them to be reconciled again or at least to stay and get more rice but they were deaf to it and weighed again while he was aboard yet at mr harthops persuasion they promised to stay till   a clock in the afternoon for captain swan and the rest of the men if they would come aboard but they suffered no man to go ashore except one william williams that had a wooden leg and another that was a sawyer  if capt swan had yet come aboard he might have dashed all their designs but he neither came himself as a captain of any prudence and courage would have done nor sent till the time was expired so we left captain swan and about    men ashore in the city and   or   that run away and about    we had buried there the most of which died by poison the natives are very expert at poisoning and do it upon small occasions nor did our men want for giving offense through their general rogueries and sometimes by dallying too familiarly with their women even before their faces some of their poisons are slow and lingering for we had some now aboard who were poisoned there but died not till some months after  chap xiv they depart from the river of mindanao of the time lost or gained in sailing round the world with a caution to

the afternoon we sailed from the river of mindanao designing to cruise before manila  it was during our stay at mindanao that we were first made sensible of the change of time in the course of our voyage for having traveled so far westward keeping the same course with the sun we must consequently have gained something insensibly in the length of the particular days but have lost in the tale the bulk or number of the days or hours according to the different longitudes of england and mindanao this isle being west from the lizzard by common computation about   0 degrees the difference of time at our arrival at mindanao ought to be about    hours and so much we should have anticipated our reckoning having gained it by bearing the sun company now the natural day in every particular place must be consonant to it self but this going about with or against the suns course will of necessity make a difference in the calculation of the civil day between any two places accordingly at mindanao and all other places in the east indies we found them reckoning a day before us both natives and europeans for the europeans coming eastward by the cape of good hope in a course contrary to the sun and us wherever we met they were a full day before us in their accounts so among the indian mahometans here their friday the day of their sultans going to their mosques was thursday with us though it were friday also with those who came eastward from europe yet at the ladrone islands we found the spaniards of guam keeping the same computation with our selves the reason of which i take to be that they settled that colony by a course westward from spain the spaniards going first to america and thence to the ladrones and philippines but how the reckoning was at manila and the rest of the spanish colonies in the philippine islands i know not whether they keep it as they brought it or corrected it by the accounts of the natives and of the portugueze dutch and english coming the contrary way from europe  one great reason why seamen ought to keep the difference of time as exact as they can is that they may be the more exact in their latitudes for our tables of the suns declination being calculated for the meridians of the places in which they were made differ about    minutes from those parts of the world that lie on their opposite meridians in the months of march and september and in proportion to the suns declination at other times of the year also and should they run farther as we did the difference would still increase upon them and be an occasion of great errors yet even able seamen in these voyages are hardly made sensible of this though so necessary to be observed for want of duly attending to the reason of it as it happened among those of our crew who after we had past   0 degrees began to decrease the difference of declination whereas they ought still to have increased it for it all the way increased upon us  we had the wind at n n e fair clear weather and a brisk gale we coasted to the westward on the south side of the island of mindanao keeping within   or   leagues of the shore the land from hence tends away w by s it is of a good height by the sea and very woody and in the country we saw high hills  the next day we were abrest of chambongo a town in this island and  0 leagues from the river of mindanao here is said to be a good harbor and a great settlement with plenty of beef and buffaloe it is reported that the spaniards were formerly fortified here also there are two shoals lie off this place   or   leagues from the shore from hence the land is more low and even yet there are some hills in the country  about   leagues before we came to the west end of the island mindanao we fell in with a great many small low islands or keys and about two or three leagues to the southward of these keys there is a long island stretching n e and s w about    leagues this island is low by the sea on the northside and has a ridge of hills in the middle running from one end to the other between this isle and the small keys there is a good large channel among the keys also there is a good depth of water and a violent tide but on what point of the compass it flows i know not nor how much it rises and falls  the   th day we anchored on the east side of all these keys in   fathom water clean sand here are plenty of green turtle whose flesh is as sweet as any in the west indies but they are very shy a little to the westward of these keys on the island mindanao we saw abundance of coconut trees therefore we sent our canoa ashore thinking to find inhabitants but found none nor sign of any but great tracts of hogs and great cattle and close by the sea there were ruins of an old fort the walls thereof were of a good height built with stone and lime and by the workmanship seemed to be spanish from this place the land trends w n w and it is of an indifferent height by the sea it run on this point of the compass   or   leagues and then the land trends away n n w   or   leagues farther making with many bluff points  we weighed again the   th day and went through between the keys but met such uncertain tides that we were forced to anchor again the   d day we got about the westermost point of all mindanao and stood to the northward plying under the shore and having the wind at n n e a fresh gale as we sailed along further we found the land to trend n n e on this part of the island the land is high by the sea with full bluff points and very woody there are some small sandy bays which afford streams of fresh water  here we met with two prows belonging to the sologues one of the mindanaiin nations beforementioned they came from manila laden with silks and calicoes we kept on this western part of the island steering northerly till we came abrest of some other of the philippine islands that lay to the northward of us then steered away toward them but still keeping on the west side of them and we had the winds at n n e  the  d of february we anchored in a good bay on the west side of the island in lat   d    min where we had    fathomwater good soft oaze this island has no name that we could find in any book but lies on the west side of the island sebo it is about   or  0 leagues long mountainous and woody at this place captain read who was the same captain swan had so much railed against in his journal and was now made captain in his room as captain teat was made master and mr henry more quartermaster ordered the carpenters to cut down our quarter deck to make the ship snug and the fitter for sailing when that was done we heeled her scrubbed her bottom and tallowed it then we filled all our water for here is a delicate small run of water  the land was pretty low in this bay the mould black and fat and the trees of several kinds very thick and tall in some places we found plenty of canes such as we use in england for walkingcanes these were shortjointed not above two foot and a half or two foot ten inches the longest and most of them not above two foot they run along on the ground like a vine or taking hold of the trees they climb up to their very tops they are    or  0 fathom long and much of a bigness from the root till within   or   fathom of the end they are of a pale green color clothed over with a coat of short thick hairy substance of a dun color but it comes off by only drawing the cane through your hand we did cut many of them and they proved very tough heavy canes  we saw no houses nor sign of inhabitants but while we lay here there was a canoa with   men came into this bay but whither they were bound or from whence they came i know not they were indians and we could not understand them  in the middle of this bay about a mile from the shore there is a small low woody island not above a mile in circumference our ship rode about a mile from it this island was the habitation of an incredible number of great batts with bodies as big as ducks or large fowl and with vast wings for i saw at mindanao one of this sort and i judge that the wings stretched out in length could not be less assunder than   or   foot from tip to tip for it was much more than any of us could fathom with our arms extended to the utmost the wings are for substance like those of other batts of a dun or mouse color the skin or leather of them has ribs running along it and draws up in   or   folds and at the joints of those ribs and the extremities of the wings there are sharp and crooked claws by which they may hang on any thing in the evening as soon as the sun was set these creatures would begin to take their flight from this island in swarms like bees directing their flight over to the main island and whither afterward i know not thus we should see them rising up from the island till night hindered our sight and in the morning as soon as it was light we should see them returning again like a cloud to the small island till sun rising this course they kept constantly while we lay here affording us every morning and evening an hours diversion in gazing at them and talking about them but our curiosity did not prevail with us to go ashore to them our selves and canoas being all the day time taken up in business about our ship at this isle also we found plenty of turtle and manatee but no fish  we stayed here till the  0th of february      and then having completed our business we sailed hence with the wind at north but going out we struck on a rock where we lay two hours it was very smooth water and the tide of flood or else we should there have lost our ship we struck off a great piece of our rudder which was all the damage that we received but we more narrowly mist losing our ships this time than in any other in the whole voyage this is a very dangerou shoal because it does not break unless probably it may appear in foul weather it lies about two mile to the westward without the small batt island here we found the tide of flood setting to the southward and the ebb to the northward  after we were past this shoal we coasted along by the rest of the philippine islands keeping on the west side of them some of them appeared to be very mountainous dry land we saw many fires in the night as we passed by panay a great island settled by spaniards and by the fires up and down it seems to be well settled by them for this is a spanish custom whereby they give notice of any danger or the like from sea and it is probable they had seen our ship the day before this is an unfrequented coast and it is rare to have any ship seen there we touched not at panay nor any where else though we saw a great many small islands to the westward of us and some shoals but none of them laid down in our draughts  the   th day of feb we anchored at the n w end of the island mindora in  0 fathomwater about   quarters of a mile from the shore mindora is a large island the middle of it lying in lat    about  0 leagues long stretching n w and s e it is high and mountainous and not very woody at this place where we anchored the land was neither very high nor low there was a small brook of water and the land by the sea was very woody and the trees high and tall but a league or two farther in the woods are very thin and small here we saw great tracks of hogs and beef and we saw some of each and hunted them but they were wild and we could kill none  while we were here there was a canoa with   indians came from manila they were very shy of us a while but at last hearing us speak spanish they came to us and told us that they were going to a friar that lived at an indian village toward the s e end of the island they told us also that the harbor of manila is seldom or never without  0 or  0 sail of vessels most chinese some portugueze and some few the spaniards have of their own they said that when they had done their business with the friar they would return to manila and hoped to be back again at this place in   days time we told them that we came for a trade with the spaniards at manila and should be glad if they would carry a letter to some merchant there which they promised to do but this was only a pretense of ours to get out of them what intelligence we could as to their shipping strength and the like under color of seeeking a trade for our business was to pillage now if we had really designed to have traded there this was as fair an opportunity as men could have desired for these men could have brought us to the friar that they were going to and a small present to him would have engaged him to do any kindness for us in the way of trade for the spanish governors do not allow of it and we must trade by stealth  the   st day we went from hence with the wind at e n e a small gale the   d day in the morning we were fair by the s e end of the island luconia the place that had been so long desired by us we presently saw a sail coming from the northward and making after her we took her in   hours time she was a spanish bark that came from a place called pangasanam a small town on the n end of luconia as they told us propably the same with pongassinay which lies on a bay at the n w side of the island she was bound to manila but had no goods aboard and therefore we turned her away  the   d we took another spanish vessel that came from the same place as the other she was laden with rice and cottoncloth and bound for manila also these goods were purposely for the acapulco ship the rice was for the men to live on while they lay there and in their return and the cottoncloth was to make sail the master of this prize was boatswain of the acapulco ship which escaped us at guam and was now at manila it was this man that gave us the relation of what strength it had how they were afraid of us there and of the accident that happened to them as is before mentioned in the  0th chapter we took these two vessels within   or   leagues of manila  luconia i have spoken of already but i shall now add this further account of it it is a great island taking up between   and   degrees of lat in length and its breadth near the middle is about  0 leagues but the ends are narrow the northend lies in about    d north lat and the s end in about    d  0 m this great island has abundance of small keys or islands lying about it especially at the northend the south side fronts toward the rest of the philippine islands of these that are its nearest neighbors mindora lately mentioned is the chief and gives name to the sea or straight that parts it and the other islands from luconia being called the streights of mindora  the body of the island luconia is composed of many spacious plain savannahs and large mountains the northend seems to be more plain and even i mean freer from hills than the southend but the land is all along of a good height it does not appear so flourishing and green as some of the other islands in this range especially that of st john mindanao batt island etc yet in some depiction of an island near manila a prospect of ye coat of ye i l near manila at  l off shore  bearing east depiction of the islands of pulo condor the con dao islands of vietnam  the islands pulo condor appear at   l distance bearing south depiction of the islands and harbor of pulo condore the con dao islands of vietnam depiction of the bashee islands batanes islands of the philippines the bashee islands places it is very woody some of the mountains of this island afford gold and the savannahs are well stockt with herds of cattle especially buaffaloes these cattle are in great plenty all over the east indies and therefore it is very probable that there were many of these here even before the spaniards came hither but now there are also plenty of other cattle as i have been told as bullocks horses sheep goats hogs etc brought hither by the spaniards  it is pretty well inhabited with indians most of them if not all under the spaniards who now are masters of it the native indians do live together in towns and they have priests among them to instruct them in the spanish religion  manila the chief or perhaps the only city lies at the foot of a ridge of high hills facing upon a spacious harbor near the s w point of the island in about the lat of    d north it is environed with a high strong wall and very well fortified with forts and breastworks the houses are large strongly built and covered with pantile the streets are large and pretty regular with a parade in the midst after the spanish fashion there are a great many fair buildings beside churches and other religious houses of which there are not a few  the harbor is so large that some hundreds of ships may ride here and is never without many both of their own and strangers i have already given you an account of the two ships going and coming between this place and acapulco besides them they have some small vessels of their own and they do allow the portuguese to trade here but the chinese are the chiefest merchants and they drive the greatest trade for they have commonly  0 or  0 or  0 jonks in the harbor at a time and a great many merchants constantly residing in the city beside shopkeepers and handycraftsmen in a bundance small vessels run up near the town but the acapulco ships and others of greater bur then lie a league short of it where there is a strong fort also and storehouses to put goods in  i had the major part of this relation   or   years after this time from mr coppinger our surgeon for he made a voyage hither from porto nova a town on the coast of coromandel in a portuguese ship as i think here he found  0 or    of captain swans men some of those that we left at mindanao for after we came from thence they brought a proe there by the instigation of an irish man who went by the name of john fitzgerald a person that spoke spanish very well and so in this their proe they came hither they had been here but    months when mr coppinger arrived here and mr fitzgerald had in this time gotten a spanish mustesa woman to wife and a good dowry with her he then professed physic and surgery and was highly esteemed among the spaniards for his supposed knowledge in those arts for being always troubled with sore shins while he was with us he kept some plasters and salves by him and with these he set up upon his bare natural stock of knowledge and his experience in kibes but then he had a very great stock of confidence withal to help out the other and being an irish roman catholic and having the spanish language he had a great advantage of all his consorts and he alone lived well there of them all we were not within sight of this town but i was shown the hills that overlooked it and drew a draft of them as we lay off at sea which i have caused to be engraven among a few others that i took my self see the table  the time of the year being now too far spent to do any thing here it was concluded to sail from hence to pulo condore a little parcel of islands on the coast of cambodia and carry this prize with us and there careen if we could find any convenient place for it designing to return hither again by the latter end of may and wait for the acapulco ship that comes about that time by our drafts which we were guided by being strangers to these parts this seemed to us then to be a place out of the way where we might lie snug for a while and wait the time of returning for our prey for we avoided as much as we could the going to lie by at any great place of commerce lest we should become too much exposed and perhaps be assaulted by a force greater than our own  so having set our prisoners ashore we sailed from luconia the   th day of feb with the wind e n e and fair weather and a brisk gale we were in lat    d n when we began to steer away for pulo condore and we steered s by w in our way thither we went pretty near the shoals of pracel and other shoals which are very dangerous we were very much afraid of them but escaped them without so much as seeing them only at the very southend of the pracel shoals we saw   little sandy islands or spots of sand standing just above water within a mile of us  it was the   th day of march before we came in sight of pulo condore or the island condore as pulo signifies the   th day about noon we anchored on the northside of the island against a sandy bay   mile from the shore in  0 fathom clean hard sand with both ship and prize pulo condore is the principal of a heap of islands and the only inhabited one of them they lie in lat  d  0 m north and about  0 leagues south and by east from the mouth of the river of cambodia these islands lie so near together that at a distance they appear to be but one island  two of these islands are pretty large and of a good height they may be seen    or    leagues at sea the rest are but little spots the biggest of the two which is the inhabited one is about   or   leagues long and lies east and west it is not above   mile broad at the broadest place in most places not above a mile wide the other large island is about   mile long and half a mile wide this island stretches n and s it is so conveniently placed at the west end of the biggest island that between both there is formed a very commodious harbor the entrance of this harbor is on the northside where the two islands are near a mile asunder there are   or   small keys and a good deep channel between them and the biggest island toward the southend of the harbor the two islands do in a manner close up leaving only a small passage for boats and canoas there are no more islands on the northside but   or   on the south side of the great island see the table  the mold of these islands for the biggest part is blackish and pretty deep only the hills are somewhat stony the eastern part of the biggest island is sandy yet all clothed with trees of diverse sorts the trees do not grow so thick as i have seen them in some places but they are generally large and tall and fit for any use  there is one sort of tree much larger than any other on this island and which i have not seen any where else it is about   or   foot diameter in the body from whence is drawn a sort of clammy juice which being boiled a little becomes perfect tar and if you boil it much it will become hard as pitch it may be put to either use we used it both ways and found it to be very serviceable the way that they get this juice is by cuting a great gap horizontally in the body of the tree half through and about a foot from the ground and then cutting the upper part of the body aslope inwardly downward till in the middle of the tree it meet with the traverse cutting or plain in this plain horizontal semicircular stump they make a hollow like a basin that may contain a quart or two into this hole the juice which drains from the wounded upper part of the tree falls from whence you must empty it every day it will run thus for some months and then dry away and the tree will recover again  the fruit trees that nature has bestowed on these isles are mangoes and trees bearing a sort of grape and other trees bearing a kind of wild or bastard nutmegs these all grow wild in the woods and in very great plenty  the mangoes here grow on trees as big as apple trees those at fort st george are not so large the fruit of these is as big as a small peach but long and smaller toward the top it is of a yellowish color when ripe it is very juicy and of a pleasant smell and delicate taste when the mango is young they cut them in two pieces and pickle them with salt and vinegar in which they put some cloves of garlic this is an excellent sauce and much esteemed it is called mangoachar achar i presume signifies sauce they make in the east indies especially at siam and pegu several sorts of achar as of the young tops of bamboes etc bamboachar and mangoachar are most used the mangoes were ripe when we were there as were also the rest of these fruits and they have then so delicate a fragrancy that we could smell them out in the thick woods if we had but the wind of them while we were a good way from them and could not see them and we generally found them out this way mangoes are common in many places of the east indies but i did never know any grow wild only at this place these though not so big as those i have seen at achin and at maderas or fort st george are yet every whit as pleasant as the best sort of their garden mangoes  the grapetree grows with a strait body of a diameter about a foot or more and has but few limbs or boughs the fruit grows in clusters all about the body of the tree like the jack durian and cacao fruits there are of them both red and white they are mueh like such grapes as grow on our vines both in shape and color and they are of a very pleasant winy taste i never saw these but on the two biggest of these islands the rest had no tartrees mangoes grapetrees nor wild nutmegs  the wild nutmegtree is as big as a walnuttree but it does not spread so much the boughs are gross and the fruit grows among the boughs as the walnut and other fruits this nutmeg is much smaller than the true nutmeg and longer also it is enclosed with a thin shell and a sort of mace encircling the nut within the shell this bastard nutmeg is so much like the true nutmeg in shape that at our first arrival here we thought it to be the true one but it has no manner of smell nor taste  the animals of these islands are some hogs lizards and guanoes and some of those creatures mentioned in chap xi which are like but much bigger than the guano  here are many sorts of birds as parrots parakites doves and pigeons here are also a sort of wild cocks and hens they are much like our tame fowl of that kind but a great deal less for they are about the bigness of a crow the cocks do crow like ours but much more small and shrill and by their crowing we do first find them out in the woods where we shoot them their flesh is very white and sweet  there are a great many limpits and muscles and plenty of green turtle  and upon this mention of turtle again i think it not amiss to add some reasons to strengthen the opinion that i have given concerning these creatures removing from place to place i have said in chapter  th that they leave their common feeding places and go to places a great way from thence to lay as particularly to the island ascension now i have discoursed with some since that subject was printed who are of opinion that when the laying time is over they never go from thence but lie somewhere in the sea about the island which i think is very improbable for there can be no food for them there as i could soon make appear as particularly from hence that the sea about the isle of ascension is so deep as to admit of no anchoring but at one place where there is no sign of grass and we never bring up with our sounding lead any grass or weeds out of very deep seas but sand or the like only but if this be granted that there is food for them yet i have a great deal of reason to believe that the turtle go from hence for after the laying time you shall never see them and wherever turtle are you will see them rise and hold their head above water to breath once in   or   minutes or at longest in  0 or    and if any man does but consider how fish take their certain seasons of the year to go from one sea to another this would not seem strange even fowls also having their seasons to remove from one place to another  these islands are pretty well watered with small brooks of fresh water that run flush into the sea for  0 months in the year the latter end of march they begin to dry away and in april you shall have none in the brooks but what is lodged in deep holes but you my dig wells in some places in may when the rain comes the land is again replenished with water and the brooks run out into the sea  these islands lie very commodiously in the way to and from japan china manila tunquin cochinchina and in general all this most easterly coast of the indian continent whether you go through the streights of malacca or the streights of sunda between samatra and java and one of them you must pass in the common way from europe or other parts of the east indies unless you mean to fetch a great compass round most of the east india islands as we did any ship in distress may be refreshed and recruited here very conveniently and besides ordinary accommodations be furnished with masts yards pitch and tar it might also be a convenient place to usher in a commerce with the neighboring country of cochinchina and forts might be built to secure a factory particularly at the harbor which is capable of being well fortified this place therefore being upon all these accounts so valuable and withal so little known i have here inserted a draft of it which i took during our stay there  the inhabitants of this island are by nation cochinchinese as they told us for one of them spoke good malayan which language we learnt a smattering of and some of us so as to speak it pretty well while we lay at mindanao and this is the common tongue of trade and commerce though it be not in several of them the native language in most of the east india islands being the lingua franca as it were of these parts i believe it is the vulgar tongue at malacca sumatra java and borneo but at celebes the philippine islands and the spice islands it seems borrowed for the carrying on of trade  the inhabitants of pulo condore are but a small people in stature well enough shaped and of a darker color than the mindanayans they are pretty long visaged their hair is black and straight their eyes are but small and black their noses of a mean bigness and pretty high their lips thin their teeth white and little mouths they are very civil people but extraordinary poor their chiefest employment is to draw the juice of those trees that i have described to make tar they preserve it in wooden troughs and when they have their cargo they transport it to cochinchina their mother country some others of them employ themselves to catch turtle and boil up their fat to oil which they also transport home these people have great large nets with wide mashes to catch the turtle the jamaica turtlers have such and i did never see the like nets but at jamaica and here  they are so free of their women that they would bring them aboard and offer them to us and many of our men hired them for a small matter this is a custom used by several nations in the east indies as at pegu siam cochinchina and cambodia as i have been told it is used at tunquin also to my knowledge for i did afterward make a voyage thither and most of our men had women aboard all the time of our abode there in africa also on the coast of guinea our merchants factors and seamen that reside there have their black misses it is accounted a piece of policy to do it for the chief factors and captains of ships have the great mens daughters offered them the mandarins or noblemens at tunquin and even the kings wives in guinea and by this sort of alliance the country people are engaged to a greater friendship and if there should arise any difference about trade or any thing else which might provoke the natives to seek some treacherous revenge to which all these heathen nations are very prone then these dalilahs would certainly declare it to their white friends and so hinder their countrymens designs  these people are idolaters but their manner of worship i know not there are a few scattering houses and plantations on the great island and a small village an the south side of it where there is a little idol temple and an image of an elephant about   foot high and in bigness proportionable placed on one side of the temple and a horse not so big placed on the other side of it both standing with their heads toward the south the temple it self was low and ordinary built of wood and thatched like one of their houses which are but very meanly  the images of the horse and the elephant were the most general idols that i observed in the temples of tunquin when i traveled there there were other images also of beasts birds and fish i do not remember i saw any humane shape there nor any such monstrous representations as i have seen among the chinese wherever the chinese seamen or merchants come and they are very numerous all over these seas they have always hideous idols on board their jonks or ships with altars and lamps burning before them these idols they bring ashore with them and beside those they have in common every man has one in his own house upon some particular solemn days i have seen their bonzies or priests bring whole armfuls of painted papers and burn them with a great deal of ceremony being very careful to let no piece escape them the same day they killed a goat which had been purposely fatting a month before this they offer or present before their idol and then dress it and feast themselves with it i have seen them do this in tunquin where i have at the same time been invited to their feasts and at bancouli in the isle of sumatra they sent a shoulder of the sacrificed goat to the english who eat of it and asked me to do so too but i refused  when i was at maderas or fort st george i took notice of a great ceremony used for several nights successively by the idolaters inhabiting the suburbs both men and women these very well clad in a great multitude went in solemn procession with lighted torches carrying their idols about with them i knew not the meaning of it i observed some went purposely carrying oil to sprinkle into the lamps to make them burn the brighter they began their round about    a clock at night and having paced it gravely about the streets till   or   a clock in the morning their idols were carried with much ceremony into the temple by the chief of the procession and some of the women i saw enter the temple particularly their idols were different from those of tunquin cambodia etc being in humane shape  i have said already that we arrived at these islands the   th day of march      the next day we searched about for a place to careen in and the   th day we entered the harbor and immediately provided to careen some men were set to fell great trees to saw into plank others went to unrigging the ship some made a house to put our goods in and for the sailmaker to work in the country people resorted to us and brought us of the fruits of the island with hogs and sometimes turtle for which they received rice in exchange which we had a shipload of taken at manila we bought of them also a good quantity of their pitchy liquor which we boiled and used about our ships bottom we mixed it first with lime which we made here and it made an excellent coat and stuck on very well  we staid in this harbor from the   th day of march till the   th of april in which time we made a new suit of sails of the cloth that was taken in the prize we cut a spare maintopmast and sawed plank to sheath the ships bottom for she was not sheathed all over at mindanao and that old plank that was left on then we now ripped off and clapped on new  while we lay here   of our men died who were poisoned at mindanao they told us of it when they found themselves poisoned and had lingered ever since they were opened by our doctor according to their own request before they died and their livers were black light and dry like pieces of cork  our business being finished here we left the spanish prize taken at manila and most of the rice taking out enough for our selves and on the   th day we went from hence to the place where we first anchored on the northside of the great island purposely to water for there was a great stream when we first came to the island and we thought it was so now but we found it dried up only it stood in holes   or   hogsheads or a tun in a hole therefore we did immediately cut bamboos and made spouts through which we conveyed the water down to the seaside by taking it up in bowls and pouring it into these spouts or troughs we conveyed some of it thus near half a mile while we were filling our water captain read engaged an old man one of the inhabitants of this island the same who i said could speak the malayan language to be his pilot to the bay of siam for he had often been telling us that he was well acquainted there and that he knew some islands there where there were fishermen lived who he thought could supply us with saltfish to eat at sea for we had nothing but rice to eat the easterly monsoon was not yet done therefore it was concluded to spend some time there and then take the advantage of the beginning of the western monsoon to return to manila again  the   st day of april      we sailed from pulo condore directing our course w by s for the bay of siam we had fair weather and a fine moderate gale of wind at e n e  the   d day we arrived at pulo ubi or the island ubi this island is about  0 leagues to the westward of pulo condore it lies just at the entrance of the bay of siam at the s w point of land that makes the bay namely the point of cambodia this island is about   or   leagues round and it is higher land than any of pulo condore isles against the southeast part of it there is a small key about a cables length from the main island this pulo ubi is very woody and it has good water on the northside where you may anchor but the best anchoring is on the east side against a small bay then you will have the little island to the southward of you  at pulo ubi we found two small barks laden with rice they belonged to cambodia from whence they came not above two or three days before and they touched here to fill water rice is the general food of all these countries therefore it is transported by sea from one country to another as corn in these parts of the world for in some countries they produce more than enough for themselves and send what they can spare to those places where there is but little  the   th day we went into the bay of siam this is a large deep bay of which and of this kingdom i shall at present speak but little because i design a more particular account of all this coast to wit of tunquin cochinchina siam champa cambodia and malacca making all the most easterly part of the continent of asia lying south of china but to do it in the course of this voyage would too mueh swell this volume and i shall choose therefore to give a separate relation of what i know or have learnt of them together with the neighboring parts of sumatra jova etc where i have spent some time  we run down into the bay of siam till we came to the islands that our pulo condore pilot told us of which lie about the middle of the bay but as good a pilot as he was he run us aground yet we had no damage captain read went ashore at these islands where he found a small town of fishermen but they had no fish to sell and so we returned empty  we had yet fair weather and very little wind so that being often becalmed we were till the   th day of may before we got to pulo ubi again there we found two small vessels at an anchor on the east side they were laden with rice and laquer which is used in japanning of cabinets one of these come from champa bound to the town of malacca which belongs to the dutch who took it from the portugueze and this shows that they have a trade with champa this was a very pretty neat vessel her bottom very clean and curiously coated she had about  0 men all armed with cortans or broad swords lances and some guns that went with a swivel upon their gunnal they were of the idolaters natives of champa and some of the briskest most sociable without fearfulness or shyness and the most neat and dextrous about their shipping of any such i have met with in all my travels the other vessel came from the river of cambodia and was bound toward the streights of malacca both of them stopped here for the westerly winds now began to blow which were against them being somewhat bleated  we anchored also on the east side intending to fill water while we lay here we had very violent wind at s w and a strong current setting right to windward the fiercer the wind blew the more strong the current set against it this storm lasted till the  0th day and then it began to abate  the   st day of may we went back from hence toward pulo condore in our way we overtook a great jonk that came from palimbam a town on the island sumatra she was full laden with pepper which they bought there and was bound to siam but it blowing so hard she was afraid to venture into that bay and therefore came to pula condore with us where we both anchored may the   th this vessel was of the chinese make full of little rooms or partitions like our wellboats i shall describe them in the next chapter the men of this jonk told us that the english were settled on the island sumatra at a place called sillabar and the first knowledge we had that the english had any settlement on sumatra was from these  when we came to an anchor we saw a small bark at an anchor near the shore therefore captain read sent a canoa aboard her to know from whence they came and supposing that it was a malaya vessel he ordered the men not to go aboard for they are accounted desperate fellows and their vessels are commonly full of men who all wear cressets or little daggers by their sides the canoas crew not minding the captains orders went aboard all but one man that stayed in the canoa the malayans who were about  0 of them seeing our men all armed thought that they came to take their vessel therefore at once on a signal given they drew out their cressets and stabbed   or   of our men before they knew what the matter was the rest of our men leapt overboard some into the canoa and some into the sea and so got away among the rest one daniel wallis leapt into the sea who could never swim before nor since yet now he swam very well a good while before he was taken up when the canoas came aboard captain read manned two canoas and went to be revenged on the malayans but they seeing him coming did cut a hole in their vessels bottom and went ashore in their boat capt read followed them but they run into the woods and hid themselves here we stayed ten or eleven days for it blew very hard all the time while we stayed here herman coppinger our surgeon went ashore intending to live here but captain read sent some men to fetch him again i had the same thoughts and would have gone ashore too but waited for a more convenient place for neither he nor i when we were last on board at mindanao had any knowledge of the plot that was laid to leave capt swan and run away with the ship and being sufficiently weary of this mad crew we were willing to give them the slip at any place from whence we might hope to get a passage to an english factory there was nothing else of moment happened while we stayed here  chap xv they leave pulo condore designing for manila but are driven off from thence and from the isle of prata by the winds and brought upon the coast of china isle of st john on the coast of the province of canton its soil and productions china hogs etc

are driven off by a violent storm and return the natives kindness to   of them left behind the crew discouraged by those storms quit their design of cruising off manila for the acapulco ship and it is resolved to fetch a compass to cape comorin and so for the red sea  having filled our water cut our wood and got our ship in a sailing posture while the blustering hard winds lasted we took the first opportunity of a settled gale to sail toward manila accordingly june the  th      we loosed from pulo condore with the wind at s w fair weather at a brisk gale the pepper jonk bound to siam remained there waiting for an easterly wind but one of his men a kind of a bastard portuguese came aboard our ship and was entertained for the sake of his knowledge in the several languages of these countries the wind continued in the s w but    hours or a little more and then came about to the north and then to the n e and the sky became exceeding clear then the wind came at east and lasted betwixt e and s e for   or  0 days yet we continued plying to windward expecting every day a shift of wind because these winds were not according to the season of the year  we were now afraid lest the currents might deceive us and carry us on the shoals of pracel which were near us a little to the n w but we passed on to the eastward without seeing any sign of them yet we were kept much to the northward of our intended course and the easterly winds still continuing we despaired of getting to manila and therefore began to project some new design and the result was to visit the island prata about the lat of  0 degrees  0 min north and not far from us at this time  it is a small low island environed with rocks clear round it by report it lies so in the way between manila and canton the head of a province and a town of great trade in china that the chinese do dread the rocks about it more than the spaniards did formerly dread bermudas for many of their jonks coming from manila have been lost there and with abundance of treasure in them as we were informed by all the spaniards that ever we converst with in these parts they told us also that in these wrecks most of the men were drowned and that the chinese did never go thither to take upon any of the treasure that was lost there for fear of being lost themselves but the danger of the place did not daunt us for we were resolved to try our fortunes there if the winds would permit and we did beat for it   or   days but at last were forced to leave that design also for want of winds for the s e winds continuing forced us on the coast of china  it was the   th day of june when we made the land and running in toward the shore we came to an anchor the same day on the n e end of st johns island  this island is in lat about    d  0 min north lying on the s coast of the province of quantung or canton in china it is of an indifferent height and pretty plain and the soil fertile enough it is partly woody partly savannahs or pasturage for cattle and there is some moist arable land for rice the skirts or outer part of the island especially that part of it which borders on the main sea is woody the middle part of it is good thick grassy pasture with some groves of trees and that which is cultivated land is low wet land yielding plentiful crops of rice the only grain that i did see here the tame cattle which this island affords are china hogs goats buffaloes and some bullocks the hogs of this island are all black they have but small heads very short thick necks great bellies commonly touching the ground and short legs they eat but little food yet they are most of them very fat probably because they sleep much the tame fowls are ducks and cocks and hens i saw no wild fowl but a few small birds  the natives of this island are chinese they are subject to the crown of china and consequently at this time to the tartars the chinese in general are tall straitbodied rawboned men they are long visaged and their foreheads are high but they have little eyes their noses are pretty large with a rising in the middle their mouths are of a mean size pretty thin lips they are of an ashy complexion their hair is black and their beards thin and long for they pluck the hair out by the roots suffering only some few very long straggling hairs to grow about their chin in which they take great pride often combing them and sometimes tying them up in a knot and they have such hairs too growing down from each side of their upper lip like whiskers the ancient chinese were very proud of the hair of their heads letting it grow very long and stroking it back with their hands curiously and then winding the plats all together round a bodkin thrust through it at the hinder part of the head and both men and women did thus but when the tartars conquered them they broke them of this custom they were fond of by main force insomuch that they resented this imposition worse than their subjection and rebelled upon it but being still worsted were forced to acquiesce and to this day they follow the fashion of their masters the tartars and shave all their heads only reserving one lock which some tie up others let it hang down to a great or small length as they please the chinese in other countries still keep their old custom but if any of the chinese is found wearing long hair in china he forfeits his head and many of them have abandoned their country to preserve their liberty of wearing their hair as i have been told by themselves  the chinese have no hats caps or turbans but when they walk abroad they carry a small umbrello in their hands wherewith they fence their head from the sun or the rain by holding it over their heads if they walk but a little way they carry only a large fan made of paper or silk of the same fashion as those our ladies have and many of them are brought over hither one of these every man carries in his hand if he do but cross the street skreening his head with it if he has not an umbrello with him  the common apparel of the men is a loose frock and breeches they seldom were stockings but they have shoes or a sort of slippers rather the mens shoes are made diversely the women have very small feet and consequently but little shoes for from their infancy their feet are kept swathed up with bands as hard as they can possibly endure them and from the time they can go till they have done growing they bind them up every night this they do purposely to hinder them from growing esteeming little feet to be a great beauty but by this unreasonable custom they do in a manner lose the use of their feet and instead of going they only stumble about their houses and presently squat down on their breeches again being as it were confined to sitting all days of their lives they seldom stir abroad and one would be apt to think that as some have conjectured their keeping up their fondness for this fashion were a stratagem of the mens to keep them from gadding and gossipping about and confine them at home they are kept constantly to their work being fine needlewomen and making many curious embroideries and they make their own shoes but if any stranger be desirous to bring away any for noveltys sake he must be a great favorite to get a pair of shoes of them though he give twice their value the poorer sort of women trudge about streets and to the market without shoes or stockings and these cannot afford to have little feet being to get their living with them  the chinese both men and women are very ingenious as may appear by the many curious things that are brought from thence especially the porcelaine or china earthen ware the spaniards of manila that we took on the coast of luconia told me that this commodity is made of conchshells the inside of which looks like mother of pearl but the portuguese lately mentioned who had lived in china and spoke that and the neighboring languages very well said that it was made of a fine sort of clay that was dug in the province of canton i have often made enquiry about it but could never be well satisfied in it but while i was on the coast of canton i forgot to inquire about it they make very fine lacquerware also and good silks and they are curious at painting and carring  china affords drugs in great abundance especially chinaroot but this is not culiar to that country alone for there is much of this root growing at jamaica particularly at    mile walk and in the bay of honduras it is very plentiful there is great store of sugar made in this country and tea in abundance is brought from thence being much used there and in tunquin and cochinchina as common drinking women sitting in the streets and selling dishes of tea hot and ready made they call it chau and even the poorest people sip it but the tea at tonqueen or cochinchina seems not so good or of so pleasant a bitter or of so fine a color or such virtue as this in china for i have drank of it in these countries unless the fault be in their way of making it for i made none there my self and by the high red color it looks as if they made a decoction of it or kept it stale yet at japan i was told there is a great deal of pure tea very good  the chinese are very great gamesters and they will never be tired with it playing night and day till they have lost all their estates then it is usual with them to hang themselves this was frequently done by the chinese factors at manila as i was told by spaniards that lived there the spaniards themselves are much addicted to gaming and are very expert at it but the chinese are too subtle for them being in general a very cunning people  but a particular account of them and their country would fill a volume nor does my short experience of them qualify me to say much of them wherefore i confine my self chiefly to what i observed at st johns island where we lay some time and visited the shore every day to buy provision as hogs fowls and buffaloe here was a small town standing in a wet swampy ground with many filthy ponds amongst the houses which were built on the ground as ours are not on posts as at mindanao in these ponds were plenty of ducks the houses were small and low and covered with thatch and the inside were but ill furnished and kept nastily and i have been told by one who was there that most of the houses in the city of canton it self are but poor and irregular  the inhabitants of this village seem to be most husbandmen they were at this time very busy in sowing their rice which is their chiefest commodity the land in which they choose to sow the rice is low and wet and when plowed the earth was like a mass of mud they plow their land with a small plow drawn by one buffaloe and one man both holds the plow and drives the beast when the rice is ripe and gathered in they tread it out of the ear with buffaloes in a large round place made with a hard floor fit for that purpose where they chain   or   of these beasts one at the tail of the other and driving them round in a ring as in a horsemill they so order it that the buffaloes may tread upon it all  i was once ashore at this island with   or   english men more and having occasion to stay some time we killed a shote or young porker and roasted it for our dinners while we were busy dressing of our pork one of the natives came and sat down by us and when the dinner was ready we cut a good piece and gave it him which he willingly received but by signs he begged more and withal pointed into the woods yet we did not understand his meaning nor much mind him till our hunger was pretty well assuaged although he did still make signs and walking a little way from us he beckoned to us to come to him which at last i did and   or   more he going before led the way in a small blind path through a thicket into a small grove of trees in which there was an old idol temple about  0 foot square the walls of it were about   foot high and   foot thick made of bricks the floor was paved with broad bricks and in the middle of the floor stood an old rusty iron bell on its brims this bell was about two foot high standing flat on the ground the brims on which it stood were about    inches diameter from the brims it did taper away a little toward the head much like our bells but that the brims did not turn out so much as ours do on the head of the bell there were   iron bars as big as a mans arm and about  0 inches long from the top of the bell where the ends joined as in a center and seemed of one mass with the bell as if cast together these bars stood all parallel to the ground and their further ends which stood triangularly and opening from each other at equal distances like the fliers of our kitchenjacks were made exactly in the shape of the paw of some monstrous beast having sharp claws on it this it seems was their god for as soon as our zealous guide came before the bell he fell flat on his face and beckoned to us seeming very desirous to have us do the like at the inner side of the temple against the walls there was an altar of white hewn stone the table of the altar was about   foot long    inches broad and   inches thick it was raised about two foot from the ground and supported by   small pillars of the same white stone on this altar there were several small earthen vessels one of them was full of small sticks that had been burned at one end our guide made a great many signs for us to fetch and to leave some of our meat there and seemed very importunate but we refused we left him there and went aboard i did see no other temple nor idol here  while we lay at this place we saw several small china jonks sailing in the lagune between the islands and the main one came and anchored by us i and some more of our men went aboard to view her she was built with a square flat head as well as stern only the head or forepart was not so broad as the stern on her deck she had little thacht houses like hovels covered with palmeto leaves and raised about   foot high for the seamen to creep into she had a pretty large cabin wherein there was an altar and a lamp burning i did but just look in and saw not the idol the hold was divided in many small partitions all of them made so tight that if a leak should spring up in any one of them it could go no farther and so could do but little damage but only to the goods in the bottom of that room where the leak springs up each of these rooms belong to one or two merchants or more and every man freights his goods in his own room and probably lodges there if he be on board himself these jonks have only two masts a mainmast and a foremast the foremast has a square yard and a square sail but the mainmast has a sail narrow aloft like a sloopssail and in fair weather they use a topsail which is to hale down on the deck in foul weather yard and all for they do not go up to furl it the mainmast in their biggest jonks seemed to me as big as any thirdrate man of wars mast in england and yet not pieced as ours but made of one grown tree and in all my travels i never saw any single treemasts so big in the body and so long and yet so well tapered as i have seen in the chinee jonks  some of our men went over to a pretty large town on the continent of china where we might have furnished our selves with provision which was a thing we were always in want of and was our chief business here but we were afraid to lie in this place any longer for we had some signs of an approaching storm this being the time of the year in which storms are expected on this coast and here was no safe riding it was now the time of the year for the s w monsoon but the wind had been whistling about from one part of the compass to another for two or three days and sometimes it would be quite calm this caused us to put to sea that we might have searoom at least for such flattering weather is commonly the forerunner of a tempest  accordingly we weighed anchor and set out yet we had very little wind all the next night but the day ensuing which was the  th day of july about   a clock in the afternoon the wind came to the n e and freshned upon us and the sky looked very black in that quarter and the black clouds began to rise apace and moved toward us having hung all the morning in the horizon this made us take in our topsails and the wind still increasing about   a clock we rift our mainsail and foresail at  0 we furled our foresail keeping under a mainsail and mizen at    a clock we furled our mainsail and ballasted our mizen at which time it began to rain and by    a clock at night it blew exceeding hard and the rain poured down as through a sieve it thundered and lightened prodigiously and the sea seemed all of a fire about us for every sea that broke sparkled like lightning the violent wind raised the sea presently to a great height and it ran very short and began to break in on our deck one sea struck away the rails of our head and our sheetanchor which was stowed with one flook or bending of the iron over the ships gunal and lasht very well down to the side was violently washed off and had like to have struck a hole in our bow as it lay beating against it then we were forced to put right before the wind to stow our anchor again which we did with much ado but afterward we durst not adventure to bring our ship to the wind again for fear of foundring for the turning the ship either to or fro from the wind is dangerous in such violent storms the fierceness of the weather continued till  a clock that morning in which time we did cut away two canoas that were towing astern  after four a clock the thunder and the rain abated and then we saw a corpus sant at our maintopmast head on the very top of the truck of the spindle this sight rejoiced our men exceedingly for the height of the storm is commonly over when the corpus sant is seen aloft but when they are seen lying on the deck it is generally accounted a bad sign  a corpus sant is a certain small glittering light when it appears as this did on the very top of the mainmast or at a yardarm it is like a star but when it appears on the deck it resembles a great glowworm the spaniards have another name for it though i take even this to be a spanish or portuguese name and a corruption only of corpus sanctum and i have been told that when they see them they presently go to prayers and bless themselves for the happy sight i have heard some ignorant seamen discoursing how they have seen them creep or as they say travel about in the scuppers telling many dismal stories that happened at such times but i did never see any one stir out of the place where it was first fixed except upon deck where every sea washes it about neither did i ever see any but when we have had hard rain as well as wind and therefore do believe it is some jelly but enough of this  we continued scudding right before wind and sea from   till   a clock in the morning and then the wind being much abated we set our mizen again and brought our ship to the wind and lay under a mizen till    then it fell flat calm and it continued so for about   hours but the sky looked very black and rueful especially in the s w and the sea tossed us about like an eggshell for want of wind about one a clock in the afternoon the wind sprung up at s w out of the quarter from whence we did expect it therefore we presently braild up our mizen and wore our ship but we had no sooner put our ship before the wind but it blew a storm again and rained very hard though not so violently as the night before but the wind was altogether as boisterous and so continued till  0 or    a clock at night all which time we scudded or run before the wind very swift though only with our bare poles that is without any sail abroad afterward the wind died away by degrees and before day we had but little wind and sine clear weather  i was never in such a violent storm in all my life so said all the company this was near the chang of the moon it was   or   days before the change the  th day in the morning having fine handsom weather we got up our yards again and began to dry our selves and our clothes for we were all well sopt this storm had deadned the hearts of our men so much that instead of going to buy more provision at the same place from whence we came before the storm or of seeking any more for the island prata they thought of going somewhere to shelter before the full moon for fear of another such storm at that time for commonly if there is any very bad weather in the month it is about   or   days before or after the full or change of the moon  these thoughts i say put our men on thinking where to go and the drafts or seaplats being first consulted it was concluded to go to certain islands lying in lat    d n called piscadores for there was not a man aboard that was any thing acquainted on these coasts and therefore all our dependence was on the drafts which only pointed out to us where such and such places or islands were without giving us any account what harbor roads or bays there were or the produce strength or trade of them these we were forced to seek after our selves  the piscadores are a great many inhabited islands lying near the island formosa between it and china in or near the lat of    degrees n lat almost as high as the tropic of cancer these piscadore islands are moderately high and appear much like our dorsetshire and wiltshiredowns in england they produce thick short grass and a few trees they are pretty well watered and they feed abundance of goats and some great cattle there are abundance of mounts and old fortifications on them but of no use now whatever they have been  between the   eastermost islands there is a very good harbor which is never without jonks riding in it and on the west side of the eastermost island there is a large town and fort commanding the harbor the houses are but low yet well built and the town makes a sine prospect this is a garrison of the tartars wherein are also   or  00 soldiers who live here   years and then they are removed to some other place  on the island on the west side of the harbor close by the sea there is a small town of chinese and most of the other islands have some chinese living on them more or less  having as i said before concluded to go to these islands we steered away for them having the wind at w s w a small gale the  0th day of july we had first sight of them and steered in among them finding no place to anchor in till we came into the harbor beforementioned we blundering in knowing little of our way and we admired to see so many jonks going and coming and some at an anchor and so great a town as the neighboring eastermost town the tartarian garrison for we did not expect nor desire to have seen any people being in care to lie concealed in these seas however seeing we were here we boldly run into the harbor and presently sent ashore our canoa to the town  our people were met by an officer at their landing and our quartermaster who was the chiefest man in the boat was conducted before the governor and examined of what nation we were and what was our business here he answered that we were english and were bound to amoy or anhay which is a city standing on a navigable river in the province of fokien in china and is a place of vast trade there being a huge multitude of ships there and in general on all these coasts as i have heard of several that have been there he said also that having received some damage by a storm we therefore put in here to refit before we could adventure to go farther and that we did intend to lie here till after the full moon for fear of another storm the governor told him that we might better refit our ship at amoy than here and that he heard that two english vessels were arrived there already and that he should be very ready to assist us in any thing but we must not expect to trade there but must go to the places allowed to entertain merchantstrangers which were amoy and macao macao is a town of great trade also lying in an island at the very mouth of the river of canton it is fortified and garrisoned by a large portuguese colony but yet under the chinese governor whose people inhabit one moiety of the town and lay on the portuguese what tax they please for they dare not disoblige the chinese for fear of losing their trade however the governor very kindly told our quartermaster that whatsoever we wanted if that place could furnish us we should have it yet that we must not come ashore on that island but he would send aboard some of his men to know what we wanted and they should also bring it off to us that nevertheless we might go on shore on other islands to buy refreshments of the chinese after the discourse was ended the governor dismissed him with a small jar of flower and   or   large cakes of very fine bread and about a dozen pineapples and watermelons all very good in their kind as a present to the captain  the next day an eminent officer came aboard with a great many attendants he wore a black silk cap of a particular make with a plume of black and white feathers standing up almost round his head behind and all his outside clothes were black silk he had a loose black coat which reached to his knees and his breeches were of the same and underneath his coat he had two garments more of other colored silk his legs were covered with small black limber boots all his attendants were in a very handsome garb of black silk all wearing those small black boots and caps these caps were like the crown of a hat made of palmetoleaves like our strawhats but without brims and coming down but to their ears these had no feathers but had an oblong button on the top and from between the button and the cap there fell down all round their head as low as the cap reached a sort of course hair like horsehair dyed as i suppose of a light red color  the officer brought aboard as a present from the governor a young heifer the fattest and kindliest beef that i did ever taste in any foreign country twas small yet full grown   large hogs   goats   baskets of fine flower  0 great flat cakes of fine well tasted bread   great jars of arack made of rice as i judged called by the chinese sam shu and    jars of hoc shu as they call it and our europeans from them this is a strong liquor made of wheat as i have been told it looks like mum and tastes much like it and is very pleasant and hearty our seamen love it mightily and will lick their lips with it for scarce a ship goes to china but the men come home fat with soaking this liquor and bring store of jars of it home with them it is put into small white thick jars that hold near a quart the double jars hold about two quarts these jars are small below and thence rise up with a pretty full belly closing in pretty short at top with a small thick mouth over the mouth of the jar they put a thin chip cut round just so as to cover the mouth over that a piece of paper aid over that they put a great lump of clay almost as big as the bottle or jar it self with a hollow in it to admit the neck of the bottle made round and about   inches long this is to preserve the liquor if the liquor take any vent it will be sour presently so that when we buy any of it of the ships from china returning to maderas or fort st george where it is then sold or o the chinese themselves of whom i have bought it at achin and bencouli in sumatra if the clay be cracked or the liquor motherly we make them take it again a quart jar there is worth sixpence besides this present from the governor there was a captain of a jonk sent two jars of arack and abundance of pineapples and watermelons  captain read sent ashore as a present to the governor a curious spanish silverhilted rapier an english carbine and a gold chain and when the officer went ashore three guns were fired in the afternoon the governor sent off the same officer again to complement the captain for his civility and promised to retaliate his kindness before we departed but we had such blustering weather afterward that no boat could come aboard  we stayed here till the   th day and then sailed from hence with the wind at s w and pretty fair weather we now directed our course for some islands we had chosen to go to that lie between formosa and luconia they are laid down in our plots without any name only with a figure of   denoting the number of them it was supposed by us that these islands had no inhabitants because they had not any name by our hydrographers therefore we thought to lie there secure and be pretty near the island luconia which we did still intend to visit  in going to them we sailed by the south west end of formosa leaving it on our larboardside this is a large island the southend is in lat    d  0 m and the northend in the    d  0 m north lat the longitude of this isle is laid down from     d   m to     d    m reckoning east from the pike of tenariffe so that it is but narrow and the tropic of cancer crosses it it is a high and woody island and was formerly well inhabited by the chinese and was then frequently visited by english merchants there being a very good harbor to secure their ships but since the tartars have conquered china they have spoiled the harbor as i have been informed to hinder the chinese that were then in rebellion from fortifying themselves there and ordered the foreign merchants to come and trade on the main  the sixth day of august we arrived at the five islands that we were bound to and anchored on the east side of the northermost island in    fathom a cables length from the shore here contrary to our expectation we found abundance of inhabitants in sight for there were   large towns all within a league of the sea and another larger town than any of the three on the backside of a small hill close by also as we found afterward these islands lie in lat  0 d  0 m north lat by my observation for i took it there and i find their longitude according to our drafts to be     d  0 m these islands having no particular names in the drafts some or other of us made use of the seamens privilege to give them what names we pleased three of the islands were pretty large the westermost is the biggest this the dutchmen who were among us called the prince of oranges island in honor of his present majesty it is about   or   leagues long and about two leagues wide and it lies almost n and s the other two great islands are about   or   leagues to the eastward of this the northermost of them where we first anchored i called the duke of graftons isle as soon as we landed on it having married my wfe out of his dutchesss family and leaving her at arlingtonhouse at my going abroad this isle is about   leagues long and one league and a half wide stretching north and south the other great island onr seamen called the duke of monmouths island this is about a league to the southward of grafton isle it is about   leagues long and a league wide lying as the other between monmouth and the south end of orange island there are two small islands of a roundish form lying east and west the eastermost island of the two our men unanimously called boshee island from a liquor which we drank there plentifully every day after we came to an anchor at it the other which is the smallest of all we called goat island from the great number of goats there and to the northward of them all are two high rocks  orange island which is the biggest of them all is not inhabited it is high land flat and even on the top with steep cliffs against the sea for whichreason we could not go ashore there as we did on all the rest  i have made it my general observation that where the land is fenced with steep rocks and cliffs against the sea there the sea is very deep and seldom affords anchorground and on the other side where the land falls away with a declivity into the sea although the land be extraordinary high within yet there are commonly good soundings and consequently anchoring and as the visible declivity of the land appears near or at the edge of the water whether pretty steep or more stoping so we commonly find our anchorground to be more or less deep or steep therefore we come nearer the shore or anchor farther off as we see convenient for there is no coast in the world that i know or have heard of where the land is of a continual height without some small valleys or declivities which lie intermixed with the high land they are the subsidings of valleys or low lands that make dents in the shore and creeks small bays and harbors or little coves etc which afford good anchoring the surface of the earth being there lodged deep under water thus we find many good harbors on such coasts where the land bounds the sea with steep cliffs by reason of the declivities or subsiding of the land between these cliffs but where the declension from the hills or cliffs is not within land between hill and hill but as on the coast of chili and peru the declivity is toward the main sea or into it the coast being perpendicular or very steep from the neighboring hills as in those countries from the andes that run along the shore there is a deep sea and few or no harbors or creeks all that coast is too steep for anchoring and has the fewest roads sit for ships of any coast i know the coasts of gallicia portugal norway and newsoundland etc are coasts like the peruvian and the high islands of the archipelago but yet not so scanty of good harbors for where there are short ridges of land there are good bays at the extremities of those ridges where they plunge into the sea as on the coast of caraccos etc the island of john fernando and the island st helena etc are such high land with deep shore and in general the plunging of any land under water seems to be in proportion to the rising of its continuous part above water more or less steep and it must be a bottom almost level or very gently declining that affords good anchoring ships being soon driven from their moorings on a steep bank therefore we never strive to anchor where we see the land high and bounding the sea with steep cliffs and for this reason when we came in sight of states island near terra del fuego before we entered into the south seas we did not so much as think of anchoring after we saw what land it was because of the steep cliffs which appeared against the sea yet there might be little harbors or coves for shallops or the like to anchor in which we did not see or search after  as high steep cliffs bounding on the sea have this ill consequence that they seldom afford anchoring so they have this benefit that we can see them far off and sail close to them without danger for which reason we call them bold shores whereas low land on the contrary is seen but a little way and in many places we dare not come near it for fear of running aground before we see it besides there are in many places shoals thrown out by the course of great rivers that from the low land fall into the sea  this which i have said that there is usually good anchoring near low lands may be illustrated by several instances thus on the south side of the bay of campeachy there is mostly low land and there also is good anchoring all along shore and in some places to the eastward of the town of campeachy we shall have so many fathom as we are leagues off from land that is from   or  0 leagues distance till you come within   leagues and from thence to land it grows but shallower the bay of honduras also is low land and continues mostly so as we past along from thence to the coasts of portobel and cartagena till we came as high as santa martha afterward the land is low again till you come toward the coast of caraccos which is a high coast and bold shore the land about surinam on the same coast is low and good anchoring and that over on the coast of guinea is such also and such too is the bay of panama where the pilotbook orders the pilot always to sound and not to come within such a depth be it by night or day in the same seas from the high land of guitimala in mexico t california there is mostly low land and good anchoring in the main of asia the coast of china the bay of siam and bengal and all the coast of coromandel and the coast about malacca and against it the island sumatra on that side are mostly low anchoring shores but on the west side of sumatra the shore is high and bold so most of the islands lying to the eastward of sumatra as the islands borneo celebes gilolo and abundance of islands of less note lying scattering up and down those seas are low land and have good anchoring about them with many shoals scattered to and fro among them but the islands lying against the eastindian ocean especially the westsides of them are high land and steep particularly the westparts not only of sumatra but also of java timer etc particulars are endless but in general it is seldom but high shores and deep waters and on the other side low land and shallow seas are found together  but to return from this digression to speak of the rest of these islands monmouth and grafton isles are very hilly with many of those steep inhabited precipies on them that i shall describe particularly the two small islands are flat and even only the bashee island has one steep scraggy hill but goat island is all flat and very even  the mold of these islands in the valley is blackish in some places but in most red the hills are very rocky the valleys are well watered with brooks of fresh water which run into the sea in many different places the soil is indifferent fruitful especially in the valleys producing pretty great plenty of trees though not very big and thick grass the sides of the mountains have also short grass and some of the mountains have mines within them for the natives told us that the yellow metal they showed us as i shall speak more particularly came from these mountains for when they held it up they would point toward them  the fruit of the islands are a few plantains bonanoes pineapples pumkins sugarcanes etc and there might be more if the natives would for the ground seems fertile enough here are great plenty of potatoes and yames which is the common food for the natives for breadkind for those few plantains they have are only used as fruit they have some cotton growing here of the small plants  here are plenty of goats and abundance of hogs but few fowls either wild or tame for this i have always observed in my travels both in the east and west indies that in those places where there is plenty of grain that is of rice in one and maiz in the other there are also found great abundance of fowls but on the contrary few fowls in those countries where the inhabitants feed on fruits and roots only the few wild fowls that are here are parakites and some other small birds their tame fowl are only a few cocks and hens  monmouth and grafton islands are very thick inhabited and bashee island has one town on it the natives of these islands are short squat people they are generally round visaged with low foreheads and thick eyebrows their eyes of a hazel color and small yet bigger than the chinese short low noses and their lip and mouths middle proportioned their teeth are white their hair is black and thick and lank which they wear but short it will just cover their ears and so it is cut round very even their skins are of a very dark copper color  they wear no hat cap nor turbat nor any thing to keep off the sun the men for the biggest part have only a small clout to cover their nakedness some of them have jackets made of plantainleaves which were as rough as any bearsskin i never saw such rugged things the women have a short petticoat made of cotton which comes a little below their knees it is a thick sort of stubborn cloth which they make themselves of their cotton both men and women do wear large earrings made of that yellow metal before mentioned whether it were gold or no i cannot positively say i took it to be so it was heavy and of the color of our paler gold i would fain have brought away some to have satisfied my curiosity but i had nothing wherewith to buy any captain read bought two of these rings with some iron of which the people are very greedy and he would have bought more thinking he was come to a very fair market but that the paleness of the metal made him and his crew distrust its being right gold for my part i should have ventured on the purchase of some but having no property in the iron of which we had great store on board sent from england by the merchants along with captain swan i durst not barter it away  these rings when first polished look very gloriously but time makes them fade and turn to a pale yellow then they make a soft paste of red earth and smearing it over their rings they cast them into a quick fire where they remain till they be red hot then they take them out and cool them in water and rub off the past and they look again of a glorious color and luster  these people make but small low houses the sides which are made of small posts watled with boughs are not above   foot and a half high the ridgepole is about   or   foot high they have a fireplace at one end of their houses and boards placed on the ground to lie on they inhabit together in small villages built on the sides and tops of rocky hills   or   rows of houses one above another and on such steep precipices that they go up to the first row with a wooden ladder and so with a ladder still from every story up to that above it there being no way to ascend the plain on the first precipice may be so wide as to have room both for a row of houses that stand all along on the edge or brink of it and a very narrow street running along before their doors between the row of houses and the foot of the next precipice the plain of which is in a manner level to the tops of the houses below and so for the rest the common ladder to each row or street comes up at a narrow passage left purposely about the middle of it and the street being bounded with a precipice also at each end it is but drawing up the ladder if they be assaulted and then there is no coming at them from below but by climbing up as against a perpindicular wall and that they may not be assaulted from above they take care to build on the side of such a hill whose backside hangs over the sea or is some high steep perpendicular precipice altogether inaccessible these precipices are natural for the rocks seem too hard to work on nor is there any sign that art has been employed about them on bashee island there is one such and built upon with its back next the sea grafton and monmouth isles are very thick set with these hills and towns and the natives whether for fear of pirates or foreign enemies or factions among their own clans care not for building but in these fastnesses which i take to be the reason that orange isle though the largest and as fertile as any yet being level and exposed has no inhabitants i never saw the like precipices and towns  these people are pretty ingenious also in building boats their small boats are much like our deal yalls but not so big and they are built with very narrow plank pinned with wooden pins and some nails they have also some pretty large boats which will carry  0 or  0 men these they row with    or    oars of a side they are built much like the small ones and they row doubled banked that is two men setting on one bench but one rowing on one side the other on the other side of the boat they understand the use of iron and work it themselves their bellows are like those at mindanao  the common employment for the men is fishing but i did never see them catch much whether it is more plenty at other times of the year i know not the women do manage their plantations  i did never see them kill any of their goats or hogs for themselves yet they would beg the panches of the goats that they themselves did sell to us and if any of our surly seamen did heave them into the sea they would take them up again and the skins of the goats also they would not meddle with hogsguts if our men threw away any beside what they made chitterlings and sausages of the goat skins these people would carry ashore and making a fire they would singe off all the hair and afterward let the skin lie and perch on the coals till they thought it eatable and then they would know it and tear it in pieces with their teeth and at last swallow it the paunches of the goats would make them an excellent dish they dressed it in this manner they would turn out all the chopped grass and crudities found in the maw into their pots and set it over the fire and stir it about often this would smoke and puff and heave up as it was boiling wind breaking out of the ferment and making a very savory stink while this was doing if they had any fish as commonly they had   or   small fish these they would make very clean as hating nastiness belike and cut the flesh from the bone and then mince the flesh as small as possibly they could and when that in the pot was well boiled they would take it up and strewing a little salt into it they would eat it mixed with their raw minced flesh the dung in the maw would look like so much boiled herbs mined very small and they took up their mess with their fingers as the moors do their pilaw using no spoons  they had another dish made of a sort of locusts whose bodies were about an inch and an half long and as thick as the top of ones little finger with large thin wings and long and small legs at this time of the year these creatures came in great swarms to devour their potatoleaves and other herbs and the natives would go out with small nets and take a quart at one sweep when they had enough they would carry them home and parch them over the fire in an earthen pan and then their wings and legs would fall off and their heads and backs would turn red like boiled shrimps being before brownish their bodies being full would eat very moist their heads would crackle in ones teeth i did once eat of this dish and liked it well enough but their other dish my stomach would not take  their common drink is water as it is of all other indians beside which they make a sort of drink with the juice of the sugarcane which they boil and put some small black sort of berries among it when it is well boiled they put it into great jars and let it stand   or   days and work then it settles and becomes clear and is presently fit to drink this is an excellent liquor and very much like english beer both in color and taste it is very strong and i do believe very wholesome for our men who drank briskly of it all day for several weeks were frequently drunk with it and never sick after it the natives brought a vast deal of it every day to those aboard and ashore for some of our men were ashore at work on bashee island which island they gave that name to from their drinking this liquor there that being the name which the natives called this liquor by and as they sold it to our men very cheap so they did not spare to drink it as freely and indeed from the plenty of this liquor and their plentiful use of it our men called all these islands the bashee islands  what language these people do speak i know not for it had no affinity in sound to the chinese which is spoke much through the teeth nor yet to the malayan language they called the metal that their earrings were made of bullawan which is the mindana word for gold therefore propably they may be related to the philippine indians for that is the general name for gold among all those indians i could not learn from whence they have their iron but it is most likely they go in their great boats to the north end of luconia and trade with the indians of that island for it neither did i see any thing beside iron and pieces of buffaloes hides which i could judge that they bought of strangers their clothes were of their own growth and manufacture  these men had wooden lances and a few lances headed with iron which are all the weapons that they have their armor is a piece o buffaloehide shaped like our carters frocks being without sleeves and sowed both sides together with holes for the head and the arms to come forth this buffcoat reaches down to their knees it is close about their shoulders but below it is   foot wide and as thick as a board  i could never perceive them to worship any thing neither had they any idols neither did they seem to observe any one day more than other i could never perceive that one man was of greater power than another but they seemed to be all equal only every man ruling in his own house and the children respecting and honoring their parents  yet it is probable that they have some law or custom by which they are governed for while we lay here we saw a young man buried alive in the earth and twas for theft as far as we could understand from them there was a great deep hole dug and abundance of people came to the place to take their last farewell of him among the rest there was one woman who made great lamentation and took off the condemned persons earrings we supposed her to be his mother after he had taken his leave of her and some others he was put into the pit and covered over with earth he did not struggle but yielded very quietly to his punishment and they crammed the earth close upon him and stifled him  they have but one wife with whom they live and agree very well and their children live very obediently under them the boys go out a fishing with their fathers and the girls live at home with their mothers and when the girls are grown pretty strong they send them to their plantations to dig hames and potatoes of which they bring home on their heads every day enough to serve the whole family for they have no rice nor maize  their plantations are in the valleys at a good distance from their houses where every man has a certain spot of land which is properly his own this he manageth himself for his own use and provides enough that he may not be beholding to his neighbor  notwithstanding the seeming nastiness of their dish of goats maw they are in their persons a very neat cleanly people both men and women and they are withal the quietest and civilest people that i did ever meet with i could never perceive them to be angry with one another i have admired to see  0 or  0 boats aboard our ship at a time and yet no difference among them but all civil and quiet endeavoring to help each other on occasion no noise nor appearance of distaste and although sometimes cross accidents would happen which might have set other men together by the ears yet they were not moved by them sometimes they will also drink freely and warm themselves with their drink yet neither then could i ever perceive them out of humor they are not only thus civil among themselves but very obliging and kind to strangers nor were their children rude to us as is usual indeed the women when we came to their houses would modesty beg any rags or small pieces of cloth to swaddle their young ones in holding out their children to us and begging is usual among all these wild nations yet neither did they beg so importunely as in other places nor did the men ever beg any thing at all neither except once at the first time that we came to an anchor as i shall relate did they steal any thing but dealt justly and with great sincerity with us and make us very welcome to their houses with bashee drink if they had none of this liquor themselves they would buy a jar of drink of their neighbors and sit down with us for we could see them go and give a piece or two of their gold for some jars of bashee and indeed among wild indians as these seem to be i wondered to see buying and selling which is not so usual nor to converse so freely as to go aboard strangers ships with so little caution yet their own small trading may have brought them to this at these entertainments they and their family wife and children drank out of small callabashes and when by themselves they drink about from one to another but when any of us came among them then they would always drink to one of us  they have no sort of coin but they have small crumbs of the metal before described which they bind up very safe in plantain leaves or the like this metal they exchange for what they want giving a small quantity of it about   or   grains for a jar of drink that would hold   or   gallons they have no scales but give it by guess thus much in general  to proceed therefore with our affairs i have said before that we anchored here the  th day of august while we were furling our sails there came near  00 boats of the natives aboard with   or   men in each so that our deck was full of men we were at first afraid of them and therefore got up  0 or  0 small arms on our poop and kept   or   men as sentinels with guns in their hands ready to fire on them if they had offered to molest us but they were pretty quiet only they picked up such old iron that they found on our deck and they also took out our pumpbolts and linchpins out of the carriages of our guns before we perceived them at last one of our men perceived one of them very busy getting out one of our linch pins and took hold of the fellow who immediately bawled out and all the rest presently leaped overboard some into their boats others into the sea and they all made away for the shore but when we perceived their fright we made much of him that was in hold who stood trembling all the while and at last we gave him a small piece of iron with which he immediately leapt overboard and swam to his consorts who hovered about our ship to see the issue then we beckned to them to come aboard again being very loath to lose a commerce with them some of the boats came aboard again and they were always very honest and civil afterward  we presently after this sent a canoa ashore to see their manner of living and what provision they had the canoas crew were made very welcome with bashee drink and saw abundance of hogs some of which they bought and returned aboard after this the natives brought aboard both hogs and goats to us in their own boats and every day we should have    or  0 hogs and goats in boats aboard by our side these we bought for a small matter we could buy a good fat goat for an old iron hoop and a hog of  0 or  0 pound weight for   or   pound of iron their drink also they brought off in jars which we bought for old nails spikes and leaden bullets beside the forementioned commodities they brought aboard great quantities of yams and potatoes which we purchased for nails spikes or bullets it was one mans work to be all day cutting out bars of iron into small pieces with a cold chisel and these were for the great purchases of hogs and goats which they would not sell for nails as their drink and roots woe never let them know what store we have that they may value it the more every morning as soon as it was light they would thus come aboard with their commodities which we bought as we had occasion we did commonly furnish our selves with as many goats and roots as served us all the day and their hogs we bought in large quantities as we thought convenient for we salted them their hogs were very sweet but i never saw so many meazled ones  we filled all our water at a curious brook close by us in graftons isle where we first anchored we stayed there about three or four days before we went to other islands we sailed to the southward passing on the east side of grafton island and then passed through between that and monmouth island but we found no anchoring till we came to the north end of monmouth island and there we stopped during one tide the tide runs very strong here and sometimes makes a short chopping sea its course among these islands is s by e and n by w the flood sets to the north and ebb to the south and it rises and falls   foot  when we went from hence we coasted about   leagues to the southward on the west side of monmouth island and finding no anchorground we stood over to the bashee island and came to an anchor on the north east part of it against a small sandy bay in   fathom clean hard sand and about a quarter of a mile from the shore here is a pretty wide channel between these two islands and anchoring all over it the depth of water is       and    fathom  we presently built a tent ashore to mend our sails in and stayed all the rest of our time here viz from the   th day of august till the   th day of september in which time we mended our sails and scrubbd our ships bottom very well and every day some of us went to their towns and were kindly entertained by them their boats also came aboard with their merchandise to sell and lay aboard all day and if we did not take it off their hands one day they would bring the same again the next  we had yet the winds at s w and s s w mostly fair weather in october we did expect the winds to shift to the n e and therefore we provided to sail as soon as the eastern monsoon was settled to cruize off of manila accordingly we provided a stock of provision we salted  0 or  0 good fat hogs and bought yams and potatoes good store to eat at sea  about the   th day of september the winds shifted about to the east and from thence to the n e fine fair weather the   th it came at n and began to grow fresh and the sky began to be clouded and the wind freshned on us  at    a clock at night it blew a very fierce storm we were then riding with our best bower a head and though our yards and topmast were down yet we drove this obliged us to let go our sheetanchor veering out a good scope of cable which stopped us till  0 or    a clock the next day then the wind came on so fierce that she drove again with both anchors ahead the wind was now at n by w and we kept driving till   or   a clock in the afternoon and it was well for us that there were no islands rocks or sands in our way for if there had we must have been driven upon them we used our utmost endeavors to stop here being loath to go to sea because we had six of our men ashore who could not get off now at last we were driven out into deep water and then it was in vain to wait any longer therefore we hove in our sheet cable and got up our sheet anchor and cut away our best bower for to have heaved her up then would have gone near to have foundred us and so put to sea we had very violent weather the night ensuing with very hard rain and we were forced to scud with our bare poles till   a clock in the morning then the wind slackened and we brought our ship to under a mizen and lay with our head to the westward the   th day the wind abated much but it rained very hard all day and the night ensuing the   th day the wind came about to the n e and it cleared up and blew a hard gale but it stood not there for it shifted about to the eastward thence to the s e then to the south and at last settled at s w and then we had a moderate gale and fair weather  it was the   th day when the wind came to the s w then we made all the sail we could for the island again the  0th day we had the wind at west and saw the islands but could not get in before night therefore we stood off to the southward till two a clock in the morning then we tackt and stood in all the morning and about    a clock the  st day of october we anchored again at the place from whence we were driven  then our six men were brought aboard by the natives to whom we gave   whole bars of iron for their kindness and civility which was an extraordinaay present to them mr robert hall was one of the men that was left ashore i shall speak more of him hereafter he and the rest of them told me that after the ship was out of sight the natives began to be more kind to them than they had been before and persuaded them to cut their hair short as theirs was offering to each of them if they would do it a young woman to wife and a small hatchet and other iron utensils fit for a planter in dowry and withal showed them a piece of land for them to manage they were courted thus by several of the town where they then were but they took up their head quarters at the house of him with whom they first went ashore when the ship appeared in sight again then they importuned them for some iron which is the chief thing that they covet even above their earrings we might have bought all their earrings or other gold they had with our ironbars had we been assured of its goodness and yet when it was touched and compard with other gold we could not discern any difference though it looked so pale in the lump but the seeing them polish it so often was a new discouragement  this last storm put our men quite out of heart for although it was not altogether so fierce as that which we were in on the coast of china which was still fresh in memory yet it wrought more powerfully and frighted them from their design of cruising before manila fearing another storm there now every man wished himself at home as they had done an hundred times before but captain read and captain teat the master persuaded them to go toward cape comorin and then they would tell them more of their minds intending doubtless to cruize in the red sea and they easily prevailed with the crew  the eastern monsoon was now at hand and the best way had been to go through the streights of malacca but captain teat said it was dangerous by reason of many islands and shoals there with which none of us were acquainted therefore he thought it best to go round on the east side of all the philippine islands and so keeping south toward the spice islands to pass out into the east indian ocean about the island timor  this seemed to be a very tedious way about and as dangerous altogether for sholes but not for meeting with english or dutch ships which was their greatest fear i was well enough satisfied knowing that the farther we went the more knowledge and experience i should get which was the main thing that i regarded and should also have the more variety of places to attempt an escape from them being fully resolved to take the first opportunity of giving them the slip  chap xvi they depart from the bashee islands and passing by some others and the n end of luconia st johns isle and other of the phillipines they stop at the two isles near mindanao where they refit their ship and make a pump after the spanish fashion by the young prince of the spice island they have news of captain swan and his men left at mindanao the author proposes to the crew to return to him but in vain the story of his murder at mindanao the cloveislands ternate tidore etc the island celebes and dutch town of macasser they coast along the east side of celebes and between it and other islands and sholes with great difficulty shy turtle vast cockles a wild vine of great virtue for sores great trees one excessively big beacons instead of buoys on the sholes a spout a description of them with a story of one uncertain tornadoes turtle the island bouton and its chief town and harbor callasusung the inhabitants visits given and received by the sultan his device in the flag of his proe his guards habit and

their feathers habit food arms etc the way of fetching fire out of wood the inhabitants on the islands their habitations unfitness for labor etc the great tides here they design for the island cocos and cape comorin  the third day of october      we sailed from these islands standing to the southward intending to sail through among the spice islands we had fair weather and the wind at west we first steered s s w and passed close by certain small islands that lie just by the northend of the island luconia we left them all on the west of us and past on the east side of it and the rest of the philippine islands coasting to the southward  the n east end of the island luconia appears to be good champion land of an indifferent height plain and even for many leagues only it has some pretty high hills standing upright by themselves in these plains but no ridges of hills or chains of mountains joining one to another the land on this side seems to be most savannah or pasture the s e part is more mountainous and woody  leaving the island luconia and with it our golden projects we sailed on to the southward passing on the east side of the rest of the philippine islands these appear to be more mountainous and less woody till we came in sight of the island st john the first of that name i mentioned the other i spoke of on the coast of china this i have already described to be a very woody island here the wind coming southerly forced us to keep farther from the islands  the    day of october we came close by a small low woody island that lies east from the s e end of mindanao distant from it about  0 leagues i do not find it set down in any seachart  the   th day we had the wind at n e and we steered west for the island mindanao and arrived at the s e end again on the   th day there we went in and anchored between two small islands which lie in about   d  0 m north lat i mentioned them when we first came on this coast here we found a fine small cove on the n w end of the eastermost island fit to careen in or hale ashore so we went in there and presently unriggd our ship and provided to hale our ship ashore to clean her bottom these islands are about   or   leagues from the island mindanao they are about   or   leagues in circumference and of a pretty good height the mold is black and deep and there are two small brooks of fresh water  they are both plentifully stored with great high trees therefore our carpenters were sent ashore to cut down some of them for our use for here they made a new boltsprit which we did set here also our old one being very saulty they made a new foreyard too and a foretopmast and our pumps being faulty and not serviceable they did cut a tree to make a pump they first squared it then sawed it in the middle and then hollowed each side exactly the two hollow sides were made big enough to contain a pumpbox in the midst of them both when they were joined together and it required their utmost skill to close them exactly to the making a tight cylinder for the pumpbox being unaccustomed to such work we learnt this way of pumpmaking from the spaniards who make their pumps that they use in their ships in the southseas after this manner and i am confident that there are no better handpumps in the world than they have  while we lay here the young prince that i mentioned in the   th chapter came aboard he understanding that we were bound farther to the southward desired us to transport him and his men to his own island he showed it to us in our draft and told us the name of it which we put down in our draft for it was not named there but i quite forgot to put it into my journal  this man told us that not above six days before this he saw captain swan and several of his men that we left there and named the names of some of them who he said were all well and that now they were at the city of mindanao but that they had all of them been out with raja laut fighting under him in his wars against his enemies the alfoores and that most of them fought with undaunted courage for which they were highly honored and esteemed as well by the sultan as by the general raja laut that now capt swan intended to go with his men to fort st george and that in order thereto he had proffered forty ounces of gold for a ship but the owner and he were not yet agreed and that he feared that the sultan would not let him go away till the wars were ended  all this the prince told us in the malayan tongue which many of us had learnt and when he went away he promised to return to us again in   days time and so long captain read promised to stay for him for we had now almost finished our business and he seemed very glad of the opportunity of going with us  after this i endeavored to persuade our men to return with the ship to the river of mindanao and offer their service again to captain swan i took an opportunity when they were filling of water there being then half the ships company ashore and i found all these very willing to do it i desired them to say nothing till i had tried the minds of the other half which i intended to do the next day it being their turn to fill water then but one of these men who seemed most forward to invite back captain swan told captain read and captain teat of the project and they presently dissuaded the men from any such designs yet fearing the worst they made all possible haste to be gone  i have since been informed that captain swan and his men stayed there a great while afterward and that many of the men got passage from thence in dutch sloops to ternate particularly mr rofy and mr nelly there they remained a great while and at last got to batavia where the dutch took their journals from them and so to europe and that some of captain swans men died at mindanao of which number mr harthrope and mr smith captain swans merchants were two at last captain swan and his surgeon going in a small canoa aboard of a dutch ship then in the road in order to get passage to europe were overset by the natives at the mouth of the river who waited their coming purposely to do it but unsuspected by them where they both were killed in the water this was done by the generals order as some think to get his gold which he did immediately seize on others say it was because the generals house was burnt a little before and captain swan was suspected to be the author of it and others say that it was captain swans threats occasioned his own ruin for he would often say passionately that he had been abused by the general and that he would have satisfaction for it saying also that now he was well acquainted with their rivers and knew how to come in at any time that he also knew their manner of fighting and the weakness of their country and therefore he would go away and get a band of men to assist him and returning thither again he would spoil and take all that they had and their country too when the general had been informed of these discourses he would say what is captain swan made of iron and able to resist a whole kingdom or does he think that we are afraid of him that he speaks thus yet did he never touch him till now the mindanayans killed him it is very probable there might be somewhat of truth in all this for the captain was passionate and the general greedy of gold but whatever was the occasion so he was killed as several have assured me and his gold seized on and all his things and his journal also from england as far as cape corrientes on the coast of mexico this journal was afterward sent away from thence by mr moody who was there both a little before and a little after the murder and he sent it to england by mr goddard chief mate of the defense  but to our purpose seeing i could not persuade them to go to captain swan again i had a great desire to have had the princes company but captain read was afraid to let his fickle crew lie long that very day that the prince had promised to return to us which was november        we sailed hence directing our course southwest and having the wind at n w  this wind continued till we came in sight of the island celebes then it veered about to the w and to the southward of the west we came up with the n e end of the island celebes the  th day and there we found the current setting to the westward so strongly that we could hardly get on the east side of that island  the island celebes is a very large island extended in length from north to south about   degrees of lat and in breadth it is about   degrees it lies under the equator the northend being in lat   d  0 m north and the southend in lat   d  0 m south and by common account the northpoint in the bulk of this island lies nearest north and south but at the northeast end there runs out a long narrow point stretching n e about  0 leagues and about  0 leagues to the eastward of this long slipe is the island gilolo on the west side of which are   small islands close by it which are very well stored with cloves the two chiefest are ternate and tidore and as the isle of ceylon is reckoned the only place for cinnamon and that of banda for nutmegs so these are thought by some to be the only cloveislands in the world but this is a great error as i have already shown  at the southend of the island clebes there is a sea or gulf of about   or   leagues wide and  0 or  0 long which runs up the country almost directly to the north and this gulf has several small islands along the middle of it on the west side of the island almost at the southend of it the town of macasser is seated a town of great strength and trade belonging to the dutch  there are great inlets and lakes on the east side of the island as also abundance of small islands and sholes lying scattered about it we saw a high peeked hill at the n end but the land on the east side is low all along for we cruized almost the length of it the mold on this side is black and deep and extraordinary fat and rich and full of trees and there are many brooks of water run out into the sea indeed all this east side of the island seems to be but one large grove of extraordinary great high trees  having with much ado got on this east side coasting along to the southward and yet having but little wind and even that little against us at s s w and sometimes calm we were a long time going about the island  the   d day we were in lat   d  0 m south and being about   leagues from the island standing to the southward with a very gentle landwind about   or   a clock in the morning we heard a clashing in the water like boats rowing and fearing some sudden attack we got up all our arms and stood ready to defend our selves as soon as it was day we saw a great proe built like the mindanayan proes with about  0 men in her and   smaller proes they lay still about a mile to windward of us to view us and probably designed to make a prey of us when they first came out but they were now afraid to venture on us  at last we showed them dutch colors thinking thereby to allure them to come to us for we could not go to them but they presently rowed in toward the island and went into a large opening and we saw them no more nor did we ever see any other boats or men but only one fishing canoa while we were about this island neither did we see any house on all the coast  about   or   leagues to the south of this place there is a great range of both large and small islands and many shoals also that are not laid down in our drafts which made it extremely troublesome for us to get through but we past between them all and the island celebes and anchored against a sandy bay in   fathom sandy ground about half a mile from the main island being then in lat   d  0 m south  here we stayed several days and sent out our canoas a striking of turtle every day for here is great plenty of them but they were very shy as they were generally wherever we found them in the east india seas i know not the reason of it unless the natives go very much a striking here for even in the west indies they are shy in places that are much disturbed and yet on newholland we found them shy as i shall relate though the natives there do not molest them  on the sholes without us we went and gathered shellfish at low water there were a monstrous sort of cockles the meat of one of them would suffice   or   men it was very good wholesome meat we did also beat about in the woods on the island but found no game one of our men who was always troubled with sore legs found a certain vine that supported it self by clinging about other trees the leaves reach   or   foot high but the strings or branches    or    it had a very green leaf pretty broad and roundish and of a thick substance these leaves pounded small and boiled with hogs lard make an excellent salve our men knowing the virtues of it stockt themselves here there was scarce a man in the ship but got a pound or two of it especially such as were troubled with old ulcers who found great benefit by it this man that discovered these leaves here had his first knowledge of them in the isthmus of darien he having had his receipt from one of the indians there and he had been ashore in diverse places since purposely to seek these leaves but did never find any but here among the many vast trees hereabouts there was one exceeded all the rest this captain read caused to be cut down in order to make a canoa having lost our boats all but one small one in the late storms so   lusty men who had been logwoodcutters in the bays of campeachy and honduras as captain read himself and many more of us had and so were very expert at this work undertook to fell it taking their turn   always cutting together and they were one whole day and half the next before they got it down this tree though it grew in a wood was yet    foot in circumference and    foot of clean body without knot or branch and even there it had no more than one or two branches and then ran clean again  0 foot higher there it spread it self into many great limbs and branches like an oak very green and flourishing yet it was perished at the heart which marred it for the service intended  so leaving it and having no more business here we weighed and went from hence the next day it being the   th day of november while we lay here we had some tornadoes one or two every day and pretty fresh landwinds which were at west the seabreezes were small and uncertain sometimes out of the n e and so veering about to the east and southeast we had the wind at north east when we weighed and we steered off s s w in the afternoon we saw a shole ahead of us and altered our course to the s s e in the evening at   a clock we were close by another great shole therefore we tackt and stood in for the island celebes again for fear of running on some of the sholes in the night by day a man might avoid them well enough for they had all beacons on them like huts built on tall posts above high water mark probably set up by the natives of the island celebes or those of some other neighboring islands and i never saw any such elsewhere in the night we had a violent tornado out of the s w which lasted about an hour  the  0th day we had a fresh land wind and steered away south passing between the   shoals which we saw the day before these shoals lie in lat   d south and about  0 leagues from the island celebes being past them the wind died away and we lay becalmed till the afternoon then we had a hard tornado out of the south west and toward the evening we saw two or three spouts the first i had seen since i came into the east indies in the west indies i had often met with them a spout is a small ragged piece or part of a cloud hanging down about a yard seemingly from the blackest part thereof commonly it hangs down sloping from thence or sometimes appearing with a small bending or elbow in the middle i never saw any hang perpendicularly down it is small at the lower end seeming no bigger than ones arm but it is fuller toward the cloud from whence it proceeds  when the surface of the sea begins to work you shall see the water for about  00 paces in circumference foam and move gently round till the whirling motion increases and then it flies upward in a pillar about  00 paces in compass at the bottom but lessening gradually upwards to the smallness of the spout it self there where it reaches the lower end of the spout through which the rising seawater seems to be conveyed into the clouds this visibly appears by the clouds increasing in bulk and blackness then you shall presently see the cloud drive along although before it seemed to be without any motion the spout also keeping the same course with the cloud and still sucking up the water as it goes along and they make a wind as they go thus it continues for the space of half an hour more or less until the sucking is spent and then breaking off all the water which was below the spout or pendulous piece of cloud falls down again into the sea making a great noise with its fall and clashing motion in the sea  it is very dangerous for a ship to be under a spout when it breaks therefore we always endeavored to shun it by keeping at a distance if possibly we can but for want of wind to carry us away we are often in great fear and danger for it is usually calm when spouts are at work except only just where they are therefore men at sea when they see a spout coming and know not how to avoid it do sometimes fire shot out of their great guns into it to give it air or vent that so it may break but i did never hear that it proved to be of any benefit  and now being on this subject i think it not amiss to give you an account of an accident that happened to a ship once on the coast of guinea some time in or about the year      one captain records of london bound for the coast of guinea in a ship of  00 tuns and    guns called the blessing when he came into the lat   or   degrees north he saw several spouts one of which came directly toward the ship and he having no wind to get out of the way of the spout made ready to receive it by furling his sails it came on very swift and broke a little before it reached the ship making a great noise and raising the sea round it as if a great house or some such thing had been cast into the sea the fury of the wind still lasted and took the ship on the starboardbow with such violence that it snapt off the boltsprit and foremast both at once and blew the ship all along ready to overset it but the ship did presently right again and the wind whirling round took the ship a second time with the like fury as before but on the contrary side and was again like to overset her the other way the mizenmast felt the fury of this second blast and was snapt short off as the foremast and boltsprit had been before the mainmast and maintopmast received no damage for the fury of the wind which was presently over did not reach them three men were in the foretop when the foremast broke and one on the boltsprit and fell with them into the sea but all of them were saved i had this relation from mr john canby who was then quartermaster and steward of her one abraham wise was chief mate and leonard jefferies second mate  we are usually very much afraid of them yet this was the only damage that ever i heard done by them they seem terrible enough the rather because they come upon you while you lie becalmed like a log in the sea and cannot get out of their way but though i have seen and been beset by them often yet the fright was always the greatest of the harm  december the  st we had a gentle gale at e s e we steered south and at noon i was by observation in lat   d    m south then we saw the island bouton bearing south west and about  0 leagues distant we had very uncertain and unconstant winds the tornadoes came out of the s w which was against us and what other winds we had were so faint that they did us little kindness but we took the advantage of the smallest gale and got a little way every day the  th day at noon i was by observation in lat   d  0 m south  the  th day we got close by the n w end of the island bouton and in the evening it being fair weather we hoised out our canoa and sent the moskito men of whom we had   or   to strike turtle for here are plenty of them but they being shy we chose to strike them in the night which is customary in the west indies also for every time they come up to breathe which is once in   or  0 minutes they blow so hard that one may hear them at  0 or  0 yards distance by which means the striker knows where they are and may more easily approach them than in the day for the turtle sees better than he hears but on the contrary the manatees hearing is quickest  in the morning they returned with a very large turtle which they took near the shore and withal an indian of the island cameaboard with them he spoke the malayan language by which we did understand him he told us that   leagues farther to the southward of us there was a good harbor in which we might anchor so having a fair wind we got thither by noon  this harbor is in lat   d    m south lying on the east side of the island bouton which island lies near the s e end of the island celebcs distant from it about   or   leagues it is of a long form stretching s w and n e about    leagues long and  0 broad it is pretty high land and appears pretty even and flat and very woody  there is a large town within a league of the anchoring place called callasusung being the chief if there were more which we knew not it is about a mile from the sea on the top of a small hill in a very fair plain encompassed with coconut trees without the trees there is a strong stone wall clear round the town the houses are built like the houses at mindanao but more neat and the whole town was very clean and delightsome  the inhabitants are small and well shaped they are much like the mindanaians in shape color and habit but more neat and tight they speak the malayan language and are all mahometans they are very obedient to the sultan who is a little man about  0 or  0 years old and has a great many wives and children  about an hour after we came to an anchor the sultan sent a messenger aboard to know what we were and what our business we gave him an account and he returned ashore and in a short time after he came aboard again and told us that the sultan was very well pleased when he heard that we were english and said that we should have any thing that the island afforded and that he himself would come aboard in the morning therefore the ship was made clean and every thing put in the best order to receive him  the  th day in the morning betimes a great many boats and canoas came aboard with fowls eggs plantains potatoes etc but they would dispose of none till they had order for it from the sultan at his coming about  0 a clock the sultan came aboard in a very neat proe built after the mindanao fashion there was a large white silk flag at the head of the mast edged round with a deep red for about   or   inches broad and in the middle there was neatly drawn a green griffon trampling on a winged serpent that seemed to struggle to get up and threatened his adversary with open mouth and with a long sting that was ready to be darted into his legs other eastindian princes have their devices also  the sultan with   or   of his nobles and   of his sons sat in the house of the proe his guards were  0 musketeers   standing on one side of the proe and   on the other side and before the door of the proehouse stood one with a great broad sword and a target and   more such at the after part of the house and in the head and stern of the proe stood   musketeers more   at each end  the sultan had a silk turbat laced with narrow gold lace by the sides and broad lace at the end which hung down on one side the head after the mindanayan fashion he had a sky colored silk pair of breeches and a piece of red silk thrown cross his shouldiers and hanging loofe about him the greatest part of his back and waist appearing naked he had neither stocking nor shoe one of his sons was about    or    year old the other two were young things and they were always in the arms of one or other of his attendants  captain read met him at the side and led him into his small cabin and fired five guns for his welcome as soon as he came aboard he gave leave to his subjects to traffic with us and then our people bought what they had a mind to the sultan seemed very well pleased to be visited by the english and said he had coveted to have a sight of englishmen having heard extraordinary characters of their just and honorable dealing but he exclaimed against the dutch as all the mindanayans and all the indians we met with do and wished them at a greater distance  for macasser is not very far from henee one of the chiefest towns that the dutch have in those parts from thence the dutch comes sometimes hither to purchase slaves the slaves that these people get here and sell to the dutch are some of the idolatrous natives of the island who not being under the sultan and having no head live straggling in the country flying from one place to another to preserve themselves from the prince and his subjects who hunt after them to make them slaves for the civilized indians of the maritime places who trade with foreigners if they cannot reduce the inland people to the obedience of their prince they catch all they can of them and sell them for slaves accounting them to be but as savages just as the spaniards do the poor americans  after two or three hours discourse the sultan went ashore again and   guns were fired at his departure also the next day he sent for captain read to come ashore and he with   or   men went to wait on the sultan i could not slip an opportunity of seeing the place and so accompanied them we were met at the landing place by two of the chief men and guided to a pretty neat house where the sultan waited our coming the house stood at the farther end of all the town beforementioned which we past through and abundance of people were gazing on us as we past by when we came near the house there were  0 poor naked soldiers with muskets made a lane for us to pass through this house was not built on posts as the rest were after the mindanayan way but the room in which we were entertained was on the ground covered with mats to sit on our entertainment was tobacco and betelnut and young coconuts and the house was beset with men and women and children who thronged to get near the windows to look on us  we did not tarry above an hour before we took our leaves and departed this town stands in a sandy soil but what the rest of the island is i know not for none of us were ashore but at this place  the next day the sultan came aboard again and presented capt read with a little boy but he was too small to be serviceable on board and so captain read returned thanks and told him he was to little for him then the sultan sent for a bigger boy which the captain accepted this boy was a very pretty tractable boy but what was wonderful in him he had two rows of teeth one within another on each jaw none of the other people were so nor did i ever see the like the captain was presented also with   hegoats and was promised some buffaloe but i do believe that they have but few of either on the island we did not see any buffaloe nor many goats neither have they much rice but their chiefest food is roots we bought here about a thousand pound weight of potatoes here our men bought also abundance of crockadores and fine large parakites curiously colored and some of them the finest i ever saw  the crockadore is as big as a parrrot and shaped much like it with such a bill but it is as white as milk and has a bunch of feathers on his head like a crown at this place we bought a proe also of the mindanaian make for our own use which our carpenters afterward altered and made a delicate boat fit for any service she was sharp at both ends but we sawed off one and made that end flat fast ening a rudder to it and she rowed and sailed incomparably  we stayed here but till the   th day because it was a bad harbor and foul ground and a bad time of the year too for the tornadoes began to come in thick and strong when we went to weigh our anchor it was hooked in a rock and we broke our cable and could not get our anchor though we strove hard for it so we went away and left it there we had the wind at n n e and we steered toward the s e and fell in with   or   small islands that lie in  d  0 m south lat and about   or   leagues from callasusung harbor these islands appeared very green with coconut trees and we saw two or three towns on them and heard a drum all night for we were got in among shoals end could no get out again till the next day we knew not whether the drum were for for fear of us or that they were making merry as it is usual in these parts to do all the night singing and dancing till morning  we found a pretty strong tide here the flood setting to the southward and the ebb to the northward these sholes and many other that are not laid down in our drafts lie on the south west side of the islands where we heard the drum about a league from them at last we past between the islands and tried for a passage on the east side we met with diverse sholes on this side also but found channels to pass through so we steered away for the island timor intending to pass out by it we had the winds commonly at w s w and s w hard gales and rainy weather  the   th day we got clear of the shoals and steered s by e with the wind at w s w but veering every half hour sometimes at s w and then again at w and sometimes at n n w bringing much rain with thunder and lightning  the  0th day we passed by the island omba which is a pretty high island lying in lat   d  0 m and not above   or   leagues from the n e part of the island timor it is about    or    leagues long and   or   leagues wide  about   or   leagues to the west of omba is another pretty large island but it had no name in our plats yet by the situation it should be that which in some maps is called pentare we saw on it abundance of smoaks by day and fires by night and a large town on the northside of it not far from the sea but it was such bad weather that we did not go ashore between omba and pentare and in the mid channel there is a small low sandy island with great sholes on either side but there is a very good channel close by pentare between that and the sholes about the small isle we were three days beating off and on not having a wind for it was at south south west  the   d day in the evening having a small gale at north we got through keeping close by pentare the tide of ebb here set out to the southward by which we were helped through for we had but little wind but this tide which did us a kindness in setting us through had like to have ruined us afterward for there are two small islands lying at the southend of the channel we came through and toward these islands the tide hurried us so swiftly that we very narrowly escaped being driven ashore for the little wind we had before at north dying away we had not one breath of wind when we came there neither was there any anchorground but we got out our oars and rowed yet all in vain for the tide set wholly on one of the small islands that we were forced with might and main strength to bear off the ship by thrusting with our oars against the shore which was a steep bank and by this means we presently drove away clear of danger and having a little wind in the night at north we steered away s s w in the morning again we had the wind at w s w and steered s and the wind coming to the w n w we steered s w to get clear of the s w end of the island timor the   th day we saw the n w point of timor s e by e distant about   leagues  timor is a long high mountainous island stretching n e and s w it is about  0 leagues long and    or    wide the middle of the island is in lat about   d south i have been informed that the portuguese do trade to this island but i know nothing of its produce besides coire for making cables of which there is mention chap x  the   th day we saw two small islands which lie near the s w end of timor they bear from us s e we had very hard gales of wind and still with a great deal of rain the wind at w and w s w  being now clear of all the islands we stood off south intending to touch at new holland a part of terra australis incognita to see what that country would afford us indeed as the winds were we could not now keep our intended course which was first westerly and then northerly without going to new holland unless we had gone back again among the islands but this was not a good time of the year to be among any islands to the south of the equator unless in a good harbor  the   st day we were in lat    d  0 m still standing to the southward the wind bearing commonly very hard at w we keeping upon it under two courses and our mizen and sometimes a maintopsail rift about  0 a clock at night we tackt and stood to the northward for fear of running on a shoal which is laid down in our drafts in lat    d  0 m or thereabouts it bearing s by w from the east end of timor and so the island bore from us by our judgments and reckoning at   a clock we tackt again and stood s by w and s s w  sharp and stood to the southward passing close by it and sounded again but found no ground  this shole is laid down in our drafts not above    or  0 leagues from new holland but we did run afterward  0 leagues due south before we fell in with it and i am very confident that no part of new holland hereabouts lies so far northerly by  0 leagues as it is laid down in our drafts for if new holland were laid down true we must of necessity have been driven near  0 leagues to the westward of our course but this is very improbable that the current should set so strong to the westward seeing we had such a constant westerly wind i grant that when the monsoon shifts first the current does not presently shift but runs afterward near a month but the monsoon had been shifted at least two months now but or the monsoons and other winds and of the currents elsewhere in their proper place as to these here i do rather believe that the land is not laid down true than that the current deceived us for it was more probable we should have been deceived before we met with the shole than afterward for on the coast of new holland we found the tides keeping their constant course the flood running n by e and the ebb s by e  the  th day of january      we fell in with the land of new holland in the lat of    d  0 m having as i said before made our course due south from the shole that we past by the   st day of december we ran in close by it and finding no convenient anchoring because it lies open to the n w we ran along shore to the eastward steering n e by e for so the land lies we steered thus about    leagues and then came to a point of land from whence the land trends east and southerly for  0 or    leagues but how afterward i know not about   leagues to the eastward of this point there is a pretty deep bay with abundance of islands in it and a very good place to anchor in or to hale ashore about a league to the eastward of that point we anchored january the  th        mile from the shore in    fathom good hard sand and clean ground  new holland is a very large tract of land it is not yet determined whether it is an island or a main continent but i am certain that it joins neither to asia africa nor america this part of it that we saw is all low even land with sandy banks against the sea only the points are rocky and so are some of the islands in this bay  the land is of a dry sandy soil destitute of water except you make wells yet producing diverse sorts of trees but the woods are not thick nor the trees very big most of the trees that we saw are dragontrees as we supposed and these too are the largest trees of any there they are about the bigness of our large apple trees and about the same height and the rind is blackish and somewhat rough the leaves are of a dark color the gum distills out of the knots or cracks that are in the bodies of the trees we compared it with some gum dragon or dragons blood that was aboard and it was of the some color and taste the other sorts of trees were not known by any of us there was pretty long grass growing under the trees but it was very thin we saw no trees that bore fruit or berries  we saw no sort of animal nor any track of beast but once and that seemed to be the tread of a beast as big as a great mastiffdog here are a few small landbirds but none bigger than a blackbird and but few seafowls neither is the sea very plentifully stored with fish unless you reckon the manatee and turtle as such of these creatures there is plenty but they are extraordinary shy though the inhabitants cannot trouble them much having neither boats nor iron  the inhabitants of this country are the miserablest people in the world the hodmadods of monomatapa though a nasty people yet for wealth are gentlemen to these who have no houses and skin garments sheep poultry and fruits of the earth ostrich eggs etc as the hodmadods have and setting aside their humane shape they differ but little from brutes they are tall strait bodied and thin with small long limbs they have great heads round foreheads and great brows their eyelids are always half closed to keep the flies out of their eyes they being so troublesome here that no fanning will keep them from coming to ones face and without the assistance of both hands to keep them off they will creep into ones nostrils and mouth too if the lips are not shut very close so that from their infancy being thus annoyed with these insects they do never open their eyes as other people and therefore they cannot see far unless they hold up their heads as if they were looking at somewhat over them  they have great bottle noses pretty full lips and wide mouths the two foreteeth of their upperjaw are wanting in all of them men and women old and young whether they draw them out i know not neither have they any beards they are long visaged and of a very unpleasing aspect having no one graceful feature in their faces their hair is black short and curled like that of the negroes and not long and lank like the common indians the color of their skins both of their faces and the rest of their body is coal black like that of the negroes of guinea  they have no sort of clothes but a piece of the rind of a tree tied like a girdle about their waists and a handful of long grass or   or   small green boughs full of leaves thrust under their girdle cover their nakedness  they have no houses but lie in the open air without any covering the earth being their bed and the heaven their canopy whether they cohabit one man to one woman or promiscuously i know not but they do live in companies  0 or  0 men women and children together their only food is a small sort of fish which they get by making wares of stone across little coves or branches of the sea every tide bringing in the small fish and there leaving them for a prey to these people who constantly attend there to search for them at low water this small fry i take to be the top of their fishery they have no instruments to catch great fish should they come and such seldom stay to be left behind at low water nor could we catch any fish with our hooks and lines all the while we lay there in other places at low water they seek for cockles muscles and periwincles of these shellfish there are fewer still so that their chiefest dependence is upon what the sea leaves in their wares which be it much or little they gather up and march to the places of their abode there the old people that are not able to stir abroad by reason of their age and the tender infants wait their return and what providence has bestowed on them they presently broil on the coals and eat it in common sometimes they get as many fish as makes them a plentiful banquet and at other times they scarce get every one a taste but be it little or much that they get every one has his part as well the young and tender the old and feeble who are not able to go abroad as the strong and lusty when they have eaten they lie down till the next low water and then all that are able march out be it night or day rain or shine it is all one they must attend the wares or else they must fast for the earth affords them no food at all there is neither herb root pulse nor any sor of grain fort them to eat that we saw nor any sort of bird or beast that they can catch having no instruments wherewithal to do so  i did not perceive that they did worship any thing these poor creatures have a sort of weapon to defend their ware or fight with their enemies if they have any that will interfere with their poor fishery they did at first endeavor with their weapons to frighten us who lying ashore deterred them from one of their fishingplaces some of them had wooden swords others had a sort of lances the sword is a piece of wood shaped somewhat like a cutlass the lance is a long strait pole sharp at one end and hardened afterward by heat i saw no iron nor any other sort of metal therefore it is probable they use stonehatchets as some indians in america do described in chap iv  how they get their fire i know not but probably as indians do out of wood i have seen the indians of bonairy do it and have my self tried the experiment they take a flat piece of wood that is pretty soft and make a small dent in one side of it then they take another hard round stick about the bigness of ones little finger and sharpening it at one end like a pencil they put that sharp end in the hole or dent of the flat soft piece and then rubbbing or twirling the hard piece between the palms of their hands they drill the soft piece till it smoaks and at last takes fire  these people speak somewhat through the throat but we could not understand one word that they said we anchored as i said before january the  th and seeing men walking on the shore we presently sent a canoa to get some acquaintance with them for we were in hopes to get some provision among them but the inhabitants seeing our boat coming run away and hid themselves we searched afterward   days in hopes to find their houses but found none yet we saw many places where they had made fires at last being out of hopes to find their habitations we searched no farther but left a great many toys ashore in such places where we thought that they would come in all our search we found no water but old wells on the sandy bays  at last we went over to the islands and there we found a great many of the natives i do believe there were  0 on one island men women and children the men at our first coming ashore threatened us with their lances and swords but they were frightened by firing one gun which we fired purposely to scare them the island was so small that they could not hide themselves but they were much disordered at our landing especially the women and children for we went directly to their camp the lustiest of the women snatching up their infants ran away howling and the little children run after squeaking and bawling but the men stood still some of the women and such people as could not go from us lay still by a fire making a doleful noise as if we had been coming to devour them but when they saw we did not intend to harm them they were pretty quiet and the rest that fled from us at our first coming returned again this their place of dwelling was only a fire with a few boughs before it set up on that side the winds was of  after we had been here a little while the men began to be familiar and we clothed some of them designing to have had some service of them for it for we found some wells of water here and intended to carry   or   barrels of it aboard but it being somewhat troublesome to carry to the canoas we thought to have made these men to have carried it for us and therefore we gave them some clothes to one an old pair of breeches to another a ragged shirt to the third a jacket that was scarce worth owning which yet would have been very acceptable at some places where we had been and so we thought they might have been with these people we put them on them thinking that this finery would have brought them to work heartily for us and our water being filled in small long barrels about   gallons in each which were made purposely to carry water in we brought these our new servants to the wells and put a barrel on each of their shoulders for them to carry to the canoa but all the signs we could make were to no purpose for they stood like statues without motion but grinnd like so many monkies staring one upon another for these poor creatures seem not accustomed to carry burdens and i believe that one of our shipboys of  0 years old would carry as much as one of them so we were forced to carry our water our selves and they very fairly put the clothes off again and laid them down as if clothes were only to work in i did not perceive that they had any great liking to them at first neither did they seem to admire any thing that we had  at another time our canoa being among these islands seeking for game espied a drove of these men swimming from one island to another for they have no boats canoas or barklogs they took up four of them and brought them aboard two of them were middle aged the other two were young men about    or  0 years old to these we gave boiled rice and with it turtle and manatee boiled they did greedily devour what we gave them but took no notice of the ship or any thing in it and when they were set on land again they ran away as fast as they could at our first coming before we were acquainted with them or they with us a company of them who lived on the main came just against our ship and standing on a pretty high bank threatened us with their swords and lances by shaking them at us at last the captain ordered the drum to be beaten which was done of a sudden with much vigor purposely to scare the poor creatures they hearing the noise ran away as fast as they could drive and when they ran away in haste they would cry gurry gurry speaking deep in the throat those inhabitants also that live on the main would always run away from us yet we took several of them for as i have already observed they had such bad eyes that they could not see us till we came close to them we did always give them victuals and let them go again but the islanders after our first time of being among them did not stir for us  when we had been here about a week we haled our ship into a small sandy cove at a springtide as far as she would float and at low water she was left dry and the sand dry without us near half a mile for the sea rises and falls here about   fathom the flood runs north by east and the ebb south by west all the neeptides we lay wholly aground for the sea did not come near us by about a hundred yards we had therefore time enough to clean our ships bottom which we did very well most of our men lay ashore in a tent where our sails were mending and our strikers brought home turtle and manatee every day which was our constant food  while we lay here i did endeavor to persuade our men to go to some english factory but was threatened to be turned ashore and left here for it this made me desist and patiently wait for some more convenient place and opportunity to leave them than here which i did hope i should accomplish in a short time because they did intend when they went from hence to bear down toward cape comorin in their way thither they designed also to visit the island cocos which lies in lat    d    m north by our drafts hoping there to find of that fruit the island having its name from thence  chap xvii leaving newholland they pass by the island cocos and touch at another woody island near it a land animal like large crawfish coconuts floating in the sea the island triste bearing cocos yet overflown every springtide they anchor at a small island near that of nassaw hog island and others a proe taken belonging to achin nicobar island and the rest called by that name ambergrease good and bad the manners of the inhabitants of these islands they anchor at nicobar isle its situation soil and pleasant mixture of its bays trees etc the melory tree and fruit used for bread the natives of nicobar island their form habit language habitations no form of religion or government their food and canoas they clean the ship the author projects and gets leave to stay ashore here and with him two englishmen more the portuguese and   malayans of achin their first rencounters with the natives of the common traditions concerning cannibals or maneaters their entertainment ashore they buy a canoa to transport them over to achin but overset her at first going out having recruited and improved her they set out again for the east side of the island they have a war with the islanders but peace being reestablished they lay in stores and make preparations for their voyage  march the   th      we sailed from newholland with the wind at n n w and fair weather we directed our course to the northward intending as i said to touch at the island cocos but we met with the winds at n w w n w and n n w for several days which obliged us to keep a more easterly course than was convenient to find that island we had soon after our setting out very bad weather with much thunder and lightning rain and high blustering winds  it was the   th day of march before we were in the lat of the island cocos which is in    d    m and then by judgment we were  0 or  0 leagues to the east of it and the wind was now at s w therefore we did rather choose to bear away toward some islands on the west side of sumatra than to beat against the wind for the island cocos i was very glad of this being in hopes to make my escape from them to sumatra or some other place  we met nothing of remark in this voyage beside the catching   great sharks till the   th day then we fell in with a small woody island in lat  0 d  0 m its longitude from newholland from whence we came was by my account    d   m west it was deep water about the island and therefore no anchoring but we sent two canoas ashore one of them with the carpenters to cut a tree to make another pump the other canoa went to search for fresh water and found a fine small brook near the s w point of the island but there the sea fell in on the shore so high that they could not get it off at noon both our canoas returned aboard and the carpenters brought aboard a good tree which they afterward made a pump with such a one as they made at mindanao the other canoa brought aboard as many boobies and men of war birds as sufficed all the ships company when they were boiled they got also a sort of landanimal somewhat resembling a large crawfish without its great claws these creatures lived in holes in the dry sandy ground like rabbits sir francis drake in his voyage round the world makes mention of such that he found at ternate or some other of the spice islands or near them they were very good sweet meat and so large that two of them were more than a man could eat being almost as thick as ones leg their shells were of a dark brown but red when boiled  this island is of a good height with steep cliffs against the s and s w and a sandy bay on the northside but very deep water steep to the shore the mold is blackish the soil fat producing large trees of diverse sorts  about one a clock in the afternoon we made sail from this island with the wind at s w and we steered n w afterward the winds came about at n w and continued between the w n w and the n n w several days i observed that the winds blew for the most part out of the west or n w and then we had always rainy weather with tornadoes and much thunder and lightning but when the wind came any way to the southward it blew but faint and brought fair weather  we met nothing of remark till the  th day of april and then being in lat   d s we saw the land of sumatra at a great distance bearing north the  th day we saw the east end of the island sumatra very plain we being then in lat   d   the  0th day being in lat   d    m and about   or   leagues from the island sumatra on the west side of it we saw abundance of coconuts swimming in the sea and we hoysed out our boat and took up some of them as also a small hatch or scuttle rather belonging to some bark the nuts were very sound and the kernel sweet and in some the milk or water in them was yet sweet and good  the   th day we came to a small island called triste in lat by observation   d south it is about    or    leagues to the west of the island sumatra from hence to the northward there are a great many small uninhabited islands lying much at the same distance from sumatra this island triste is not a mile round and so low that the tide flows clear over it it is of a sandy soil and full of coconut trees the nuts are but small yet sweet enough full and more ponderous than i ever felt any of that bigness notwithstanding that every springtide the salt water goes clear over the island  we sent ashore our canoas for coconuts and they returned aboard laden with them three times our strikers also went out and struck some fish which was boiled for supper they also killed   young aligators which was salted for the next day  i had no opportunity at this place to make my escape as i would have done and gone over hence to sumatra could i have kept a boat to me but there was no compassing this and so the   th day we went from hence steering to the northward on the west side of sumatra our food now was rice and the meat of the coconuts rasped and steeped in water which made a sort of milk into which we did put our rice making a pleasant mess enough after we parted from triste we saw other small islands that were also full of coconut trees  the   th day being in lat   d    m s the s w point of the island nassaw bore n about   mile did this is a pretty large uninhabited island in lat   d  0 m s and is full of high trees about a mile from the island nassaw there is a small island full of coconut trees there we anchored the   th day to replenish our stock of coconuts a riff of rocks lies almost round this island so that our boats could not go ashore nor come aboard at low water yet we got aboard four boatload of nuts this island is low like triste and the anchoring is on the northside where you have fourteen fathom a mile from shore clean sand  the   st day we went from hence and kept to the northward coasting still on the west side of the island sumatra and having the winds between the w and s s w with unsettled weather sometimes rains and tornadoes and sometimes fair weather  the   th day we crossed the equator still coasting to the northward between the island sumatra and a range of small islands lying    or    leagues off it amongst all these islands hogisland is the most considerable it lies in lat   d  0 m north it is pretty high even land clothed with tall flourishing trees we past it by the   th day  the   th we saw a sail to the north of us which we chased but it being little wind we did not come up with her till the  0th day then being within a league of her captain read went into a canoa and took her and brought her aboard she was a proe with four men in her belonging to achin whether she was bound she came from one of these coconut islands that we past by and was laden with coconuts and coconut oil captain read ordered his men to take aboard all the nuts and as much of the oil as he thought convenient and then cut a hole in the bottom of the proe and turned her loose keeping the men prisoners  it was not for the lucre of the cargo that captain read took this boat but to hinder me and some others from going ashore for he knew that we were ready to make our escapes if an opportunity presented it self and he thought that by his abusing and robbing the natives we should be afraid to trust our selves among them but yet this proceeding of his turned to our great advantage as shall be declared hereafter  may the  st we ran down by the north west end of the island sumatra within   or   leagues of the shore all this west side of sumatra which we thus coasted along our englishmen at fort st george call the westcoast simply without adding the name of sumatra the prisoners who were taken the day before showed us the islands that lie off achin harbor and the channels through which ships go in and told us also that there was an english factory at achin i wished my self there but was forced to wait with patience till my time was come  we were now directing our course toward the nicobar islands intending there to clean the ships bottom in order to make her sail well  the  th day in the evening we had sight of one of the nicobar islands the southermost of them lies about  0 leagues n n w from the n w end of the island sumatra this most southerly of them is nicobar it self but all the cluster of islands lying south of the audeman islands are called by our seamen the nicobar islands  the inhabitants of these islands have no certain converse with any nation but as ships pass by them they will come aboard in their proes and offer their commodities to sail never enquiring of what nation they are for all white people are alike to them their chiefest commodities are ambergrease and fruits  ambergrease is often found by the native indians of these islands who know it very well as also know how to cheat ignorant strangers with a certain mixture like it several of our men bought such of them for a small purchase capt weldon also about this time touched at some of these islands to the north of the island where we lay and i saw a great deal of such ambergrease that one of his men bought there but it was not good having no smell at all yet i saw some there very good and fragrant  at that island where captain weldon was there were two friars sent thither to convert the indians one of them came away with captain weldon the other remained there still he that came away with captain weldon gave a very good character of the inhabitants of that island viz that they were very honest civil harmless people that they were not addicted to quarrelling theft or murder that they did marry or at least live as man and wife one man with one woman never changing till death made the separation that they were punctual and honest in performing their bargains and that they were inclined to receive the christian religion this relation i had afterward from the mouth of a priest at tonqueen who told me that he received this information by a letter from the friar that captain weldon brought away from thence but to proceed  the  th day of may we ran down on the westside of the island nicobar properly so called and anchored at the n w end of it in a small bay in   fathom water not half a mile from the shore the body of this island is in   d  0 m north lat it is about    leagues long and   or   broad the southend of it is pretty high with steep cliffs against the sea the rest of the island is low flat and even the mold of it is black and deep and it is very well watered with small running streams it produces abundance of tall trees fit for any uses for the whole bulk of it seems to be but one entire grove but that which adds most to its beauty off at sea are the many spots of coconut trees which grow round it in every small bay the bays are half a mile or a mile long more or less and these bays are intercepted or divided from each other with as many little rocky points  woodland  as the coconut trees do thus grow in groves fronting to the sea in the bays so there is another sort of fruittree in the bays bordering on the backside of the cocotrees farther from the sea it is called by the natives a melorytree this tree is as big as our large apple trees and as high it has a blackish rind and a pretty broad leaf the fruit is as big as the breadfruit at guam described in chapter x or a large penny loaf it is shaped like a pear and has a pretty tough smooth rind of a light green color the inside of the fruit is in substance much like an apple but full of small strings as big as a brown thread i did never see of these trees any where but here  the natives of this island are tall welllimbd men pretty longvisagd with black eyes their noses middle proportioned and the whole symmetry of their faces agreeing very well their hair is black and lank and their skins of a dark coppercolour the women have no hair on their eyebrows i do believe it is plucked up by the roots for the men had hair growing on their eyebrows as other people  the men go all naked save only a long narrow piece of cloth or sash which going round their wastes and thence down between their thighs is brought up behind and tuckt in at that part which goes about the waste the women have a kind of a short petticoat reaching from their waste to their knees  their language was different from any that i had ever heard before yet they had some few malayan words and some of them had a word or two of portugueze which probably they might learn aboard of their ships passing by this place for when these men see a sail they do presently go aboard of them in their canoas i did not perceive any form of religion that they had they had neither temple nor idol nor any manner of outward veneration to any deity that i did see  they inhabit all round the island by the seaside in the bays there being   or   houses more or less in each bay their houses are built on posts as the mindanayans are they are small low and of a square form there is but one room in each house and this room is about   foot from the ground and from thence the roof is raised about   foot higher but instead of a sharp ridge the top is exceeding neatly arched with small rafters about the bigness of a mans arm bent round like a half moon and very curiously thatcht with palmetoleaves  they live under no government that i could perceive for they seem to be equal without any distinction every man ruling in his own house their plantations are only those coconut trees which grow by the seaside their being no cleared land farther in on the island for i observed that when past the fruit trees there were no paths to be seen going into the woods the greatest use which they make of their cocotrees is to draw toddy from them of which they are very fond  the melory trees seem to grow wild they have great earthen pots to boil the melory fruit in which will hold    or    gallons these pots they fill with the fruit and putting in a little water they cover the mouth of the pot with leaves to keep the steam while it boils when the fruit is soft they peel off the rind and scrape the pulp from the strings with a flat stick made like a knife and then make it up in great lumps as big as a holland cheese and then it will keep   or   days it looks yellow and tastes well and is their chiefest food for they have no yams potatoes rice nor plantains except a very few yet they have a few small hogs and a very few cocks and hens like ours the men employ themselves in fishing but i did not see much fish that they got every house has at least   or   canoas belonging to it which they draw up ashore  the canoas that they go a fishing in are sharp at both ends and both the sides and the bottom are very thin and smooth they are shaped somewhat like the proes at guam with one side flattish and the other with a pretty big belly and they have small slight outlagers on one side being thus thin and light they are better managed with oars than with sails yet they sail well enough and are steered with a paddle there commonly go  0 or  0 men in one of these canoas and seldom fewer than   or  0 their oars are short and they do not paddle but row with them as we do the benches they sit on when they row are made of split bamboes laid across and so near together that they look like a deck the bamboes lie moveable so that when any go in to row they take up a bambo in the place where they would sit and lay it by to make room for their legs the canoas of those of the rest of these islands were like those of nicobar and probably they were alike in other things for we saw no difference at all in the natives of them who came hither while we were here  but to proceed with our affairs it was as i said before the  th day of may about  0 in the morning when we anchored at this island captain read immediately ordered his men to heel the ship in order to clean her which was done this day and the next all the watervessels were filled they intended to go to sea at night for the winds being yet at n n e the captain was in hopes to get over to cape comorin before the wind shifted otherwise it would have been somewhat difficult for him to get thither because the westerly monsoon was not at hand  i thought now was my time to make my escape by getting leave if possible to stay here for it seemed not very feasible to do it by stealth and i had no reason to despair of getting leave this being a place where my stay could probably do our crew no harm should i design it indeed one reason that put me on the thoughts of staying at this particular place besides the present opportunity of leaving captain read which i did always intend to do as soon i could was that i had here also a prospect of advancing a profitable trade for ambergrease with these people and of gaining a considerable fortune to my self for in a short time i might have learned their language and by accustoming my self to row with them in the proes or canoas especially by conforming my self to their customs and manners of living i should have seen how they got their ambergrease and have known what quantities they get and the time of the year when most is found and then afterward i thought it would be easy for me to have transported my self from thence either in some ship that past this way whether english dutch or portugueze or else to have gotten one of the young men of the island to have gone with me in one of their canoas to achin and there to have furnished my self with such commodities as i found most coveted by them and therewith at my return to have bought their ambergrease  i had till this time made no open show of going ashore here but now the water being filled and the ship in a readiness to sail i desired captain read to set me ashore on this island he supposing that i could not go ashore in a place less frequented by ships than this gave me leave which probably he would have refused to have done if he thought i should have gotten from hence in any short time for fear of my giving an account of him to the english or dutch i soon got up my chest and bedding and immediately got some to row me ashore for fear let his mind should change again  the canoa that brought me ashore landed me on a small sandy bay where there were two houses but no person in them for the inhabitants were removed to some other house probably for fear of us because the ship was close by and yet both men and women came aboard the ship without any sign of fear when our ships canoa was going aboard again they met the owner of the houses coming ashore in his boat he made a great many signs to them to fetch me off again but they would not understand him then he came to me and offered his boat to carry me off but i refused it then he made signs for me to go up into the house and according as i did understand him by his signs and a few malayan words that he used he intimated that somewhat would come out of the woods in the night when i was asleep and kill me meaning probably some wild beast then i carried my chest and clothes up into the house  i had not been ashore an hour before captain teat and one john damarel with   or   armed men more came to fetch me aboard again they need not have sent an armed posse for me for had they but sent the cabbinboy ashore for me i would not have denied going aboard for though i could have hid my self in the woods yet then they would have abused or have killed some of the natives purposely to incense them against me i told them therefore that i was ready to go with them and went aboard with all my things  when i came aboard i found the ship in an uproar for there were   men more who taking courage by my example desired leave also to accompany me one of them was the surgeon mr coppinger the other was mr robert hall and one named ambrose i have forgot his surname these men had always harbored the same designs as i had the two last were not much opposed but captain read and his crew would not part with the surgeon at last the surgeon leapt into the canoa and taking up my gun swore he would go ashore and that if any man did oppose it he would shoot him but john oliver who was then quartermaster leapt into the canoa taking hold of him took away the gun and with the help of two or three more they dragged him again into the ship  then mr hall and ambrose and i were again sent ashore and one of the men that rowed us ashore stole an ax and gave it to us knowing it was a good commodity with the indians it was now dark therefore we lighted a candle and i being the oldest stander in our new country conducted them into one of the houses where we did presently hang up our hammocks we had scarce done this before the canoa came ashore again and brought the   malayan men belonging to achin which we took in the proe we took off of sumatra and the portuguese that came to our ship out of the siam jonk at pulo condore the crew having no occasion for these being leaving the malayan parts where the portuguese spark served as an interpreter and not fearing now that the achinese could be serviceable to us in bringing us over to their country  0 leagues off nor imagining that we durst make such an attempt as indeed it was a bold one now we were men enough to defend our selves against the natives of this island if they should prove our enemies though if none of these men had come ashore to me i should not have feared any danger nay perhaps less because i should have been cautious of giving any offense to the natives and i am of the opinion that there are no people in the world so barbarous as to kill a single person that falls accidently into their hands or comes to live among them except they have before been injured by some outrage or violence committed against them yet even then or afterward if a man could but preserve his life from their first rage and come to treat with them which is the hardest thing because their way is usually to abscond and rushing suddenly upon their enemy to kill him at unawares one might by some slight insinuate ones self into their favors again especially by showing some toy or knack that they didnever see before which any european that has seen the world might soon contrive to amuse them withal as might be done generally even with a little fire struck with a flint and steel  as for the common opinion of authropophagi or maneaters i did never meet with any such people all nations or families in the world that i have seen or heard of having some sort of food to live on either fruit grain pulse or roots which grow naturally or else planted by them if not fish and landanimals besides yea even the people of newholland had fish amidst all their penury and would scarce kill a man purposely to eat him i know not what barbarous customs may formerly have been in the world and to sacrifice their enemies to their gods is a thing has been much talked of with relation to the savages of america i am a stranger to that also if it be or have been customary in any nation there and yet if they sacrifice their enemies it is not necessary they should eat them too after all i will not be peremptory in the negative but i speak as to the compass of my own knowledge and know some of these cannibal stories to be false and many of them have been disproved since i first went to the west indies at that time how barbarous were the poor florida indians accounted whieh now we find to be civil enough what strange stories have we heard of the indians whose islands were called the isles of cannibals yet we find that they do trade very civilly with the french and spaniards and have done so with us i do own that they have formerly endeavored to destroy our plantations at barbados and have since hindered us from settling the island santa loca by destroying two or three colonies successively of those that were settled there and even the island tabago has been often annoyed and ravaged by them when settled by the dutch and still lies wast though a delicate fruitful island as being too near the caribbees on the continent who visit it every year but this was to preserve their own right by endeavoring to keep out any that would settle themselves on those islands where they had planted themselves yet even these people would not hurt a single person as i have been told by some that have been prisoners among them i could instance also in the indians of bocca toro and bocca drago and many other places where they do live as the spaniards call it wild and salvage yet there they have been familiar with privateers but by abuses have withdrawn their friendship again as for these nicobar people i found them affable enough and therefore i did not fear them but i did not much care whether i had gotten any more company or no  but however i was very well satisfied and the rather because we were now men enough to row our selves over to the island sumatra and accordingly we presently consulted how to purchase a canoa of the natives  it was a fine clear moonlight night in which we were left ashore therefore we walked on the sandy bay to watch when the ship would weigh and be gone not thinking our selves secure in our newgotten liberty till then about    or    a clock we saw her under sail and then we returned to our chamber and so to sleep this was the  th of may  the next morning betimes our landlord with   or   of his friends came to see his new guests and was somewhat surprised to see so many of us for he knew of no more but my self yet he seemed to be very well pleased and entertained us with a large calabash of toddy which he brought with him before he went away again for wheresoever we came they left their houses to us but whether out of fear or superstition i know not we bought a canoa of him for an ax and we did presently put our chests and clothes in it designing to go to the southend of the island and lie there till the monsoon shifted which we expected every day  when our things were stowed away we with the achinese entered with joy into our new frigot and launched off from the shore we were no sooner off but our canoa overset bottom upwards we preserved our lives well enough by swimming and dragged also our chests and clothes ashore but all our things were wet i had nothing of value but my journal and some drafts of land of my own taking which i much prized and which i had hitherto carefully preserved mr hall had also such another cargo of books and drafts which were now like to perish but we presently opened our chests and took out our books which with much ado we did afterward dry but some of our drafts that lay loose in our chests were spoiled  we lay here afterward   days making great fires to dry our books the achinese in the mean time fixed our canoa with outlagers on each side and they also cut a good mast for her and made a substantial sail with mats  the canoa being now very well sixth and our books and clothes dry we launched out the second time and rowed toward the east side of the island leaving many islands to the north of us the indians of the island accompanied us with   or  0 canoas against our desire for we thought that these men would make provision dearer at that side of the island we were going to by giving an account what rates we gave for it at the place from whence we came which was owing to the ships being there for the ships crew were not so thrifty in bargaining as they seldom are as single persons or a few men might be apt to be who would keep to one bargain therefore to hinder them from going with us mr hall scared one canoas crew by firing a shot over them they all leapt overboard and cried out but seeing us row away they got into their canoa again and came after us  the firing of that gun made all the inhabitants of the island to be our enemies for presently after this we put ashore at a bay where were four houses and a great many canoas but they all went away and came near us no more for several days we had then a great loaf of melory which was our constant food and if we had a mind to coconuts or toddy our malayans of achin would climb the trees and fetch as many nuts as we would have and a good pot of toddy every morning thus we lived till our melory was almost spent being still in hopes that the natives would come to us and sell it as they had formerly done but they came not to us nay they opposed us wherever we came and often shaking their lances at us made all the show of hatred that they could invent  at last when we saw that they stood in opposition to us we resolved to use force to get some of their food if we could not get it other ways with this resolution we went in our canoa to a small bay on the north part of the island because it was smooth water there and good landing but on the other side the wind being yet on that quarter we could not land without jeopardy of oversetting our canoa and wetting our arms and then we must have lain at the mercy of our enemies who stood   or  00 men in every bay where they saw us coming to keep us off  when we set out we rowed directly to the north end and presently were followed by   or   of their canoas they keeping at a distance rowed away faster than we did and got to the bay before us and there with about  0 more canoas full of men they all landed and stood to hinder us from landing but we rowed in within a hundred yards of them then we lay still and i took my gun and presented at them at which they all fell down flat on the ground but i turned my self about and to show that we did not intend to harm them i fired my gun off to sea so that they might see the shot graze on the water as soon as my gun was laden again we rowed gently in at which some of them withdrew the rest standing up did still cut and hew the air making signs of their hatred till i once more frighted them with my gun and discharged it as before then more of them sneaked away leaving only   or   men on the bay then we rowed in again and mr hall taking his sword in his hand leapt ashore and i stood ready with my gun to fire at the indians if they had injured him but they did not stir till he came to them and saluted them  he shook them by the hand and by such signs of friendship as he made the peace was concluded ratified and confirmed by all that were present and others that were gone were again called back and they all very joyfully accepted of a peace this became universal over all the island to the great joy of the inhabitants there was no ringing of bells nor bonfires made for that is not the custom here but gladness appeared in their countenances for now they could go out and fish again without fear of being taken this peace was not more welcome to them than to us for now the inhabitants brought their melory again to us which we bought for old rags and small stripes of cloth about as broad as the palm of ones hand i did not see abve   or   hens for they have but few on the island at some places we saw some small hogs which we could have bought of them reasonably but we would not offend our achinese friends who were mahometans  we stayed here two or three days and then rowed toward the southend of the island keeping on the east side and we were kindly received by the natives wherever we came when we arrived at the southend of the island we fitted our selves with melory and water we bought   or   loaves of melory and about    large coconut shells that had all the kernel taken out yet were preserved whole except only a small hole at one end and all these held for us about   gallons and a half of water we bought also   or   bamboes that held about   or   gallons more this was our seastore  we now designd to go to achin a town on the n w end of the island sumatra distant from hence about  0 leagues bearing south south east we only waited for the western monsoon which we had expected a great while and now it seemed to be at hand for the clouds began to hang their heads to the fastward and at last moved gently that way and though the wind was still at east yet this was an infalliable sign that the western monsoon was nigh  chap xviii the author with some others put to sea in an open boat designing for achin their accommodations for their

was the   th day of may      about   a clock in the afternoon when we left nicobar island directing our course toward achin being   men of us in company viz   english   malayans who were born at achin and the mungrel portuguese  our vessel the nicobar canoa was not one of the biggest nor of the least size she was much about the burden of one of our london wherries below bridge and built sharp at both ends like the fore part of a wherry she was deeper than a wherry but not so broad and was so thin and light that when empty   men could launch he or hale her ashore on a sandy bay we had a good substantial mast and a mat sail and good outlagers lasht very fast and firm on each side the vessel being made of strong poles so that while these continued firm the vessel could not overset which she would easily have done without them and with them too had they not been made very strong and we were therefore much beholding to our achinese companions for this contrivance  these men were none of them so sensible of the danger as mr hall and my self for they all confided so much in us that they did not so much as scruple any thing that we did approve of neither was mr hall so well provided as i was for before we left the ship i had purposely consulted our draft of the east indies for we had but one in the ship and out of that i had written in my pocketbook an account of the bearing and distance of all the malacca coast and that of sumatra pegu and siam and also brought away with me a pocketcompass for my direction in any enterprise that i should undertake  the weather at our setting out was very fair clear and hot the wind was still at s f a very small breeze just fanning the air and the clouds were moving gently from west to east which gave us hopes that the winds were either at west already abroad at sea or would be so in a very short time we took this opportunity of fair weather being in hopes to accomplish our voyage to achin before the western monsoon was set in strong knowing that we should have very blustering weather after this fair weather especially at the first coming of the western monsoon  we rowed therefore away to the southward supposing that when we were clear from the island we should have a true wind as we call it for the land hales the wind and we often find the wind at sea different from what it is near the shore we rowed with   oars taking our turns mr hall and i steered also by turns for none of the rest were capable of it we rowed the first afternoon and the night ensuing about twelve leagues by my judgment our course was south south east but the   th day in the morning when the sun was an hour high we saw the island from whence we came bearing n w by n therefore i found we had gone a point more to the east than i intended for which reason we steered s by f  in the afternoon at   a clock we had a gentle breeze at w s w which continued so till   all which time we laid down our oars and steered away s s e i was then at the helm and i found by the ripling of the sea that there was a strong current against us it made a great noise that might be heard near half a mile at   a clock it fell calm and so continued till  0 then the wind sprung up again and blew a fresh breeze all night  the   th day in the morning we looked out for the island sumatra supposing that we were now within  0 leagues of it for we had rowed and sailed by our reckoning    leagues from nicobar island and the distance from nicobar to achin is about  0 leagues but we looked in vain for the island sumatra for turning our selves about we saw to our grief nicobar island lying w n w and not above   leagues distant by this it was visible that we had met a very strong current against us in the night but the wind freshned on us and we made the best use of it while the weather continued fair at noon we had an observation of the sun my lat was   d    m and mr halls was   d n  the   th day the wind freshned on us again and the sky began to be clouded it was indifferent clear till noon and we thought to have had an observation but we were hindered by the clouds that covered the face of the sun when it came on the meridian this often happens that we are disappointed of making observations by the suns being clouded at noon though it shines clear both before and after especially in places near the sun and this obscuring of the sun at noon is commonly sudden and unexpected and for about half an hour or more  we had then also a very ill passage by a great circle about the sun   or   times the diameter of it which seldom appears but storms of wind or much rain ensue such circles about the moon are more frequent but of less import we do commonly take great notice of these that are about the sun observing if there be any breach in the circle and in what quarter the breach is for from thence we commoly find the greatest stress of the wind will come i must confess that i was a little anxious at the sight of this circle and wished heartily that we were near some land yet i showed no sign of it to discourage my consorts but made a virtue of necessity and put a good countenance on the matter  i told mr hall that if the wind became too strong and violent as i feared it would it being even then very strong we must of necessity steer away before the wind and sea till better weather presented and that as the winds were now we should instead of about  0 leagues to achin be driven  0 and  0 leagues to the coast of cudda or queda a kingdom and town and harbor of trade on the coast of malacca  the winds therefore bearing very hard we rolled up the foot of our sail on a pole fastened to it and settled our yard within three foot of the canoa sides so that we had now but a small sail yet it was still too big considering the wind for the wind being on our broad side pressed her down very much though supported by her outlagers insomuch that the poles of the outlagers going from the sides of their vessel bent as if they would break and should they have broken our overturning and perishing had been inevitable besides the sea increasing would soon have silled the vessel this way yet thus we made a shift to bear up with the side of the vessel against the wind for a while but the wind still increasing about one a clock in the afternoon we put away right before wind and sea continuing to run thus all the afternoon and part of the night ensuing the wind continued increasing all the afternoon and the sea still swelled higher and often broke but did us no damage for the ends of the vessel being very narrow he that steered received and broke the sea on his back and so kept it from coming in so much as to endanger the vessel though much water would come in which we were forced to keep heaving out continually and by this time we saw it was well that we had altered our course every wave would else have filled and sunk us taking the side of the vessel and though our outlagers were well lashed down to the canoas bottom with rattans yet they must probably have yielded to such a sea as this when even before they were plunged under water and bent like twigs  the evening of this   th day was very dismal the sky looked very black being covered with dark clouds the wind blew hard and the seas ran high the sea was already roaring in a white foam about us a dark night coming on and no land in sight to shelter us and our little ark in danger to be swallowed by every wave and what was worst of all none of us thought our selves prepared for another world the reader may better guess than i can express the confusion that we were all in i had been in many eminent dangers before now some of which i have already related but the worst of them all was but a playgame in comparison with this i must confess that i was in great conflicts of mind at this time other dangers came not upon me with such a leisurely and dreadful solemnity a sudden skirmish or engagement or so was nothing when ones blood was up and pushed forwards with eager expectations but here i had a lingering view of approaching death and little or no hopes of escaping it and i must confess that my courage which i had hitherto kept up failed me here and i made very sad reflections on my former life and looked back with horror and detestation on actions which before i disliked but now i trembled at the remembrance of i had long before this repented me of that roving course of life but never with such concern as now i did also call to mind the many miraculous acts of gods providence toward me in the whole course of my life of which kind i believe few men have met with the like for all these i returned thanks in a peculiar manner and this once more desired gods assistance and composed my mind as well as i could in the hopes of it and as the event showed i was not disappointed of my hopes  submitting our selves therefore to gods good providence and taking all the care we could to preserve our lives mr hall and i took turns to steer and the rest took turns to heave out the water and thus we provided to spend the most doleful night i ever was in about  0 a clock it began to thunder lighten and rain but the rain was very welcome to us having drank up all the water we brought from the island  the wind at first blew harder than before but within half an hour it abated and became more moderate and the sea also assuaged of its fury and then by a lighted match of which we kept a piece burning on purpose we looked on our compass to see how we steered and found our course to be still east we had no occasion to look on the compass before for we steered right before the wind which if it shifted we had been obliged to have altered our course accordingly but now it being abated we found our vessel lively enough with that small sail which was then aboard to hale to our former course s s e which accordingly we did being now in hopes again to get to the island sumatra  but about   a clock in the morning of the   th day we had another gust of wind with much thunder lightning and rain which lasted till day and obliged us to put before the wind again steering thus for several hours it was very dark and the hard rain soaked us so thoroughly that we had not one dry thread about us the rain chilled us extremely for any fresh water is much colder than that of the sea for even in the coldest climates the sea is warm and in the hottest climates the rain is cold and unwholsesome for mans body in this wet starveling plight we spent the tedious night never did poor mariners on a leeshore more earnestly long for the dawning light than we did now at length the day appeared but with such dark black clouds near the horizon that the sirst glimpse of the dawn appeared  0 or  0 degrees high which was dreadful enough for it is a common saying among seamen and true as i have experienced that a high dawn will have high winds and a low dawn small winds  we continued our course still east before wind and sea till about   a clock in the morning of this   th day and then one of our malayan friends cried out pulo way mr hall and ambrose and i thought the fellow had said pull away an expression usual among english seamen when they are rowing and we wondered what he meant by it till we saw him point to his consorts and then we looking that way saw land appearing like an island and all our malayans said it was an island at the n w end of sumatra called way for pulo way is the island way we who were dropping with wet cold and hungry were all over joyed at the sight of the land and presently marked its bearing it bore south and the wind was still at west a strong gale but the sea did not run so high as in the night therefore we trimmed our small sail no bigger than a apron and steered with it now our outlagers did us a great kindness again for although we had but a small sail yet the wind was strong and pressed down our vessels side very much but being supported by the outlagers we could brook it well enough which otherwise we could not have done  about noon we saw more land beneath the supposed pulo way and steering toward it before night we saw all the coast of sumatra and found the errors of our achinesc for the high land that we first saw which then appeared like an island was not pulo way but a great high mountain on the island sumatra called by the english the golden mountain our wind continued till about   a clock at night then it abated and at  0 a clock it died away and then we stuck to our oars again tho all of us quite tired with our former fatigues and hardships  the next morning being the  0th day we saw all the low land plain and judged our selves not above   leagues off about   clock in the morning we had the wind again at west a fresh gale and steering in still for the shore a   a clock in the afternoon we run to the mouth of a river on the island sumatra called passange jonca it is    leagues to the eastward of achin and   leagues to the west of diamond point which makes with three angles of a rhombus and is low land  our malayans were very well acquainted here and carried us to a small fishing village within a mile of the rivers mouth called also by the name of the river passange jonca the hardships of this voyage with the scorching heat of the sun at our first setting out and the cold rain and our continuing wet for the last two days cast us all into fevers so that now we are not able to help each other nor so much as to get our canoa up to the village but our malayans got some of the townsmen to bring her up  the news of our arrival being noised abroad one of the oramkais or noblemen of the island came in the night to see us we were then lying in a small hut at the end of the town and it being late this lord only viewed us and having spoken with our malayans went away again but he returned to us again the next day and provided a large house for us to live in till we should be recovered of our sickness ordering the townspeople to let us want for nothing the achinese malayans that came with us told them all the circumstances of our voyage how they were taken by our ship and where and how we that came with them were prisoners aboard the ship and had been set ashore together at nccobar as they were it was for this reason probably that the gentlemen of sumatra were thus extraordinary kind to us to provide every thing that we had need of nay they would force us to accept of presents from them that we knew not what to do with as young buffaloes goats etc for these we would turn loose at night after the gentlemen that gave them to us were gone for we were prompted by our achinese consorts to accept of them for fear of disobliging by our refusal but the coconuts plaintains fowls eggs fish and rice we kept for our use the malayans that accompanied us from nicobar separated themselves from us now living at one end of the house by themselves for they were mahometans as all those of the kingdom of achin are and though during our passage by sea together we made them be contented to drink their water out of the same cocoshell with us yet being now no longer under that necessity they again took up their accustomed nicety and reservedness they all lay sick and as their sickness increased one of them threatened us that if any of them died the rest would kill us for having brought them this voyage yet i question whether they would have attempted or the country people have suffered it we made a shift to dress our own food for none of these people though they were very kind in giving us any thing that we wanted would yet come near us to assist us in dressing our victuals nay they would not touch any thing that we used we had all fevers and therefore took turns to dress victuals according as we had strength to do it or stomachs to eat it i found my fever to increase and my head so distempered that i could scarce stand therefore i whetted and sharpened my penkife in order to let my self blood but i could not for my knife was too blunt  we stayed here ten or twelve days in hopes to recover our health but finding no amendment we desired to go to achin but we were delayed by the natives who had a desire to have kept mr hall and my self to sail in their vessels to malacca cudda or to other places whither they trade but finding us more desirous to to be with our countrymen in our factory at achin they provided a large proe to carry us thither we not being able to manage our own canoa besides before this three of our malayan comrades were gone very sick into the country and only one of them and the portuguese remained with us accompanying us to achin and they both as sick as we  it was the beginning of june      when we left passange jonca we had   men to row one to steer and a gentleman of the country that went puprosely to give an information to the government of our arrival we were but three days and nights in our passage having seabreezes by day and landwinds by night and very fair weather  when we arrived at achin i was carried before the shabander the chief magistrate in the city one mr dennis driscall and irishman and a resident there in the factory which our east india company had there then was interpreter i being weak was suffered to stand in the shabanders presence for it is their custom to make men sit on the floor as they do cross legged like tailors but i had not strength then to pluck up my heels in that manner the shabander asked of me several questions especially how we durst adventure to come in a canoa from the nicobar islands to sumatra i told him that i had been accustomed to hardships and hazards therefore i did with much freedom undertake it he enquired also concerning our ship whence she came etc i told him from the south seas that she had ranged about the philippine islands etc and was now gone toward arabia and the red sea the malayans also and portuguese were afterward examined and confimed what i declared and in less than half an hour i was dismissed with mr priscal who then lived in the english east india companys factory he provided a room for us to lie in and some victuals  three days after our arrival here our portuguese died of a fever what became of our malayans i know not ambrose lived not long after mr hall also was so weak that i did not think he would recover i was the best yet still very sick of a fever and little likely to live therefore mr driscal and some other englishmen persuaded me to take some purging physic of a malayan doctor i took their advice being willing to get ease but after three doses each a large calabash of nasty stuff finding no amendment i thought to desist from more physic but was persuaded to take one dose more which i did and it wrought so violently that i thought it would have ended my days i struggled till i had been about  0 or  0 times at stool but it working so quick with me with little intermission and my strength being almost spent i even threw my self down once for all and had above  0 stools in all before it left off working i thought my malayan doctor whom they so much commended would have killed me outright i continued extraordinary weak for some days after his drenching me thus but my fever left me for above a week after which it returned upon me again for a twelve month and a flux with it  however when i was a little recovered from the effects of my drench i made a shift to go abroad and having been kindly invited to capt bowreys house there my first visit was to him who had a ship in the road but lived ashore this gentleman was extraordinary kind to us all particularly to me and importuned me to go his boatsawain to persia whither he was bound with a design to sell his ship there as i was told though not by himself from thence he intended to pass with the caravan to aleppo and so home for england his business required him to stay some time longer at achin i judge to sell some commodities that he had not yet disposed of yet he chose rather to leave the disposal of them to some merchant there and make a short trip to the nicobar islands in the mean time and on his return to take in his effects and so proceed toward persia this was a sudden resolution of captain bowrys presently after the arrival of a small frigot from siam with an ambassador from the king of siam to the queen of achin the ambassador was a frenchman by nation the vessel that he came in was but small yet very well manned and fitted for a fight therefore it was generally supposed here that captain bowry was afraid to lie in achin road because the siamers were now at wars with the english and he was not able to defend his ship if should be attacked by them  but whatever made him think of going to the nicobar islands he provided to sail and took me mr hall and ambrose with him though all of us so sick and weak that we could do him no service it was some time about the beginning of june when we sailed out of achin road but we met with the winds at n w with turbulent weather which forced us back again in two days time yet he gave us each    mess apiece a gold coin each of which is about the value of    d english so he gave over that design and some english ships coming into achin road he was not afraid of the siamers who lay there  after this he again invited me to his house at achin and treated me always with wine and good cheer and still importuned me to go with him to persia but i being very weak and fearing the westerly winds would create a great deal of trouble did not give him a positive answer especially because i thought i might get a better voyage in the english ships newly arrived or some others now expected here it was this captain bowry who sent the letter from borneo directed to the chief of the english factory at mindanto of which mention is made in chapter xiii  a short time after this captain welden arrived here from fort st george in a ship called the curtana bound to tonqueen this being a more agreeable voyage than to persia at this time of the year besides that the ship was better accommodated especially with a surgeon and i being still sick i therefore chose rather to serve captain welden than captain bowry but to go on with a particular account of that expedition were to carry my reader back again whom having brought thus far toward england in my circumnavigation of the globe i shall not weary him with new rambles nor so much swell this volume as i must to describe the tour i made in those remote parts of the east indies from and to sumatra so that my voyage to tonqueen at this time as also another to malacca afterward with my observations in them and the descriptions of those and the neighboring countries as well as the description of the island sumatra it self and therein the kingdom and city of achin bencouli etc i shall refer to another place where i may give a particular relation of them in short it may suffice that i set out to tonqueen with captain welden about july      and returned to achin in the april following i staid here till the latter end of september      and making a short voyage to malacca came thither again about christmas soon after that i went to fort st george and staying thereabout five months i returned once more to sumatra not to achin but bencouli an english factory on the west coast of which i was gunner about five months more  sumatra without carrying him back i shall bring him on next way from thence to england and of all that occurred between my first setting out from this island in      and my final depature from it at the beginning of the year      i shall only take notice at present of two passages which i think i ought not to omit  the first is that at my return from malacca a little before christmas      i found at achin one mr morgan who was one of our ships crew that left me ashore at nicobar now mate of a danish ship of trangambar which is a town on the coast of coromandel near cape comorin belonging to the danes and receiving an account of our crew from him and others i thought it might not be amiss to gratify the readers curiosity therewith who would probably be desirous to know the success of those ramblers in their new intended expedition toward the red sea and withal i thought it might not be unlikely that these papers might fall into hands of some of our london merchants who were concerned in fitting out that ship which i said formerly was called the cygnet of london sent on a trading voyage into the south seas under the command of captain swan and that they might be willing to have a particular information of the fate of their ship and by the way even before this meeting with mr morgan while i was at tenqueen jan      i met with an english ship in the river of tenqueen called the rainbow of london captain poole commander by whose mate mr barlow who was returning in that ship to england i sent a packet which he undertook to deliver to the merchants owners of the cygnet some of which he said he knew wherein i gave a particular account of all the course and transactions of their ship from the time of my first meeting it in the south seas and going aboard it there to its leaving me ashore at nicobar but i never could hear that either that or other letters which i sent at the same time were received  to proceed therefore with morgans relation he told me that when they in the cygnet went away from nicobar in pursuit of their intendedvoyage to persia they directed their course to wards ceylon but not being able to weather it the westerly monsoon being hard against them they were oblidged to seek refreshment on the coast of coromandel here this mad fickle crew were upon new projects again their designs meeting with such delays and obstructions that many of them grew weary of it and about half of them went ashore of this number mr morgan who told me this and mr herman copinger the surgeon went to the danes at trangambar who kindly received them there they lived very well and mr morgan was employed as a mate in a ship of theirs at this time to achin and captain knox tells me that he since commanded the curtana the ship that i went in to tonqueen which captain welden having sold to the moguls subjects they employed mr morgan as captain to trade in her for them and it is an usual thing for the trading indians to hire europeans to go officers on board their ships especially captains and gunners  about two or three more of these that were set ashore went to fort st george but the main body of them were for going into the moguls service our seamen are apt to have great notions of i know not what profit and advantages to be had in serving the mogul nor do they want for fine stories to encourage one another to it it was what these men had long been thinking and talking of as a fine thing but now they went upon it in good earnest the place where they went ashore was at a town of the moors which name our seamen give to all the subjects of the great mogul but especially his mohammedan subjects calling the idolaters gentous or rashbouts at this moors town they got a peun to be their guide to the moguls nearest camp for he has always several armies in his vast empire  these peuns are some of the gentous or rashbouts who in all places along the coast especially in seaport towns make it their business to hire themselves to wait upon strangers be they merchants seamen or what they will to qualify them for such attendance they learn the european languages english dutch french portuguese etc according as they have any of the factories of these nations in their neighborhood or are visited by their ships no sooner does any such ship come to an anchor and the men come ashore but a great many of these peuns are ready to proffer their service it is usual for the strangers to hire their attendance during their stay there giving them about a crown a month of our money more or less the richest sort of men will ordinarily hire   or   peuns to wait upon them and even the common seamen if able will hire one a piece to attend them either for convenience or ostentation or sometimes one peun between two of them these peuns serve them in many capacities as interpreters brokers servants to attend at meals and go to market and on errands etc nor do they give any trouble eating at their own homes and lodging there when they have done their masters business for them expecting nothing but their wages except that they have a certain allowance of about a fanam or   d in a dollar which is an   th part profit by way of brokerage for every bargain they drive they being generally employed in buying and selling when the strangers go away their peuns desire them to give them their names in writing with a certificate of their honest and diligent serving em and these they show to the next comers to get into business some being able to produce a large scrowl of such certificates  but to proceed the moors town where the  men landed was not far from cunnimere a small english factory on the coromondel coast the governor whereof having intelligence by the moors of the landing of these men and their intended march to the moguls camp sent out a captain with his company to oppose it he came up with them and gave them hard words but they being  0 or  0 resolute fellows not easily daunted he durst not attack them but returned to the governor and the news of it was soon carried to fort st george during their march john oliver who was one of them privately told the peun who guided them that himself was their captain so when they came to the camp the peun told this to the general and when their stations and pay were assigned them john oliver had a greater respect paid him than the rest and whereas their pay was ten pagodas a month each man a pagoda is two dollar or   s english his pay was twenty pagodas which stratagem and usurpation of his occasioned him no small envy and indignation from his comrades  soon after this   or   of them went to agra to be of the moguls guard a while after the governor of fort st george sent a message to the main body of them and a pardon to withdraw them from thence which most of them accepted and came away john oliver and the small remainder continued in the country but leaving the camp went up and down plundering the villages and fleeing when they were pursued and this was the last news i heard of them this account i had partly by mr morgan from some of those deserters he met with at trangambar partly from others of them whom i met with my self afterward at fort st george and these were the adventures of those who went up into the country  captain read having thus lost the best half of his men sailed away with the rest of them after having filled his water and got rice still intending for the red sea when they were near ceylon they met with a portuguese ship richly laden out of which they took what they pleased and then turned her away again from thence they pursued their voyage but the westerly winds bearing hard against them and making it hardly feizable for them to reach the red sea they stood away for madagascar there they entered into the service of one of the petty princes of that island to assist him against his neighbors with whom he was at wars during this interval a small vessel from new york came hither to purchase slaves which trade is driven here as it is upon the coast of guinea one nation or clan selling others that are their enemies captain read with about   or   more stole away from their crew and went aboard this new york ship and captain teat was made commander of the residue soon after which a brigantine from the west indies captain knight commander coming thither with design to go to the red sea also these of the cygnet consorted with them and they went together to the island johanna thence going together toward the red sea the cygnet proving leaky and sailing heavily as being much out of repair captain knight grew weary of her company and giving her the slip in the night went away for achin for having heard that there was plenty of glod there he went thither with a design to cruize and twas from one mr humes belonging to the ann of london capt freke commander who had gone aboard captain knight and whom i saw afterward at achin that i had this relation some of captain frekes men their own ship being lost and gone aboard the cygnet at johanna and after capt knight had left red sea but the winds being against them and the ship in so ill a condition they were forced to bear away for coromandel where capt teat and his own men went ashore to serve the mogul but the strangers of capt frekes ship who kept still aboard the cygnet undertook to carry her for england and the last news i heard of the cygnet was from captain knox who tells me that she now lies sunk in st augustins bay in madagascar this digression i have made to give an account of our ship  the other passage i shall speak of that occurred during this interval of the tour l made from achin is with relation to the painted prince whom i brought with me into england and who died at oxford for while i was at fort st george about april    0 there arrived a ship called the mindanao merchant laden with clovebark from mindanao three of capt swans men that remained there when we went from thence came in her from whom i had the account of captain swans death as is before related there was also one mr moody who was supercargo of the ship this gentleman bought at mindanao the painted prince jeoly mentioned in chapter xiii and his mother and brought them to fort st george where they were much admired by all that saw them some time after this mr moody who spoke the malayan language very well and was a person very capable to manage the companys affairs was ordered by the governor of fort st george to prepare to go to indrapore an english factory on the west coast of sumatra in order to succeed mr gibbons who was chief of that place  by this time i was very intimately acquainted with mr moody and was importuned by him to go with him and to be gunner of the fort there i always told him i had a great desire to go to the bay of bengal and that i had now an offer to go thither with capt metcalf who wanted a mate and had already spoke to me mr moody to encourage me to go with him told me that if i would go with him to indrapore he would buy a small vessel there and send me to the island meangis commander of her and that i should carry prince jeoly and his mother with me that being their country by which means i might gain a commerce with his people for cloves  this was a design that i liked very well and therefore i consented to go thither it was some time in july    0 when we went from fort st george in a small ship called the diamond capt howel commander we were about  0 or  0 passengers in all some ordered to be left at indrapore and some at bencouli five or six of us were officers the rest soldiers to the company we met nothing in our voyage that deserves notice till we came abrest of indrapore and then the wind came at n w and blew so hard that we could not get in but were forced to bear away to bencouli another english factory on the same coast lying  0 or  0 leagues to the southward of indrapore  upon our arrival at bencouli we saluted the fort and were welcomed by them the same day we came to an anchor and captain howel and mr moody with the other merchants went ashore and were all kindly received by the covernour of the fort it was two days before i went ashore and then i was importuned by the governor to stay there to be gunner of this fort because the gunner was lately dead and this being a place of greater import than indrapore i should do the company more service here than there i told the governor if he would augment my sallary which by agreement with the governor of fort st george i was to have had at indrapore i was willing to serve him provided mr moody would consent to it as to my sallary he told me i should have    dollars per month which was as much as he gave to the old gunner  mr moody gave no answer till a week after and then being ready to be gone to indrapore he told me i might use my own liberty either to stay here or go with him to indrapore he added that if i went with him he was not certain as yet to perform his promise in getting a vessel for me to go to meangas with jeoly and his mother but he would be so fair to me that because i left maderas on his account he would give me the half share of the two painted people and leave them in my possession and at my disposal i accepted of the offer and writings were immediately drawn between us  thus it was that i came to have this painted prince whose name was jeoly and his mother they were born on a small island called meangis which is once or twice mentioned in chap xiii i saw the island twice and two more close by it each of the three seemed to be about four or five leagues round and of a good height jeoly himself told me that they all three abounded with gold cloves and nutmegs for i showed him some of each sort several times and he told me in the malayan language which he spoke indifferent well meangis hadda madochala se bullawan that is there is abundance of gold at meangis bullawan i have observed to be the common word for gold at mindanao but whether the proper malayan word i know not for i found much difference between the malayan language as it was spoken at mindanao and the language on the coast of malacca and achin when i showed him spice he would not only tell me that there was madochala that is abundance but to make it appear more plain he would also show me the hair of his head a thing frequent among all the indians that i have met with to show their hair when they would express more than they can number he told me also that his father was raja of the island where they lived that there were not above thirty men on the island and about one hundred women that he himself had   wives and eight children and that one of his wives painted him  he was painted all down the brreast between his shoulders behind on his thighs mostly before and in the form of several broad rings or bracelets round his arms and legs i cannot liken the drawings to any figure of animals or the like but they were very curious full of great variety of lines flourishes chequered work etc keeping a very graceful proportion and appearing very artificial even to wonder especially that upon and between his shoulderblades by the account he gave me of the manner of doing it i understood that the painting was done in the same manner as the jerusalemcross is made in mens arms by pricking the skin and rubbing in a pigment but whereas powder is used in making the jerusalemcross they at meangis use the gum of a tree beaten to powder called by english dammer which is used instead of pitch in many parts of india he told me that most of the men and women on the island were thus painted and also that they had all ear rings made of gold and gold shaekles about their legs and arms that their common food of the produce of the land was potatoes and yames that they had plenty of cocks and hens but no other tame fowl he said that fish of which he was a great lover as wild indians generally are was very plentiful about the island and that they had canoas and went a fishing frequently in them and that they often visited the other two small islands whose inhabitants speak the same language as they did which was so unlike the malayan which he had learnt while he was a slave at mindanao that when his mother and he were talking together in their meangian tongue i could not understand one word they said and indeed all the indians who speak malayan who are the trading and politer sort looked on these meangians as a kind of barbarians and upon any occasion of dislike would call them bobby that is hoggs the greatest expression of contempt that can be especially from the mouth of malayans who are generally mahometans and yet the malayans every where call a woman babby by a name not much different and mamma signifies a man though these two last words properly denote male and female and as ejam signifies a fowl so ejam mamma is a cock and ejam babbi is a hen but this by the way  he said also that the customs of those other isles and their manner of living was like theirs and that they were the only people with whom they had any converse and that one time as he with his father mother and brother with two or three men more were going to one of these other islands they were driven by a strong wind on the coast of mindanao where they were taken by the fishermen of that island and carried ashore and sold as slaves they being first stripped of their gold ornaments i did not see any of the gold that they wore but there were great holes in their ears by which it was manifest that they had worn some ornaments in them jeoly was sold to one michael a mindanayan that spoke good spanish and commonly waited on raja laut serving him as our interpreter where the raja was at a loss in any word for michael understood it better he did often beat and abuse his painted servant to make him work but all in vain for neither fair means threats nor blows would make him work as he would have him yet he was very timorous and could not endure to see any sort of weapons and he often told me that they had no arms at meangis they having no enemies to fight with  i knew this michael very well while we were at mindanao i suppose that name was given him by the spaniards who baptized many of them at the time when they had footing at that island but at the deparrure of the spaniards they were mahometans again as before some of our people lay at this michaels house whose wife and daughter were pagallies to some of them i often saw jeoly at his master michaels house and when i came to have him so long after he remembered me again i did never see his father nor brother n any of the others that were taken with them  jeoly came several times aboard our ship when we lay at mindanao and gladly accepted of such victuals as we gave him for his master kept him at very short commons  prince jeoly lived thus a slave at mindanao   or   years till at last mr moody bought him and his mother for  0 dollars and as is before related carried him to fort st george and from thence along with me to bencouli mr moody stayed at bencouli about three weeks and then went back with captain howel to indrapore leaving jeoly and his mother with me they lived in a house by themselves without the fort i had no employment for them but they both employed themselves she used to make and mend their own clothes at which she was not very expert for they wear no clothes at meangis but only a claoth about their wastes and he busied himself in making a chest with   boards and a few nails that he begged of me it was but an ill shaped odd thing yet he was as proud of it as if it had been the rarest piece in the world after some time they were both taken sick and though i took as much care of them as if they had been my brother and sister yet she died i did what i could to comfort jeoly but he took on extremely insomuch that i feared him also therefore i caused a grave to be made presently to hide her out of his sight i had her shrouded decently in a piece of new callico but jeoly was not so satisfied for he wrapped all her clothes about her and two new pieces of chints that mr moody gave her saying that they were his mothers and she must have em i would not disoblige him for fear of endangering his life and i used all possible means to recover his health but i found little amendment while we stayed here  in the little printed relation that was made of him when he was shown for a sight in england there was a romantic story of a beautiful sister of his a slave with them at mindanao and of the sultans falling in love with her but these were stories indeed they reported also that his paint was of such virtue that serpents and venomous creatures would flee from him for which reason i suppose they represented so many serpents scampering about in the printed picture that was made of him but i never knew any paint of such virtue and as for jeoly i have seen him as much afraid of snakes scorpions or centapees as my self  having given this account of the ship that left me at nicobar and of my painted prince whom i brought with me to bencouli i shall now proceed on with the relation of my voyage thence to england after i have given this short account of the occasion of it and the manner of my getting away  to say nothing therefore now of that place and my employment there as gunner of the fort the year    0 drew toward an end and not finding the governor keep to his agreement with me nor seeing by his carriage toward others any great reason i had to expect he would i began to wish my self away again i saw so much ignorance in him with respect to his charge being much fitter to be a bookkeeper than governor of a fort and yet so much insolence and cruelty with respect to those under him and rashness in his management of the malayan neighborhood that i soon grew weary of him not thinking my self very safe indeed under a man whose humors were so brutish and barbarous i forbear to mention his name after such a character nor do i care to fill these papers with particular stories of him but therefore give this intimation because as it is the interest of the nation in general so is it especially of the honorable east india company to be informed of abuses in their factories and i think the company might receive great advantage by strictly enquiring into the behavior of those wh they entrust with any command for  which reflects back upon the superiors from the misdoings of their servants how undeservedly soever thee are great and lastig mischiefs proceed from the tyranny or ignorant rashness of some petty governors those under them are discouraged from their service by it and often go away to the dutch the mogul or malayan princes to the great detriment of our trade and even the trade and the ports themselves are many times in danger by indiscreet provocations given to the neighboring nations who are best managed as all mankind are by justice malayans who live in the neighborhood of bencli which fort hah been more than once in danger of being surpised by them i speak not this out of disgust to this particular governor much less would i seem to reflect on any others of whom i know nothing amiss but as it is not to be wondered at  should not know how to demean themselves in places of power for which neither their education nor their business possibly have sufficiently qualified them so it will be the more necessary for the honorable company to have the closer eye over them and as much as may be to prevent or reform any abuses they may be guilty of and it is purely out of my zeal for theirs and the nations interest that i have given this caution having seen too much occasion for it  i had other motives also for my going away i began to long after my native country after so tedious a ramble from it and i proposed no small advantage to my self from my painted prince whom mr moody had left entirely to my disposal only reserving to himself his right to one half share in him for beside what might be gained by showing him in england i was in hopes that when i had got some money i might there obtain what i had in vain sought for in the indies viz a ship from the merchants wherewith to carry him back to meangis and reinstate him there in his own country and by his favor and negotiation to establish a traffic for the spices and other products of those islands  upon these projects i went to the governor and council and desired that i might have my discharge to go for england with the next ship that came the council hought it reasonable and they consented to it he also give me his word that i should go upon the  d of january      there came to anchor in bencouli road the defense captain heath commander bound for england in te service of the company they had been at indrapore where mr moody then was and he had made over his share in prince jeoly to mr goddard chief mate of the ship upon his coming on shore he showed me mr moodys writings and looked upon jeoly who had been sick for   months in all which time i tended him as carefully as if he had been my brother i agreed matters with mr goddard and sent jeoly on board intending to follow him as i could and desiring mr goddards assistance to fetch me off and conceal me aboard the ship if there should be occasion which he promised to do and the captain promised to entertain me for it proved as i had foreseen that upon captain heaths arrival the governor repented him of of his promise and would not suffer me to depart i importuned him all i could but in vain so did captain heath also but to no purpose in short after several essays i slipped away at midnight understanding the ship was to sail away the next morning and that they had taken leave of the fort and creeping through one of the portholes of the fort i got to the shore where the ships boat waited for me and carried me on board i brought with me my journal and most of my written papers but some papers and books of value i left in haste and all my furniture being glad i was my self at liberty and had hopes of seeing england again  chap xx the authors departure from bencouli on board the defense under captain heath of a fight between some french men of war from ponticheri and some dutch ships from pallacat joined with some english in sight of fort st george of the bad water taken in at bencouli and the strange sickness and death of the seamen supposed to be occasioned thereby a spring at bencouli recommended the great exigences on board a consult held and a proposal made to go to johanna a resolution taken to prosecute their voyage to the cape of good hope the wind favors them the captains couduct they arrive at the cape and are helped into harbor by the dutch a description of the cape its prospect soundings table mount harbor soil etc large pomgranates and good wines the land animals a very beautiful kind of onager or wild ass striped regularly blak and white ostrages fish seals the dutch fort and factory their fine garden tbe traffic here  being thus got on board the defense i was concealed there till a boat which came from the fort laden with pepper was gone off again and then we set sail for the cape of good hope jan         and made the best of our way as wind and weather would permit expecting there to meet   english ships more bound home from the indies for the war with the french having been proclaimed at fort st george a little before captain heath came from thence he was willing to have company home if he could  a little before this war was proclaimed there was an engagement in the road of fort st george between some french men of war and some dutch and english ships at anchor in the road which because there is such a plausible story made of it in monsieur duquesnes late voyage to the east indies i shall give a short account of as i had it particularly related to me by the gunners mate of capt heaths ship a very sensible man and several others of his men who were in the action the dutch have a fort on the coast of coromandel called pallacat about  0 leagues to the northward of fort st george upon some occasion or other the dutch sent some ships thither to fetch away their effects and transport them to batavia acts of hostility were already begun between the french and dutch and the french had at this time a squadron newly arrived in india and lying at ponticheri a french fort on the same coast southward of fort st george the dutch in returning to batavia were obliged to coast it along by fort st george and ponticheri for the sake of the wind but when they came near this last they saw the french men of war lying at anchor there and should they have proceeded along the shore or stood out to sea expected to be pursued by them they therefore turned back again for though their ships were of a pretty good force yet were they unsit for fight as having great loads of goods and many passengers women and children on board so they put in at fort st george and desiring the governors protection had leave to anchor in the road and to send their goods and useless people ashore there were then in the road a few small english ships and capt heath whose ship was a very stout merchant man and which the french relater calls the english admiral was just come from china but very deep laden with goods and the deck full of canisters of sugar which he was preparing to send ashore but before he could do it the french appeared coming into the road with their lower sails and top sails and had with them a fireship with this they thought to have burnt the dutchcommodore and might probably enough have done it as she lay at anchor if they had had the courage to have come boldly on but they fired their ship at a distance and the dutch sent and towed her away where she spent her self without any execution had the french men of war also come boldly up and grappled with their enemies they might have done something considerable for the fort could not have played on them without damaging our ships as well as theirs but instead of this the french dropped anchor out of reach of the shot of the fort and there lay exchanging shot with their enemies ships with so little advantage to themselves that after about four hours fighting they cut their cables and went away in haste and disorder with all their sails loose even their top gallant sails which is not usual but when ships are just next to running away  captain heath notwithstanding his ship was so heavy and encumbered behaved himself very bravely in the sight and upon the going off of the french went aboard the dutch commodore and told him that if he would pursue them he would stand out with them to sea though he had very little water aboard but the dutch commander excused himself saying he had orders to defend himself from the french but none to chase them or go out of his way to seek them and this was the exploit which the french have thought fit to brag of i hear that the dutch have taken from them since their fort of ponticheri  but to proceed with our voyage we had not been at sea long before our men began to droop in a sort of a distemper that stole insensibly on them and proved fatal to above thirty who died before we arrived at the cape we had sometimes two and once three men thrown over board in a morning this distemper might probably arise from the badness of the water which we took in at bencouli for i did observe while i was there that the river water wherewith our ships were watered was very unwholesome it being mixed with the water of many small creeks that proceeded from low land and whose streams were always very black they being nourished by the water that drained out of the low swampy unwholesome ground  i have observed not only there but in other hot countries also both in the east and west indies that the landfloods which pour into the channels of the rivers about the season of the rains are very unwholesome for when i lived in the bay of campeachy the fish were found dead in heaps on the shores of the rivers and creeks at such a season and many we took up half dead of which sudden mortality there appeared no cause but only the malignity of the waters draining off the land this happens chiefly as i take it where the water drains through thick woods and savannahs of long grass and swampy grounds with which some hot countries abound and i believe it receives a strong tincture from the roots of several kind of trees herbs etc and especially where there is any stagnancy of the water it soon corrupts and possibly the serpents and other poisonous vermin and insects may not a little contribute to its bad qualities at such times it will look very deep colored yellow red or black etc the season of the rains was over and the landfloods were abating upon the taking up this water in the river of bencouli but would the seamen have given themselves the trouble they might have filled their vessels with excellent good water at a spring on the backside of the fort not above   or  00 paces from the landing place and with which the fort is served and i mention this as a caution to any ships that shall go to bencouli for the future and withal i think it worth the care of the owners or governors of the factory and that it would tend much to the preservation of their seamens lives to lay pipes to convey the fountain water to the shore which might easily be done with a small charge and had i staid longer there i would have undertaken it i had a design also of bringing it into the fort tho much higher for it would be a great convenience and security to it in case of a siege  besides the badness of our water it was stowed among the pepper in the hold which made it very hot every morning when we came to take our allowance it was so hot that a man could hardly suffer his hands in it or hold a bottle full of it in his hand i never any where felt the like nor could have thought it possible that water should heat to that degree in a ships hold it was exceeding black too and looked more like ink than water whether it grew so black with standing or was tinged with the pepper i know not for this water was not so black when it was first taken up our food also was very bad for the ship had been out of england upon this voyage above three years and the salt provision brought from thence and which we fed on having been so long in salt was but ordinary food for sickly men to feed on  captain heath when he saw the misery of his company ordered his own tamarinds of which he had some jars aboard to be given some to each mess to eat with their rice this was a great refreshment to the men and i do believe it contributed much to keep us on our legs  this distemper was so universal that i do believe there was scarce a man in the ship but languished under it yet it stole so insensibly on us that we could not say we were sick feeling little or no pain only a weakness and but little stomach nay most of those that died in this voyage would hardly be persuaded to keep their cabbins or hammocks till they could not stir about and when they were forced to lie down they made their wills and piked off in two or three days  the loss of these men and the weak languishing condition that the rest of us were in rendered us incapable to govern our ship when the wind blew more than ordinary this often happened when we drew near the cape and as often put us to our trumps to manage the ship captain health to encourage his men to their labor kept his watch as constantly as any man though sickly himself and lent an helping hand on all occasions but at last almost despairing of gaining his passage to the cape by reason of the winds coming southerly and we having now been sailing   or   weeks he called all our men to consult about our safety and desired every man from the highest to the lowest freely to give his real opinion and advice what to do in this dangerous juncture for we were not in a condition to keep out long and could we not get to land quickly must have perished at sea he consulted therefore whether it were best to beat for the cape or bear away for johanna where we might expect relief that being a place where our outward bound east india ships usually touch and whose natives are very familiar but other places especially st laarence or madagascar which was nearer was unknown to us we were now so nigh the cape that with a fair wind we might expect to be there in   or   days but as the wind was now we could not hope to get thither on the other side this wind was fair to carry us to johanna but then johanna was a great way off and if the wind should continue as it was to bring us into a true trade wind yet we could not get thither under a fortnight and if we should meet calms as we might probably expect it might be much longer besides we should lose our passage about the cape till october or november this being about the latter end of march for after the  0th of may it is not usual to beat about the cape to come home all circumstances therefore being weighed and considered we at last unanimously agreed to prosecute our voyage toward the cape and with patience wait for a shift of wind  but captain heath having thus far sounded the inclination of his weak men told them that it was not enough that they all consented to beat for the cape for our desires were not sufficient to bring us thither but that there would need a more than ordinary labor and management from those that were able and withal for their encouragement he promised a months pay gratis to every man that would engage to assist on all occasions and be ready upon call whether it were his turn to watch or not and this money he promised to pay at the cape this offer was first embraced by some of the officers and then as many of the men as found themselves in a capacity listed themselves in a roll to serve their commander  this was wisely contrived of the captain for he could not have compelled them in their weak condition neither would fair words alone without some hopes of a reward have engaged them to so much extraordinary work for the ship sail and rigging were much out of repair for my part i was too weak to enter my self into that list for else our common safety which i plainly saw lay at stake would have prompted me to do more than any such reward would do in a short time after this it pleased god to favor us with a fine wind which being improved to the best advantage by the incessant labor of these new listed men brought us in a short time to the cape  the night before we entered the harbor which was about the beginning of april being near the land we fired a gun every hour to give notice that we were in distress the next day a dutch captain came aboard in his boat who seeing us so weak as not to be able to trim our sails to turn into the harbor tho we did tolerably well at sea before the wind and being requested by our captain to assist him sent ashore for a hundred lusty men who immediately came aboard and brought our ship in to an anchor they also unbent our sails and did every thing for us that they were required to do for which capt heath gratified them to the full  these men had better stomachs than we and eat freely of such food as the ship afforded and they having the freedom of our ship to go to and fro between decks made prize of what they could lay their hands on especially salt beef which our men for want of stomachs in the voyage had hung up     or  0 pieces in a place this was conveyed away before we knew it or thought of it besides in the night there was a bale of muzlins broke open and a great deal conveyed away but whether the muzlins were stolen by our own men or the dutch i cannot say for we had some very dexterous thieves in our ship  being thus got safe to an anchor the sick were presently sent ashore to quarters provided for them and those that were able remained aboard and had good fat mutton or fresh beef sent aboard every day i went ashore also with my painted prince where i remained with him till the time of sailing again which was about six weeks in which time i took the opportunity to inform my self what i could concerning this country which i shall in the next place give you a brief account of and so make what haste i can home  the cape of good hope is the utmost bounds of the continent of africa toward the south lying in    d  0 m s lat in a very temperate climate i look upon this latitude to be one of the mildest and sweetest for its temperature of any whatsoever and i cannot here but take notice of a common prejudice our european seamen have as to this country that they look upon it as much colder than places in the same latitude to the north of the line i am not of their opinion as to that and their thinking so i believe may easily be accounted for from hence that whatever way they come to the cape whether going to the east indies or returning back they pass through a hot climate and coming to it thus out of an extremity of heat it is no wonder if it appear the colder to them some impute the coldness of the south wind here to its blowing off from sea on the contrary i have always observed the sea winds to be warmer than land winds unless it be when a bloom as we call it or hot blast blow from thence such an one we felt in this very voyage as we went from cape verd islands toward the south seas which i forgot to mention in its proper place chap  th for one afternoon about the   th of jan      in the lat of    south we felt a brisk gale coming from off the coast of america but so violent hot that we thought it came from some burning mountain on the shore and was like the heat from the mouth of an oven just such another gleam i felt one afternoon also as i lay at anchor at the groin in july      it came with a southerly wind both these were followed by a thunder shower these were the only great blooms i ever met with in my travels but setting these aside which are exceptions i have made it my general observation that the seawinds are a great deal warmer than those which blow from land unless where the wind blows from the poles which i take to be the true cause of the coldness of the south wind at the cape for it is cold at sea also and as for the coldness of landwinds as the south west parts of europe are very sensible of it from the northern and eastern winds so on the opposite coast of virginia they are as much pinched with the north west winds blowing excessively cold from over the continent tho its lat be not much greater than this of the cape  but to proceed this large promontory consists of high and very remarkable land and off at sea it affords a very pleasant and agreeable prospect and without doubt the prospect of it was very agreeable to those portuguese who first sound out this way by sea to the east indies when after coasting along the vast continent of africa toward the south pole they had the comfort of seeing the land and their course end in this promontory which therefore they called the cape de bon esperance or of good hope finding that they might now proceed fastwardly  there is good sounding off this cape  0 or  0 leagues at sea to the southward and therefore our english seamen standing over as they usually do from the coast of brazil content themselves with their soundings concluding thereby that they are abrest of the cape they often pass by without seeing it and begin to shape their course northward they have several other signs whereby to know when they are near it as by the seafowl they meet at sea especially the algatrosses a very large long winged bird and the mangovolucres a smaller fowl but the greatest dependence of our english seamen now is upon their observing the variation of the compass which is very carefully minded when they come near the cape by taking the suns amplitude mornings and evenings this they are so exact in that by the help of the azimuth compass an instrument more peculiar to the seamen of our nation they know when they are abrest of the cape or are either to the east or west of it and for that reason though they should be to southward of all the soundings or fathomable ground they can shape their course right without being obliged to make the land but the dutch on the contrary having settled themselves on this promontory do always touch here in their east india voyages both going and coming  the most remarkable land at sea is a high mountain steep to the sea with a flat even top which is called the table land on the west side of the cape a little to the northward of it there is a spacious harbor with a low flat island lying off it which you may leave on either hand and pass in or out securely at either end ships that anchor here ride near the main land leaving the island at a farther distance without them the land by the sea against the harbor is low but backed with high mountains a little way in to the southward of it  the soil of this country is of a brown color not deep yet indifferently productive of grass herbs and trees the grass is short like that which grows on our wiltshire or dorsetshire downs the trees hereabouts are but small and few the country also farther from the sea does not much abound in trees as i have been informed the mould or soil also is much like this near the harbor which though it cannot be said to be very fat or rich land yet it is very fit for cultivation and yields good croops to the industrious husbandman and the country is pretty well settled with farms dutch families and french refugees for  0 or  0 leagues up the country but there are but few farms near the harbor  here grows plenty of wheat barley pease etc here are also fruits of many kinds as apples pears quinces and the largest pomgranates that i did ever see  the chief fruits are grapes these thrive very well and the country is of later years so well stockt with vineyards that they make abundance of wine of which they have enough and to spare and do sell great quantities to ships that rouch here this wine is like a french high country white wind but of a pale yellowish color it is sweet very pleasant and strong  the tame animals of this country are sheep goats hogs cows horses etc the sheep are very large and fat for they thrive very well here this being a dry country and the short pasturage very agreeable to these creatures but it is not so proper for great cattle neither is the beef in its kind so sweet as the mutton of wild beasts it is said here are several sorts but i saw none however it is very likely there are some wild beasts that prey on the sheep because they are commonly brought into the houses in the night and penned up  there is a very beautiful sort of wild ass in this country whose body is curiously striped with equal lists of white and black the stripes coming from the ridge of his back and ending under the belly which is white these stripes are two or three fingers broad running parallel with each other and curiously intermixed one white and one black over from the shoulder to the rump i saw two of the skins of these beasts dried and preserved to be sent to holland as a rarity they seemed big enough to enclose the body of a beast as big as a large colt of a twelvemonth old  here are a great many ducks dunghill fowls etc and ostriges are plentifully found in the dry mountains and plains i eat of their eggs here and those of whom i bought them told me that these creatures lay their eggs in the sand or at least on dry ground and so leave them to be hatched by the sun the meat of one of their eggs will suffice two men very well the inhabitants do preserve the eggs that they find to sell to strangers they were pretty scarce when i was here it being the beginning of their winter whereas i was told they lay their eggs about christmas which is their summer  the sea hereabouts affords plenty of fish of diverse sorts especially a small sort of fish not so big as a herring whereof they have such great plenty that they pickle great quantities yearly and send them to europe seals are also in great numbers about the cape which as i have still observed is a good sign of the plentifulness of fish which is their food  the dutch have a strong fort by the sea side against the harbor where the governor lives at about   or  00 paces distance from thence on the west side of the fort there is a small dutch town in which i told about  0 or  0 houses low but well built with stonewalls there being plenty of stone drawn out of a quarry close by  on the backside of the town as you go toward the mountains the dutch east india company have a large house and a stately garden walled in with a high stonewall  this garden is full of diverse sorts of herbs flowers roots and fruits with curious spacious gravelwalks and arbors and is watered with a brook that descends out of the mountains which being cut into many channels is conveyed into all parts of the garden the hedges which make the walks are very thick and   or  0 foot high they are kept exceeding neat and even by continual pruning there are lower hedges within these again which serve to separate the fruit trees from each other but without shading them and they keep each sort of fruit by themselves as apples pears abundance of quinces pomgranats etc these all prosper very well and bear good fruit especially the pomgranat the roots and gardenherbs have also their distinct places hedged in apart by themselves and all in such order that it is exceeding pleasant and beautiful there are a great number of negro slaves brought from other parts of the world some of which are continually weeding pruning trimming and looking after it all strangers are allowed the liberty to walk there and by the servants leave you may be admitted to taste of the fruit but if you think to do it clandestinly you may be mistaken as i knew one was when i was in the garden who took   or   pomgranats and was espied by one of the slaves and threatened to be carried before the governor i believe it cost him some money to make his peace for i heard no more of it further up from the sea beyond the garden toward the mountains there are several other small gardens and vineyards belonging to private men but the mountains are so nigh that the number of them are but small  the dutch that live in the town get considerably by the ships that frequently touch here chiefly by entertaining strangers that come ashore to refresh themselves for you must give   s or a dollar a day for your entertainment the bread and flesh is as cheap here as in england besides they buy good pennyworths of the seamen both outward and homeward bound which the farmers up the country buy of them again at a dear rate for they have not an opportunity of buying things at the best hand but must buy of those that live at the harbor the nearest settlements as i was informed being  0 miles off  notwithstanding the great plenty of corn and wine yet the extraordinary high taxes which the company lays on liquor makes it very dear and you can buy none but at the tavern except it be by stealth there are but   houses in the town that sell strong liquor one of which is this winehouse or tavern there they sell only wine another sells beer and mum and the third sells brandy and tobacco all extraordinary dear a flask of wine which holds   quarts will cost    stivers for so much i paid for it yet i bought as much for   stivers in another place but it was privately at an unlicenced house and the person that sold it would have been ruined had it been known and thus much for the country and the european inhabitants  chap xx of the natural inhabitants of the cape of good hope the hodmodods or hottantots their personage garb besmearing themselves their clothing houses food way of living and dancing at the full of the moon compared in those respects with other negroes and wild indians captain heath refreshes his men at the cape and getting some more hands departs in company with the james and mary and the josiah a great swelling sea from s w they arrive at santa hellena and there meet with the princess ann homeward bound the air situation and soil of that island its first discovery and change of masters since how the english got it its strength town inhabitants and the product of their plantations the santa hellena manatee no other than the sea lion of the english women at this isle the english ships refresh their men here and depart all together of the different courses from hence to england their course and arrival in the english channel and the downs  the natural inhabitants of the cape are the hodmodods as they are commonly called which is a corruption of the word hottantot for this is the name by which they call to one another either in their dances or on any occasion as if every one of them had this for his name the word probably has some signification or other in their language whatever it is  these hottantots are people of a middle stature with small limbs and thin bodies full of activity their faces are of a flat oval figure of the negro make with great eyebrows black eyes but neither are their noses so flat nor their lips so thick as the negroes of guinea their complexion is darker than the common indians though not so black as the negroes or new hollanders neither is their hair so much frizled  they besmear themselves all over with grease as well to keep their joints supple as to fence their half naked bodies from the air by stopping up their pores to do this the more effectually they rub soot over the greased parts especially their faces which adds to their natural beauty as painting does in europe but withal sends from them a strong smell which though sufficiently pleasing to themselves is very unpleasant to others they are glad of the worst of kitchinstuff for this purpose and use it as often as they can get it  this custom of anointing the body is very common in other parts of africa especially on the coast of guinea where they generally use palmoil anointing themselves from head to foot but when they want oil they make use of kitchinstuff which they buy of the europeans that trade with them in the east indies also especially on the coast of cudda and malacca and in general on almost all the easterly islands as well on sumatra java etc as on the philippine and spice islands the indian inhabitants anoint themselves with coconut oil two or three times a day especially mornings and evenings they spend sometimes half an hour in chasing the oil and rubbing it into their hair and skin leaving no place unsmeard with oil but their face which they daub not like these hottantots the americans also in some places do use this custom but not so frequently perhaps for want of oil and grease to do it yet some americanindians in the north seas frequently daub themselves with a pigment made with leaves roots or herbs or with a sort of red earth giving their skins a yellow red or green color according as the pigment is and these smell unsavourly enough to people not accustomed to them tho not so rank as those who use oil or grease  the hottantots do wear no covering on their heads but deck their hair with small shells their garments are sheepskins wrapped about their shoulders like a mantle with the woolly sides next their bodies the men have besides this mantle a piece of skin like a small apron hanging before them the women have another skin tucked about their wastes which comes down to their knees like a petticoat and their legs are wrapped round with sheepsguts two or three inches thick some up as high as to their calves others even from their feet to their knees which at a small distance seems to be a sort of boots these are put on when they are green and so they grow hard and stiff on their legs for they never pull them off again till they have occasion to eat them which is when they journey from home and have no other food then these guts which have been worn it may be six eight ten or twelve months make them a good banquet this i was informed of by the dutch they never pull off their sheep skin garment but to louse themselves for by continual wearing them they are sull of vermin which obliges them often to strip and sit in the sun two or three hours together in the heat of the day to destroy them indeed most indians that live remote from the equator are molested with lice though their garments afford less shelter for lice than these hottatots sheepskins do for all those indians who live in cold countries as in the north and south parts of america have some sort of skin or other to cover their bodies as deer otter beaver or seals skins all which they as constantly wear without shifting themselves as these hottantots do their sheep skins and hence they are lousy too and strong scented though they do not daub themselves at all or but very little for even by reason of their skins they smell strong  the hottantots houses are the meanest that i did ever see they are about   or  0 foot high and  0 or    from side to side they are in a manner round made with small poles stuck into the ground and brought together at the top where they are fastened the sides and top of the house are filled up with boughs coursely wattled between the poles and all is covered over with long grass rushes and pieces of hides and the house at a distance appears just like a haycock they leave only a small hole on one side about   or   foot high for a door to creep in and out at but when the wind comes in at this door they stop it up and make another hole in the opposite side they make the fire in the middle of the house and the smoke ascends out of the crannies from all parts of the house they have no beds to lie on but tumble down at night round the sire  their household furniture is commonly an earthen pot or two to boil victuals and they live very miserably and hard it is reported that they will last two or three days together when they travel about the country  their common food is either herbs flesh or shellfish which they get among the rocks or other places at low water for they have no boats barklogs nor canoas to go a fishing in so that their chiefest subsistence is on land animals or on such herbs as the land naturally produces i was told by my dutch landlord that they kept sheep and bullocks here before the dutch settled among them and that the inland hottantots have still great stocks of cattle and sell them to the dutch for rolls of tobacco and that the price for which they sell a cow or sheep was as much twisted tobacco as will reach from the horns or head to the tail for they are great lovers of tobacco and will do any thing for it this their way of trucking was confirmed to me by many others who yet said that they could not buy their beef this cheap way for they had not the liberty to deal with the hottantots that being a privilege which the dutch east india company reserve to themselves my landlord having a great many lodgers fed us most with mutton some of which he bought of the butcher and there is but one in the town but most of it he killed in the night the sheep being brought privately by the hottantots who assisted in the skinning and dressing and had the skin and guts for their pains i judged these sheep were fetched out of the country a good way off for he himself would be absent a day or two to procure them and two or three hottantots with him these of the hottantots that live by the dutch town have their greatest subsistence from the dutch for there is one or more of them belonging to every house these do all sorts of servile work and there take their food and grease three or four more of their nearest relations sit at the doors or near the dutch house waiting for the scraps and fragments that come from the table and if between meals the dutch people have any occasion for them to go on errands or the like they are ready at command expecting little for their pains but for a stranger they will not budge under a stiver  their religion if they have any is wholly unknown to me for they have no temple nor idol nor any place of worship that i did see or hear of yet their mirth and nocturnal pastimes at the new and full of the moon looked as if they had some superstition about it for at the full especially they sing and dance all night making a great noise i walked out to their huts twice at these times in the evening when the moon arose above the horizon and viewed them for an hour or more they seem all very busy both men women and children dancing very oddly on the green grass by their houses they traced two and fro promiscuously often clapping their hands and singing aloud their faces were sometimes to the east sometimes to the west neither did i see any motion or gesture that they used when their faces were toward the moon more than when their backs were toward it after i had thus observed them for a while i returned to my lodging which was not above   or  00 paces from their huts and i heard them singing in the same manner all night in the gray of the morning i walked out again and found many of the men and women still singing and dancing who continued their mirth till the moon went down and then they left off some of them going into their huts to sleep and others to their attendance in their dutch houses other negroes are less circumspect in their nightdances as to the precise time of the full moon they being more general in these nocturnal pastimes and use them oftener as do many people also in the east and west indies yet there is a difference between colder and warmer countries as to their devertisements the warmer climates being generally very productive of delicate fruits etc and these uncivilizd people caring for little else than what is barely necessary they spend the greatest part of their time in diverting themselves after their several fashions but the indians of colder climates are not so much at leisure the fruits of the earth being scarce with them and they necessiated to be continually fishing hunting or fowling for their subsistence not as with us for recreation  as for these hottantots they are a very lazy sort of people and tho they live in a delicate country very fit to be manured and where there is land enough for them yet they choose rather to live as their forefathers poor and miserable than be at pains for plenty and so much for the hottantots i shall now return to our own affairs  upon our arrival at the cape captain heath took an house to live in in order to recover his health such of his men as were able did so too for the rest he provided lodgings and paid their expenses three or four of our men who came ashore very sick died but the rest by the assistance of the doctors of the fort a fine air and good kitchen and cellar physic soon recovered their healths those that subscribed to be at all calls and assisted to bring in the ship received captain heaths bounty by which they furnished themselves with liquor for their homeward voyage but we were now so few that we could not sail the ship therefore captain heath desired the governor to spare him some men and as i was informed had a promise to be supplied out of the homeward bound dutch east india ships that were now expected every day and we waiied for them in the mean time in came the james and mary and the josiah of london bound home out of those we thought to have been furnished with men but they had only enough for themselves therefore we waited yet longer for the dutch fleet which at last arrived but we could get no men from them  captain heath was therefore forced to get men by stealth such as he could pick up whether soldiers or seamen the dutch knew our want of men therefore near  0 of them those that had a design to return to europe came privately and offered themselves and waited in the night at places appointed where our boats went and fetched   or   aboard at a time and hid them especially when any dutch boat came aboard our ship here at the cape i met my friend daniel wallis the same who leapt into the sea and swam at pulo condore after several traverses to madagascar don mascarin ponticherri pegu cunnimere maderas and the river of hugli he was now got hither in a homeward bound dutch ship i soon persuaded him to come over to us and found means to get him aboard our ship  about the   d of may we sailed from the cape in the company of the james and mary and the jasiah directing our course toward the island santa hellena we met nothing of remark in this voyage except a great swelling sea out of the s w which taking us on the broad side made us roll sufficiently such of our watercasks as were between decks running from side to side were in a short time all staved and the deck well washed with the fresh water the shot tumbled out the lockers and garlands and rung a loud peal rumbling from side to side every wl that the ship made neither was it an easy matter to reduce them again within bounds the guns being carefully looked after and lashed fast never budgd but the tackles or pulleys and lashings made great music too the sudden and violent motion of the ship made us fearful last some of the guns should have broken loose which must have been very detrimental to the ships sides the masts were also in great danger to be rolled by the board but no harm happened to any of us besides the loss of   or   butts of water and a barrel or two of good cape wine which was stavd in the great cabin  this great tumbling sea took us shortly after we came from the cape the violence of it lasted but one night yet we had a continual swelling came out of the s w almost during all the passage to santa hellena which was an eminent token that the s w winds were now violent in the higher latitudes toward the south pole for this was the time of the year for those winds notwithstanding this boisterous sea coming thus obliquely upon us we had fine clear weather and a moderate gale at s e or between that and the east till we came to the island santa hellena where we arrived the  0th day of june there we found the princess ann at an anchor waiting for us  the island santa hellena lies in about    degrees south lat the air is commonly serene and clear except in the months that yield rain yet we had one or two very rainy days even while we were here here are moist seasons to plant and sow and the weather is temperate enough as to heat tho so near the equator and very healthy  the island is but small not above nine or ten leagues in length and stands   or  00 leagues from the main land it is bounded against the sea with steep rocks so that there is no landing but at two or three places the land is high and mountainous and seems to be very dry and poor yet they are fine valleys proper for cultivation the mountains appear bare only in some places you may see a few low shrubs but the valleys afford some trees fit for building as i was informed  this island is said to have been first discovered and settled by the portuguese who stockt it with goats and hogs but it being afterward deserted by them it lay waste till the dutch finding it convenient to relieve their east india ships settled it again but they afterward relinquished it for a more convenient place i mean the cape of good hope then the english east india company settled their servants there and began to fortify it but they being yet weak the dutch about the year      came thither and retook it and keep it in their possession this news being reported in england captain monday was sent to retake it who by the advice and conduct of one that had formerly lived there landed a party of armed men in the night in a small cove unknown to the dutch then in garrison and climbing the rocks got up into the island and so came in the morning to the hills hanging over the fort which stands by the sea in a small valley from thence firing into the fort they soon made them surrender there were at this time two or three dutch east india ships either at anchor or coming thither when our ships were there these when they saw that the english were masters of the island again made sail to be gone but being chaced by the english frigots   of them became rich prizes to capt monday and his men  the island has continued ever since in the hands of the english east india company and has been greatly strengthened both with men and guns so that at this day it is secure enough from the invasion of an enemy for the common landing place is a small bay like a half moon scarce  00 paces wide between the two points close by the seaside are good guns planted at equal distances lying along from one end of the bay to the other besides a small fort a little further in from the sea near the midst of the bay all which makes the bay so strong that it is impossible to force it the small cove where capt monday landed his men when he took the island from the dutch is scarce fit for a boat to land at and yet that is now also fortified  there is a small english town within the great bay standing in a little valley between two high steep mountains there may be about  0 or  0 small houses whose walls are built with rough stones the inside furniture is very mean the governor has a pretty tolerable handsome low house by the fort where he commonly lives having a few soldiers to attend him and to guard the fort but the houses in the town before mentioned stand empty save only when ships arrive here here for their owners have all plantations farther in the island where they constantly employ themselves but when ships arrive they all flock to the town where they live all the time that the ships lie here for then is their fair or market to buy such necessaries as they want and to sell off the produce of their plantations  their plantations afford potatoes yams and some plantains and bonanoes their stock consists chiefly of hogs bullocks cocks and hens ducks geese and turkeys of which they have great plenty and fell them at a low rate to the sailers taking in exchange shirts drawers or any light clothes pieces of callico silks or muzlins arack sugar and lime juice is also much esteemed and coveted by them but now they are in hopes to produce wine and brandy in a short time for they do already begin to plant vines for that end there being a few french men that are to manage that affair this i was told but i saw nothing of it for it rained so hard when i was ashore that i had not the opportunity of seeing their plantations i was also informed that they get manatee or seacows here which seemed very strange to me therefore enquiring more strictly into the matter i found the santa hellena manatee to be by their shapes and manner of lying ashore on the rocks those creatures called sealyons for the manatee never come ashore neither are they feund near any rocky shores as this island is there being no feeding for them in such places besides in this island there is no river for them to drink at tho there is a small brook runs into the sea out of the valley by the fort  we stayed here   or   days all which time the islanders lived at the town to entertain the seamen who constantly flock ashore to enjoy themselves among their country people our touching at the cape had greatly drained the seamen of their loose corns at which these islanders as greatly repined and some of the poorer sort openly complained against such doings saying it was fit that the east india company should be acquainted with it that they might hinder their ships from touching at the cape yet they were extremely kind in hopes to get what was remaining they are most of them very poor but such as could get a little liquor to sell to the seamen at this time got what the seamen could spare for the punchhouses were never empty but had we all come directly hither and not touched at the cape even the poorest people among them would have gotten something by entertaining sick men for commonly the seamen coming home are troubled more or less with scorbutic distempers and their only hopes are to get refreshment and health at this island and thse hopes seldom or never fail them if once they get footing here for the islands afford bundance of delicate herbs wherewith the sick re first bathed to supple their joints and then the ruits and herbs and fresh food soon after cure them of their scorbutic humor so that in a weeks time men that have been carried ashore in hammocks and they who were wholly unable to go have soon been able to leap and dance doubtless the serenity and wholesomness of the air contributes much to the carrying off of these distempers for here is constantly a fresh breze while we stayed here many of the seamen got sweethearts one young man belonging to the james and mary was married and brought his wife to england with him another brought his sweetheart to england they being each engaged by bonds to marry at their arrival in england and several other of our men were over head and ears in love with the santa hellena maids who tho they were born there yet very earnestly desired to be released from that prison which they have no other way to compass but by marrying seamen or passengers that touch here the young women born here are but one remove from english being the daughters of such they are well shaped proper and comely were they in a dress to set them off  my stay ashore here was but two days to get refreshments for my self and jcoly whom i carried ashore with me and he was very diligent to pick up such things as the islands afforded carrying ashore with him a bag which the people of the isle filled with roots for him they flockt about him and seemed to admire him much this was the last place where i had him at my own disposal for the mate of the ship who had mr moodies share in him left him entirely to my management i being to bring him to england but i was no sooner arrived in the thames but he was sent ashore to be seen by some eminent persons and i being in want of money was prevailed upon to sell first part of my share in him and by degrees all of it after this i heard he was carried about to be shown as a sight and that he died of the small pox at oxsord  but to proceed our water being filled and the ship all stockt with fresh provision we sailed from hence in company of the princess ann the james and mary and the josiah july the  d      directing our course toward england and designing to touch no where by the way we were now in the way of the trade winds which we commonly find at e s e or s e by e or s e till we draw near the line and sometimes till we are   or  0 degrees to the north of the line for which reason ships might shape their course so as to keep on the asrican shore and pass between cape verd and cape verd islands for that seems to be the dirctest course to england but experience often shows us that the sarthest way about is the nearest way home and so it is here for by striving to keep near the asrican shore you meet with the winds more uncertain and subject to calms whereas in keeping the mid way between asrica and america or rather nearer the american continent till you are north of the line you have a brisk constant gale  this was the way that we took and in our passage before we got to the line we saw three ships and making toward them we found two of them to be portugueze bound to brazil the third kept on a wind so that we could not speak with her but we found by the portugueze it was an english ship called the dorothy capt thwart commander bound to the east indies after this we kept company still with our   consorts till we came near england and then were separated by bad weather but before we came within sight of land we got together again all but the james and mary she got into the channel before us and went to plymouth and there gave an account of the rest of us whereupon our men of war who ly there came out to join us and meeting us brought us off of plymouth there our consort the james and mary came to us again and from thence we all sailed in company of several men of war toward portsmouth there our first convoy left us and went in thither but we did not want convoys for our fleets were then repairing to their winter harbors to be laid up so that we had the company of several english ships to the downs and a squadron also of dutch sailed up the channel but kept off farther from our english coast they being bound home to holland when we came as high as the south foreland we left them standing on their course keeping on the back of the goodwin sands and we lufft in for the downs where we anchored september the   th       books printed for j knapton at the crown in st pauls churchyard voyages
