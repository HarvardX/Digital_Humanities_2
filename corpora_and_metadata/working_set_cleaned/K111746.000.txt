master georgerobert berkeley second son of the rev dr berkeley prebendary of canterbury     the editors postscript of the poems     erratum p    l  0 r smoke ascending to the skies  the authors preface it is more usual for poets than for writers of any other description to apologize for presenting their works to the public it is not easy to determine whether this arises from a suspicion that their talents are unequal to support the character they have assumed or whether it proceeds from an idea that as of poetical merit all the world are or pretend to be judges the utmost appearance of diffidence is necessary to defend the candidates for the laurel from the vengeance of criticism the man who publishes a treatise in theology or an essay on farriery comes boldly forward and delivers his opinion without apparent apprehensions but such is not the case with the poet he generally thinks himself obliged to state that the following poems were never intended for the public eye  that they were written for the entertainment of a select circle or how felfish merely to amuse himself  that either the earnest entreaties of friends or a dread lest their zeal might have tempted them to circulate incorrect copies of his works are his sole motives for appealing to the tribunal of public criticism  such is the general prelude to poems but the author of this volume is much at a loss how he may properly deprecate the public vengeance for having aspired to the title of a poet as he confessedly comes forward neither urged by the entreaties of friends nor terrified by the threats of creditors and he certainly entertains no apprehensions that his slender stock of fame may be injured by the publication of spurious copies for none such exist  he has therefore nothing to plead in his own excuse but that the public having without disgust received his humble attempts in prose he is encouraged by the protection he has already experienced to appear once more as an author hoping that those whom he may fail to please will pardon his having attempted it  to many the perusal of these trifles will restore the recollection of times long past they will be remembered with pleasure though mingled with that regret which ever attends the recollection of happy days that are to return no more  in extenuation of any errors that may occur in these poems the author has only to say that they were mostly written from the age of seventeen when he commenced his literary career to twentyfour that at that time of life the imagination is more active than the judgment and that at present he is so reduced by a long and tedious illness as to be incapable of improving whatever he has written for the last four years of his life those hours that have not been marked with disease have been devoted to studies of a severer nature in order to qualify him for the practice of a profession which a constitution debilitated by disease obliges him now for ever to relinquish had it pleased the allwise disposer of all events to have spared mr bs life he hoped to have obtained some appointment in the diplomatic line for which as well as for the bar nature and education had excellently qualified him mr b never had at any moment of his life an idea of going into the ministry  he saying to his friend about a month before his death nothing this world has to offer could ever induce me to go into orders whilst it pleases god to spare me my understanding mr b had from early youth been entreated to read with deep attention the thirtythird chapter of the prophet ezekiel and st pauls epistles to timothy and titus and mr b firmly believed that all scripture was given by inspiration   from a mind exhausted by pain and sickness emanations of splendour cannot be expected had the author still possessed that share of health which once constituted his first felicity he might have rendered his performances less deserving of censure but whatever be the result of their publication the writing of them has occupied many an hour that might have been worse employed and he may add that his having a literary turn of mind has procured him the acquaintance and friendship of many whose superiority of talents he readily acknowledges and from whose conversation he has derived at once pleasure and instruction neither has an attachment to poetry as is too often the case prevented his pursuing studies of a different cast from the works of his friend doctor reid and those of other able writers in the same line he has derived a pleasure more solid than poetry can bestow poetry may charm with the power of fancy but it is philosophy alone that can strengthen the mind  as the authors present state of health renders it probable that this may be his last address to the public he will not lay down his pen without adverting to the reviews those channels of literary intelligence are often censured as both partial and severe how far these charges may be just he will not pretend to determine but he wishes those who bring the charge to recollect that reviewers are men that some degree of partiality is inseparable from humanity and that therefore till we are supplied with reviews from above they like every other human invention must have their imperfections however in matters of religion the reviewers may have improper biasses in matters of belles lettres their opinion will in general be found to be impartial and by appeals from their decision little is now to be gained we live in an age when literary merit is thoroughly understood and the volumes that are now condemned will derive little advantage from the award of posterity  having said thus much on the subject of the reviews he thinks it right to declare that he has not the least personal acquaintance with any of the gentlemen who compile them of his connections with the reviewers in his literary capacity he has no right to complain where he has merited censure they have inflicted it fairly and they have often cheered him with approbation  whatever be the result of their decision with respect to this work he promises to submit without any appeal with respect to the trifles that compose this volume he has only farther to observe that instead of inscribing the whole to one person he has inscribed the separate poems to different people as slight tokens of his esteem for this mode of dedication though now he does not think himself bound to offer any apology possibly his plan may recall to the memory of his readers the fable of the hare and many friends and should the author fail of success in his present attempt he like the hare may experience the inutility of friendship but whatever be the success of his volume he will still have the satisfaction to reflect that he has never written a line which dying he might wish to blot  sonnet on the death of george monck berkeley esquire grandson of the illustrious bishop berkeley supposed to be written in cheltenham church by the

accidentally of mr monck berkeleys characteristic sympathy with wretchedness  and which was singularly exemplified during a residence of the last summer at hastings in the kindest attention to more than three hundred emigrant french clergy mr monck berkeley was their sole interpreter for although there were several persons at hastings that could speak something that was not english yet these poor people used to say no body comprendres us but mons berquelly as the french always speak and write that to them hard name a ridiculous anecdote might be related of the name being properly written once when mr berkeleys mother was in france many years ago  assisted them as did his truly respectable unwearied friend the very worthy henry grimston esquire most liberally with his purse  and in every other possible way  dying as he then was  they were most gratefully sensible of his truly amiable unwearied attention to them  by mr dunster ah me those tears he dried again shall flow those hearts he eased again shall burst with woe the poor for him heartrending sighs shall heave and gallias reverend exiles doubly grieve cd  character of mr monck berkeley written by one of the most accomplished gentlemen of the present time my first knowledge of mr berkeley was at oxford he was then a gentleman commoner of magdalen hall in that university and though many very respectable names were at the same time on the list of its members yet mr berkeley was so preeminently noble in his manners so faithful in his friendships and so benevolent to his associates that perhaps not one of the society envied his high reputation as a man or thought themseves lessened by the acknowledged superiority of his talents as a scholar his delight was in searching out merit and well knowing that it fled from the glare of day and should be sought after in the shade of retirement he there looked for that humble but valuable plant and having found it transplanted it instantly into the richest soil he had access to the soul of the great bishop berkeley seemed in every thing to have animated the body of his grandson and like him to have equally deserved the just tribute of praise recorded by the sweet poet of his day to berkeley every virtue under heaven  genius marked him in his earliest years for a child of her own adoption and had not providence for some good purpose hidden from our eyes recalled his spirit from the abodes of men when it was verging upon the years where youth ends and manhood begins he would not have needed the impartial pen to have told the admiring world that he possessed every power whether by various rules of art to touch the soul or warm the heart to please the eye delight the mind with objects simple pure refined to sound sublime the epic strain like falccus charm or with the rage of juvenal chastise the age sweet as the prophets vision to unfold what sainted breasts have felt but never told what bards to us with sparing hand have given of liberal gifts bestowed on them by heaven webb  through a long and oppressive illness he supported with unabated vigor the soul of the christian the ties of friendship and the benevolence of the man pious without oftentation gay without licentiousness a poet without envy a man without guile such was george monck berkeley esquire now happier far in the region of his kindred spirits than all the vain pursuits of this earthly globe could bestow upon him  to the right honorable alexander lord loughborough lord high chancellor of england my lord permit me to offer to your lordship the following hasty sketch of the alas short life of a most accomplished young man honored by your lordships thoroughly amiable attention when introduced to your lordship by letter only from an old acquaintance of whom perhaps you had not heard even the name for near a quarter of a century  it requires an abler pen than that of a poor infirm female to do justice to your lordships highly polite friendly attentions to that lovely young man and to his and his happy mothers gratitude for those attentions by those who have known her best through life gratitude has been said to be the distinguishing the strongest feature in her character and she is tempted to believe it for the death of her angelichearted son certainly blasted every other passion of her mind but gratitude perhaps indigenous if any good in our fallen nature may be said to be so still blossoms in her heart no affliction has eradicated has blasted or frozen it whilst it continues sensible to any sublunary objects it will reflect with pleasure with delight often with extacy on the goodness of your lordship and your incomparable compeer the excellent earl of leven to the descendant of those two great and good men bishop berkeley and francis

and during the last eighteen years of his life the only child of the reverend george berkeley lld prebendary of canterbury son of george lord bishop of cloyne by anne eldest daughter of the right honorable john forster speaker of the house of commons in ireland and eliza eldest daughter of the reverend henry frinsham ma by eliza youngest daughter and coheiress of francis cherry esquire of shottesbrook house in the county of berks a friend of mr berkeley used to tell him that he was as remarkably descended by his mother as he was nobly by his father two of mrs berkeleys paternal grandsires were killed in one day at the isle of rhee sir john heidon and sir george blundell baronets and the son of the former was highly favored by providence to escape an untimely death by the wretched lord bruces objecting to his being second in that tremendous duel fought between him and sir edward sackville ancestor to the present worthy duke of dorset some years ago when mr berkeley visited france and got a letter of introduction to his grace then ambassador at paris containing a very urgent request that mr berkeley might have particular attention his father laughing said you may plead your grandsires merits in crossing the ocean to prevent his graces grandsires being butchered by that wretch lord bruce all who have read that tragical tale related by mr addison in the guardian and in the second volume of collins peerage p     must rejoice that poor lord bruce died possessed of a very different spirit from that which influenced him in life that he like the thief on the cross was called into the vineyard at the eleventh hour and a half or rather three quarters just before the final close of the day of mercy and grace for his soul passed into the region of spirits within the hour   mr berkeley was born at bray in the county of berks on tuesday february        at half past two in the morning  it is frequently said by biographers that nothing remarkable occurred during childhood of mr berkeley this cannot be asserted for throughout childhood youth manhood and till within a very few months of his death the hairbreadth escapes of losing life were almost innumerable an allgracious providence constantly interposing sometimes very remarkably to rescue him from death until he was enabled by free sovereign grace through redeeming mercy to meet that king of terrors with joy for he died triumphing in christ  a little before the birth of mr berkeley dr cadogans essay on the nursing of children made its appearance when the depositing children in cradles was exploded accordingly a large easy chair during the day was appropriated to his use when he was about six weeks old a person going into the nursery in the dusk before the servant had lighted candles sat down on this chair but providentially did not sit quite to the back it being very deep she soon felt something move the infant finding itself incommoded began to struggle with its arms and legs mr berkeley from his birth showed the very uncommon strength of limbs which as he grew up increased and he was esteemed the strongest man in england by those who were judges some of his intimate friends have owed their lives in a tumultuous crowd to the strength of his arm joined to his true resolute cool courage where he did not wish to have recourse to his sword mr berkeleys strength was muscular as his bones were remarkably small his wrist some time before his death measuring little more than six inches  when he was about three months old his mother was attacked by so desperate an ague that it was supposed another fit must have proved fatal to her yet so unwilling was she that her darling her idol alas from his cradle to his coffin should be indebted for his early nourishment to any but herself that she resolved to attempt the bringing him up by hand but he had very nearly lost his life in the attempt before a nurse could be procured  at a very early period of his life he began to show signs of that uncommon brilliancy of parts quickness of wit and soundness of judgment which so remarkably distinguished him through life even to its latest period to relate witticisms of a child to any but a fond parent would be ridiculous one or two instances it is hoped may however be pardoned when about three years old he was searching the house for his mother whom from his earliest infancy he passionately loved unable to find her he walked from room to room calling her a lady who was staying in the family said my dear child what a bleating thou do make he instantly turned round and said to be sure i do for i am bleating for my dam when he was little more than three years and a half old he was diverting himself in the garden a beggar came to the gate and seeing the hall doors and windows all open and no one in sight said my pretty little master what are you doing here alone he replied i am watering some flowers for the gardener the old fox said i think i must come in and help you on which mr berkeley flew to the gate and bolted it saying no i thank you i can do it very well by myself on his maids asking him why he bolted the gate he replied why if he had got into the house now that the men are out with the coach perhaps the maids and i could not have got him out again  generosity and compassion are indeed very rarely found until instilled into the breasts of very young children in mr berkeley they were certainly indigenous when a child in arms if he was asked to give a piece of cake out of his hand he would instantly break off threefourths of it reserving only a very small piece for himself and be unhappy if the petitioner did not take and eat it on receiving his orange after dinner when it was peeled he would retire to the window ahd carefully separate the quills then go out into the servants hall and force one upon every servant eight in number one evening his mother observing that he kept his left hand closed enquired whether he had hurt it the servant replied that he had not but that he had kept since dinner full four hours a quill of his orange to give to the coachman who had been sent to windsor on a message and that no promises of care could prevail on master berkeley to entrust her with it adding that he assured her it would comfort him after his ride  mr berkeley had been told as all children should be that the poor had a right to a share of all his money accordingly the first bright sixpence of which he was master he procured a hammer and attempted to break it on his servants asking him what he was about he replied why mamma says the poor must have their share of it so i am going to break it for them this attended him to his latest hour for the distressed ever shared largely indeed in every guinea he possessed  mr berkeleys understanding was such as often when a child to occasion his mother to say she hoped he would not in other instances resemble the famous marquis de bedmar of whom in his memoires it is said he had the power of appearing to be entirely taken up with bagatelles when he was listening to every thing that was saying by various persons and when he was plotting the destruction of venice  mr berkeley when only five years old would stand at the window seat and hum a tune and three weeks afterward would relate two different conversations carried on at the same time and not only relate them verbatim but take off exactly the action and tone of voice of every speaker of this dangerous however diverting amusement mr berkeley was early broke by his mother  the first eight years and a half of his life mr berkeley had no other instructor than his mother and such was the extreme volatility of his genius the wonderful strength of his understanding and the natural wilfulness of his temper that the difficulty of teaching him to read was an herculean labor so much as often to occasion him to say when grown up that he was resolved not to learn to read that he did verily believe his mother was the only human being who could have accomplished it until he was old enough to feel the necessity of it a brother of the late sir thomas stapleton of grays court persisted in a like resolution saying it was nonsense to learn until he at thirteen was sent to sea on board a ship commanded by sir john norris who on learning the young gentlemans sentiments assured him that he should be flogged every day until he could read the chaplain was appointed his tutor he was after this declaration a very apt scholar this acute worthy young gentleman died at the age of twentytwo it is sometimes a misfortune to children to be too clever   adding i think my dear mother seemed to have been sent into this world on purpose to teach and govern me as i attended to nor cared for any one but herself finding that she alone had that invincible perseverance requisite to govern me  before he attained his sixth year he read incomparably and his comments on what he read and what he saw often occasioned the late george lord lyttelton when staying at his fathers on a visit to declare he had the strongest as well as the most brilliant powers of mind he had ever seen often exclaiming as did the late learned dr sumner of harrow school and many other great men what a man this very extraordinary child must become and mr berkeley more than answered the expectations of his childhood as all the learned and great men who had share in his education bore testimony his beloved and respected tutor at eton the reverend dr norbury too well known in the learned world to need any eulogium from a feeble pen used to say that there were wonderful traits of originality in all mr berkeleys exercises on this being mentioned one day by a friend to his father mr berkeley then a young man said ah my dear tutor as to the time of his death he ever termed dr norbury i do pity him he used to storm and say i have thirty dolts that cannot do any thing and i have three or four with that idle varlet berkeley at their head that can do every thing and that will do nothing and when dr berkeley used to complain of his sons idleness to dr norbury his reply was sir if your son would apply at all he must carry the world before him but i must tell you fairly such is his genius that i do not believe that man lives who can make him apply regularly until he comes himself to see the necessity of it  the very learned dr hill professor of greek at the university of st andrews now dean of the chapel royal at edinburgh where mr berkeley did apply used to say that he would engage to select mr berkeleys exercise from amongst a thousand without any other mark than what the french term  le marque douvrier  mr berkeley although he could not be called a man of business might with propriety be termed a creature of business from seven years old for he always felt himself as he thought equal to transact any thing that he offered his services to perform the following little incident may serve to illustrate this before he was seven years old his mother being alarmed lest one of his front teeth should grow uneven from the old one not being removed had sent him to town to hemmet who very honestly said all would be right if let alone and he proved that his judgment was as great as his honesty for when mr berkeley grew up and sometimes went to him for his tooth powder he often said that mr berkeley had the finest and strongest set of teeth he ever saw in any head he returned home with a gentleman who was coming on a visit to his fathers a lady of very large fortune happened to be in the machine going on a visit to a friend at taplow finding that he lived in the neighborhood she asked him how far it was from maidenhead bridge to taplow he replied that it was about ten minutes drive she said she must walk as her friends not knowing the day of her arrival could not send their carriage he replied that she certainly should not do that for that his fathers coach would be sent to convey the gentleman and himself and that he would certainly have the pleasure of taking her up the hill to her friends house the instant he got out of the machine he enquired of mr march if his fathers coach was come and had the mortification to hear that the coachman had called to say that the carriage was gone on to carry some gentlemen over maidenhead thicket and would call for him in an hour mr berkeley not then seven years old said madam it is very improper that a lady should walk on the high road alone so i will have the honor of walking up with you i can borrow a stick of mr march this protection was as will naturally be supposed politely declined and the lady ordered a chaise as soon as she alighted her first question was do you know dr berkeley of cookham yes intimately do you know his little boy if you do not you do not know i very believe the most sensible little creature in the world and the politest adding there was a tall young man of i suppose near thirty with him but the dear child has twenty times his sense and forty times his politeness the gentleman was a learned man who laughed at that pleasing accomplishment politeness he was then what fine men are now mr berkeley was almost idolized by the family to whom the lady was going so it appeared not so wonderful to them  in the may after he had completed his eighth year dr berkeley went to reside at his prebendal house in the oaks at canterbury where he was immediately sent to the kings school under the care of those two eminent masters the learned accomplished elegant dr beauvoir and the reverend learned and worthy mr tucker in august a gentlemans family going to france to place a son at st quintin to learn the language his mother suggested to his father the advantage of sending mr berkeley who although she had taught him to read french well yet found it impossible with an house full of english servants to make him speak it and as it never was the consideration of a moment with his parents whether any thing concerning their childrens education was to cost one guinea or one hundred immediately determined to send him young as he was he was the only one of the party who knew any thing of french and the sensible amiable lady whose son was going to learn the french language at her return declared that they should have been half starved at the inns and hotels had not mr berkeley been with them saying that lovely little creature seemed quite inspired for he began in french telling the waiters it was a shame to let english ladies and gentlemen sit there without their tea and chocolate he used to run to the bar and drive them in before him with whatever was wanted in his own language it may with strictest truth be asserted that even at that early period of life he was a great proficient for there is not a word in the english language which at the age of seven years he could not spell without book and of most of the difficult words he perfectly understood their sense and used them with the strictest propriety which occasioned the sensible sir j temple brother of the abovenamed amiable lady who accompanied her to france repeatedly to say i never saw so sensible a creature here is my nephew the very amiable d l esquire of hampshire  just double his age who has been under private tuition for five years is no more capable of expressing himself in the elegant language this had been by him easily acquired his mother having from the age of three years every morning after he had spelt his lesson regularly explained to him the meaning of two words of five six or seven syllables this easy task to both mistress and scholar produced a laughable circumstance one day when mr berkeley was about three years and a half old after dinner he being at play in the window a gentleman who had dined at dr berkeleys speaking of the unfortunate captain b said ah poor man it is pity his father and mother did not take it into their heads to marry before he was born it makes the difference of  000 l a year to him mr berkeley turned round and said poor man i pity him exceedingly it is a very great misfortune to be illegitimate the gentleman turning to him said you little animal how could you become acquainted with a word almost as long as yourself no one supposed him attending to the conversation but from the time he was capable of speaking although deeply engaged at play he would frequently a week after relate verbatim even long conversations with every gesture and the tone of voice of every speaker in mimickry he was an adept but was early taught by his mother the danger of indulging it and very rarely indeed practiced it never but when earnestly requested by some very intimate friend and in very select company of this little creature than i am of scaling the skies adding i shall watch him through life and bid adieu to all my sagacity if he does not become one of the greatest men of the age mr berkeley remained somewhat less than a year in france boarding in the house of a truly respectable roman catholic negociant of the name of montjole under the kind inspection of the truly amiable protestant family of fitzou the unfeigned affection he ever retained for the french friends of his early youth appeared when at the age of seventeen he published his maria or the generous rustic by his selecting the names of his actors in that beautiful little volume from the families with whom he lived and those by whom he was caressed and delighted indeed almost idolized for he had ever most engaging attracting manners his heroine took her name from the servant of monsieur and madame montjole who loved him so tenderly that when he was to quit st quintin at the age of between nine and ten she was obliged to be sent by her mistress for two or three days to visit her parents while le petit general angloise as he was universally called at that place from his collecting a number of boys a little older than himself and exercising them every evening and marching them with a drum and other martial music about the town after which he used frequently to entertain them with fruit cakes etc his sejour in france fully answered as perhaps very few englishmen were ever more thoroughly masters of the french language speaking and writing it as correctly as he did his mother tongue on being thanked by a gentleman who had requested him to take up his pen for his elegant translation of nina inscribed to the honorable mr hobart he replied sir the favor was very trifling for excepting the sonnet it employed me only just six hours  when a child at the kings school at canterbury his mother used to rise at six oclock in summer to walk with him out of the city for country air one morning about seven oclock passing by the city wall a woman with a child sat begging as mrs berkeley never gave to trampers she told the woman she could not relieve her mr berkeley then little more than eight years old unobserved stayed behind talking to her when he joined his mother she began reproving him by saying it is very wrong to talk to such persons without one means to relieve them and that she was persuaded his yesterdays allowance was all gone to which he replied in his sweetly melodious voice why the poor woman said she had not ate a morsel today the church clock struck seven as he was speaking and i told her i had no money but asked her if some gingerbread nuts that i bought last night would be any comfort to her and her poor little child and she said yes so i stayed that i might get them all out of my pocket for her  his mothers eyes filled with tears of gratitude to god for having blessed her child with such an heart and she has frequently declared that had she been offered fifty thousand pounds not to have heard that early ebullition of that through life lovely heart she would have rejected it the same sweet spirit attended him amidst all his torturing illness not many days before his death a poor family in distress being named he turned on the sofa on which he was lying and not finding in his pocket what he thought sufficient to send them eagerly desired his servant might be called to take his keys to get him some more money to send to them and when his mother assured him that they had been already relieved by his father and aunt he replied that a little more would comfort them  when mr berkeley was between ten and eleven years old a melancholy affair happened at canterbury one of those unfortunate orphans who are said to be happy in having careful guardians had in the summer vacation stepped over from london to paris had there spent more than his scanty allowance had repeatedly applied to his careful guardians one i think his maternal uncle for a little of his own money his humble suit was rejected he however reached dover without a guinea he again applied but in vain utterly unable to reach london this unfortunate youth not yet nineteen sallied forth on the high road between dover and canterbury he unfortunately met with an amiable farmer and his compassionate carasposa in what is called an hurdygurdy from the former he took a silverpewter watch with a greasy leather chain and a foxs head set in brass from the other about seventeen shillings this worthy pair drove with all speed to raise an hue and cry after their foot highwayman the poor youth returned to the alehouse whence he sallied out borrowed a petticoat of the maid servant got a cork blacked his face and escaped into a wood where he was taken and in this wretched disguise brought to canterbury the news of so extraordinary a figure was soon spread the children belonging to the kings school went beyond their bounds to see him mr berkeley soon returned and told his mother the lamentable tale she of course moralized on the subject soon a violent noise was heard mr berkeley started to the window then sitting down exclaimed good god how can our boys be such brutes and looked as pale as death his mother who is shortsighted asked him what it was he replied the justices are sitting and this poor creature is going to be examined and our boys are hallooing after him as if he were a mad dog it being one of those days on which the school hours permit the gentlemens sons who board at home to dine with their families mrs berkeley observed that her son did not eat at all but leaned back in his chair she enquired if he was ill he replied no what ails you then that you do not eat eat your dinner i desire you he replied  i cannot eat a morsel for thinking of this poor creature just gone to st dunstans gaol at his examination several questions were asked him the answering of which tended to his crimination dr berkeley who although in the commission for kent berks and middlesex never acted called out aloud young man do not answer any question that is asked you thank god the laws of england do not oblige any man to accuse himself the youth took his advice the farmer and his odious dame swore so readily and so positively through every thing that he was committed and took his trial at maidstone and was transported for three years he lived however to return and enjoy a good fortune and no doubt thank his careful guardians  he accordingly went without his dinner the next day when he came in from school at twelve oclock he repaired as usual to his mothers dressing room he gently approached his mother and began as follows my dear mamma i am sure i should be very sorry to ask you to do any thing improper for a lady to do but could there be any impropriety in your ordering john the very worthy mr wrightson now master of the workhouse at canterbury who lived with dr berkeley near thirty years and married from his service was in the house when mr berkeley was born he ever took the most tender judicious and respectful care of him in infancy and youth a very ludicrous little anecdote might be repeated of mr wrightsons bargaining with a bargeman to buy mr berkeley then six years old which entirely cured mr berkeley of a most dangerous trick of which had mr wrightson told his mother the little man would have received a heavy chastisement indeed to carry that poor young man a few bottles of wine to the gaol for my heart bleeds for him and i have not money enough to buy him wine his mother told him she would mention it at dinner to his father who she was very certain would give orders concerning it perhaps the poor young man owed the preservation of his life to dr berkeleys philanthropy  at the age of twelve he lost his only brother near four years younger than himself of whom he was most passionately fond and whose death he ever lamented till he was going to rejoin him in the realms of bliss as children this was remarkable the exquisite beauty of his brother attracted the eyes of all beholders drew persons to their doors and windows to look at him which so entirely void of envy was mr berkeley through life that he used to come home in extacies telling his mother how every body admired his brothers beauty when he was about six years old a lady meeting him one day who admired him much asked him if his little brother was like him he instantly replied o dear madam not at all he is a vast deal handsomer than i am every body wonders at his beauty that meets him in the street when one was about eight the other rather more than four years old the celebrated george lord lyttelton staying some time on a visit at dr berkeleys said to a gentleman that he did really think that mind and person they were the very finest children he had ever seen during the course of his life  the death of mr berkeleys younger brother caused by a dreadful fever which raged at that time in canterbury occasioned his being removed to eton school some months sooner than was intended by his father but his mother trembling for her darling the moment the physician pronounced his brothers fever infectious begged he might be sent away immediately which he was within the hour under the care of a faithful tender servant who lived at his fathers family at the time of his birth and until within about four years of mr berkeleys death when he married for this worthy man mr berkeley ever retained the most grateful regard and affection as did his parents for his constant unwearied attention paid by him to the health the manners the morals of their evertobelamented son to this worthy persons care was he constantly confided from the time that he began to run alone until after he quitted eton school and had a servant of his own mr berkeley used frequently to say it is not easy to express the gratitude i feel toward john for his wonderfully judicious method of managing such a refractory chap as i was especially when i was from home and he had not my mother to call in to his aid  mr berkeley with perhaps as amiable as lovely a nature as ever god bestowed on any fallen child of adam had a very high spirit and a very uncommonly wilful temper mr wrightson by civility gentleness and ridicule as a child and youth could prevail on mr berkeley to give up any project to do any thing mr berkeley had a very affectionate regard for him and when visiting at his fathers from oxford or the temple if it were but from saturday to monday he used constantly to say i must go and sit half an hour with my old friend john in his pantry and talk over old times or he will think me unkind adding i am sure i owe it to him for the judicious care he took of me in childhood and youth  mr berkeleys behavior to servants as servants was from early youth very remarkably kind and he never had any servant who would not have risqued almost every thing to serve and oblige him excepting one italian whom he took for a few weeks after an old servant of his married this execrable villain threatened to murder him for having ordered him to go a journey on the top of a stagecoach mr berkeley having a friend in the postchaise with him such are foreign servants more frequently than is imagined by the wise persons who confide in them in preference to their own countrymen who are seldom tempted to rob or murder a master having no foreign tongue to secure them a safe retreat on the continent  mr berkeleys tutor at eton was as mentioned above the learned and respectable dr norbury under whose tuition he had been placed by his father at the earnest request of his mother who knew his merits as a tutor having resided at windsor four years before her marriage and conceived him particularly calculated to direct such a spirit as her darling son the event proved that she was not mistaken for volatile and idle as mr berkeley was it is certain dr norbury contrived to make him apply more than ever any one before had done excepting his mother who often regretted that finding what cast of genius her eldest son had she had not set about learning latin and greek that she might have made him apply more closely in his youth as a proof of mrs berkeleys inflexible steadiness in teaching her son and correcting his perverseness of temper she once made him say the word nicodemus thirty times when he was about five years old which he either could not or would not pronounce properly when grown up he used to say oh my dear mother it was would not for it was one of my numerous trials of skill with you adding but you were very wise to do it or god knows what must have become of me  dr berkeleys grand object was to see his son as great a scholar as his father bishop berkeley never having been at any school himself but coming immediately from the palace of cloyne to christ church in oxford he had conceived that eton collegers if they had talents must necessarily be excellent scholars and after his son had been a considerable time at eton boarding at the house of the worthy mrs tyrrell and her truly amiable niece mrs brookland whom mr berkeley through his life termed that angelictempered woman he dutifully submitted to go into the long chamber to the extreme affliction of his mother who conjured his father with many tears not to remove him but he consulted and followed the advice of the then provost of eton dr barnard although he had by his accomplished worthy friend the late dr sumner of harrow been cautioned against his wiles in these remarkable words never trust that man he has a black heart i had myself been head master of eton my friends in power having secured it for me but on my asking if dr barnard was to be provost and being answered in the affirmative i for that sole reason begged to decline it the subsequent conduct of dr barnard fully justified the truth of the character dr sumner had given of him could any man but dr barnard have treated the first school in england over which he had so long presided and which he had upon the whole upon the whole so well for certainly in some instances he was tyrannical even cruel which the following wellknown fact must prove to all impartial persons the late general brudenell deputy governor of windsor castle being with his regiment in germany one day as his lady was sitting at dinner her son from eton came in she naturally enquired what could bring him up at that hour on a whole school day the youth aged between thirteen and fourteen replied why i am expelled mrs brudenell the knife and fork dropping from her hand exclaimed good god child what have you done have you killed a boy no i have done nothing but called my dames upper maid a thief that is impossible child you must have done something worse than that or i am sure dr barnard would not have expelled you the boy related the whole transaction which appeared to her so utterly incredible that she instantly sent a servant to request a gentleman of large fortune her near neighbor to call on her immediately when the youth related to him the following facts as they proved to be that having lost his dictionary he borrowed one for two or three days of some boys but finding that inconvenient he and two of his friends went to the secondhand booksellers in eton to try to buy one a dictionary was immediately produced when one of his friends said it is exactly like your own the other said i verily believe it is your own young brudenell asked of whom he bought it the man without hesitation said of dame s upper maid she told me a boy who had left school had given it to her on a close inspection there appeared a paper pasted over the inside of the cover this being removed master brudenells name and the date of the year when it was bought at mr potes appeared they carried it off and as soon as they arrived there showed it to the rest of the boys of the house who unanimously agreed to interrogate the woman how it came into her possession she colored and replied that she picked it up in their gateway they asked her if she could not read writing she said no this they knew to be false but one of the larger boys said you must naturally have supposed that it belonged to some of us and you are a thief so they agreed to call her thief for a week this so exasperated her that she complained to her mistress who instantly showed brudenell up to dr barnard the boy refused to be flogged until dr barnard had heard his case and if he did not find it true he would suffer any thing he pleased to inflict this he utterly refused and instantly expelled him the gentleman immediately went down to eton and on examination every tittle of brudenells account appeared to be literally true but dr barnard positively refused to readmit him  dr barnard showed of what materials his heart was composed by his  conduct to several amiable worthy young ladies in the neighborhood  so well governed with such marked contempt as he did by not suffering his son to be educated at that school but keeping him at home in his own house and introducing some person to teach him there never permitting him to associate or play with the fine youths of the school a few insignicant boys were now and then introduced to play with master barnard could five hundred youths and boys some of them sons of the first noblesse of these three kingdoms others sons of the first scholars in those kingdoms degenerate in a few days after the famous dr barnard ceased to govern them that he could prefer all the uncomfortable inconveniences of an homeeducation for his only child had dr barnard been removed to the provostship of kings college something might have been offered in excuse for this cruel conduct to the new master a man of profound erudition and before he became master he was well known to the writer before he became master she meeting him often at the house of her learned sensible thoroughly agreeable lively friend the late h b buckeridge esquire where some of the most joyous evenings  mornings of her life alas for poor mr buckeridge  were what as with every body lateearly hours sadly injured in company with many amiable old friends and neighbors now no more it used to be said that the party would last a week round but for the agreeable amiable dr bostock father of sir c rich and the writer who jointly agreed that they could not live without sleep  of amiable disposition and gentle manners but dr barnard the world at that time said meant to have a foil as he never could show his wit without a but which occasioned his bringing in that poor weak creature teddy betham fellow of eton  mr berkeley being ever a most obedient son went into college but he soon found very different treatment from what he had a right to expect from some of those in power dr barnard promised dr berkeley that he would send for him frequently and pay every attention to the grandson of the great bishop berkeley mr berkeley never entered the provosts house after he became  a poor colleger the style of dr barnard for the younger sons of many gentlemen of good family  his father in order to remedy the evil permitted him to spend two hundred pounds a year during the whole time he remained in the college  it was evident that mr berkeley never escaped punishment when it could at any rate be contrived to inflict it and as a colleger he became more liable to it his father learning this from other young men as well as from his son offered to take him from college but with that fortitude which attended him through life through his torturing illness for the last three years of it to his latest breath he declined it saying it was but for a few years however when he was a little turned of sixteen his father instead of letting him remain until nineteen which was his original intention took him home to his house at cookham determining to become his tutor for two years until he went to oxford whither he intended to remove his family during mr berkeleys sejour at that university and the refusal of a house in st giless was secured to dr berkeley which was occupied by the very sensible r harcourt esquire for the same wise and kind purpose and it happily succeeded  on mr berkeleys quitting school in order to atone for the want of cricket at dear eton mr berkeley had a fine hunter kept for him by his father and he generally hunted twice a week with the buck hounds mr berkeley rode remarkably well  the village and neighborhood of cookham it should be observed though a very fluctuating one happened very lukily for mr berkeley just at that time to abound with sensible cultivated polished families had his parents selected them they could not have done it more in general to their wish these families viz the polite lord conynghams the learned accomplished daniel malthuss esquire the very sensible thomas forsters esquire thomas parrys esquire and those of two very sensible ladies in two small houses lived in the strictest harmony perpetually meeting at each others houses which occasioned mr berkeleys mother one day to ask where is our next parish meeting to be held and they ever after retained the name in the summer parties on the water to different parts of the banks of that beautiful river the thames in the winter evenings music little dances and that most amusing of all round games pope joan  to the above may be added the large and agreeable society at taplow the politest of men lord inchiquin and the honorable reverend sensible and truly worthy mr hamilton with his agreeable family the sensible and worthy relict of general leighton with her accomplished daughters it will naturally be supposed that mr berkeley could not quit such very agreeable society without a pang the farewell to the banks of the thames was written about this time  especially when part of it was composed of more than half a score such young ladies of whom it may without flattery or compliment be asserted were very rarely to be met with even then and mr berkeley was ever a much greater admirer of a sensible accomplished than of a very beautiful woman insomuch that his beloved respected revered friend miss mlths mr berkeley wrote and printed but never published a most beautiful elegant elegy on the ever to be lamented death of that lovely allaccomplished angelic young lady which happened in the summer of the year       used laughingly to tell him that he really did not know a beautiful woman from a plain one so that it became a kind of cant expression amongst his young friends if any sensible plain young woman was named that she was one of berkeleys beauties  but to return when the time of mr berkeleys departure drew near he very humbly and sensibly requested his father to permit him to pass three years at the university of st andrew in scotland by which time to use his own words all my dear idle eton friends will have quitted oxford and i shall not be tempted to go out twice a week with lord abingdons hounds  when mr berkeley took his last farewell of his amiable friends at the ferryhouse he could not articulate went out mounted his horse and followed the carriage over the ferry it was a long and not a very pleasant journey to quit a beautiful native country to adopt the language of the poet speaking of the soul entering the world of spirits  to go to be she knows not what she knows not where   his parents accompanied him to the land of kind hospitality as it must ever be termed by the writer of this preface where mr berkeley passed three years and an half most happily where he formed a friendship with some of the first characters in that kingdom with many persons of rank and also amongst the literati which ended but with his life mr berkeley had the honor the happiness to be enfant de famille at melvil house and he with heartfelt gratitude termed the exquisitely pious earl and countess of leven his scottish parents the goodness of that illustrious pair not only invited him to visit there for weeks himself but also to carry any english or scotch student he pleased with him mr berkeley was too judicious and too wellbred to make an improper use of this condescending goodness having never introduced any but two or three englishmen sons of men of rank or fashion constantly saying lord leven must know the characters of the fathers of young scottish gentlemen too well for me to introduce them with what delight would he often talk of the happy hours spent at melvil house and his gratitude to his honored friend for inviting him attend him to edinburgh when his lordship was appointed by his majesty lord high commissioner of scotland as also one of his introducedfriends the son of an english peer and his lordships giving express orders that mr berkeley should never dine any one day at the purse bearers table but always at the commissioners it is impossible to dismiss this article without attempting to celebrate the wonderful condescending amiability of the noblesse of scotland particularly and in common with the ancient gentry of that kingdom to strangers of any degree of fashion and decent character it was a common remark of dr berkeley were a scotch gentleman to settle for some time in any southern or eastern county of england i wonder how many peers or men who in fortune equal peers would visit him and almost every peer and man of fortune in fife have done us that honor which must ever be remembered with the most heartfelt gratitude by the writer of this preface oh shame to our english pride used to exclaim dr berkeley although born in london he spent the first eighteen years of his life under the roof of his noble illustriousminded father in the next hospitable country in europe to scotland for the scotch do certainly exceed even the irish as mrs wedderburn used to say to the writer of these pages the irish give you an excellent dinner and supper and let you go out to seek a bed we always find one the remark was just and worthy the great good sense of that thoroughly hospitable polite lady who having heard that dr berkeleys family none of whom she had ever then seen were traveling near her house immediately ordered her beds to be prepared and most politely visited them at their inn telling them that every thing was ready for their reception this and numberless other almost similar attentions from numerous other families of rank and fashion has for the last fifteen years caused the writer of this to term scotland the land of polite kind hospitality such may it long continue and they meet a more grateful return than they often do when they visit england than did the amiable   of scotland from the  of  who went in and hid himself when he saw the equipage of his noble host in his park  one is tempted to wonder that he ever could emerge from his hiding place one of the amiable sons of lord leven coming from abroad went to an inn at canterbury before he went to dr berkeleys he reproached him on mr leslies saying he feared being troublesome dr berkeley replied my dear sir if a dog came hither with a collar on his neck from melvil house i should feel myself a monster not to entertain him  mr monck berkeley used often to be accused of partiality to scotland and to his scottish friends indeed he had one of the most amiable hearts that ever beat in a human breast it must have been a very cold heart that had not felt such amiable such respectful attentions as mr berkeley received in his seven hundred miles tour through the unfrequented parts of the highlands which was chiefly performed on foot although mr berkeley had three horses and two servants but he often went where they could not follow him and at edinburgh where he generally passed the first part of the st andrews vacation until the grouse shooting season commenced although greatly his superiors in learning mr berkeley had the honor to rank amongst his literary friends lord buchan the profoundly learned highly polished allaccomplished lord monboddo mr mkenzie and dr reid it is hoped that the introducing here a bon mot of mr berkeleys may be pardoned lord monboddo when visiting dr berkeley at st andrews with his usual exquisite politeness pressed the doctor and his family to visit him at monboddo and invited mr berkeley to pass the next vacation there mrs berkeley said to her son surely you will go it will be a wonderful advantage to you to pass so many weeks under the roof of such a man as lord monboddo mrs george berkeley from its first publication was an enthusiastic admirer of lord monboddos ancient metaphysics so as to occasion mr monck berkeleys always styling it his mothers second bible the first volume then only published lord monboddo did mrs berkeley the honor to send her the second saying he found she understood it with a note by the hand of the very deeply learned worthy professor hunter a very sincerely highly respected friend of mr monck berkeley one of the most striking likenesses ever produced by the pencil is a portrait of this wonderful genius now in the possession of mrs george berkeley in his robes of a thoroughly upright just judge it instantly on entering the room catches the eye of every stranger who has any skill in painting and very often of those who are honest enough to declare they have not any skill  mr berkeley replied my dear madam i am convinced that if i do go i shall return home the best greek scholar in the university but i have great doubts whether my heart may not be more injured than my head benefited alluding to that loveliest of women miss burnett his lordships truly angelic darling daughter no longer an inhabitant of this sublunary world but gone to join her kindred spirits that lovely young lady can be only a very little more angelic in mind than when on earth shakspeares beautiful distich on a young woman in a country churchyard in gloucestershire might have been inscribed on the monument of eliza burnett rather than on that of eleanor freeman rest here blessed maid and wait the almightys will then rise unchanged and be an angel still   perhaps very few females in any age or country have united so much beauty good sense and amiableness of disposition and have borne their faculties so meekly as the lovely miss burnett she possessed all her honorable fathers great superiority of understanding and all the refined delicacy and genuine humility of her very lovely mother she saw she could not but see herself the idol of all the young men yet not one air of superiority not a grain of affectation ever appeared in her conduct a variety of diverting little anecdotes of the universal desire of the young gentlemen students of st andrews to appear agreeable at least not disagreeable to miss burnett might be related by the writer to the amusement of the reader  d m esquire one of those few laymen as dr berkeley used to observe who kept up their classical learning after they had quitted the university for he generally read greek from four to six hours every day was a great admirer of the rising genius of mr berkeley insomuch that he became sincerely attached to him and mr berkeley ever retained a most affectionate grateful regard for this gentlemans condescension as he termed it in suffering a youth from school to enjoy so much of his society who had children elder than mr berkeley  as the families lived in the greatest intimacy in the happiest friendship they generally met three or four times a week one evening at dr berkeleys the barenness of newspapers was as was then usual i think everywhere lamented nothing worth reading in them mr berkeley reached out his arm and taking dr berkeleys constant paper the st jamess chronicle ran his eye over it and said i think there is something in this today and began reading something which lasted about ten minutes that every body agreed was worth reading at night mr m desired permission to take it home saying he would return it in the morning the next day at noon he brought it to dr berkeleys telling him that he believed he had taken the wrong paper for he could not find what mr berkeley read the evening before mrs berkeley showed him all the last papers but in vain at dinner mrs berkeley asked her son out of what paper he had read the evening before not out of the st jamess chronicle for that mr m and she had been searching several of them and could not find it mr berkeley replied my dear madam i never doubted of yours or mr ms cleverness but you must both be much cleverer than i take either of you to be if you could have found it why should we not find it because it was not to be found where is it then tell mr m that he may read it alas i cannot for it never was any where but in your sons brain what do you mean child i do not understand you why my dear madam when i hear people finding such fault with the poor newspapers i often take them up and help them out as i did last night i have done it scores of times before for my father and aunt who only skim a newspaper you know they say you study it  it must however be observed in order to do justice to mr berkeleys gratitude for the numberless polite amiable friendly attentions received from every rank in that land of kind hospitality during his three years and a half sejour there that he was almost brokenhearted at quitting it and twice after revisited it and would have continued to do so had his life been spared dr berkeley being at that time in an indifferent state of health the journey was about six weeks in performing as he rested some time at york where mr berkeley had what he ever esteemed an honor young as he was of commencing an acquaintance with the truly learned and pious dr burgh by the polite attentions of his mothers respected friends mrs moritts every person of any fashion who visits york endeavors to obtain an introduction to those sensible cultivated ladies the many only to gratify their eyes with a sight of the exquisitely fine paintings in needle work of the eldest mrs morritt those who are capable of relishing refined conversation to feast their minds the house of those excellent ladies being the general rendezvous of every one who can relish the charms of refined conversation mr berkeley lamented that his living idol as gray was his dead one amongst poets mr mason was absent from york at that time  whose beautifully adorned house is admired by all persons who have any skill in painting by the very polite attentions of the dean of york his lady and several other families of fashion which were ever most gratefully remembered mr berkeley and the family passed their time most agreeably in that ancient city to which the library of the very civil mr todd contributed in no small degree one of the delights of mr berkeleys life being to read in a library a happiness he enjoyed in his fathers house bishop berkeleys library being valued at two thousand pounds at the time of his death dr berkeley being indisposed rested some time at newcastle  in their road to edinburgh they passed through the town of lauder a very little way out of the town stands lauder castle one of the seats of the late worthy earl of lauderdale as the horses were to bait at least two hours mr berkeley after dinner went down to the castle the family being absent he requested the porter to permit him to enter and look at the pictures he had from his childhood a wonderfully fine eye for painting it is probable he owed it to the so often hearing the merits and demerits of his grandfathers collection of pictures talked over the man who was a tailor and hard at work said he would call his gewd weef to show him the castle  it is hoped the reader will pardon the introducing a dialogue between the gewd weef and mr berkeley  gewd weef  pray laddie whence come ye and whither gang ye that ye be come to lauder  mr berkeley  i came from england and i am going to st andrews  g w  belike ye come from london  mr b  i came from within about twenty miles of it  g w  were ye ever at the greet toon  mr b  yes very often  g w  then ye can tell me what they pay

that is but little i have been told it is always nine pence  during this dialogue a young woman entered with her hair curled and powdered mr berkeley had asked the gewd weef how many miles it was to st andrews she replied to that as to almost every thing donaken on the appearance of the young woman she said if you ask this lassey she can tell you she knows muckle things mr berkeley taking off his hat made the enquiry and was very civilly informed the young woman having dispatched her business with the tailor went away and the dialogue recommenced  gewd weef  i suppose you ll gang home this way from st anders hoo long shall ye tarry there  mr berkeley  about three years if it please god i live so long  g w  three years for what can ye stay there three years it may not be amiss to remark here that every scotsman thinks it incumbent on him to visit st andrews once in his life and take a view of the beautiful ruins of the finest christian temple perhaps ever built by man during dr berkeleys residence there one party arrived so late that they only saw it by the light of an old horn lantern but they would say they saw it   mr b  to study at the university there  g w  aye laddie ye ha studied enough ye seem to ken a vast deal of pictures and other larning no no ye had better tarry here and marry yon lassey she has houses two and parks the scots call fields parks and a wood a policy

marry and settle  g w  and where be they  mr b  at the inn in the town  g w  aye there is two pretty lasseys at the inn they ll haa muckle siller an aye take one of them  at that instant a coach and four drove down when the gewd weef exclaimed what haa we got coming here  mr b  the carriage in which i came from england  g w  ye come from england in that anacarriage and wha came we ye  mr b  why my father and my mother and my mothers maid  g w  aye laddie laddie if you came in that anacoach ye ll not marry oone of oor lasseys what muckle siller it must haa cost your father to bring ye aa ie all done here  mr berkeley then took his leave of the gewd weef presenting her with a bright half crown with which she was much delighted and wished him a fine laady when he married  about three years after mr berkeley accompanied his worthy friend henry grimston esquire to the famous contested election for yorkshire mr grimston going up from st andrews to assist in supporting the interests of his godfather and friend  duncombe esquire they returned by lauder when they together with their learned lively tutor mr bruce whom they agreed to treat with a sight of york visited the castle mr grimston archly asked the gewd weef if she had ever seen that gentleman before pointing to mr berkeley when she exclaimed aye that i have and he gave me half a croon mr berkeley at his second visit doubled the bounty and used frequently to laugh with his friends and say that he had never met with such a friend since for that she endeavored according to her idea to procure him a wife with a large fortune soon after his first visit to the castle he made a song entitled the lass of lauder and had it set to music by mr jenkins the musicmaster at st andrews but now a teacher of that science in london mr berkeley used jocularly to remark it is very certain that i had not made so favorable an impression on the lassey as i had on the gewd weef at lauder for she stayed only to settle her business with the tailor and then went off some years after mr berkeley being on a visit at petenweem and going with his friend to drink tea at a gentlemans house was asked if he had not once been at lauder castle he replied i have been twice there the female who asked the question said i had the honor of seeing you there sir and i should esteem it an honor if you would drink tea with me during your stay here mr berkeley instantly recollected that it was the lass of lauder who did not then know that she had been celebrated in song mr berkeley was to have left petenweem the next day but with his wonted amiability postponed it until the day following that he might visit the lass who was then married to the reliefminister the reliefminister is one chosen by the people of any place where they do not happen to approve the established kirkminister there are few towns or even villages without one mr berkeley and several other gentlemen now living were present when one of these good men asserted that if zaccheus the publican had been blessed with true faaithe he had not fallen from the tree into which he had climbed to see our blessed lord pass by all the company exclaimed that the good little publican did not fall from the tree but gladly came down to prepare to receive his heavenly guest the producing the book of god and turning to the chapter very hardly convinced this reliefminister that he did not fall for want of true faaithe of that place several families were invited to meet him and a very gay afternoon was spent mr berkeley telling mrs  that she had made a better match for herself than the gewd weef at lauder castle wished to have made for her mr berkeley who had neither vanity nor conceit here exceeded the truth dr l a friend of his father and the worthy sir c b a very old friend of his mother both urged him seriously to visit them to see after two young ladies of immense fortunes in their respective counties assuring him that he must infallibly succeed mr berkeleys uniform reply to all such kind invitations was i early resolved not to be a fortunehunter i have no large rentroll to produce i will never alarm or distress the anxious parents of any great fortunes  mr berkeley from his youth from his mother was an hereditary admirer and strenuous advocate for the unfortunate injured mary and a detester of her cunning cruel persecutor elizabeth requested his father to go to st andrews by the road of kinross that he might visit the castle of lochleven and he spent some time in wandering about the ruins so much as occasioned his and his servants being benighted on a heath to the extreme distress of his mother who was then unacquainted with the exquisite the amiable hospitality of the scottish nation high and low rich and poor for mr berkeley could with difficulty force a shilling into the hand of a man who went a quarter of a mile over the heath to put him in the road to cuparinfife where his family were to sleep that night and it was very late before he and his servant arrived there  the next morning they all set out for st andrews about eight miles distant and enjoyed the prospect from the top of the hill of the still magnificent cathedral and the tower of st regulus or st rule of which there are four beautiful engravings with cardinal bethunes castle by oliphant now exceedingly scarce and very dear the plates being lost it is supposed that when that ingenious young man died the plates were sold amongst other metal things for their weight   on entering the city at the argyle port your eye is greeted with a noble wide street one mile in length and at the lower end of a noble breadth with stone houses most of them disfigured by what is termed a fore stair that is an open stair case on the outside in a zigzag manner across the front of the house and an huge smidie a not inelegant name for a filthy thing a dunghill no court no palisade no breastwall or railing before even the best houses excepting only what was once the palace of james the first of england but it is not meant here to give an imperfect description of this once beautiful magnificent city which has been so well done by boswell and pennant before john knox preached it into ruins by removing an archbishop dean and eight resident prebendaries who fed the hungry clothed the naked and administered to the wants of the sick and needy who are all now starving on a full sight of this dreary deserted city mr berkeley wept to think that he was to remain if god spared his life three long years in it the house taken for dr berkeleys family the best then to be had in the town was without even a back door the covetous wretch who owned it having sold a little spot behind it to a gentleman at the next house so the door was stopped up dr berkeley seeing mr berkeley so deeply affected and principal watson whose learning had induced him to prefer st andrews to a foreign university having died a very few days before made mr berkeley the offer of returning to england the next day for which he felt great gratitude but with his wonted strength of mind declared that let him suffer what he might he would remain his three years it is but justice to say that mr berkeley shed more tears at leaving st andrews than he drew sighs at entering it  so deeply was submission to lawful authority engraven on mr berkeleys mind that during the three years and a half he was a student at the university of st andrew he never would go out for even two or three nights to his noble truly amiable friend the earl of levens at melvil house without going to ask leave out as it is termed of the principal dr mcormick whom mr berkeley always called our polite amiable principal or in his absence of the professor who used politely to say that he living in his fathers house it was needless to trouble himself his constant reply was that the statutes which he had promised to observe enjoined it  it is hoped that the relation of a little adventure which mr berkeley met with during his residence at st andrews may be pardoned a very few days before the term began in autumn mr berkeley who was at that time a very keen sportsman was told by the son of the professor of medicine a very sensible young man now settled in canada that if he wished it he could lead him to a place where ptermagants abounded the youths set out marched several miles night overtook them and they wandered in a very dark evening unable to find the road at length the moon began to appear and presented to their view a figure all in white mr berkeley soon learnt to speak scotch so perfectly as at any time throughout his life to be mistaken whenever he wished it for a true scot which often amused his friends or strangers of that country which his mother ever termed  the land of kind hospitality a proof whereof will soon appear  mr berkeley accosted the young woman with lassey whither gang ye  lassey  to yonder house laddie  mr b  can we get lodging there to night  lassey  hoo can ye ask that question with these weapons in your hands they must lodge ye  mr b  god forbid that we should attempt to force any one to lodge us and to convince you how harmless we are i will instantly discharge my piece  mr berkeley immediately fired off a fine doublebarreled gun and requested his friend to follow his example they then escorted the nymph about a quarter of a mile to the house where mr berkeley refused to enter until permission was obtained by their kind guide who went in alone in a minute out rushed a bevey of fair nymphs more than twenty with a matron in the rear who very wisely began examining them how they came on that wild heath at that hour who and what they were mr berkeley being spokesman assured them that they were honest young men students of st andrews still they were distrusted  at length fortunately for them a young woman espied a youth in the highland dress and going up to him asked who he was  servant  who why i am servant to that tall gentleman  young woman  and who is he  servant  who why mr berkeley secondary at st andrews  young woman  where does he come from to keep a servant at college  servant  why from england  young woman  from what part of england  servant  why from canterbury my masters father is one of the prebendaries there and is a gentleman of great family  mr berkeley used to laugh when relating this conversation and say all mnicolls account of my fathers dignity in the church availed me no more than they will do in the world of spirits but luckily some one asked mr berkeleys highlander who was his masters companion to which he being irritated replied what does that signify he is son to dr flint of st andrews the magical name of flint as mr berkeley used to say acted like a charm dr flint is a most incomparable physician mr flint was immediately examined and cross examined and it was determined to admit them they delivering up their guns to the nymphs mr berkeley with his usual elegant gallantry instantly delivered his into the hands of their kind guide they then went into the house being almost starved with cold and sadly tired plenty of food and a good fire soon reanimated them still they saw nothing but females all clothed in white no male appeared the men were attending the corn at length they all agreed that it was time to set off  melancholy news as mr berkeley used to say to a couple of young men whither were they to go could not the beaux escort them they replied to a neighboring harvesthome to a dance mr berkeley who was a remarkably fine dancer and loved it exceedingly jumped up forgot all the fatigues of the day and said that he and his friend would attend them their hospitable and very sensible hostess replied oh sir it is not such a ball as you have been used to in england there will be only farmers daughters i will have the pleasure of endeavoring to entertain you and mr flint here mr berkeley with his usual engaging politeness said there will be your daughters madam and our kind conductress to your hospitable roof the young men went and danced in the barn till four in the morning slept soundly as may be guessed until near noon took an excellent scotch breakfast even dr johnson liked the breakfasts in scotland and after inviting his kind hostess and her son to dine at his fathers house in st andrews when either business or pleasure called them to that ancient city took their leave the young man went once or twice to dr berkeleys mr berkeley who was born with what is commonly but often falsely called a princely spirit although not to a princely fortune did not think a few grateful speeches an adequate return for being rescued from sleeping among the heather on the heath but sent his worthy landlady some fine prints elegantly framed and glazed to adorn her parlour with which he had great pleasure in finding she was much delighted some of mr berkeleys intimates among the students laughed at him saying now berkeley you have lain out a night without leave  the great charles leslie the famous controversial writer used to say of mr berkeleys maternal greatgrandfather the celebrated francis cherry esquire of shottesbrooke house in berkshire that he believed him to have the most accurate the soundest judgment that god had in these latter days bestowed on man a multitude of instances might be adduced to prove that although mr berkeley inherited but little of mr cherrys immense fortune he certainly did of a better portion than money  mr berkeley on his return from his highland tour told his family that he might he believed have lived seven years there on the merits of the ring sent by the old chevalier de st george to mr cherry when he sent mr leslie at his own expense to rome to try to convert him from popery mr leslie wrote mr cherry word from rome that an attempt to make the sun rise in the west would be equally successful  mr berkeley said he felt a little ashamed that the ring should be so well known in the highlands and that he the presumptive heir to it had never seen it more than once or twice in his life he requested his mother and aunt to gratify him with a sight of it that he might be able in future to give a better account of the famous relic  it has been already observed see before p xix  that one of mr berkeleys friends used to tell him that he was as extraordinarily descended by his mothers side william cherry esquire known by the name of the great lawyer son of sir francis cherry esteemed the acutest counselor of his time as the learned earl of clarendon bears testimony in his papers and letters published by powney about thirty years ago in one of the letters he says i have had the opinion of the attorney and solicitor general on my cause but i cannot rest satisfied till i hear what old cherry says about it mr cherry was at law with king james when he fled a considerable part of shottesbrooke estate lies in windsor forest mr cherry had planted some young trees and was enclosing them the king rode by and asked the labourer who bid him do it he answered my master please your majesty it does not please me replied the king and i order you to throw up the enclosure directly he did so mr cherrys old steward informed his master immediately of it who ordered that the same labourer should directly set about enclosing it again the next huntingmorning his majesty found him at work and asked how he dared to do what he had forbidden him to do he replied his master had ordered it the king commanded him to undo his work at his peril which the poor fellow did and mr cherry who when in the country acted as a justice of the peace committed him to reading gaol and commenced a suit against the king luckily for this poor man he could not only read but write being clerk of the parish of white waltham where and in many surrounding parishes mr cherry had large farms and always found and made his tenants find work for the industrious laborers when the poor innocent culprit reached the gaol he wrote a long and interesting letter to the king telling his majesty that as his good old master had now turned him off from his work for obeying him he hoped his majesty would be pleased in his consideration to send him some money to keep him comfortably in gaol and after much more curious matter subscribed himself his majestys poor pitiful patient lamentable servant john hone this letter reached the king about three weeks before he left the kingdom when mr cherry immediately liberated honest john and took care that he had every comfort during his imprisonment mr cherry having sent the man to gaol only to teach the monarch what he might not do mr berkeley had for some years been writing a treatise on the prerogatives of the crown and one volume was ready for the press at the time of his death how far he would have approved his ancestors conduct in this matter is uncertain this transaction is somewhat differently told in the old ballad of the king and mr cherry this gentleman was killed by the overturning of his chariot as he was going down a hill in kent near the seat of the grandfather of the late worthy sir sidney stafford smythe by whom and his lady every humane amiable attention was paid him that his desperate situation would admit of his death was the more to be lamented by his excellent son as on the coroners inquest it appeared to have happened through roguery the verdict being  killed by the footboard having been mended with old rusty nails on going down the hill the coachman of course pressing more on the footboard than on even ground it gave way and he fell down among the horses who immediately ran away in half a dozen different directions threw off the postillion and broke the chariot entirely to pieces when they stopped it was a quarter of an hour before mr cherrys valet de chamber who was attending his master on horseback could discover life either in his master mr partridge of the isle of ely to whom mr cherry was guardian or any of the servants the moment he found his master was not dead he rode off to town to carry down the queens serjeantsurgeon and sent off from london an express to mr cherry at shottesbrooke on the arrival of the surgeon he asked mr cherry where he felt pain he replied ah sir where do i not feel pain a piece of the plate glass of the chariot was taken out of his head as large as the palm of a mans hand mr cherry lived only four days after the accident the surgeon saying he is the noblest ruin i ever saw i never beheld such a man of eightythree but for this accident he would probably have attained to the age of old parr mr cherrys strength of body and mind were equal at eightythree to what they were at thirtythree this account of mr cherrys death and mr partridges almost miraculous escape is very differently and very erroneously related in a work printed about seventy years ago by a gentleman of fortune in devonshire mr cherrys ladys father john whitefield esquire of ives place near maidenhead was thrown from his horse and drowned in the thames when taking an airing one evening near his own house at an advanced age mr berkeleys mothers paternal grandfather was killed by a fall from his horse as he was riding one morning near his own house at the age of eightyone the lady of the celebrated francis cherry esquire the patron of thomas hearne one of his underfootmen was the eldest of the five coheiresses of john finch esquire of fienes court berks in the clothes of this gentleman was king charles the second dressed when he escaped with lady jane lane oh shame to royal gratitude that this lady was not made a duchess to descend to her heirs female as well as male he used to say that he had worn mr finchs old clothes mr finch having gone down a few weeks before to marry the beautiful rich heiress of sir john chapman aged fifteen an exquisitely fine very small miniature of this lady by pettitote is in the possession of mr monck berkeleys aunt mrs frinsham it having been presented to her by mr berkeleys mother at mrs berkeleys marriage  as he was nobly by his fathers most of his maternal grandsires having had something remarkable about them if mr berkeley had any pride when a man which had not been eradicated in his childhood by the incessant pains raken to eradicate it it was what is called i think very erroneously family pride for one certainly may feel grateful to god that ones father was not a tinker but a gentleman without despising those of very low extraction if they are not  beggars set on horseback riding to the  mr berkeley used to say  any monarch may make any man noble but he cannot bestow on him a long train of coronetted ancestors that belongs only to the king of kings who was as i think graciously pleased to cause me to be born the son of dr berkeley rather than the son of tom smith my fathers butcher  it is impossible for the writer of this preface not to pay a small tribute of gratitude to the memory of that uncommonly judicious amiable young gentleman the late meredith price junior esquire to whose wisdom prudence and humanity before either had completed his twentieth year mr berkeley owed that he was not either a murderer or murdered during their residence at the university of st andrews mr berkeley was one day attacked by mr g a student he was not a scotchman for an affront that he supposed mr berkeley had offered to the fame of a distillers daughter who resided near st andrews to whom or to whose fathers table mr g paid great attention mr berkeley defended himself by declaring that so far from speaking slightingly of the young woman he had never even thought slightingly of her mr g brutally said you say so because you are a coward and are afraid to fight this mr berkeley received very calmly replying g those who have known me through life will never say that of me when a youth it used to be said of mr berkeley he fears nothing but god and his own mother mr g then proceeded i may say whatever i please to you for you dare not challenge me through fear of your mothers displeasure she never would forgive you if you fought a duel this dastardly vautrien was mistaken for mrs berkeleys horror of those wretched parents who can cast off a child for any crime that fallen man or woman can commit the very idea of casting off or deserting any creature that one has been the means of bringing into this world  leaving them entirely to the air and the prince of the power of the air  is replete with horror that it is not like our heavenly father all must see and feel was so strong that from mr berkeleys age of fifteen his mother used frequently to say to him may god give you grace to grow up an excellent honest worthy young man but always remember that there is no crime you can commit that shall ever make me desert you and if you should become extravagant whilst ever i have a guinea you shall have eighteen shillings of it and i am sure whilst ever you have one you would give me twenty out of it mr g might with equal justice have added your father for dr berkeleys on the matter becoming public dr berkeley said to his son you ought to have cut the matter short by saying that let his father have gotten any sum by  it was certainly beneath your dignity as a gentleman to fight with the son of  and not have degraded yourself by sending a challenge to the son of g dr berkeley and his father the bishop both felt pleasure without pride in their very ancient noble descent horror of that barbarous custom of duelling was at least equal to mrs berkeleys although he might not perhaps so frequently descant upon the subject this last outrage was too much for mr berkeley it roused all the noble blood of the berkeleys in his veins he left the room went home immediately retired to his apartment wrote and sent the challenge his next care was to pitch upon a second he determined it should not be his dear friend mr l lest it should embroil him with his excellent noble father lord  that young gentleman used to say to dr berkeley i do not know how to forgive berkeleys not calling upon me on that occasion i who have received so many amiable kind attentions from him and his family mr berkeley went to a gentleman one of his companions at eton to whom he had been particularly attached from twelve years old and who had manifold more obligations than mr l he was many months an inmate at dr berkeleys on mr berkeleys requesting him to attend him the next morning he hummed a little while and at length stammered out that he was afraid whether or no his papa might approve of it so begged his dear berkeley would excuse him why his father should disapprove it puzzled all who knew his character it could not be on account of breaking gods holy law for mr  would become wretched if he supposed any body suspected him of believing in god indeed the conduct of this fine mr  toward his lady and children has evidently proved it the description of mr  in shire where his great estate lies is this the first time you are in company with him you are charmed the second you like him much less and the third you long to kick him out of the room  as he deserves mr berkeley resolved not to call on any friend english or scottish whose fortunes it might injure the certain consequence being expulsion from the university went to mr price who owed no obligation of any sort except permission to attend the service of the church of england at dr berkeleys private chapel and of course being sometimes invited to a dinner supper or dance in common with other english and scottish young gentlemen mr price instantly replied he was entirely at mr berkeleys service but hoped the matter might be accommodated without fighting mr berkeley assured him  that was impossible they therefore proceeded to the place where this wise young gentleman again urged the matter so sensibly so eloquently that mr g offered to make any submission that mr berkeley should require mr berkeley from his infancy although a little fury was surely the most ready to pardon of all the fallen children of adam insomuch that his mother used to say that if any one murdered him and he lived only three minutes he would freely forgive them constantly adding alas he does not inherit that from me mr berkeley however was so exasperated at the brutal rascality of i may say whatever i please for you dare not fight etc that for once he appeared inexorable the ground was measured the pistols were delivered and the swords laid ready when mr price instead of giving the word to fire stepped in between the combatants and so wisely so pathetically conjured mr berkeley to accept mr gs offers of making every submission that at length mr berkeley with his wonted sweetness threw away his pistol and said well g you shall beg my pardon in no other way than saying in mr prices presence before the gentlemen in whose company you insulted me that you are sorry you provoked me so this frightful affair ended but not the gratitude of mr berkeley and his parents providence had placed mr price in a situation to render other return than polite and friendly attentions out of the question when mr price went to france they felt unfeigned pleasure in giving him letters of introduction to several very worthy french families with whom they were intimate which rendered his sejour in that once delightful country very pleasant may that amiable young gentleman be now rejoicing in one still pleasanter  it may perhaps be asked by some with all these amiable qualities and great virtues had mr berkeley no vices alas yes mr berkeley fell as david fell there is no history through the whole bible that affords more diversion to the pert ignorant young sucking atheist than the lamentable fall of david but let such poor wits remember what god says to david by nathan because by this deed thou have given great occasion to the enemies of the lord to blaspheme etc god foresaw the wit of these geniuses but let them remember the title bestowed on them the enemies of the lord for the friends of  must ever feel for the subsequent sufferings of david through the whole remainder of his life his children guilty of incest murder horrid deceit and rebellion punished him even to his extreme old age  it is impossible here to avoid relating an anecdote of mr berkeleys celebrated learned grandfather  bishop berkeley walking down pall mall with his darling friend bishop benson whom he used to call titus the delight of human kind there rushed out of the star and garter four or five very witty bucks of that day one exclaimed a brace of bishops the bishops then wore purple coats let us put them up bishop benson being a much lighter man than bishop berkeley instantly ran off to the opposite side of the way the wits immediately made a circle and enclosed poor bishop berkeley whom they thus wittily accosted pray my lord what does your lordship think of king david david loved a pretty girl my lord gentlemen i think that king david was a very great sinner as you and i are but god gave him grace to repent of his sin as i sincerely hope he will to you and me they all slank off like pitiful fools excepting one who said i humbly heartily be your lordships pardon  the same very ready and pointed wit mr berkeley showed on a different occasion when introduced to the late lord mansfield by his lordships desire he eyed him about half a minute when mr berkeley expected him to say what many lords and learned men had often said to him that they were happy to see the grandson of their excellent old friend lord mansfield said to berkeley every virtue under heaven mr berkeley instantly replied how sweet an ovid was in murray lost lord mansfield said you are sir a very polite young gentleman indeed aye sir mr pope was very partial to me took berkeley under the arm and walked off with him all tunbridge talked of mr berkeleys ready wit some of mr berkeleys friends on hearing it said to him berkeley we are afraid the old prelate was a forestaller and has left none of these virtues to you    as solomon fell  but with them he received grace to repent and mercy to console his thoroughly humbled penitent contrite spirit mr berkeley had not sufficiently attended to that admonition of the wise king use not much the company of a woman that is a singer mr berkeleys enthusiastic love of music drew him into the snares of the celebrated mrs  his delight in real sterling wit caused him to fall into the deep ditch long digging for him by lady  from both it pleased the great mercy of god to rescue him for more than four years before his death his lovely spirit was supplicating for that pardon promised by our allgracious redeemer to all who turn to him in faith  him that comes unto me i will in no wise cast out mr berkeley reflecting on his thoroughly pious education and many other advantages considered himself as a much greater sinner than any of his young friends who had not been so favored by providence could possibly be but it pleased the god of mercy to speak peace to his wounded spirit i have heard thy prayer i have seen thy tears isaiah xxxviii   and for some weeks before his death to pour the balm of perfect peace into his dear wounded spirit and most graciously to lift up the light of his reconciled countenance upon him  mr berkeley had too strong an understanding not to believe with his whole heart and mind the truths the blessed truths revealed in the gospel of peace he was blessed with an honest mind as has been said of a very great man still living as much mr berkeleys superior in years as in rank his lordship is too honest to endeavor to warp the gospel to his life and he feels every day that they are at war which makes him so illtempered with a wonderfully amiable nature ever acting the kindest things ever speaking the roughest there mr berkeley resembled not the noble peer for he was never known from a child to say a disobliging thing to any one so attached to him was every servant he ever had from the age of seventeen as that to use a common phrase they would have gone through fire and water for him even the poor creature whom he took from his grace of bedford after his beloved scotch servant married  who now lives most happily with a much beloved honored and respected relation of mr berkeleys the polite the accomplished the learned sir francis lumm baronet for whose kind unwearied watchful attentions to mr berkeley from his first return to england mr berkeley his father and mother ever felt the survivor still feels the deepest gratitude  this poor creature one night robbed mr berkeley in the temple on his being pressed to appear against him he absolutely refused when strongly urged that it was right he replied it must be so to be sure to hang a poor devil who might have murdered me for we were in the chambers alone and he only took my watch and a few guineas no i hope he may live to repent poor creature i am sure i will never appear against him i wish i could appear for him  the present earl of e when a very young man was robbed on salisbury plain by the famous dumas afterward executed at oxford his lordship with the usual spirit of nineteen was resolved not to be robbed dumas demanded his watch and money out sprang his lordship down jumped dumas lord p as he then was attempted to fire his pistol would not go off he threw it down and had recourse to the second which likewise flashed in the pan dumas then said sir you are in my power you will be pleased to give me your watch and money the request was complied with in a short time dumas was taken committed to fisherton gaol and tried lord p was subpoenaed to appear his lordships purse was produced he said he could not say that was his purse then the watch his lordship could not say the watch was his the seals arms crest etc were produced but his lordship said it was impossible for him to swear to them on being asked by his friends when he came out of court if he had lost his wits not to know his own arms crest etc he nobly replied know them to be sure i do but do you think i would take away the life of a poor distressed creature who had my life in his power and would not hurt a hair of my head it was immediately said that lord p was become a methodist  an high compliment surely to the methodists it is not likely that a follower of that archhypocrite john wesley should have acted thus unless some pelf or plunder was to be obtained thereby at least if they resembled their wretched leader whose practice was to fleece the rich to feather finely feather harlots and rogues witness poor mr and mrs g ths of c who were induced to turn their house into a kind of lock hospital until they had no house left in which to shelter their aged heads only a two pair of stairs lodging in london on their first acquaintance with the zealous apostle of  they kept a carriage and a pair of good horses to draw it a coachman footman and several female servants a few years reduced them to the situation above described a letter written by mrs gths from the london garret to a lady at c describing their sufferings was sufficient to have distressed any hearer of it but it was of a piece with his setting miss bt with fifty thousand pounds to wash her own linen that young harlots might be healed of their bodily diseases and dressed out to draw in poor deluded young men to marry them one of the nymphs thus restored to health at mrs gthss was actually married to a person in london who settled on her a jointure of three hundred pounds per annum such were the good works of john wesley may his followers cease to practice them one does not find them recommended in scripture st paul says charge them that are rich that they be ready to distribute willing to communicate etc not turn themselves into washerwomen and retire to garrets with their poor blind lame deluded husbands as did mrs g  but to return to say that mr berkeleys servants loved him is too feeble an expression his own and the servants of his fathers family in general old in his service almost idolized him his generosity his condescending goodness to the meanest servant in the house was so engaging that joy enlivened every countenance whenever he visited at his fathers he had been very early taught that although it had pleased providence to place him in a different station of life from his fathers servants yet that he must ever treat them with kind civility he and his brother were always made whilst children to take off their hat to the lowest peasant and washerwoman who passed them in the village and so habitual was it to mr berkeley to be  courteous to all men that when he gave orders to his servant a stranger to him would not have supposed he had been speaking to his own domestic yet wonderful to relate he had one servant who actually had a desire to lie in wait to murder him but he was an italian see above p xxxvii  this may be a warning to english and irish gentlemen to be less fond of foreign servants mr berkeley wanting a servant at a time when few were in london a person who owed mr berkeley much gratitude earnestly recommended this villain mr berkeley objected wishing either an english or scotchman always thinking it wrong to employ foreigners to the detriment of our own countrymen he however yielded dr berkeley at his return from visiting his son in town said to mrs berkeley i think your son seems to have got a devil in the form of a fine tall fellow what does he do nothing i believe but such a pair of diabolical eyes i never saw before in my life mrs berkeley ever anxious for her idol wrote to her son who with his usual benignity replied the poor fellow to be sure is not handsome nor has he a very benign countenance which made my father think him diabolical but he does every thing that i want although he is not like ritchie or mnicol  when mr berkeley was once ordered to the sea a day or or two before he set out accompanied by his excellent unwearied friend h grimston esquire he told this servant that as he wished to lounge and change his posture frequently and as he could not accommodate three in the chaise it being summer time he should go down on the top of the coach this signor resented as such an indignity that on his arrival he utterly refused to act at all so that but for mr grimstons servant mr berkeley must have been exceedingly distressed his ill humor increasing daily mr berkeley at length discharged him without the least anger or reproach the sweetness of his nature never suffered his anger to rise against an inferior my superiors he used ever to say shall feel it if they treat me improperly this wretch instead of returning to london the next morning stayed the whole of the next day and when he did set off said he had waited all that day to murder his master but he found it was in vain for that he kept close it providentially happened that mr berkeleys horse had picked up a nail and he could not ride into the country as was his constant custom to drink milk from the cow morning and evening neither did he go to the library or rooms that day which mr berkeley when mentioning it looked upon as the mercy of an allgracious overruling particular providence in which he ever believed ever trusted and was never disappointed mr berkeley not having any italian blood in his veins could form no idea of this villains spirit of revenge he was immediately replaced by a very worthy honest englishman mr william morfey for whose attentive incessant care mr berkeley felt himself so much indebted that some little time before his lamented death he requested of his father and mother that he might remain in their family as long as service should be agreeable to him although he had a competency without it  it is almost impossible to avoid relating here a little circumstance that will show the contrast between the englishman and the italian for some time before mr berkeleys dissolution finding himself unable to fit up through the day he rose not until after the family had dined that he might enjoy the society of his friends in the afternoon he constantly dismissed his servant to eat his dinner in comfort ordering him not to hurry himself and not to return until he rang his bell one day his bell rang and mr berkeleys mother conceiving that the servant had not dined went to the top of the kitchen stairs and told the servant she would go up and see what his master wanted and if she could not get it ring for him he replied no madam i must go myself the housekeeper and the other servants urged him to stay saying you have but one single mouthful to finish do pray eat it mr berkeley is never impatient he will wait he replied  no i will not stay to eat it his mother once recommending to his care a most affectionate tenderhearted servant her old housekeeper who came into the family when mr berkeley was a lad to keep in his family if it pleased god to spare him to settle he lifted up his fine eyes and replied in the tenderest tone of voice my dearest mother there is no occasion for you to recommend mrs marsh to me when mr berkeleys exquisitely fine picture presented to his mother by his beloved friend mr peters arrived at dr berkeleys this amiablehearted woman hastened to assist at the unpacking it and on seeing it sunk motionless upon it heartfelt gratitude forces the writer of this preface to celebrate the incessant unwearied attention of the two above named servants as also of the very worthy mrs jane godwin who has for many years been the happy domestic of mr berkeleys incomparably kind generous excellent aunt mrs frinsham for the delightful alacrity and unwearied assiduity with which they endeavored incessantly to alleviate mr berkeleys intolerable all but insupportable bodily sufferings as indeed did every other servant in the family for all which sufferings mr berkeley repeatedly returned hearty thanks to god frequently saying to his mother i would not have been without them for all this world has to give as i am persuaded nothing short of what i have suffered could have brought me as i ought to come to christ such universal benevolence may tempt the possessor to feel less need of the atonement  it is impossible to omit here my most grateful acknowledgements to many amiablehearted persons in the inferior stations in life to whom mr berkeley was only known by his almost divine philanthropy and by his severe sufferings  at hastings at dover and at cheltenham  who seemed to vie with each other who should be most active in endeavoring to lighten the distress of a poor miserable stomach that for many months regurgitated every delicacy of every kind mr berkeley frequently for days together did not retain any thing taken into his stomach for one minute which occasioned one of the most eminent physicians to pronounce positively that the passage into the stomach was stopped and must be opened by a method known to medical gentlemen this was not the case as sometimes for two or three days successively plainly appeared mr berkeley was one of the most temperate of men never from the age of fifteen tasting a morsel of any food between his meals no sandwich no soup nor any thing else even if he did not dine until six oclock and very rarely ate any supper when he dined at the oldfashioned hour of three at his fathers house  persons are often punished in kind  by what things a man sins by the same also shall he be tormented speaks the scripture  mr berkeley never was an epicure a moment of his life frequently when the family dined out and he did not choose to accompany them mrs berkeley would ask him what she should order for his dinner his constant reply was oh my dear madam whatever they have in the servants hall will do for me but my dear they have not any thing yet ordered well then if it is quite convenient a neck of mutton and broth and suet dumplings and turnips of which he constantly ate the absolute scrag which often occasioned his mothers telling him however you may torment your wife if ever you marry it will not be as an epicure  mr berkeley wished exceedingly to have gone to dover immediately on his being ordered the third time to the sea that together with sea bathing he might have enjoyed the delightful society of his old his beloved his sincerely respected friends the excellent sir robert and lady laurie and their thoroughly amiable son and daughter but his father wished him to make choice of hastings and mr berkeley was the most obedient of sons as the autumn advanced the want of a warm seabath obliged him to quit hastings and he repaired to dover accompanied by his excellent relation above named mrs frinsham where he received such amiable such incessant attentions from the lovely family of laurie the angelic mrs firebrace and the very worthy mrs and miss pain  although it were impossible even if possessed of the mines of peru and mexico to repay their kindness yet must it ever be whilst possessed of life registered in the retentive grateful memory of the editor and may he who rewards every one according to although not for their good works reward these amiable friends an hundred a thousand fold in time and through the countless ages of eternity is a prayer offered daily at the throne of that god who hears and answers prayer as is often happily experienced by those who believe and trust his gracious promises revealed in the holy scriptures the mention of these particular kind old intimate friends of mr berkeley and his family does not prevent the writer from feeling the sincerest gratitude to numberless other of the wonderfully amiable inhabitants of dover who high and low seemed to study who should be most forward in showing every possible attention to mr berkeley so much as frequently at this time to occasion the above named worthy domestics to say they never saw such delightful people as the inhabitants of dover it has been repeatedly asserted many years ago by the writer who has often bathed in the sea at dover that the inhabitants even the very lowest ranks were certainly the most courteous people in europe and attributed it to their vicinity to their once amiable delightfully courteous neighbors on the other side of the water the streets of dover are narrow of course the pavement cannot be wide and so very attentive are they that you never see an inferior take the wall of a superior or a charityschool child of an elder person if looking on the other side a bricklayers labourer in a leathern apron stumble on any lady or gentleman he instantly steps off the narrow pavement with i ask your pardon sir or madam for not seeing you were coming mr berkeleys father used to say they remind me of the days of my youth spent in ireland where the inferior people are most remarkably respectful to their superiors  it would be a vain effort to attempt doing justice to mr berkeleys gratitude to the excellent mr brydges of wootton court and his accomplished lady at dover at the time mr berkeley was there he used to exclaim how often have they driven over to wootton court to fetch me some fine fruit as if i had been only brother to both fruit fit to eat indeed any fruit cannot be procured for any sum at dover and on fruit sweetmeats and old hock did mr berkeley long subsist after his arrival at cheltenham how many fervent prayers did he pour forth to the almighty to reward the thoroughly amiable relations of his mother sir john and lady guise when a servant arrived loaded with the fine fruits of highnam court as also the amiable highly respected old friend of his mother mr de la bear of cheltenham in whose pleasing conversation mr berkeley much delighted during the few weeks of his life after his arrival at cheltenham whither he went in compliance with the wishes of his mother to enjoy the advice of the celebrated dr chestern of gloucester but alas mr berkeley fell a victim to duty he had for near two years before been under the hands of an hypocritical ignoramus the editor wishes for the pen of a johnson or a burke to endeavor to do justice to her gratitude to that most amiable of men her respected friend william sharp esquire of fulham who having as it appeared wrenched himself from his patients from his extensive practice has the goodness to attend to the maladies of his friends dr berkeley being from home for a few nights mrs berkeley instantly dispatched a letter to mr sharp conjuring him to permit her son to wait on him she being convinced that he was in a very dangerous situation the permission was in the politest manner more than granted mr sharp most amiably writing to mrs berkeley said i will not give mr berkeley the trouble of coming to fulham but if he will be pleased to appoint any place day and hour in town i will punctually attend mr berkeley was too well bred and felt this amiable goodness too strongly to accept it he set out for fulham and on his arrival there sent his servant to beg to know at what hour it would be agreeable to mr sharp to admit him on presenting to mr sharp a short letter of introduction from his mother mr berkeley having never before seen him good mr sharp politely exclaimed from mrs berkeleys letter do all i can to rescue you from the grave sir if i had no friendship for mrs berkeley i would certainly exert all the skill i am master of to rescue from death the finest young gentleman i ever saw alas it was too late that healing art as divine hervey says of dr stonhouse to which myself and so many others have been indebted failed here see meditations among the tombs  on examining mr berkeley mr sharp exclaimed into the hands of what ignorant brute can you have fallen sir dr berkeley resides within thirty miles of town i did not conceive that in these days in the remotest village in england there they had not better medical aid one fortnight more and all the men in the world could not have rescued you and a most direful calamity must have inevitably come upon you for ever blessed be the mercy of god on the great skill of good mr sharp and the eminent surgeon an eleve of his own for fourteen years under whose care he advised mr berkeley to put himself that tragical maiming of his fine person was averted although his dear life could only be lengthened not preserved  some years ago the late amiable pious mrs wadham knatchbull having a disorder that baffled the skill of several very good canterbury surgeons her excellent son wyndham knatchbull esquire prevailed on mr sharp to visit her after he had retired from practice during his stay at the house of his excellent relation dr dering prebendary of canterbury he very obligingly wrote a prescription for a snuff for mrs george berkeleys eyes to that gentlemans great skill when in practice fifteen years before she under god owes it that after having nursed a child too long she has still through mercy one eye left to scribble her grateful acknowledgement to her kind benefactors her sympathizing friends mrs berkeley one morning carried the prescription herself to dr berkeleys respected surgeon mr lofty desiring him to make it up himself mentioning from whom she had it acknowledging as above that she owed to that gentlemans skill that she had still one eye mr lofty exclaimed then madam you know mr sharp i never in my life beheld such another man good god with what tenderness ease and skill did he did perform the operation on mrs knatchbull i never never saw his equal besides madam he is as wellbred a gentleman as he is an excellent surgeon    in whom his father placed great confidence his mother saw through the wretch and what added to her anguish was that two perhaps as skilful medical men as any in england resided at the same town one of whom always attended mr berkeleys mother when ill as she frequently declared to dr berkeley that to the third she would not trust the life of her angola cat  gods ways are unsearchable but they are all well ordered for his children who are enabled to feel as well as say all thy ways are mercy and truth etc perhaps few situations have been more distressing than that of mr berkeleys mother for many weeks just at the time when she should have set out to attend her son at dover her tenderly beloved partner was seized at cheltenham with a most tremendous disorder that threatened almost immediate dissolution every post brought more alarming accounts from dover   dreadful post of observation darker every hour says dr young when relating his own sufferings during lady bettys last illness her agonies every time the postboys horn notified his arrival may by those who have feeling hearts be more easily imagined than described and especially as they were obliged to be suppressed it however pleased the mercy of god to grant a reprieve  a short one alas to these two too dear objects mr berkeley languished to see once more his mother perhaps no mother ever did love a son quite so sincerely and it was supposed by those who knew him well that no man ever did love even a mother so exceedingly as mr berkeley the holy spirit certainly holds out the love between mother and son as the highest love without passion solomon speaking of wisdom says she shall love thee more than thy mother does and david says i went heavily as one that mourns for his mother and again the holy spirit describing the bitterest mournings says it shall be as the mourning for an only son  that love commenced as mrs berkeley used to tell her son the instant she saw his dear homely face and continued unabated  alas daily increased  until his fine face was for ever hid from her bodily eyes by the arrival of the plumber late on saturday evening preceding his interment on the sunday evening god in love in mercy must remove the idols see the prophet ezekiel son of man they have set up their idols in their heart out of the hearts of his children  mr berkeleys mother always flattered herself with the hope that as she never spoiled or improperly gratified her children and constantly corrected them according to the advice of the wise king the book of proverbs being her constant directory that she did not idolize them but alas the wisest are too apt to deceive themselves  how much more then a poor weak female  mrs berkeleys first care for her children was the salvation of their souls secondly the cultivation of their minds and manners next the forming their persons and lastly the advancing her son in his profession for the youngest died before he attained to nine years  when it is mentioned that attention was paid to the immortal part of mr berkeley even before he was born it will be easily imagined that as soon as reason began to dawn every judicious attention was paid to the direction of the holy spirit delivered by st paul  bring up your children in the nurture and admonition of the lord from the time that his mother perceived that the allgracious giver of every good gift was about to entrust her with the care of an immortal soul that must pass the countless ages of eternity either in bliss unspeakable or woe unutterable she never failed to pray daily that nothing descended from her might ever be separated from that adorable god who lived and died that man might live for ever and she trusts through free sovereign grace and redeeming love to be enabled to say at the great day lo here am i and the children whom thou have graciously given me in a letter of mrs berkeleys many months ago in the st jamess chronicle combating dr beatties idea of not permitting children to know that there is a supreme being until they attain to the age of six years the editor of the st jamess chronicle in general very sensible has rejected this text as too serious for a newspaper and has adopted a sentence of nonsense in another part he has sadly turned one period and mutilated it for fear of being too serious he apologizes for it in a succeeding paper   almost as soon as mr berkeley could articulate there was discovered in him what attended him through life wonderful powers of reasoning and an incessant enquiry  how can these things be and a sagacity that it was next to impossible to deceive which once occasioned a sensible lady lady p the beloved the bosomfriend of mr monck berkeleys mother from very early youth to her latest hour without any intermission any coolness over whose heavy sufferings she cannot avoid dropping a tear friends from children both married just at the same time within a few weeks both called upon to offer up two beloved children mrs berkeley two fine sons lady p two lovely daughters on the death of the eldest of the two miss catharine p whom mrs berkeley had prevailed on lady p to put for a couple of years under the tuition of the accomplished mrs beaver in dover street being as both these very old fashioned ladies thought too young at between sixteen and seventeen to be introduced into life as it is termed died very suddenly mrs berkeley wrote as follows to her beloved friend after her usual preface it is the lord let him do what seems him good was added i am at a loss what to say to my dearest friend the subject is difficult for i do really believe you have lost such a daughter as no other mother in europe has to lose the astonishing strength and solidity of this young ladys understanding and the exceeding beauty of her face and elegance of her form could only be exceeded by the loveliness of her temper corrected at about fourteen by herself and the exquisite obligingness and refined unaffected sweetness of her manners some years after lady p lost another lovely daughter but she had still a lovely one remaining together with a most excellent son and a worthy husband to soothe her sufferings under the total loss of the use of her limbs all which she bore with true christian resignation it was somewhat remarkable that from her age of eighteen she had always told the editor that she was very certain that god would some time or other in mercy punish her by taking away the use of her limbs adding i know he must do it in love to my soul then assigning the reason thou art now in bliss thou beloved friend  mother of many fine children to say of what can that little creatures brain be formed for i never heard any child ask such very extraordinary questions not even at double his age  mr berkeley was early a great skeptic which alarmed his mother the less as she felt it was hereditary and she pursued the same plan which her eminently pious and wise mother had so happily used toward herself and her endeavors to direct and settle that dangerous tendency of mind were so happily blessed that from the early age of fifteen mr berkeley was a most zealous ardent stickler for the coequal coeternal godhead of his adored redeemer and of the holy spirit with the father a most respectable and worthy friend of his early youth in a letter to his mother on the death of his beloved friend says how often have i heard him in company battling for the honor of his savior and silencing his deistical acquaintance and friends he had many friends whom he earnestly wished to lead out of their infidel darkness into the glorious sunshine of the gospel of christ  several of the great geniuses of this day mr berkeley at one time very earnestly solicited his fathers permission to recommend a cottage ornee in the neighborhood of cookham to a friend of his a man of large fortune and deserved fame in the literary world for a summer residence saying i have no doubt but he would be convinced by your arguments to which dr berkeley replied i am sure if he has not been convinced by yours who are his friend he will not be convinced by mine on mrs berkeleys joining in her sons supplications dr berkeley rather angrily replied  no no he shall not bring down any of his deistical friends to stink in my nose he shall not come it is not that they do not but that they will not believe the record that god has given of his son so it was of course given up  who may perhaps affect to laugh or scoff at this although they know it to be true and that mr berkeley did not wait to believe in the savior of the world until driven to him by sickness or the terrors of death  mrs berkeley when her children were young and during their being under their fathers roof whilst at the kings school at canterbury devoted her mornings primarily to them never admitting any morning visitor which occasioned the sensible the witty lady  an old intimate school friend of hers frequently to say i wish those two nasty little brats were dead out of the way then your friends might enjoy a little of your company the jocular wish alas is realized that amiable friend was very partial to them perpetually fetching them to childrens cardparties at her hospitable mansion mr berkeley when a man used frequently to say i love lady  for her goodness to me when i was a boy her benevolence was so well known that all who did not wish to drown puppies and kittens as dogs and cats produce their young so frequently and so plentifully is it not reasonable to suppose that the bounteous giver of every good gift meant these cheaply fed domestic animals for food for man and not to be soused at nine days old into a horsepond to corrupt the water for the poor horses and cows we learn from high authority  that god made nothing in vain these poor animals as we treat them seem made worse than in vain we read in mr forsters account of captain cooks first voyage that the life of that very worthy amiable man was supposed to be saved by mr forsters sacrificing his favorite dog for his food when very ill and it is well known that half london who choose to eat tame rabbits certainly eat cats it is a prejudice which perhaps like most other prejudices it would be wisdom to give up the county of fife in some parts abounds with the finest rabbits yet the poorest labourer will not eat one although starving calling them carrion they kill them sell their skins and throw the body to the smiddie their elegant word for our gross one of dunghill we are rather a coarse people the french call that necessary heap un fumee many of the lower people of scotland will not touch a silver eel terming watersnakes when the late bishop berkeley went in the year      to reside in the palace at cloyne none of the poor irish would eat of some very fine fish in great plenty there i think the jean doree but after some time they said that if my lord ate it it could not harm them used in the evening to convey them into her garden mrs berkeley used to tell her that she would advise some poor clergyman to pack up a child or two in a basket and lay it at her hall door lady  used to reply i declare if ever there is a child found in the garden i will send it to you to keep the generosity of this lady needs no eulogium from the pen of an old friend  mr berkeley determined to attempt complying with the earnest request of his mother took an affectionate a grateful last farewell of all his amiable friends and obliging neighbors at dover including the thoroughly respectable and pious rev mr lion and his tenderhearted amiable apothecary mr hanham who did not conceive that mr berkeley had sufficient strength remaining to reach canterbury alive but the divine tenderness of nature which showed itself at the age of three years when about that age one wednesday the family all coming out of church a beggar applied to her father for relief saying that a scaffold breaking at colonel tyrrels at shottover house two men had been killed  his arm was so shattered that it had been cut off just at the elbow  that it was then mortified and he was going to the hospital to have it taken off above the elbow mr frinsham an excellent surgeon to his poor neighbors insisted on looking at it and turning to his footman bid him assist the man to take off his coat after much apparatus removed there appeared a lily white hand hereupon mr frinsham exclaimed thou villain i will commit you to bridewell directly william to his servant go call the constable who lived at the parsonage close by  out came the constable  down fell the restored cripple on his knees on the pitched walk this lovely little creature flew to her father and clinging round him said oh my dear papa forgive the poor man he will cut his knees he will indeed then falling upon her knees and embracing her fathers she wept and shrieked so violently that fearing she would be deprived of her reason the vile impostor was dismissed unpunished the same sweet spirit has attended her through life a blessing to the poor and needy a constant source of suffering to herself the wretch confessed that his hand had been thus muffled up for the last fourteen years he appeared to common spectators to have really but half an arm the coat sleeve was smeared all over with medicine and the hand confined in the leathern case of a duodecimo bible in his angelic relation mrs frinsham and has actuated her through life determined that excellent friend who alone could attempt it not to dissuade him from his purpose accompanied by that lady and the three above named worthy affectionate attendants mr berkeley set out and with difficulty reached canterbury where he saw some of his old friends the very learned mr todd and some others and in the evening sent for mr wrightson now master of the workhouse of the sixteen parishes of that city  happy indeed do both high and low express themselves in so worthy so mild so able a governor  the learned and accomplished mr m of cookham used when obligingly advising mr berkeley at the age of seventeen to say well if you will not attend to me i will speak to mr john and he will make you do it immediately mr berkeley used to redden and say he make me do it how so why my dear berkeley i had not been intimate with your family six weeks before i saw that he governed the whole family the whole family how so why when dr or mrs berkeley say berkeley i would advise you to do so or so you instantly reply yes sir or madam but i must first hear what john says then on some other subject dr berkeley turns to mrs berkeley and says my dear you will speak to john highly as mr berkeley thought of john he is one instance thought more highly of his own eloquence sometimes mr berkeleys fine hunter was not thought sufficiently recovered from the fatigues of the preceding hunt and only one horse in the place was capable of flying over hedge and ditch  burn and brake the property of a most worthy old blacksmith of the name of pierce mr berkeley used to send his own young man now through the mercy of god with christ give my service to pierce and desire he will hire me his horse to hunt tomorrow  master peirces duty to you sir and he is very sorry but he thinks he shall want him himself  off sets mr berkeley to the gardener who lives at maidenhead a man of very uncommonly strong understanding much better improved in youth by a kind relation than is usual in that rank of life and who would have educated him a scholar but for the avarice of his mother who said john has had larning enough and he must now set about arning ie earning  always a most respectful domestic down goes the spade or waterpot  off goes the gardener with the message a little strengthened  his humble duty to you and he is very sorry but i cannot spare his horse tomorrow  john pray now do you go to old pierce and tell him what distress i am in and i am sure he will lend me his horse i will give whatever he desires for him off goes john  returns with as little success as the others off sets mr berkeley and soon returns in triumph with aye there is nothing like doing ones own business here have i sent robert gardener john all in vain and i prevailed upon the old man in two minutes he said lord bless you sir why you must have him i think and i must go to reading on thursday the fact was mr berkeleys manners were so uncommonly sweet and winning particularly to his inferiors where as his mother used to tell him the noble blood of the berkeleys could not be put in motion that he could like his grandfather the bishop as mr dalton used always to say of his beloved respected friend he could persuade every body to any thing that he pleased some time after this honest man opened a grocers shop mr berkeley conjured his mother to lay out some money with him adding i really feel myself under great obligations to the honest old man on mr berkeleys return to cookham several years after finding his old friend pierce dead he put his little orphan boy to school  and hear what he says when mrs berkeley replies yes i have talked to him already about it now is it not evident that what i say is fact this gentleman did not mean that dr berkeley consulted his excellent old servant on his sermons or mrs berkeley on her letters although she had taught him the alphabet he coming very early into dr berkeleys family and living in it very near thirty years during which long period he never returned a saucy answer nor uttered a pert sentence or grumble when shutting the door notwithstanding he was when mrs berkeley was not present the only governor of mr monck berkeley yet he never forgot that he was the son of his master but always treated him with the respect due from one in an humbler station sir you must not you shall not do that what would my mistress say if she should come into the stableyard now mr wrightson was many years coachman to dr berkeley before he became his butler a stronger proof that persons is an humble station may be thoroughly respectable and respected cannot be adduced than in mr berkeleys little brother when about seven years old sitting very disconsolately the cause being enquired he replied why i have been naughty and john will not be friends with me mrs berkeley his grandmother being in the room replied oh never mind that if he will not but go away to play never mind it indeed why if all the world were friends with and john was not i could never be happy  mr wrightsons powers for governing well it may be presumed are not impaired as the little boys in canterbury workhouse of which he is now master are made so industrious at eight years old as to earn money sufficient to receive a poundage of threepence every week for themselves to spend as they please in little innocent trifles a wise encouragement this and it must be wished by every humane person that it was practiced in every workhouse and poorhouse throughout the three kingdoms at cookham in berkshire where they are remarkably kind to the poor in the workhouse and most shamefully hard and cruel to those who strive to keep themselves out of it the lacemaking women and girls and others have two pence out of every shilling they earn and permission to work for their own profit after a certain hour in the evening this is comforting the hearts of the poor enabling them to procure a little tea tobacco and snuff which cannot be provided otherwise dr berkeley has often had his wonderfully fine tender feelings soothed when visiting sick persons in the workhouse saying on his return home well it is a delight to ones spirit to see those poor people in sheets as white though not as fine as ones own and every comfort that human aid can render tea wine etc were always allowed to the sick if the apothecary said it was necessary the very worthy mrs lane was then mistress with a handsome salary she lived many years in the family of the late lord aylesford servants who have lived in genteel families are the only proper conductors of workhouses a butler of the late worthy general onslow of cookham was her predecessor a broken tradesman who perhaps knows little but how to give short measure and light weight and eat the best of every thing till he breaks is tyrannical and cruel  laying his weight heavily on the aged and not pitying children as speaks the holy scripture  the aid of the very learned very skilful dr pack had been procured by mrs berkeley who in a letter sent to him by her had desired him to visit mr berkeley at dover which he did and saw him again at canterbury on his journey it was supposed by all who did see him that mr berkeley would hardly reach sittingbourn alive and he was supposed once to be dead yet it pleased that allgracious god whose mercies are no fewer than infinite to his faithful however unworthy servants to conduct mr berkeley to cheltenham where his family had been for some months unable to get to him on account of his fathers lamentable state of health as above mentioned mr berkeley after reposing part of a day and a night at the palace of those prodigies of kentish innkeepers mr and mrs simpson at the rose at sittingbourn  indeed they might with truth be compared with the marches at maidenhead bridge the red lion henley and most of the great innkeepers on the northern road whose accommodations obliging assiduities and reasonable charges deserve to be celebrated  mr berkeley by slow journeys reached the metropolis where he rested two or three days and collected all those few friends who happened to be in town at that season when london is usually most empty the beginning of december he exhibited himself as a man dying in the very prime of life and besought them to  remember their creator before the evil days come on and to fly from temptation he afterward proceeded to his fathers house at cookham in the garden of which he ever delighted so much particularly in the southcote walk leading to the thames as often to say to his mother who admired it at least as much as her son well if i was lord chancellor and could not get the vicars garden at cookham i should be perpetually breaking the tenth commandment  mrs berkeley had written to her apothecary the very sensible and skilful mr falwasser of maidenhead to desire him to meet mr berkeley at cookham and endeavor to administer something to alleviate his sufferings during his journey at least after a short rest at cookham he left his beloved relation mrs frinsham so exhausted with tender anxiety as to be unable then to prosecute her journey to cheltenham he proceeded with his attentive servant to oxford whither he had written to his bedmaker and kind attentive nurse in a severe stage of his near five years illness mrs leycester some time after mr monck berkeleys death the family passing through oxford this very worthy grateful woman came to mrs berkeley with a small box under her arm saying that she knew not what it contained but that whenever mr berkeley quitted oxford for any length of time he constantly gave it her with a strict charge to lock it up carefully and never whilst he was living to deliver it into any hand but his own in case of his death to his mother it contained some very curious letters from some of his intimate friends one very curious one from r m esquire the contents of which still remain known only to the editor two or three rings and coins souvenirs of departed friends a curious purse containing several strips cut out of newspapers on examination they were found to be accounts of the deaths of various friends thus preserved as mementos from the time that he was a schoolboy and a card quite yellowed by time containing the lines not at last rightly quoted by mr s in his anecdotes from aaron hills fine tragedy which dr johnson said merited to be written in letters of gold and which mrs berkeley had caused her son to get by heart as soon as they were commented upon in daviess life of david garrick esquire oh leoline as obstinately just etc  while mr berkeley was at eton his mother said to him i hope you have not forgotten the delightful lines of aaron hill he instantly repeated them adding i wish you would be so good as to write them out for me on a card why so you remember them perfectly yes so i do and hope never to forget them but i think if i saw them now and then in what he politely termed your beautiful hand they would make a deeper impression on my mind the request was of course complied with and on the reverse of the card two important texts of scripture written the card written about fourteen years before was found deposited in this box    to procure him a lodging as near the hall as she could as mr berkeley the hall being full was obliged when more than four years standing in the university to relinquish his rooms to admit younger members  it is impossible to omit relating here a most pleasing grateful attention of a much younger gentleman than mr berkeley over whom mr berkeley had most kindly and wisely watched in order to prevent his forming as youths of sixteen seventeen or eighteen are too apt to do improper intimacies and connections the worthy very amiablehearted william brown esquire gentlemancommoner of magdalen hall now the very worthy rector of horton near windsor that parish was once so happy as to have the excellent mr roman for curate this amiablehearted young gentleman mr brown was one of several gentlemen who although in distant parts of the kingdom as if by consent put themselves into brothers mourning for their beloved lamented friend  hearing from his bedmaker mrs leycester that mr berkeley was coming to oxford bid her take no thought about a lodging for that in mr berkeleys infirm state of health it must be more agreeable to him to be in his own old rooms which mr brown had desired the principal to let him exchange for his when mr berkeley was obliged to quit them immediately took a lodging for himself and directed mrs leycester and the worthy mr william wells this young man was an orphan and attended the hall with fruit etc mr berkeleys piercing eye soon descried that shirts would add to his comfort he soon appeared in the hall thus equipped one of the gentlemen of the hall said to him why will you have got a nice new shirt but will it is not complete those who gave you the shirt should have treated you with ruffles to it no sir replied will they had too much good sense to do that it would ill become any one to wear ruffles on a shirt that was given to them in charity the wisdom of will was at least as much admired as the wit of the gentleman some time after mr berkeleys death his mother on seeing this honest worthy young man observed to him mr william you have lost a kind friend he burst into tears and could scarcely articulate that i have indeed madam can i do any thing to serve you the gratitude of the worthy mrs leycester is great for some essential services rendered her by mr berkeley during his residence at the hall  one of the scouts as the college servants are termed at oxford an early protege of mr berkeley to prepare the rooms for his reception and collected a number of mr berkeleys old friends to spend the evening with him and of course their beloved and respected tutor the reverned mr green the viceprincipal on account of whose great learning and strict attention to his pupils dr berkeley had recommended it to his son to enter at magdalene hall rather than at his own beloved christ church or under his old excellent friend the angelichearted bishop of norwich under whose roof and in whose cheerful gay society and that of his worthy lady and beautiful daughters mr berkeley passed many happy hours of his oxford life the delightfully amiable bishop always considering the son of his oldest friend as to use the french term enfant de famille that thoroughly angelic prelate would frequently relate little anecdotes of mr berkeleys gay lively wit with greater pleasure than a parent might venture to do without being suspected of too great partiality the writer of this preface cannot dismiss this beloved respected character of her incomparable old friend without saying what the same pen wrote when the church of england lost this bright mild star and the church of scotland his counterpart that bishop horn and the reverend dr gillespie late principal of the divinity college in the university of st andrew could be very little more angelical now with worshipping at the throne of glory than when on earth supplicating at the throne of grace two more lovely mild benign sweet spirits have not perhaps since the days of moses the meekest of mere men been permitted to shine in this dark world for more than threescore years before they took their flight to join their kindred spirits and may the writer of these pages through redeeming love be admitted in gods appointed time to rejoin those sweet spirits whose society was so exhilarating here both were remarkably cheerful agreeable companions both had perhaps attended to that line of dr young it is impious in a good man to be sad and to a still higher than dr young st paul  rejoice always  and again i say rejoice could gloomy pious persons possibly conceive the injury that they do to the religion of our divine redeemer who repeatedly asserts  my yoke is easy and my burden light they would not always as if like manasseh they were dragging about fetters of brass or rather lead for brass would shine too much for such illjudging gloomy spirits  as if religion the religion of the blessed jesus ever was intended to make our joys less alas no it is a slight knowledge of christ that sheds the gloom acquaint thyself with god says holy job and be at peace it is one thing to get a slight view of any eminently wise person in a crowd and another to acquaint ourselves thoroughly with them if permitted so to do and all are invited come unto me all ye that are weary and heavy laden and i will refresh you  after passing a couple of days at oxford to rest and bid a last adieu to his friends in that beloved place he proceeded by easy journeys toward cheltenham he was met on the road by his father mother and his fathers cousingerman the generous amiable and compassionate mrs d monck too well known in the polite circles of london and bath for her polite attentions elegant hospitality and unbounded generosity to her relations her friends and the poor to need an enumeration here to attempt to do justice to her exquisitely kind amiable unwearied attentions to mr berkeley during the last six weeks of his life spent at cheltenham or his and his parents gratitude to that extraordinary lady is a task not to be executed perhaps by any pen much less by one so very imbecile suffice it therefore to say may god reward in time and through eternity what mr berkeley termed mrs moncks divine attentions to him amen  mr berkeleys strength daily decreasing as it had done for many months he never walked out but twice at cheltenham once to look at the beautiful church with a handsome painting of that church the eyes of the editor are daily delighted for which she is indebted to the elegant pencil of her very highly accomplished sensible amiable young friend miss hamilton one of the daughters of lord archibald hamilton who although so very distant in point of years honored the editor by seeking her acquaintance  an honor but very rarely granted by the editor to young ladies of any rank when young herself she had only two young friends lady p and mrs d w all her other intimate friends and correspondents were ten some fifteen years older than herself  little she used to think was to be learned from girls of her own age forty years ago much less alas now unless it be to go without clothing in these hard times and so save a little money mr monck berkeley used to say it was a mercy that god did not spare the life of his little sister that if he had both his mother and self should certainly have ended their days at tyburn for had she as many lives as a cat is said to have we should both have killed her nine times if she had behaved as the generality of girls of fashion do now he always named some as exceptions he had not the honor the pleasure to be acquainted with miss hamiltons  where he felt his mortal remains would soon be deposited in hope of a joyful resurrection to immortal life which he humbly hoped through christ jesus his savior  curiosity perhaps may have led many to run their eye for want of something else to do over this short indigested sketch of the short life of a young man of whom it cannot be said there is nothing remarkable in it for were the account of mr berkeleys life methodically written by a learned accurate pen perhaps few lives of double the length of his could furnish more curious matter the number of astonishing hairbreadth escapes of life in his very early childhood used to occasion his mother to express her fears that he would resemble pope sixtus quintus or the celebrated unfortunate wortley montague esquire both of whom it is well known were incessantly in perils and escaped most wonderfully a very worthy woman that waited on lady mary wortley montague when he was born and many years afterward in her advanced age lived with an intimate friend of mrs berkeleys mother when mrs berkeley was a girl and was by her frequently entertained with the wonderful exploits of master montague and those of master berkeley were in many instances so similar as to cause the supremest vigilance in mrs berkeley her younger son although a wonderfully lively alert child never had any danger to encounter never had any known escape from danger which occasioned mr berkeleys frequent dangers and escapes to be the more noticed by the whole family the spirit of one  returned early to god who gave it the other was appointed to travel longer through the thorny wilderness of this world  a certain description of readers are now about to be addressed in the words of that noblest of poets dr young in his second night fly ye profane if not draw near with awe receive the blessing and adore the chance that threw in this bethesda your disease if unrestord by this despair your cure for here resistless demonstration dwells a deathbed s a detector of the heart here tired dissimulation drops her mask the late very sensible learned accomplished grateful dr beauvoir head master of canterbury school used always to say i do deny that position of dr youngs it only makes them fit it on the closer dreadful idea if it does so what must be their lot through the countless ages of eternity had he lived until this time he might have seen some who drop it before they lie stretched on their death bed a mask is a very troublesome thing to fit on nicely in youth when one may be allowed to attend a little to dress the editor was perhaps too proud ever to wear one for a moment which frequently occasioned her beloved partners often saying to mr monck berkeley  your mother is too honest for this world her constant reply well she cannot be too honest for the next  through lifes grimace that mistress of the scene mr berkeley from very early youth resembled his mother in always exhibiting his faults rather than his virtues frequently saying god make me better than i am but i hope he will always give me grace never to appear better than i really am the editors mother whom god in mercy spared until she was turned of twenty used to say my dear child you will never get a husband you hold yourself up as a dragon men like quiet wives the editor always cautioned her son and all his young friends against a fine soft gentle meekling  the usual mask to conceal the most violent temper there are to be sure a few female mosess but these are very rare a beloved friend of the editors mrs c one day when two sisters were spoken of said to her the men like f better than k because she is too lazy to put herself in a passion but she is never with all that apparent meekness half an hour in a week mr berkeley used to say i hope if ever i should persuade any lady to marry me that she will not apply to my mother for my character for she will certainly tell her every fault i have as she told my father beforehand all her own faults as she has often told us all declared it little likely mrs berkeley should be so applied to by any lady   here real and apparent are the same you see the man you see his hold on heaven heaven waits not the last moment own her friends on this side death and points them out to men a lecture silent but of sovereign power   when it is mentioned that mr berkeleys mother ever anxious for the salvation of her children had never failed from the moment they had life to pray that god would vouchsafe to make her the mother of their souls it will be easily believed that this anxiety did not decrease on the letters she perpetually received from her excellent friends lady laurie and mrs frinsham from dover of the declining state of mr berkeleys health and dreading lest she might never have an opportunity of conversing with him on earth she repeatedly wrote to conjure them to procure for mr berkeleys perusal a small volume that she persuaded herself would pour balm into his humble contrite spirit these excellent ladies incessantly procuring comforts for his agonized stomach and well knowing how constantly and how frequently mr berkeley read and studied the book of books as good bishop ridley at the stake termed the book of god omitted to comply with mrs berkeleys request they then never having perused that exquisite little volume which mr berkeleys mother on finishing and closing it almost involuntarily exclaimed my god i desire to praise thy mercy that thou have permitted me to live to read this incomparable little book it expounds some parts of scripture differently from what many modern divines of the church of england understand them although perfectly consonant to the articles of the church of england and written by one of her brightest ornaments who may be termed as the evangelical bishop hall used to style his seraphic friend the honorable robert boil  a lay bishop mrs berkeley knowing that her son dreaded any thing that he conceived might open a door to licentiousness and she equally dreading any thing that might lead him to despair of gods mercy through christ to all true penitents for some days forbore to produce this invaluable little volume one morning after breakfast sitting in mr berkeleys room he said  my dear madam i wish you would be so good as to read to me  mrs berkeley  what shall i read my dear  mr b  something good  mrs b  shall i read in the bible  mr b  no morsey has just been reading that to me  mrs b  what then my dear do you choose  mr b  why pray read to me some of your own books  by your own books mr berkeley meant either roman or hervey etc mrs berkeley then drew the little volume out of her pocket and began she had not read far before mr berkeley put back his curtain and said  pray my dear madam whose book is that  mrs b  it is mine my dear  mr b  yes yes i know that you know what i mean who is the writer  mrs b  why do you ask my dear do you like it  mr b  yes most exceedingly pray tell me who is the author  mrs b  why my dear it is written by my excellent old friend sir richard hill  he then exclaimed oh best of mothers do not make an antinomian of your poor son for if you do he is lost for ever  mrs b  my dear child sir richard hill is no more an antinomian than your mother and you have long known her horror of that dreadful doctrine of devils as i have always told you till a certain text can be expunged from scripture no real christian can become an antinomian without holiness no man shall see the lord  mr b  pray proceed  on the monday he requested mrs berkeley to read out of it again and one day asking her to read to him she replied my dear i have just laid it out of my pocket on the table in my own room he replied  but best of mothers you can have the goodness to go and fetch it which request was of course instantly complied with he frequently exclaimed it is a wonderful book surely the title  the deep things of god or milk and strong meat mrs berkeley every day immediately on quitting her sons room wrote under many of the numbers mr berkeleys comments upon them she has had that incomparable identical book most elegantly bound gilt etc and poor as she is would not take five hundred pounds for it if it may be permitted us to compare small things with great that excellent kind unwearied friend one of the trustees to mrs berkeleys marriage settlement is now perpetually laboring to assist his old friend in her worldly concerns her multiplicity of ugly businesses as he was to assist her angelic son with his spiritual aid   about ten days before his lamented death his mother sitting in her usual place close to his pillow he thus addressed her my dear madam i have a favor to beg of you pray promise me that you will grant it my dear child you know that if it is any thing in my power you may command it it is that you will promise me faithfully to send a copy of this book over to ireland for it is a book of a very extraordinary nature indeed  the most wonderful book surely that ever was written by man uninspired and god knows they lamentably want it in that poor country as well as in this mrs berkeley enquired to whom he wished her to send it he mentioned a particular old friend of his father for whom mr berkeley had a very great and unfeigned regard mrs berkeley promised him that if it pleased god to spare her life she certainly would send it without fail  the evening immediately preceding mr berkeleys happy departure as mrs berkeley was sitting by his bed side he fell into a sweet sleep a servant came to announce to her that tea was made she went silently out of the room in a few minutes he awoke and enquired of his servant where is my mother just gone down to tea sir go down and give my duty to her and say that when she has quite done drinking her tea i beg to speak with her mrs berkeley instantly obeyed the summons he kindly reproached her for having come so quickly saying he feared she had not taken her tea which he knew was her favorite refreshment in comfort on being assured that she had done he began my dearest mother i beg that you will have the goodness to promise me solemnly that you will send that excellent book over to ireland my dear i did promise you about a fortnight ago that i would certainly send it if i lived did i ever in my life from your infancy break any promise good or bad that i made to you or to your dear brother no never i believe in your whole life but i thought perhaps that you might promise me as a dy he was going to say it is supposed as a dying man he stopped short thinking it would too tenderly affect his almost brokenhearted mother and proceeded to say to pacify me and make me easy again repeating it is a most extraordinary wonderful book surely  mr berkeley might most happily term it such for it was that alone by the mercy of god that could that did enable him to triumph over the king of terrors  mrs frinsham used frequently when visiting at dr berkeleys to say to her sister i am surprised your children are ever terrified you promise them a whipping or a starving so she termed a dinner of potatoes and water for it injures childrens stomachs to fast entirely or go to bed supperless in so very good humoured a voice that i wonder they ever believe you mrs berkeley used to assure her that there was no need of uttering the promise in the tone of a fishwoman as they well knew whatever the voice was the threat would infallibly be executed  a curious little anecdote of mr berkeleys early entering into characters occurred when he was just turned six years old one day mrs frinsham and dr berkeley going down the southcote walk he gallopped by them whipping his horse a fine long stick saying miss frinsham i am to dine upon bread and water today his two relatives both made up of tenderness lamentably exclaimed oh i hope not go and beg pardon oh that will not do to which his father replied oh my dear go and try to coax your mamma with a look of ineffable scorn he replied oh my dear sir you dont know my mamma when once she has said imitating the exact tone always as slow as a sentence could be uttered and with all the solemnity of an excellent judge on the bench in which the threat was denounced berkeley you shall dine to day upon bread and water if the king was to come and go down upon both his knees doctor and mrs berkeley being very oldfashioned persons in some things their children constantly asking their parents blessing every morning and night were never suffered to kneel on both knees mrs berkeleys father never suffering her to do it always saying never fall on both your knees but to your father in heaven he is king of kings  lord of lords you cannot humble yourselves enough to him asking a parents blessing is now quite obsolete the editor has very frequently seen her old hereditary friend the agreeable learned author of christianity not founded on argument alas for him poor man on his arrival from his own seat in surrey at his pious mothers house in berks constantly drop on his knee previously to his taking notice of any one before his mothers chair she was lame saying madam i beg your blessing  this it must be known was out of respect to her  mr berkeley that he might obtain a parents intercession with god to her she would not pardon me my mamma is not like you  when i am naughty take and give me a good hearty shake or two and scold me for a minute or two and then forget it directly the idea of his majestys intercession being vain was a lucky one or perhaps as his majesty in hunting frequently passed through dr berkeleys grounds this extraordinary little genius might have thrown himself in his way he had been told that nobody must ever turn their backs on the king when about five years old walking one evening with his mother and miss leigh a relation of hers in kensington gardens he on a sudden began walking backwards presently saying dear ladies why do you not walk backwards some gentleman passed whom he supposed to be his majesty whom he had then never seen but to return  mr berkeley felt that he had broken gods law had fallen into temptation and considering that he had received a thoroughly pious education as he used to tell his consoling mother when she repeatedly applied to his broken contrite spirit that glorious promise though your sins be as scarlet etc and that infinitely gracious one of our eternal coequal savior god him that comes unto me i will in no wise cast out  come unto me all ye that are weary and heavy laden and i will refresh you alas my dear mother i have been a more grievous sinner than others because i have had a more pious education than most persons but blessed for ever blessed be the astonishing love of god the comforter this blessed little book poured the balm of perfect peace of joy into his lovely wounded spirit and he wished others to be consoled by it  one morning after all fear of vengeance on account of the broken law of god was quite done away by his mercy who is mighty to save and who trod the wine press alone mrs berkeley going into the room as was her custom enquired if he had passed a tolerable night his reply was i have had great pain and have not closed my eyes one minute since i saw you but i have been in heaven blessed be the mercy of god a few mornings afterward the same anxious enquiry was answered in the very same words with this addition surely my dearest mother it is not an illusion of my grand enemy to lull me into security so watchful was he against deceiving himself especially in the concerns of his soul to which his mother earnestly replied no my dear child no that god whom you have labored so zealously so faithfully to serve although he has permitted you to fall to show you your own frailty yet he will never suffer the enemy of souls to delude you besides my dearest creature what can the devil hope to gain by you in your present helpless languishing state unless he could tempt you to blaspheme or despair as you lie stretched on a bed of languishing and blessed be the free grace of god he has never yet been able to do either the one or the other no my dear son god has vouchsafed in infinite mercy to lift up the light of his reconciled countenance upon you to answer the constant fervent prayers of your poor unworthy mother and your own on this side the grave at two three or four nights distance mr berkeley had two or three more such blessed nights for which wonderfully gracious vouchsafement all glory be to free sovereign grace and redeeming love  the day before mr berkeleys death he discovered by what dr berkeley happened to drop that mrs berkeley had sat up the whole of the preceding night in the next room his eyes flashed with indignation and he instantly spoke to her concerning it as mrs berkeley never in the polite intercourse of life suffers herself to falsify a lady one day requested mrs berkeley to make a very fine madeup speech of excuse for her to some other lady to which mrs berkeley said would it not madam be better to tell the truth and say that really a multiplicity of engagements have rendered it inconvenient for you to go so far mr monck berkeley happening to be present remarked how little that good lady knows my mother why she will not tell a civil lie for my father or myself her idea is that many obliging polite kind friendly things may be said without sacrificing truth the worthy amiable mrs waller sister of the archdeacon of essex the friend of mrs berkeley from eight years old always says there is a real pleasure in hearing a polite thing from mrs berkeley for you may swear it comes from her heart  she was obliged at last to confess that she had reposed on the sopha in the drawing room he earnestly exclaimed good god so my dear mother is to kill herself for me that is at last to be the end of her and turning to his father he said ah my dear sir why would you suffer it dr berkeley replied my dear child your mother would have been wretched if i had interposed he then extorted a solemn promise from his mother that she would go to rest that night amiably adding and promise that you will undress and go into bed or i will not attempt to close my eyes all night mrs berkeley retired with a strict injunction to dr berkeleys and mr berkeleys own servant both of whom attended him with wonderful assiduity alternately lying in a tentbed in mr berkeleys room and sitting up with him that she would never forgive them if they perceived the least change in mr berkeley and did not instantly call her up  on the morning of january    mr berkeleys servant knocked at the chamber door saying that he came with his masters duty and desired dr berkeley would go down and pray with him dr berkeley instantly arose and went down just as mrs berkeley had put on some of her clothes dr berkeley returned announcing the heavy tidings that they had lost their earthly treasure mrs berkeley although having ever earnestly wished and prayed to witness the last moments of all those beloved relations she is doomed to survive submitted in she humbly trusts profound silence to the will of the allwise disposer of all events acting as well as daily praying thy will be done in me on me and by me mr berkeley in a letter to his mother during his illness says i trust i have learned my dearest mothers prayer thy will etc mrs berkeley sunk again into her bed just as the clock struck nine she exclaimed to dr berkeley if ever i heard berkeley cough in my life he has coughed this minute alas my dear no you will never hear him any more on earth mrs berkeleys maid entered at that instant saying that mr berkeley was come to life again and wished to see mrs berkeley it may be easily supposed that she was not long in getting down stairs where she saw her dear son looking like an angel his fine eyes as lively as when in perfect health and for about a fortnight before his death his nose became so exactly like the beautiful one of his two grandfathers bishop berkeley and mr frinsham both having the same fineshaped nose that he looked remarkably beautiful the same change after death took place in the same feature of dr berkeleys wonderfully beautiful face such changes are said by the learned men of the faculty often to happen a few hours before the separation of the spirit from the earthly mould  dr and mr monck berkeley both wanted what mrs berkeley always termed the genuine berkeley nose and which her own father without being a berkeley had the present countess dowager of granard has it when the beautiful lady georgiana berkeley she was a fac simile of a wonderfully fine ivory medallion taken of bishop berkeley at rome when a young man dr berkeley used to say to mr berkeley aye your nose is a judgment upon your mother for despising mine because it is not like my fathers mr monck berkeley had from pictures in berkeley castle and from monuments drawings of all his noble ancestors and used to show his mother some few with a short nose to which she used to reply aye some ugly mother has introduced it when doctor berkeley in the case of the late brave admiral b as plain as he was valiant his lady one of the most beautiful women in europe  the sons all resembling the mother the very clever worthy daughters the good admiral  observed what a pity it is that those poor girls have all got such an horrid dash of their father in their faces the young ladies are all well married and make as excellent wives as their beautiful mother the worthy veteran used to say i never thought my wife handsome until dr berkeley talked so much of her beauty i know she was a very good wife  mr berkeley who always greatly delighted in the psalms desired those of the day both morning and evening might be read to him in which he joined the evening psalms of the   th day of the month conclude the exixth psalm mr berkeley felt the whole well suited to his state particularly the last verse his father prayed with him the family attending and pronounced at the request of his mother that delightful absolution of the excellent church of england in her office for the visitation of the sick he appeared so much revived that his friends all quitted the room a little before noon except his mother the medical gentlemen who attended having given it as their opinion that he would remain until about ten at night in about half an hour his mother perceiving that speaking seemed rather painful to him and that he breathed rather quicker said we will pray and taking out of her pocket bishop halls excellent little book of devotions for all occasions and all relations in life from which she petitioned at the throne of grace for her son as soon as his soul the breath of  entered his body she now when she conceived it was returning to god prostrated herself by the bedside and his servant at the foot of the bed when oh the wonderful goodness of christ she was enabled to offer that fine prayer for one just departing out of this world with a distinct voice and without one falling tear which she well knew would have thrown her son into extreme agony mr berkeley from a child of three years old could never support the sight of his mother in tears had she chosen to condescend to practice art and have wept she might have managed her son as she pleased from three to almost thirty years old after his arrival at cheltenham observing the tears standing in her eyes he exclaimed to his father oh my dear sir this is too much for me to support i have all my life since i knew how to pray besought god to inflict any suffering upon me but that of seeing my dear mother in tears dr berkeley replied my dear can you suppose that your mother much command as she has over herself must not sometimes be overcome mrs berkeley wiped her eyes and cheerfully said my dear shall i get a mask   any thing best of mothers to prevent my seeing your tears i never could bear it in my health and strength mr berkeley when a youth once said  my mother never laughs  to which his father replied well if your mother never laughs herself she makes us laugh very often and that is more to our purpose than if she did we have this comfort that she never weeps without real cause  mr berkeley joined in that fine prayer the lords prayer and the lord lift up the light of his reconciled countenance etc mrs berkeley then seated herself by her sons pillow he fixed his still fine eyes most tenderly upon her for about two minutes then closed them she conceiving that he was resolved his poor unworthy mother should be the last earthly object they should behold he then without calling for the assistance of his servant turned himself quite round to the other side of his bed laid his arms down by his side and made himself quite ready for his coffin then uttered three distinct aspirations as was conceived to that coequal triune god in whom he had ever so firmly believed from the age of fifteen after a little time one single deep breath to  as was supposed his lovely spirit winged its happy flight to the realms of bliss there may all who loved him in gods appointed time join him in casting their crowns before the throne and singing worthy is the lamb etc thus ended the short  long  life of george monck berkeley esquire leaving his parents to  what shall i say  deplore their irreparable loss they could hardly be so selfish and as lord  a near relation of his father and sir   an old intimate friend both with one consent although in very distant parts said in their letters to mrs berkeley it is hardly possible to condole one must rather exult with you on so happy so delightful an exit and his mother has often asserted that if a wish would restore to her the sweet society of her beloved son and husband she would not be selfish enough  wicked enough  to form that wish  mr berkeley prayed fervently to god for three things and he that hears the prayers of the contrite heard and answered him  first that the agonies of his stomach might cease one week before he quitted this mortal life oh spare me a little that i may recover my strength before i go hence and be no more seen  the mercy of god graciously ordered that they ceased just ten days before his death and instead of that craving for fruits and acids he rather wished to avoid taking any thing not even orange and lemon jelly so as to occasion his mothers one day saying my dear man if you do not take a little nourishment you will be a suicide to which he hastily replied oh god for jesus sake avert he then took the glass of jelly from her hand and said i will take any thing you wish  going into his room one morning he as usual enquired kindly of mrs berkeley concerning her health to which she replied as well my dear as i can expect to be with this horrid weather frost has ever been exceedingly inimical to mrs berkeleys health he with the mildest sweetest voice said my dear mother is it quite right in us to find fault with any weather or any thing that god pleases to send us a few years ago an irish gentleman of fortune of cork published a long letter in the st jamess chronicle on the same idea it may perhaps be wrong but one has from childhood been accustomed to say unreproved what horrid or what vile weather this is  secondly that he might not die in the night or in his sleep  he expired exactly at noon the sun shining more remarkably bright and clear than is at all usual at that season of the year  thirdly that he might retain his senses perfectly to the very last breath he drew how graciously that petition was answered has been above related  monsieur le moyne in a beautiful little work which i believe is not translated into english says  la mer nous represent la bonte du bon dieu au penitents  la mer toujours sort pour rencontre les rivieres etc  mr berkeley was too well known in the metropolises of these three kingdoms to make a particular description of his person necessary suffice it therefore to say that the beauty of his face by no means equalled that of his exquisitely beautiful father and his still handsomer grandfather bishop berkeley he more resembled in face and stature his mothers father the thoroughly excellent reverend henry frinsham am esteemed when at oxford and till debilitated by illness the strongest bestbuilt man in england mr frinsham and his grandson were both six feet high without their shoes each took care not be indebted to them for additional height both their strength was muscular both having remarkably small bones mr berkeley was much handsomer than mr frinsham excepting his nose mr frinsham going once to dine with a friend at a gentlemans house one servant was observed not to move when any thing was called for on being asked sharply why he did not exchange plates etc he exclaimed i cannot do any thing for looking at that gentlemans mr frinshams beautiful nose mr berkeley strongly resembled both his grandfathers and bore none or very slight resemblance to either of his parents mr berkeley could not look into a glass without perceiving that he did not resemble his father his agreeable wit used to divert his friends by saying some poor simple person now and then meaning to flatter my mother says dear madam how much mr berkeley resembles the doctor i who know le desous des carts see my mother redden and answer oh dear sir or madam not the least in the world  sometimes a simpler soul says madam i think mr berkeley is very like you  the first was bad enough but now i can fancy i see my mother getting her knuckles ready to knock them down  mrs berkeley used often to laugh and say berkeley how is it that with very fine eyes etc an exquisitely fine complexion the finest teeth ever set in a head and very fine hair and a wellshaped face you are not handsome a most highly accomplished sensible intimate friend of mr berkeleys mother the lady of d m esquire used often to say to mrs berkeley if you tell him before me that he is not handsome i will knock you down  all the ladies and men say he is handsome  dont mind berkeley what your mother says because you dont happen to be just like your father  the great beauty of his face his eyes much larger which were decorated with his fathers beautiful dark eyebrows and eyelashes mr monck berkeleys eyelashes were so remarkably long as often when he was a lad to entangle and distress him when reading a decoration of face to which he was indebted as well as his brother to their mother who constantly cut them with a fine pair of scissors twice every moon it is an infallible method of rendering them long and thick with mr berkeley it was attended with some little difficulty from the extreme volatility of his motions dr berkeley and all her intimate friends thought her the most daring of spirits to venture to do it before mr berkeley could listen to reason it was then done when he was in a sound sleep afterward with the following exhortation  now child stand as still as a statue for if you move your finger or your eye the least in the world in go the scissors and out goes your eye well but then i shall have one left  no you will not for when one is gone the other generally goes soon after it and you will never get eyes again until your body rises out of the grave at the day of judgment and you will be always all your life in the dark  much as mr berkeley loved in childhood to be in motion this eloquent oration had as much weight as if it had been uttered by a burke   dr berkeleys family once attending some friends of theirs of too high rank to be left entirely to the verger of the week to view the curiosities of the magnificent cathedral of canterbury on reaching the tomb of the black prince the sword was taken out as usual and delivered to the company to admire when going to be again deposited within the iron railing mr berkeley took it into his hands and drew it with as much ease as he would have drawn his own sword mrs preston the vergers wife exclaimed good lord sir what have you done mr berkeleys mother instantly said i hope no harm my dear berkeley why would you draw it without asking if it was permitted to be drawn  harm madam replied the worthy woman mr berkeley has done no harm if he has not hurt himself adding well sir i suppose i have seen more than an hundred gentlemen attempt to draw that sword but no one ever accomplished it with one hand but yourself mrs berkeleys alarm then subsided and she replied he has his mothers and grandfathers wonderful strength of wrist so entirely muscular was his strength that a short time before his death that wrist that could lift a man nearly as tall as himself by the collar of the coat did not measure half an inch more than his mothers who is a very little woman  mr monck berkeleys person altogether made what persons usually term a very fine looking young man he was so exactly proportioned that he never appeared a tall man except when standing in a groupe he had a most graceful figure and was esteemed the finest dancer of his stature in england at the famous masquerade given by the late lord barrymore at wargrove where mr berkeley appeared as an highland chief most completely elegantly equipped purse claymore dirk etc every thing but the kelt insted of which he wore the trowse two masks accosted him with lord are you for a highland reel mr berkeley instantly gave his claymore to a gentleman to hold stepped forward and they began a threesome reel in which the superiority of mr berkeleys dancing was so marked as to cause a very great personage who honored that most elegant masquerade with his presence to stand the whole time and to say at the expiration of that beautiful dance when well danced by scots that mr berkeley was the finest figure and the finest dancer he had ever seen and praise from those who excel in any art is praise  mr berkeley although not regularly handsome had perhaps one of the most pleasing countenances any where to be seen  a look of the deepest thought enlightened by the sweetest mildest benevolence and when called forth brightened by the liveliest chastized gaiety which has caused some of the first characters for learning and sense to assert that mr monck berkeley was the most agreeable companion they had ever known that look of deep thought and exquisite benevolence seldom united in the same soul seldomer blended in the same countenance are so astonishingly preserved in the beautiful portrait painted by his beloved friend mr peters and by that thoroughly amiable gentleman presented to mrs berkeley after her sons death as to delight all who have a soul capable of enjoying the beauties of an exquisite painting the print prefixed to the poems is taken from that exquisite painting but engraving cannot give the soul like painting mrs berkeley esteems herself rich in a most beautiful miniature of her unspeakably dear son so small as constantly to be carried in the pocket taken from mr peterss portrait by the wonderful the magic pencil of her excellent accomplished friend miss johnson of the paddockhouse near canterbury whoever has an eye for fine painting and has been treated with a fight of that ladys performances must be sensible of the happiness of possessing one of a dear departed friend it can hardly be said departed he is present and does every thing but articulate such obligations are not to be repaid the mines of brazil if possessed are not adequate mrs berkeley was some years ago indebted to the same exquisite pencil for a bracelet of her youngest son done entirely from memory for two indifferent pictures of that beautiful child rather confused than assisted  at the kings school at canterbury a common amusement of the lower school was playing at judge and jury counsel were regularly retained to plead on each side by accident dr berkeley discovered the value that was set on his sons oratorical powers in that mimic court on first hearing of it from the amiable beloved friend of his son the late mr thurlow son of lord thurlow whose play hours were constantly spent under the hospitable roof of dr berkeley who enquiring how the counsel were feed he replied oh we have all the same fee a halfpenny apiece excepting berkeley and he has always a penny a penny replied dr berkeley why should he have a penny i am sure he is not covetous  no no but they will give it him because they are sure to win their cause who have berkeley on their side  perhaps it may gratify some young gentlemen his schoolfelows in distant parts of the world and bring the happy innocent days of very early youth to their remembrance if they should glance their eye over this to see their names at the head of this list stands dear angelichearted mr thurlow the gentle elegant captain colombine of the navy the lively sprightly samuel chambers of woodstockhouse kent the reverend stephen tucker mr charles hasted osborne tylden esquire of  court in kent mr gregory now in the wiltshire militia  son of the reverend mr gregory of canterbury the reverend cooper willyams of itning mr mark thomas son of the famous alderman thomas the thoroughly respectable worthy reverend sir henrypix heyman baronet shame to tell with only a living or rather a starving of about sixty pounds per annum bestowed on him by the bounty of his present grace of canterbury for until lately that very respectable ancient young baronet had only a curacy  happily for him he inherits some fortune from his mother  the vast family estate except what was left to charity all went in the reigns of the stuarts sir henry heyman may read emphatically put not your trust in princes the greatgrandfather of his friend mr monck berkeley is said to have left his curse on his latest descendant who should ever expend a shilling in the service of any king mr berkeleys father hazarded it it is almost incredible what it cost him to advertize his famous sermon preached on the   st of january to endeavor to prevent a reform in parliament  twenty guineas for advertizing it in one particular newspaper besides frequently in some others and in all country papers  presenting a copy to every member of both houses whom to use his own expression he thought had sense enough to understand it it went through five editions within four weeks as the doctor mentioned to a friend a little time before his lamented death a sixth edition was very lately printed consisting of one thousand copies which were all dispersed gratis amongst traders etc to try to teach poor fools to know when they are well  it had been always said that dr berkeleys grandfather the right honorable john forster of forest near dublin during the reign of queen anne his exertions for the house of hanover were so well known that the speaker of the irish house of commons was every day for some years the first toast at the palace of herenhausen and so grateful was king george the first for his essential services that on arriving in london he said the first man i will prefer is the speaker of the irish house of commons this grateful prince offered any and every thing together with a peerage little was accepted as his fortune was very large and the peerage gratefully declined his majesty said i will promote all your brothers sir the speaker had an only brother younger than himself a senior fellow of dublin college with a maternal estate of fifteen hundred pounds per annum who begged to decline the burden of a bishopric being a very sickly man but his majesty insisted on inflicting it on him for which the poor of raphoe ought to bless his memory for they even to this day eat bread meat and potatoes at a very reduced price bishop forster at his death bequeathing a very large sum annually out of his estates for ever his conduct through life and at death was such as to make his witty successor the only wit of his family for generations say it is not polite to name my predecessor in my presence we are such a contrast set the present family on the throne and that his father in the rebellion in      bishop berkeleys letter to the roman catholics of the diocese of cloyne for which he received the thanks of all the roman catholic clergy in ireland in the public papers was at that time universally supposed to have prevented the people of that persuasion from rising and joining the chevalier de st george and by their vast superiority in point of numbers placing him on the throne of ireland and the stuart family had then a great many concealed friends in england who lay perdue till they saw which side was likely to prove victorious a very worthy gentleman one of the younger brothers of bishop berkeley a most excellent officer used often to say i will never incur my grandfathers curse my brother may do what he pleases this gentleman father to four very worthy ladies all still living was commander in chief in the year      in the county kingdom as it is often called of fife it will easily be supposed that it afforded no small pleasure to dr and mr monck berkeley to have it frequently asked if they were at all related to that delightfully humane kind officer who commanded in fife in the rebellion numerous instances of his humanity were related to them dr berkeley said he had often heard that brave veteran relate with tears in his eyes one adventure going to the castle of the father of the present worthy earl of  no men appeared but the countess came out with an infant at her breast fell down on her knees at his feet and conjured him for christs sake not to deprive her of two small cows all that was left to keep her seven children and three female servants from perishing by famine he conjured her to rise and told her ladyship that so far from driving her cows he would station a few of his soldiers not in but near her castle to protect her from all injury the present earls gratitude was shown by the most marked attention to dr berkeley and his family during their sejour in fife fixed them there and that generous disinterested nobleminded man used to say by the blessing of god i will try to keep them there dr berkeley as well as his father and grandfather was a very great politician the sermon was preached in canterbury cathedral on monday january    and by the orders and contrivance of the preacher and active acuteness of the wellknown alderman simmons of canterbury sold in todds shop at york on the next thursday in order to defeat wyvilles meeting at that place which to the great delight of dr berkeley it accomplished  dr berkeley never asked during his life but two favors of ministry  equal to the exchanging two halfcrowns for five shillings or two sixpences for a shilling both however were too great to be granted to the grandson of the speaker of the irish house of commons  to the son of bishop berkeley when his son left canterbury school he wished to exchange his stall at canterbury for either windsor or westminster to superintend the education of his son at one of those schools he preferred windsor some years after on his sons leaving eton he again requested an exchange for a stall at christ church but met with similar success  the exquisite amiability of mr berkeleys nature not his temper that being naturally wilful in some sort rugged was reformed by education regenerated by grace his nature as has been shown was thoroughly noble uncommonly generous he had by both his parents from infancy been bred up with an horror of being what is called a tuft hunter at oxford or a sneaking lord courter at eton his real nobility of blood little needed such cautions  soon after his going to the kings school at canterbury there came to board at dr beauvoirs mr thurlow only son of the late lord chancellor thurlow by miss lynch daughter of the charitable hospitable dean lynch dean lynch preserved the poor of canterbury from starving as they have since done by ordering five hundred pounds worth of silk damask to be wove and entirely new furnished the deanery it raised that excellent trade which the muslin misses have since totally annihilated those who have witnessed the distress of the poor silk weavers their wives and children are not to be pitied when burnt to death by flimsey muslin gowns and draggled linen petticoats  and sister to the late accomplished sir william and to the happiness of the poor and distressed or oppressed the present reverend dr lynch prebendary of canterbury each of these gentlemen inherited a very large share of both their parents extraordinarily charitable disposition as did the late lovely mrs hey and mrs tatton their sisters mr thurlow then about eight years old just half a year younger than mr berkeley was sent from under the protection of his sensible wonderfully kind adopting father the reverend mr hey of wickham whose lady abovenamed was his mothers eldest sister the writer cannot proceed without heaving a sigh and dropping a tear of friendship over the urn of that most sensible interesting of youths the only son of dear thurlows earthly guardian angel mr hey she still feels pleasure in recollecting how often he used to say is it not very odd that although i have uncles aunts and many kind relations who are very good to me yet i always feel myself more at home at dr berkeleys he was about fifteen a youth of a very singular turn of mind endowed with all his fathers great understanding and all the real mild not affected gentleness of his lovely mother a strong tincture of melancholy was visible to even a common observer as a child at home it was said he never loved to play at school he never played at cricket etc longer than ten minutes then retired to read mrs berkeleys wish to delight the mother of an only child occasioned her telling her servants that whenever mrs heys carriage came to dr berkeleys some servant man or woman must go immediately to dr beauvoirs where he boarded to fetch master hey both mother and son felt more than this little motherly attention merited mrs berkeley told master hey when he felt himself lowspirited and had no more agreeable place to take his tea he would find it in her dressing room at six where he would sometimes enjoy the very improving conversation of that accomplished that wise director of young men dr berkeley if not he might dissipate his gloom a little by hearing her raileries on his gravity etc at fifteen mrs berkeley having been in the same predicament herself at twelve with a youth of thirteen dear johnny as he was always called by dr and mrs berkeley had contrived very early in life before he was thirteen to form an attachment that did not contribute to dissipate the natural gloom of his mind although it often exhilarated him  the youngest daughter of the celebrated mr airson although very far from handsome was blessed with so very fine an understanding that all the uncommonly sensible youths and even lads were her devoted admirers as others were of the great beauty of dr beauvoirs eldest daughter now married to william hammond esquire of the friars canterbury miss airson died at the age of nineteen mrs berkeley used to say of her that she had understanding enough to set up a large country town her gratitude was great indeed that very scarce virtue growing only in an humble heart and cherished by a strong head for what she deemed the condescending attentions of mrs berkeley to her her father being a minor where mrs berkeleys husband was a major although very kindly treated at canterbury to what they are in most other cathedrals and choirs norwich excepted the minorcanons and schoolmasters their wives and daughters are in a very different line of company in general their original fortunes and always their church incomes are undoubtedly so much inferior as not to make them wish to mix mrs berkeley on being once reproached by a prebendarys lady for introducing miss airsons at her routs and being intimate with their elegant sweet mother made this laconic reply why my dear madam mrs airsons father had almost as many thousands a year as my father had hundreds and if mrs airson chose to marry the first singer in the world a clergyman and a gentleman rather than a foolish ignoramus in a red coat does that make her conversation the less pleasing to me should mrs airsons elegant accomplished  burton esquire of shropshire nephew with his noble estate offer to any prebendarys daughter i dare say she would not refuse him i have no daughter thank god so am not courting mrs airson for her nephew mr airson and his family were so highly so universally respected that their small house was the resort of all persons of fashion and good sense the late amiable bishop of norwich when dean of canterbury would often when walking out say come my dear madam suppose we go to johnnys coffeehouse mr airson a great invalid never dined or even drank tea from home he never confined his lady or daughters they well knew he would not pass his afternoons alone his piety almost equalled his musical powers which he never would use except in a private room to his friends but in the house of that god who bestowed them it used sometimes to be said that mr airson was indolent and did not sing a fine anthem when asked if he thought himself ill he used to say ask mrs berkley if i ever in my life when able to go to church refused singing any anthem when she desired it of me mrs berkeley herself had an idea of not riding a free horse to death  handel offered him eight hundred pounds per annum if he would only sing in the oratorios in lent but he refused it it is somewhat remarkable that the sunday after his very sudden death the late bishop of norwich then dean of canterbury lamented his loss and celebrated his virtues in similar words to those used by the writer of this preface in the canterbury paper the preceding day when lamenting the loss of that cheerful gay heavenlyminded friend whom she had so far en gaiete de coeur prevailed on to accompany her as far as his hall in her way to a rout at his next door neighbors saying she should attract all eyes and receive the thanks of all the company his gentle amiable eldest daughter then his all since married to mr allen of hereford her mother and sister being gone objected to his having on his old coat and begging him to put on his smart new one to this mrs berkeley strongly objected saying it might tender as he was occasion his taking cold had he gone she would ever have reproached herself as the cause of his universally lamented death  it is now more than high time to return from this too long digression but the reciting the virtues of beloved respected friends now beyond the reach of any other attentions is apt in a heart susceptible of sincere regard for real worth to give the pen a disorder which the french apply to the tongue of one who talks too much il a une flux de langue the writer often feels la flux de plume she is sometimes tempted to form the wish of an old friend of hers whose husband made her she being a ready penwoman write much for him  well i do wish i had never been taught to write at all perhaps the readers of this may form it for her but it is not necessary to read the whole of every book and to use the language of holy writ they may  separate the precious from the vile they may read the fine poetry of the author and pass over the indifferent prose of the editor  whenever mr monck berkeley observed any boy who boarded at either of the masters never invited out to dinner on holidays he would say to his mother pray my dear madam next holiday invite poor such an one and such an one poor things they have no relations or acquaintance here to invite them and it is very dull for them pray be so good as to let them come here this whether they were his intimates or not indeed his intimates seldom did come having most of them parents in the church or city excepting sometimes the reverend cooper willyams of ixning son of the very worthy captain and mrs willyams and captain gregory of the wiltshire militia son of the very learned reverend francis gregory of canterbury  mr thurlow happened to come to school in the beginning of summer when all his uncles and aunts usually resident in canterbury during the winter had retired to their country residences mr berkeley soon presented his humble petition to his mother that he might bring thurlow home sometimes the request was granted and the good disposition the propriety the docility the worthiness of mr thurlow soon endeared him so much to mrs berkeley that she told her son he might bring thurlow but no other boy without asking her permission whenever he pleased the dear child generally drank tea every evening in winter at dr berkeleys for in summer they are all over the hills and far away when he was a little more than nine years old he like his friend mr berkeley was sent to france for several months to acquire the french language in perfection at his return he gave a proof of the exquisite sensibility of his heart a short character and sincere lamentation of this early not untimely  for gods time is ever the best time death of this beloved young gentleman was inserted by his friend mrs berkeley in bristows canterbury journal it fell short in describing his amiability but the editor cannot let a beloved friend whether young or old quit this mortal scene without paying that little tribute to their memory  when she sees it neglected by abler pens  on his arrival in england he went from dover for a short time to the house of his kind patron mr hey who soon brought him to canterbury for a day the instant he got out of the carriage he flew to the oaks knocked at the door and begged he might be shown up to mrs berkeley being told she was in bed with a bad headache he expressed much concern and enquired what time she would rise the servant replied most likely to dinner as she never continued in bed when not exceedingly ill at a little before the dinner hour he came mrs berkeley not risen about five in the afternoon he called again and hearing mrs berkeley was not up begged to see her own maid whom he thus addressed pray be so good as to go up to mrs berkeley and give my tenderest love to her tell her i long so much to see her that i beg she will permit me to go up and stand a few minutes at her bed side as i shall not be in canterbury again these four days the servant came up mrs berkeley said she was very sorry but hoped she should be able to see him the next time he came the servant replied dear madam he is but a child and he longs so to see you it will half break his heart if he does not  well poor dear child let him come up then the moment he reached the bed side he caught mrs berkeleys hand kissed it and bursting into tears kneeled down and after sobbing some time said i hope my dear madam that you are not dangerously ill mrs berkeley with her usual good spirits in illness replied no my dear charles i hope in god i am not i have the old proverb on my side that naught is never in danger what would not some persons give for a son with such an heart and a most excellent head during his last lingering illness at the house of his excellent uncle the amiable generous kindhearted dr lynch prebendary of canterbury where every thing that kindness could suggest and cleverness could execute was prepared for him he would perpetually say go to next door with my best regards to mrs berkeley and beg her to send me something whatever she pleases out of her storeroom i know i can eat that mr berkeleys earnest request to his mother who was to reach canterbury after their arrival from scotland many weeks before he could being obliged to keep term at the temple was pray learn and write me word immediately whether thurlow is returned to england and if he is where i may find him mrs berkeley who used laughingly to say she was as obedient a mother after mr berkeley grew up as she had made him a son in his childhood and youth obeyed and soon executed her commission and mr berkeley and mr thurlow came down in the same chaise one to the oaks the other to wickham on christmas eve the most dreadful cold snowing day one can remember both were almost literally frozen when they arrived at dr berkeleys and it was an alarming time before they seemed to feel any effect from what was given them  dr and mrs berkeley reproached mr berkeley for not stopping all night at the palace of mr simpson the rose at sittingbourne where every comfort convenience and elegance is to be found from the excellent master mistress and the wonderfully worthy chambermaid mrs mary humphreys as a proof of her worthiness one night when dr berkeleys family slept there mrs berkeleys maid said madam the maid you admire so much for her care and honesty has just now gone up into a gentlemans room and made him rise saying that the underchambermaid had mistaken her and put him into a wrong bed not sufficiently aired but that the other was quite ready begged his pardon for her deputys carelessness that she was attending to your beds and thought the other could not have mistaken but that she could never have forgiven herself had she ever put any one into an halfaired bed oh that all innservants were as careful the writer of this note has twice once in france and once in england suffered from want of such care this worthy womans education was singular she is by birth a native of wales being her fathers tenth child the worthy minister of the parish having no child of his own said he would take her as a tithechild under the roof of this humane worthy minister of christ she grew up and remained till his death she certainly does not disgrace her education received under the roof in the kitchen for he was too wise to bring up a labourers daughter as a gentlewoman  to starve or become a streetwalker  it however pleased the mercy of god that the two friends received not the least injury from this frightful journey to adopt the language of the excellent monsieur de pontis in his delightfully entertaining although pious memoires which that execrable monster voltaire has tried to persuade fools and atheists is a fable notwithstanding madame de sevigne mentions his death etc at the time god waited for them elsewhere for dear thurlow was doomed to fall an early victim to english inhospitality as himself related to dr berkeley whom he had so frequently heard celebrated the lovely hospitality of scotland i owe said he my present illness to the want of it in england i had been out hunting was caught in a violent storm was quite wet through called at a gentlemans where i hoped to have been taken in i was offered wine and brandy the butler called but no offer of a bed for a few hours or of going in to dry my clothes so after having sat on my horse the storm over at the gate in cold wet clothes i proceeded to cambridge and went to my rooms but the cold fixed on my lungs and no skill has been able to remove it alas it not long after removed him and robbed his friends and the world of one of the most amiablehearted grateful of human beings adieu dear youth requiescat in pace  when mr thurlow was about eleven years old his uncle the bishop of durham then dean of rochester when passing through canterbury to the sea and conceiving his old friend dr berkeleys house to be the best as he knew it was the mrs berkeley who seldom leaves home for more than three hours at a time ie from six to nine in the evening nor wishes to see any friend unless traveling near her at any other time used to occasion mr monck berkeleys often saying if my aunt father and self were all dead my mother would never miss us until the servant announced to her that the urn was carried into the drawing room the trio all agreed to this charge on entering it she would ask where are they all and begin lamenting the loss of us mrs berkeley used often to be laughed at by dr berkeley and mrs frinsham for declaring that she ate her dinner quite as well alone as in the best company when dr berkeley at the age of twentyfour took from christ church the little living of asgarton near the vale of white horse he found the house a hovel and having been bred in a palace he loved a good house however after laying out near four hundred pounds on the house and building a fine south wall in the garden finding it too small to lodge his few friends  the reverend james hamilton grandson of lord abercorne a constant delightful visitor through the whole summer at dr berkeleys at bray or acton until his removal by the late lord abercorne to a great living in ireland and some others together with a multitude of locusts  finding the vicarage too small he rented ley farm the country house of sir nathaniel nash until his removal to bray the bishop of durham then curate of wantage was a very constant frequent visitor there cheapest inn in canterbury drove to the oaks no sooner was his arrival notified to mrs berkeley than she ordered mr wrightson to go and tell his master a person wanted to speak to him mrs berkeley conjured him to permit her to send to dr beauvoirs for dear charles dr berkeley with his usual good will to man and child complied john now mr wrightson as the best messenger was dispatched to beg that miss beauvoir would order master thurlow to be arrayed in his sunday garb and posted off to dr berkeleys notifying the cause mrs berkeley ordered mr wrightson to call out his master when the little man arrived accordingly in a few minutes dr berkeley looking like a beautiful guardianangel of those  little ones mentioned by our blessed lord entered the drawing room leading in his little protege whom he presented to the dean here my old friend is a very good little man who is very nearly related to you the dean looked about as eveille as usual stroked his head and asked him how he liked school and some other questions generally put to children in the afternoon he told him to stand by him at the cardtable and when the time arrived for charles to make his bow and return to dr beauvoirs the dean who had won about a guinea generously presented poor dear charles with two and sixpence for which he made one of his graceful french bows and retired they never met again until they met in the regions of departed spirits some persons have even doubted whether poor thurlow could be found worthy of a place to behold the glory of the angel of the church of durham the resemblance in face and person of mr thurlow to the bishop was remarkably striking to all the company allowing only that the tempers and dispositions of his mind were entirely lynch and wake which threw a look of benevolence into his features and countenance which did not appear in the bishops  about the year      there died at canterbury a very excellent young man an old schoolfellow of mr berkeleys mr george hasted son of the author of the history of kent on mr berkeleys arrival in vacationtime mrs berkeley asked her son if he was not afflicted at the death of his old intimate george hasted he replied i was very sorry for the death of so very worthy a young man but my dear mother he was never an intimate of mine he was much too studious and diligent for us was in quite another set he pitied us for our idleness and folly george hasted would never go to cricket or to bingley where the kings scholars swim in summer till he had done every tittle of his exercise we all set off and left it to chance to get our exercise done or if not done get a sound flogging had mr berkeley when a boy been told that nobody could learn latin or greek he would have studied night and day every night just before the family went to supper mrs berkeley used to go into both her little boys rooms to see whether they lay straight and in a wholesome posture which is of more consequence to children than people in general are aware of one night when mr berkeley was about five years old on entering the room she found his fine eyes wide open she asked him how he came to be awake and how he dared to have his eyes open  being always ordered to shut them when in bed or in a dark room he replied i have not been asleep at all i have been racking my brain to try to make a syllable without a vowel because you have always told me it was impossible to do it  and if i could have done it it would have made me very happy to have come and told you of it  tell him from five years old of any thing that it was impossible to accomplish and he was indefatigable in laboring at it his brother just the reverse perhaps never were two children born of the same father and mother more different mr berkeley would add always excepting my mother and her only sister  mr berkeley gay lively volatile yet wonderfully solid his brother sedate grave yet wonderfully witty both poets from the time they could articulate at all both enthusiastic admirers of music neither mr berkeley nor his brother were ever suffered to go to bingley to swim without their mothers leave mr berkeley used to come regularly when the masters had given permission to the boys with his request  mrs berkeley  i am afraid you will be drowned  mr b  no i shall not  mrs b  do any of the upper school go  mr b  yes  mrs b  who does mr j tucker or mr tilden go  mr b  yes  mrs b  well then go if you will but i am afraid you know herbert pack would have been drowned if young lofty had not saved him  down he sat and took up a book  well child why do not you go  mr b  no i shall not go  mrs b  why not now that i have given you leave  mr b  no i shall not indeed  mrs b  why what can i do more would you have me conduct you thither  mr b  no but i shall not take such a leave  mrs b  why what leave would you have  mr b  why say in your good humoured sweet voice yes my dear berkeley you may go to bingley this afternoon and i had rather you went than stayed at home or else i shall not go on any account  his brother coming with the same request and obtaining the forced permission would reply thank you my dear mamma fly out of the room scamper down stairs and set off lest the permission should be recalled leaving the door wide open and dart away under st johns arch when passed that he thought himself quite safe from being remanded yet he was governed by a silk thread whilst his dear brother required  a threefold cord  mr berkeley when a lad too old for correction would when his mother desired him not to go to such a place or do such a thing immediately reply well then my dear madam command me  command you my dear i do not love commanding i never wish to exert my authority i desire that you will not do it  yes i must all the desiring in the world will not do  that is very strange  i cannot help it why will not you say berkeley i command you not to do it  the magic words by his earnest desire being uttered he would say well now i am happy now i have not the least wish in the world to do it would not do it for any sum of money when he was about thirteen years old the news of the day was a runaway match of a young man of rank a gentleman visiting at dr berkeleys turned to mr monck berkeley and said aye in three or four years young squire you will be playing the same prank it is impossible for any one then present to forget the dignified solemnity of mr berkeleys countenance whilst he uttered the following reply no sir i hope not god forbid that i should ever do so important a thing as marry without the full consent of my parents  mr berkeley was certainly a very extraordinary proof of the blessed effects of education a witty friend of the editors used to say if god will but send mrs berkeleys children a tolerable pair of eyes and all their limbs she asks no more this lady might have added good understandings for the editor when a young woman probably after the death of a young gentleman who had been tenderly attached to her from his age of twelve and hers of eleven he at eton she at mrs sheeles until he at near nineteen died a gentleman commoner of trinity college oxford used frequently to tell her mother she feared to marry lest if she should have children they should have weak understandings which would break her heart to which mrs frinsham used to reply surely it is the oddest idea that ever entered into the mind of woman i never thought of any such thing thank god none of my family have ever been fools nor i hope knaves and why if you have children they should be such i cannot conceive i am sure you will never marry a fool god heard the editors prayers for certainly her dear children were not fools  she will trim them and twist them into handsome faces and fine figures but she is not up to making eyes mr berkeley when grown up used often to divert his father and friends by drawing his mothers character  she present he used to say my mother has no mercy on her own sex but little for the other every fault every defect related of any young man she instantly replies poor creature that was his mothers fault in short she lays every fault of every kind except not writing a good greek epigram or latin oration on a mans mother but she was an early studier of lord halifaxs advice to a daughter he used to say my mother i believe keeps a folio sheet of paper with all the virtues of her friends emblazoned on one side and their faults on the other whilst they act worthily and honorably you never suppose they have any fault or foible let them but act unworthily to any one and the paper is reversed and you hear all their faults my mother always carries a little catoninetails in her pocket and if any fool blasphemes or ridicules scripture out it comes and he is very speedily made the laugh of all the company if my mother was not my mother i would bribe her with five hundred pounds to become my friend to which mrs berkeley used to reply you varlet you know it would be all in vain for your mother would not be bribed to flatter royalty any more than your worship who thank god will not condescend to flatter any one although you often by your benevolence and great personal sincerity are led to cultivate intimacies with vautriens male and female some of rank among your own relations  of mr monck berkeleys genius many of those who have read what he has written may be competent judges to attempt to do justice to the exquisite amiability generosity and nobleness of his heart and the wonderful strength and soundness of his judgment even in early youth requires the knowledge of the editor and the pen of his favorite dr johnson  his attentions to the poor from his childhood were unremitting the arguments of his mother to dissuade him from wasting his alms on common beggars those horrid robbers of the honest laboring poor were all in vain his answer always was my dear madam i am fully convinced of the truth of your reasoning and i do believe i never did relieve a common beggar in my life that was not a vautrein yet should i ever hear that any poor creature had perished who had asked charity of me and i had not relieved him i know i never could forgive myself through life so well was his character known to these wretches that they frequently asked in the village near which his father resided if the squire was at home for if he is not it is not worth while to turn out of the way to the house as the doctor and the lady never give any thing to poor travelers the fact is certain that they never came but when mr berkeley was in the country which occasioned mrs berkeleys telling her son that they were his visitors  mr berkeley as has been observed above was remarkably generous and had what is commonly called a princely spirit his beautiful brother was very saving and even covetous he never parted with his money but to the poor to whom he was very liberal indeed so careful was he of his money that it used to be a diversion to his father and aunt to borrow sixpence of him and then tell him that they were poor and could not pay him he would go to his mother and desire her to talk to them and tell them that it was not honest to borrow of people and not pay them again and that absolutely he could not afford to lose his money  mr monck berkeley when a child once went and sold his buckles to relieve a person in distress when at eton being unable to relieve a very large poor family near braywood side to whom his father had been exceedingly bountiful and the family being at canterbury he wrote to his mother i beg of you to send five or three guineas to these poor creatures my cousin the very worthy reverend j hayes then second son of james hayes esquire berkeleys amiable protector and director when he went to eton and myself have given them all the money that we have but they are very poor still not getting an answer as soon as he wished he risqued a flogging and contrived in company with an equally daring friend to scamper over to cookham there he sold his little poney and sent them the money a youth going from canterbury school to oxford when mr berkeley was about twelve years old he presented him with his watch chain and seal for which being sharply reproved by his mother he sweetly replied why i am but a boy and he is going to be a man and it must be unpleasant to him not to have a watch and i know he cannot afford to buy one and i can contrive to shift without one such was ever the nature of this lovely young man  mr berkeley was from his early youth destined for the bar where had it pleased god to have spared his life and blessed him with health he would no doubt have reached the acme of his profession mr monck berkeley going one evening to visit his amiable kind friend mrs horn then on a visit at her fathers the very worthy sensible philip burton esquire that gentleman desired the bishop and mrs horn to tell dr berkeley from him that he never saw a young man quite so likely to shine eminently at the bar as his son and obligingly added i have been near fifty years in westminster hall and i have very rarely failed in my sentence of those who would succeed and who fail it is well known that mr burton was a man of very superior understanding and a wonderfully agreeable pleasant companion  for all who heard him speak pronounced him eminently qualified to make a distinguished figure unless his very strict ideas of honesty had prevented it in early youth he had been earnestly requested by his mother when arguing never for the sake of argument to improve in logic to undertake the wrong side of the question lest it might warp his mind he had ever most religiously adhered to this advice and in more advanced years always declared if he lived to speak at the bar which he early determined he would not do until he had completed his twentyeighth year mr berkeley had been often pressed by his learned friends to break this resolution but his constant reply was so determined am i to adhere to it that i will not keep my last term at the temple until the term before adding if ever a man ceases to be a coxcomb or a fool it is surely after having served four apprenticeships to folly and nonsense  he would tell every client that applied to him that if he found his cause to be an unjust one he would desert it even in westminster hall mr berkeley had also firmly resolved never to plead against the fatherless the widow or the clergy and always to plead gratis for them if their circumstances required it  it has been observed that although mr berkeley was highly indebted to what we commonly call nature with strict propriety to the god of nature for a very uncommonly fine understanding quick ready wit and what does not always accompany it a very extraordinary strength and soundness of judgment so as often to occasion persons to remark that he had all the brilliancy of bishop berkeleys imagination and all the sound strong judgment of mr cherry of whom the great charles leslie the celebrated controversial writer used to say he thought god had not bestowed better judgment on man since the days of solomon when mr berkeley with all his great vivacity in early youth often acted with the supremest caution mrs berkeley used to the great diversion of dr berkeley to say it was a happy thing for her children that she introduced a little lead into the family for although peacocks feathers were exquisitely beautiful yet unless tipped with a little weight they naturally flew away to the moon  mr berkeley owed much also to education to principles very early instilled into him to which he professed long before and during his last illness he owed his greatest happiness in life his only hope in the prospect of death until he through the free sovereign grace of god and the rich mercy of christ arrived by the instrumentality of a most excellent book to assurance of faith feeling the full force of that glorious promise of emanuel  him that comes to me i will in no wise cast out he was enabled to trust to go and happily found as all true penitents will a most gracious reception may all true penitents be enabled to make the trial and they will most certainly rejoice through the countless ages of a blissful eternity but alas our adored redeemer himself says ye will not come unto me that ye may have life the writer is well aware of the ridicule contempt etc etc that will be liberally bestowed on her on account of many things in this preface yet ever bearing in mind the admonition of an eminently pious mother never to be ashamed of that god who lived who died to redeem her ever remembering his own emphatic admonition whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation of him or her shall the son of man be ashamed when he comes in his own glory etc at the age of seventeen going to spend a few weeks with a near relation her mother said the first thing for which you will be laughed at is going to church on sunday in the afternoon yet never omit it your mother has been laughed to scorn for it years ago then the above cited text was repeatedly enforced and although the writer naturally the most shy of human beings amongst strangers always when young on entering the room crowding her little insignificant figure behind the door that nobody might look at her so as generally to occasion her witty younger sister of course following her into the room when visiting with their mother to say for pitys sake my dear miss frinsham do not go into the room looking as if you had stolen your clothes mrs berkeley used sadly to lament after her mothers death that she was the eldest sister  yet the first sunday of her visit she encountered the loud laugh of ten or eleven gentlemen and ladies for setting off to afternoon prayers the lady at whose house she was on a visit said oh the young ladys mother has brought her up with wonderfully strict notions of god and religion so i dare say she will go go the young lady certainly did but she never remembers to have suffered more in her whole life than in that first struggle in the service of her blessed master of her own never dying soul living many years in the first company cured that painful timidity conversing much with learned and good men soon enabled her to become more than a silent advocate for the honor of her blessed master when ridiculed by foolish scoffers insomuch as often to occasion mr monck berkeley to say to his father and friends few things delight me more than hearing my mother trim an infidel some deistical fellow begins spouting out his nonsensical blasphemy to amuse the company  on he goes without interruption for i make it a point never to say a word well knowing what he is going to meet with  at length down goes my mothers needle work she begins and in a few words turns the laugh of all the company upon him and the poor wretch never opens his mouth any more the remainder of the evening  this is a proof of the fulfillment of this promise of christ to his faithful servants the editor at the age of twentytwo was asked by a very near relation of her own a single man of vast fortune universally esteemed one of the first scholars in england why she was not a papist for the papists required not the belief of any thing so contrary to reason as the doctrine of the trinity which he was persuaded she did believe it pleased god to enable her to make him a firstrate scholar she an unlettered young woman such an answer as immediately silenced him and astonished the whole of the company that sat at table to god be all the glory this worthy wight lived many years never spending near as many hundreds per annum as he possessed thousands a few years ago the editor was called upon to put on an old black lustring  he being gone where his gold cannot follow him and alas he had not sent any of it before him his nephew however has made it fly in all directions in all countries the last time the editor was abroad  at lisle commonly called petit paris all her acquaintance were lamenting she had not arrived a little sooner as her relation had been giving such etes etc etc   i will give you a mouth and wisdom that all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay or resist as mrs berkeley is not an eliza carter or a mrs montagu two of her respected old friends but an unlettered female who lost a learned and wise father when she was eleven years old who had set his heart on cultivating the minds of his daughters had god spared his life until their leaving the school of that thoroughly amiable accomplished woman the excellent mrs sheeles but alas they had been in queens square but one year before he went to hear those blessed words well done thou good and faithful servant etc as perhaps one of the best the most vigilant parish priests any where to be found even half a century ago for so long has he been removed he had read st pauls epistles to timothy and titus with good effect in the year      the reverend dr dodwell was blessed with a curate who followed the example of mr frinsham mr ratcliffe fellow of queens college oxford few days passed without his visiting some house in the parish chiefly the cottages where he examined and instructed the poor children and generally ignorant mother admonishing them if they neglected going to church exhorting them to attend at the altar he was a cheerful pleasant unassuming young man he died about two years ago on a college living the county wherein it was situated is not at present recollected but he is not forgotten by his master  for he never suffered sin on any of his parishioners however high their rank or station  unrebuked  he was instant in season and out of season etc  it is hoped the introduction of a little anecdote concerning the zeal of this worthy gentleman for the salvation of his flock may be excused the wife of mr  a man of good fortune in every sense of the word a fine lady was a little talked of as having a partiality for one of her menservants the excellent vicar took an early opportunity when he knew her husband was absent to call upon her finding her alone he soon began the subject she heard him with seeming attention for some time at length she replied mr frinsham you may save yourself any farther trouble about me for i do assure you sir that i mind what you say no more than the coals on that fire mr frinsham mildly replied mrs  i dare say that often during the course of my ministry i may have met with many as inattentive hearers as yourself but i must tell you that you are the first the only person who ever told me so then taking up his hat he made a bow and told her he hoped god would in time bring her to a better state of mind he had the mortification to see her some years after die as she had lived but he had the consolation offered to watchful pastors in ezekiel chapter xxxiii  when the late earl of bute took waltham place soon after his arrival mr frinsham with some other gentlemen of the neighborhood made him a visit at taking leave lord bute said to mr frinsham sir i hope that we shall be good neighbors as i have taken this house solely on account of your excellent amiable character perhaps one of the most beautiful letters it is possible that some of lord butes letters to mr frinsham may some time or other be presented to the public they will serve to show what lord bute then was ever penned was by lord bute on the death of as he termed him  that dear delightful excellent friend the peer and the pastor generally met on the hill or at the vale below every day mr frinsham was as witty as he was good in his youth the idol of all his acquaintance as what is termed the fiddle of the company and to his latest day the most cheerful person of a large circle he expired with a smile on his benign countenance without even drawing a single sigh at the age of fiftyfour  it is hoped that the following little tribute of a grateful child to the best of fathers will be pardoned a few lines shall suffice not long after his obtaining priests orders he became curate of beaconsfield in bucks to a poor man of large fortune but so weak in his understanding that when mr frinsham was one sunday confined with a rash mr n attempted to do the duty which he could not get through and therefore came down and went home may god have pardoned the wickedness of the prelate who admitted such a being into the church of christ to get the emoluments of a family living it is seldom seen i believe that an almost idiot at twentyfour becomes a man of sense at thirtyfour a buck a blood a newmarket jockey made a priest of the most high god at twentyfour does often by thirtyfour or fortyfour begin to feel the value of his own and the souls committed to his charge but the wise king assures us the braying in a mortar will not make a fool wise surely in that instance the presbyterians are wiser than our excellent church they i believe seldom ordain any man such as their ordination is until thirty our blessed master god incarnate began not his own ministry until the age of thirty his precursor john the baptist not until twentyseven yet our church wise in every thing else permits poor shatterbrained boys of twentytwo and an half to go and solemnly lie to the holy ghost see ordination office that they may get forty pounds per annum and scamper after a pack of hounds  the living being then on sale mr frinsham much wished his father to purchase it for him the old gentleman stood for about a hundred and fifty or two hundred pounds the principal and fellows of magdalene college oxford hearing of it instantly paid down the sum demanded and of course for ever precluded mr frinsham from becoming rector where he was only not adored as curate so powerfully had his persuasions wrought on the people of that place that the wheeler the blacksmith the millener yea every trader quitted their occupation to attend wednesday friday and saintsday prayers so much as frequently to occasion passengers enquiring if there was any great wedding that so many persons were coming out of the church  mr frinsham being what was called a tory and all his own and his ladys considerable relations who could prefer him being whigs he never obtained any more important preferment than the vicarage of white waltham a parish of sixteen miles round in windsor forest of which his very learned and worthy successor the reverend dr dodwell canon of salisbury and archdeacon of berks said he never made fifty pounds a year thus are many excellent ministers of christ provided for in this world enough to make them take up the language of the great apostle st paul and say if in this life only we have hope in christ we are of all men most miserable mr frinsham used frequently to say i hope i am humbly thankful to god for a very comfortable fortune but i thank him still more for that temper that had i been an almsman with five pounds a year i am sure i should have been an happy man his unworthy daughter feels herself much more favored by providence in inheriting her fathers disposition than the comfortable fortune he bequeathed to her humbly thankful she trusts for both blessings unmerited by her her mother used frequently to say surely thou art the happiest little creature under the sun  as like your dear father in temper as in face thou must meet with a wonderful lot in life if thou do not go contented and joyous to thy grave the editor trusts by becoming daily more resigned to the blessed will of the allwise disposer of all events to feel that her mother judged aright she has ever delighted in being able to apply to herself that pleasant line of mr addisons in one of his beautiful hymns set to music by her old master mr sheeles nor is the least a cheerful heart which tastes those gifts with joy    mr frinsham perhaps naturally the most contentedtempered of the fallen children of adam and the most hospitable although he wished not for a larger income wished for a larger better house in which to entertain his numerous friends and acquaintance rich and poor high and low all ate and drank at his house the vicarage house at white waltham was literally a very large old barn with small rooms on each side the kitchen however was not very small and was paid with curious roman bricks which might have consoled his grandson mr monck berkeley an enthusiastical antiquary  an answer of mr frinsham to a letter written by his relation sir   to mr frinsham offering him a living of one hundred pounds per annum with a good house if he would promise faithfully and might be depended upon mr frinsham in his answer to that letter says it is as impossible that ministry should always act disinterestedly for the good of the nation as that they should not sometimes do so no earthly power therefore should ever make me yield such a promise to any minister of any monarch were my own father minister i shall therefore contentedly remain in my old clayed barn until providence removes me to the realms of bliss lord bute used personally as the editor well remembers when playing cards spending the evening under that very humble roof  the top of mr frinshams wig just touched the middle beam  to say my dear friend if ever i have power the first man on earth for whom i will exert it shall be yourself and breakfasting with his lady at mr frinshams the morning he quitted waltham place he looked out of one of the sashes at his late dwelling saying i grieve to leave it mr  might if he pleased have enabled me to continue but i hope we shall soon meet again they never did on earth mr frinsham dying before lord bute returned from scotland may they have met in a future state  to vote always as lord h should direct him is still carefully preserved his soninlaw the late as independent and spirited dr berkeley prebendary of canterbury used to say it merited to be written in letters of gold such were the whig ministers of george the second  it is somewhat remarkable that mr frinsham never met with any serious affliction through life the loss of his beautiful mother when he was five years old was so supplied by an excellent housekeeper of his fathers that he scarcely felt it and the death of his worthy father at the age of eightyone not long before his own death was an event to be expected at that age although he died as before mentioned by casualty mr frinsham was interred close to his honored fatherinlaw francis cherry esquire within the railed burial place in shottesbrooke churchyard he used to say i am gods creature he sent me into the world when he pleased and he will take me out how he pleases and i am sure it will be at the best time in the best way he dreaded nothing in life so much as losing the best of wives and the being left with two little girls whom he humoured in every thing not in itself wrong  some proofs how much mr berkeley was indebted to education may be gathered from his amiable humility as a lad a youth and a man when it is considered that he was astonishingly proud whilst a child  when mr monck berkeley was aged three years and two months his father went to reside at acton near london a large living presented to him by his only patron through life the excellent archbishop secker and which he so nobly resigned to a man who after making him repair the tithe barn and letting him have about five hundred pounds worth of new furniture and fixtures for an hundred and eighty pounds  amongst which was a harpsichord that cost bishop berkeley seventy guineas for four pounds  mrs berkeley objected but the doctor with his wonted generosity said he hated disputes among clergy and therefore permitted him to have it at his own price  after suffering the house to stand empty from michaelmas to the end of april  came upon him with a long bill for dilapidations and protested a draught drawn on him by dr berkeley for the money for the furniture this naturally exasperated the too generous mind that had been the actual presenter of the living for no power on earth no honor could have compelled any one to resign it but dr berkeley one day asking the archbishop if his grace meant he should resign action on becoming prebendary of canterbury his reply was dont be in haste you must talk one day or other with lord hardwicke about it before any conference with lord hardwicke the good archbishop died and the nice honor of dr berkeley without ever even seeing lord hardwick made him resign it to a cousingerman of his lordship  a very different man from his noble relation a very intimate friend of dr berkeleys the excellent thoroughly honorable and reverend mr hamilton of taplow felt such resentment that he conjured dr berkeley to post the man every where mr hamilton had one excellent rule he never would call any man a gentleman if in any instance he had acted unlike a gentleman  in a very few days after the arrival of the family at acton mrs berkeley heard a most violent stamping and screaming of her then only child on enquiry into the cause it was found to be that master berkeley would not go to bed up the back stairs  mrs berkeley  what ails him  servant  why you know madam there is only one staircase at bray but master berkeley says there are two here and he observes that my master and you and all visitors go up the great staircase and only the servants up the back stairs and that he is as good a gentleman as his papa although he is not so old and that he will not go up the back stairs  an order was immediately made and strictly adhered to that he was not for a whole week a long time for a creature of three feet high to presume in the day time to go up or down the great staircase to the dressing room to his mamma to read or play  when about four years old mr berkeley received a smart trimming for a speech to a once famous apothecary in london who had retired to acton mr sawtell whose appearance was rather against him he attended dr berkeley when unwell and charles stanley monck of grange gormonde esquire ill about four months at dr berkeleys with the whooping cough which he brought from eton school and communicated to the word poor is introduced on account of his very severe sufferings for more than seven months dr berkeley having never been at any school had unluckily escaped all those disorders which children together with many other benefits generally get at good schools the whoopingcough is a tremendous disorder indeed to adults  dr berkeley could not exist without going into fresh air every three or four days it cost him more than an hundred guineas the agonies suffered by the editor during some parts of that time were exceedingly great laughing constantly brought on a violent fit of coughing innumerable were the times that the editor has sat trembling with anguish expecting that her beloved partner would expire hanging on the window his only hope of relief being to throw up the sash and hang out at it gasping for breath mr james hamilton and the as witty samuel horn spent the summer with him mrs berkeley used to protest she would turn them both out of doors if they would not bottle up their wit saying she would send for two mutes she used seriously to conjure them not to make dr berkeley laugh none can laugh at this account who has ever had the distress of seeing an adult under the paroxysms of the whooping cough an old friend of mrs berkeleys more advanced in life than dr berkeley often fell senseless on the floor the late rev mr chapman the beloved friend of the late dr booth dean of windsor poor dr berkeley and his little boy this proud descendant of fallen adam thus accosted him sir if you were ever to stay here to dinner you must dine in the servants hall for you cannot be fit company for my papa dr berkeley ready to sink with shame flew to mrs berkeley saying surely that chit is the proudest little being on earth i must now really ask the poor man one day to dinner to show that he has not heard any thing of the kind from you or me  mr berkeley was always told that a gentleman must never do mean or shabby actions he reasoned on the matter and in early infancy drew such wonderful conclusions as those just mentioned  that both mr berkeley and his brother were in very very early youth exceedingly proud is absolutely certain in their different ways and that both became remarkably humble by their mothers adhering closely to the directions given to parents in that wonderful book the proverbs of solomon is equally certain  the exquisite loveliness of mr monck berkeleys nature led him from an infant to look with pity on all below him but his dear brother naturally looked with contempt one day when very young going in the coach with their mother to marlow as they passed a remarkably small meanlooking cottage at the foot of the hill he exclaimed my dear mamma look there did you ever see so miserable a looking hut what kind of creatures must they be that live in it mrs berkeley threw terror into her countenance and said robert what have i just heard you say do you dare to despise any of your fellow creatures or any meanlooking habitation have not you often read in the bible what our blessed savior said the foxes  now go on he did so  have holes and the birds of the air have nests but the son of man has not where to lay his head  why did he come upon earth  to save sinners  yes such a poor proud little wretch as you and are you not very naughty to say what you have just said  yes indeed mamma and if god will forgive me this once i will never do so again whilst i live  once passing a little chimneysweeper about his own size with the sootbag at his back he coiled up his nose and said what a poor dirty little creature it is his mother acted terror as before and asked him how he came to be so wicked and if he knew how it came to pass that he was not that poor little sweep and little sweep master robert berkeley he replied no  should you have liked it  no  do you think if god almighty had asked that little boy whether he would be dr berkeleys son or the sweeps that he would not have chosen to have been born a gentleman that christ died to redeem from hell that little boy as well as himself or one of the kings little sons that as he had not even the merit of choosing to come to dr berkeleys instead of to old lalooe the nick name of a chimney sweeper who ought now to enjoy a very good fortune in bucks if he had money to contend for it he ought to to be humble as a little dove instead of being proud as lucifer and despising those whom providence without any goodness of his had placed below him he wept and said it was very wicked indeed but if god would pardon it he would never despise dirty children again the worthy woman who brought him up was remarkably cleanly and had made him so he was exceedingly careful to keep his word for if he were told of any thing that would offend god no persuasion of the most eloquent could cause him to do it such admonotions until he grew toward manhood were heard by his lovely brother as they are by most other children to use a cant phrase go in at one ear and out at the other  the early ripe for glory are generally soon removed from this vale of tears to use the beautiful language of dean hickess reformed devotions no matter how late the fruit be gathered if it still go on growing better no matter how soon it fall from the tree if not blown down before it be ripe   mr berkeley and his brother were whilst children always made not to touch but take off their hats to the poorest labourer in the village who saluted them if ever they saw an old man or woman with a burden of wood or leazed corn to run to open the gate to let them through they were made to treat the servants with the utmost civility never daring to order them to do any thing being always told that they were not their servants but their fathers therefore they must always say pray john or thomas get me so or so by incessant attention and the utmost vigilance their pride was kept under and in due time by gods grace eradicated  it was no small delight to his mother on his arrival in england at the age of near twentytwo that she could scarcely go into any small shop in canterbury without hearing from the master or mistress oh madam what a fine young gentleman mr berkeley is so condescending he met my poor son stopped and asked him how he did and hoped he went on well in the world who would have thought he would have done him the honor to remember him so many years  let it be remarked here that ecclesiastical bodies do some good at canterbury the dean and prebendaries pay for the education of fifty tradesmens sons find them books etc until they are eighteen or nineteen and then if they wish it raise a subscription to send them to one of the universities many other cathedrals have similar charitable institutions this produces a sort of honorable equality as it enables the sons of chairmen footmen etc when ordained to associate with their superiors in birth perhaps not in learning  mr berkeleys amiability was the more remarked as he quitted the kings school at the age of twelve and his father removed his family to his living in west kent the year following and returned not to settle in canterbury until the end of the year      when it became his turn to take the offices a good old shopman one day said to mrs berkeley ah madam what a charming man mr berkeley is he was galloping toward margate looking like a young lord when one of our poor old neighbors was creeping along he suddenly stopped his horse drew up to the causeway and asked him who he was and if he was comfortable he took out his purse and not finding much silver bade his servant lend him half a crown which he gave to the poor man and told him to call upon him if ever he wanted any thing adding his eyes filling with tears lord bless him where will you find another young gentleman going galloping on his pleasure that will think so of the poor it proved to be the famous old newscarrier of whom the fine print was sold some years ago in canterbury  the poor and distressed were ever the grand objects of his tender care when at st andrews one night at the play the poor man who acted the king in the tragedy fainted away and it had nearly been a real tragedy as he had several small children on enquiry it was found to be from inanition the next day the editor sent her faithful affectionate trusty aged scotch servant the excellent betty russel to enquire particularly into the state of these heroes and heroines of the stage the worthy woman soon returned saying welladay madam i never saw such an unka sight in all my life there was the poor crator who is to be queen to night the kings wife that fainted last night with her head dressed all in flowers and ribbons and a fine crown and a child sucking at her breast quite empty it had not a drop of milk in it  she had had nothing but water all day  oh it was an unka sight to see her head so fine her breast hanging like a wet leather glove that uncommonly honest worthy woman elizabeth russel met with most kind charitable friends on dr berkeleys family leaving st andrews in the amiable excellent and by them highly respected dr adamson senior kirk minister of st andrews and his worthy very charitable lady the editor used to delight to send her a guinea in a letter to dr adamson until twice some postmaster stopped it  mr berkeley on finding that to be the case posted off to his tutor the very amiable now reverend mr james bruce beseeching him to go and relieve him on his account on mrs berkeleys saying why did not you go yourself instead of routing out mr bruce he wisely replied my dear mother the woman was exceedingly beautiful and my going might have injured her fame which i hear although an actress is unsullied so now you know why i got bruce to go  mr berkeley had certainly no offensive pride discoverable to those who knew him most intimately for what is usually termed family pride is surely improperly so called a man that is descended from a king rather than from a cobbler from a hero rather than from a huckster may feel grateful to his maker mr berkeleys father felt it his grandfather felt it and perhaps he felt it on becoming a bishop some friend said your lordship must now give purple liveries to which the good bishop replied no sir my becoming a bishop will not make me give up what the domestics of my ancestors have worn for centuries accordingly his episcopal livery was the yellow green coat worn by the servants of his honorable relations the earl of berkeley lord berkeley of stratton his brothers etc with royal ie red purple waistcoats etc and the servants of his sons he always made wear the crimson waistcoat etc that he might not give up his family livery dr berkeleys coach being to be new painted the coachmaker said to be sure sir you will have a cipher instead of your coat of arms it is all the fashion that may be sir but if you please put on my coat it is an old one to be sure the cipher is very well for nabobs and planters to save them trouble it was a great diversion when mr berkeley was seventeen or eighteen to a lovely young lady whose death mr berkeley lamented in a most beautiful elegy printed but never sold to wink on mrs berkeley and say aye one day or other berkeley will marry a girl with an hundred thousand pounds and change his name to hickenbottom vide kit smart he used to storm and say harriet hold your tongue i will not change my name for a million mr addison says ancient family is a feather but it is a feather that no man possessed of ever disdained to stick in his cap  when the vile treatise on education written by that learned atheist the late lord kaimes made its appearance it was immediately in every hand when mr berkeley came to the part where lord kaimes speaks of the eton montem he stormed violently indeed he felt lesprit du corpse so violently as to amuse all his friends he assured his father and the gentlemen of the agreeable society of cookham above described that had they been educated at eton they would feel equal indignation his mother assured him that men of fortyseven were rarely as irritable as youths of seventeen to which mr berkeley replied well madam i can tell you at what page of the book you will throw it by and not read one line more she laughing asked if lord kaimes had abused dear mrs sheeless school he replied much worse than that i assure you my dear madam with all your calmness you will be ready to throw it into the fire mrs berkeley requested to be informed but her son politely declined it saying no read on my dear madam it is certain that when she came to the page where lord kaimes says i would advise you to be of the christian religion because it is or it happens to be the religion of the country where you were born mrs berkeley verified her sons prediction for she never thought it worth while to go on with such a wretch on education his lordships treatise on husbandry is an excellent work  the following anecdote of that dreadful atheist may be depended on as a fact it was related to the editor by a lady incapable of forging it to whom it was related by an eye and ear witness of the scene when a divorce has actually taken place it is no scandal to speak of the divorced female as having lost her character lord kaimess daughter was married to mr heron a gentleman of very large fortune in scotland of most excellent character and uncommonly amiable gentle manners say all who have the happiness of his acquaintance the editor was well acquainted with the elegant worthy major heron his younger brother when that favorite regiment of canterbury families of fashion the scotch greys were quartered at canterbury this lady was at length detected and gently and quietly sent home to her worthy father with a letter from her excellent injured husband stating her conduct she reached her fathers house in the afternoon in the evening after tea lord kaimes walked up and down the room in silence but appeared greatly agitated at length he exclaimed good god child how could you act thus how could you bring me to such shameful disgrace  why my lord you have always told me that there was no other world that the idea of an hereafter was all a juggle of knaves and priests to keep fools in order and as i am not to be called to any account but by the world  i preferred mr  to my husband this silenced his lordship he said not a single word more and soon quitted the room mr heron her much injured husband has for many years enjoyed great felicity with a lady very differently educated from the daughter of lord kaimes may he long enjoy it  in a few days after reading the book above mentioned when the social meeting happened to be at dr berkeleys just before tea the very learned mr m either took off the slab behind him or out of his pocket a newspaper neither that amiable gentleman nor the editor can recollect which if it was dr berkeleys paper it was the st jamess chronicle as he was always partial to that paper on account of his old fellow collegian mr colman and began reading a letter to lord kaimes concerning his very severe attack on eton school proving to the learned lord that he was totally ignorant of what he had been so grossly abusing every one admired it exceedingly mr m said why berkeley this letter must delight you prodigiously surely eton is nobly vindicated indeed the writer is quite of your spirit mr berkeley replied to be sure every man educated there must be indignant to find himself and his friends styled highwaymen mr m proceeded to read on and said turning to mrs berkeley why i believe berkeley must have written this letter himself to which mrs berkeley replied he write such a letter poor dear soul poor as i am i would give a thousand pounds that he could three years hence write such a letter as that to which dr berkeley added aye poor fellow i hope if he is not idle he may in time write as well as this eton champion  about seven years afterward mr berkeley sitting conversing with his mother in her dressing room said my dear mother do you remember before we went to scotland a letter that m read us out of the newspaper exposing lord kaimess attack upon eton school  mrs berkeley  yes very well  mr b  do you remember his saying jocularly to you that he believed that it was written by me  mrs b  yes  mr b  and do you remember what answer you made  mrs b  yes that i would freely give a thousand pounds that you were capable of writing that letter  mr b  well my dear madam perhaps it may now give you some little pleasure to hear that your bairn did write that letter and that lord kaimes answered it acknowledging that he had been in an error concerning the eton montem adding that he must have been an hasty writer to publish such a censure on an ancient custom sanctioned by such a man as lord camden educated there who always makes a point of attending and being robbed whilst this sheet was in the press the montem at eton was celebrated  it was a fine very fine sight that the editor could not now alas have witnessed she was twice called upon by a thoroughly polite young gentleman  a most active zealous friend of the captain who on his entering the room at ten oclock most elegantly apologized for having called before so early as eight  this young gentlemans conduct encourages the editor to persevere in her assertion from seventeen years old that the young men youths even the lads of eton school are the gentlemen of the nation dr berkeley used frequently to tell his son when admonishing him as a youth to be like a gentleman wellbred why child every nobleman is not a gentleman to use the elegant language of the late dr berkeley in a charitysermon   few can give the rich mans largess all may give the  widows mite the very polite receiver of the editors mite on her enquiry she learned was mr marsh of lee in kent if he has parents she congratulates them on having such a son may he be spared to them may they never suffer as the editor has done and must in some few sad moments ever do until she meets her angelichearted son in the realms of bliss  as lord kaimes terms it of ten guineas and of late years his majesty and the queen how any man of any country could suppose that the sons of men of the highest rank and most ancient families in england would be permitted to act as he describes is mavelous  mr berkeley from the time he went to eton used very acutely to learn his mothers opinion of any little thing he was going to publish in a newspaper or magazine without her even suspecting him as the author by saying it was written by an eton boy of his acquaintance lest as he told her when he grew up maternal partiality might tempt her to think it clever when it was not so or the same tenderness might tempt her to wish it suppressed lest it should expose him to ridicule  on mr berkeleys printing his maria or the generous rustic written when he was only seventeen the copies were sent down to him one day after dinner he went to his study and brought a copy of it in sheets saying he would read something that he hoped might amuse his father and the ladies he began and dr berkeley who had eyes like a lynx seeing it in sheets immediately exclaimed good heavens child what have you done this is written by you surely you have not gone and published some nonsense that will ruin your character as a writer before you are a man  why i have never published any thing with my name yet mrs berkeley motherlike in agony to think that her idol had injured his fame as a writer began lamenting his temerity when the indignation of dr berkeley and the lamentations of mrs berkeley were a little subsided because they were almost out of breath he said in the sweetest voice and gentlest manner well i am very sorry you are all so angry with me i have done what i could to please you all i have made the marquis learned to please my father and i have made maria pious to gratify my mother mrs frinsham here interposed in her wonted way my dear i think it very beautiful and i question whether either of them could have written such a book at your age i am sure i could not indeed i am not quite sure i could do it now that i am more than double your age mrs frinsham has a wonderful fund of true humor which breaks forth on every occasion before the very few with whom she will be intimately acquainted being perhaps the most reserved of human beings now that lord  is dead an excellent understanding very highly cultivated by reading the best authors in various languages and to sum up the character in few words as it is frequently done by the grateful editor perhaps the best woman on earth now that her excellent mother is removed to heaven  matters being a little quieted by mrs frinshams interposition mr berkeley said to his father well sir although it is printed i would not presume to publish it without your permission and if you disapprove it i will burn every copy but one indeed i have burnt a vast deal many months ago before i printed it all the marquiss sejour in england and wales his remarks on english manners customs etc i have destroyed indeed i have burnt near five times as much as i have printed and if you wish it i will burn that here there was a triple cry of oh no but dr berkeley asked my poor simple child why would you not let me look it over and correct it  alas my dear sir i knew what would be its fate you would have made a new book a very just remark dr berkeley never could correct he could write admirably as the world has seen but any thing sent him to correct he always remade generally perhaps for the better  but then as his son through life used to tell him sir the book is yours not the mans whose name it bears  but if you knew that why not let your mother read and correct it  why my dear sir for fear of getting my mother into a scrape for not showing it to you  uncorrected as it was it has been so admired that seven years ago half a guinea was paid for a miserable thumbed dirty copy only to be found in those banes of industry cleanliness etc etc a little countrytown circulating library mr berkeley was often pressed to permit a second edition but his constant reply was  no never whilst my name is berkeley i was a great fool ever to let there be one but i was young and of course foolish  that there are great beauties in maria is generally allowed and that it has some considerable errors is certain the calling the idea of a marquis even a french marquis marrying a little farmers daughter however worthy being highly objectionable  one of the absurd maxims of the world is what at twenty or before mr berkeley would have expunged and on his mothers pointing out to him how much better it would have been to have made her the daughter of a reduced officer he saw the force of it but replied  you know my dear madam that by means of the nunneries in popish countries every peasants daughter living in the neighborhood of a monastery can on very easy terms have as good an education as a dukes can the styling the wretched consort of the baron darandar his wife instead of his lady was improper and on his mothers expressing her astonishment that he who from infancy was wellbred and elegant could be guilty of such a vulgarism he replied mr  a gentleman then very intimate with dr berkeley always ridiculed those who said lord and lady  or mr  and his lady this gentleman long before it became fashionable was a great advocate for equality mrs berkeley regretted the melancholy catastrophe of the amiable marquis and the noblesouled maria  after mr berkeleys return to england he came one day to his mother and enquiring if she had a couple of hours to spare sat down and began to read in manuscript the spanish memoirs telling her as they appeared on the stage who the chief actors were for mr berkeley in every novel or poem celebrated or stigmatized some real existing character thus the hero of love and nature bears the title of westmorland mr berkeley having always respected the character of the present earl of westmorland for his spirited wise conduct in quitting a great school where he then could not learn any thing for one where he could and did learn very much and for other parts of his character the late earl of  whose pride whose cruelty to very near relations mr berkeley from a youth detested is held up to contempt to hatred in the person of the duke daranda as he told his mother when he had concluded he desired to hear his mothers sentiments of the work she told him she liked it very well until she came to the murder of don frederic murder he exclaimed my dear madam you have not been listening with your usual attention to reading why he is not murdered he is cast away and drowned  mrs berkeley  well and what is that but murdering him as you did the poor marquis de clerville and maria indeed worse for you leave this poor heroine alive to mourn to the end of the chapter how can you practice such cruelties  mr b  well my dear madam i am glad you do not disapprove any part but that innocent murder i shall do myself the honor to send you a copy as soon as it is printed  mrs b  and i shall certainly do myself the honor to tuck it in between the bars of that grate and burn it  mr b  burn it my dear madam no no i am sure you will not serve me so  mrs b  yes i solemnly protest i will without reading one line of it you know i hate the idea of encouraging melancholy on the mind i have often told you that with mr addison in one of his beautiful hymns in the spectator all the hymns etc in the spectator as has been already noticed p clxix were many years ago set to music by the late mr sheeles and dedicated to lady albinia and lady mary bertie daughters of the late duke of ancaster both educated at mrs sheeless school lady mary had a pleasanter honor than being a dukes daughter being mother to bertie greathead esquire  i have always delighted that i could subscribe to that lovely line nor is the least a cheerful heart which tastes those gifts with joy   the next day mr berkeley and his mother dining alone after the cloth was removed he drew out the book and said he had brought the conclusion of the spanish memoirs to read to her mrs berkeley said she would not hear another tittle of them he conjured her she rose to go he said you will catch your death the fire i am sure does not burn well in the drawing room mrs berkeley being resolute got to the door he pursued and taking hold of her gown said well suppose don frederic is not dead will you stay and hear  mrs b  aye but he is dead and i will go  mr b  will you stay if i solemnly declare he is alive  mrs b  yes because i know you will not deceive me  those who have read the spanish memoirs know how beautifully he is redivivus mr berkeley added you have made me spoil it but i cannot bear to do any thing that you do not approve  it has been mentioned above that mr berkeley was indebted to nature or rather to the god of nature for a most lovely disposition a very shocking proof that a nature perhaps equally amiable although not blessed with as strong an understanding may by a bad education degenerate into horrid cruelty of the meanest kind is now daily seen in the honorable   it was a common remark of bishop berkeley that the strongest wine if ill kept became the sourest vinegar  the editor was asked within a few months if she was not acquainted with   to which replying in the affirmative the gentleman answered then you know the meanest scoundrel upon earth for he is now actually employed as a crimp she lamented that a creature so lovely in very early youth should by bad education have become so horridly so shamefully depraved one or two instances of the sweetness the delicacy of his mind when a child shall be related  a very honest old woman who had lived many years at lord s his fathers and had the care of him from his birth dressed quite in the old style of wise servants fifty years ago therefore looked a little oldfashioned about thirty years ago lady w who visited his mother often used to laugh at this little man about the cut of nurses cap etc children should never be teazed it injures never corrects their tempers it is not meant to do it it only serves to show the low wit of old simpletons this hurt his then amiable heart so much that when as children usually are she conveyed her charge to the eatingroom whilst she dined he used to say my dear nurse when you have opened the door slip behind it for fear that illnatured woman lady w should see you and laugh at you and make me cry  one day when he was barely eight years old dr berkeley happening to be visiting at lord s lady  as ignorant ladies are apt to do began railing against the university of oxford the next time lady  saw the editor she said i must tell you a remark of your little favorite  your coach was hardly driven from the door when he came and said surely my dear mamma when you abused oxford so violently you had quite forgot that mr afterward dr berkeley had been educated there a great many years and must know it well dr berkeley was then about twentysix years old and had not long quitted that excellent university where to be sure young fools if not properly placed may fall into mischief as in the army the navy and the merchants or bankers counting house  dr berkeley used every possible argument that a man of his sense could devise to persuade lord  to send mr  to dr glass at harrow underr whose care a few years before he being consulted by the two dowager countesses had been placed the late not the last earl of barrymore and the present earl of massareen and his brothers the honorable messrs skeffington dr berkeley was desired by the ladies to fix the salary the two peers paid each four hundred pounds a year they had horses kept for them the others paid one hundred but lady  after deliberating some time declared she dreaded her sons being made too religious if he went to dr glass she lived to feel bitterly feel the direful want of religion in two of her sons the eldest immediately on his fathers death turning her out of the house in town and the crimp merchant out of the villa near town and had not the very worthy countess of hd then going out of town to make a visit in the north kindly lent hers she must have taken a lodging lady  was the most indulgent mother in the world she attended to her childrens food their physic their warm clothing etc but she left the care of their souls to  satan and he was not wanting in his attentions one of them had naturally a good understanding but neither lord nor lady  were equal to the task of directing it aright nor by any means equal to the still much harder task of cultivating and directing weak minds poor lady  she lived to feel the threat of the wise king sorely verified a child left to himself brings his mother to shame proverbs xix chap  0  which seems to imply that in those ignorant unenlightened times the care of sons devolved entirely in the early part of life on the mother the very sensible lord halifax in his advice to a daughter speaks excellently on this subject this book must become very scarce since a very learned gentleman about a year ago assured the editor he had never even heard of such a book it is pity that more fathers do not put it early into the hands of their daughters it might contribute greatly in preventing husbands being obliged to exhibit many unhappy creatures at doctors commons and the house of lords between the wise king and the wise peer if both were duly studied young gentlemen and young ladies might certainly be very different beings from what many in the present time are  solomon when he says train up a child in the way he should go and when he is old he will not depart from it does by no means imply that he shall not through life depart from it he departed lamentably from it himself but having as we well know received an excellent education from his pious preceptor nathan the prophet he returned into the paths of virtue and piety before his death the late archdeacon of berkshire the very learned dr dodwell in an excellent sermon on one man in a thousand have i found etc told his audience that probably that great king owed the salvation of his soul to the admonitions of his beloved friend the son of nathan who certainly in those times when monarchs were absolutely arbitrary put his life in his hand to save the soul of his sovereign by admonishing him to return to the paths of piety  it was an high act of friendship in the late excellent stz one of the gentlemen of the bedchamber to a king who reigned over these realms not quite a century ago to admonish his master frequently of the heinous sin of adultery to do the british prince justice although he did not like the jewish prince reform he never resented the liberty taken the nickname of this gentleman before that of methodist had like aarons rod swallowed up all others was praying stz he prayed on earth he is now praising in heaven  so terrifying is the idea of being styled a methodist become of late that within these few weeks the editor who never was in a methodist meeting but once in her life about twentyfive years ago with a large party at canterbury to hear some dull abuse from that accomplished old hypocrite john wesley advising a young gentleman to read a small portion of the bible every day to his servants replied oh my dear madam i should be reckoned a methodist if it was known that i did it and that would be sad you know how wretched must those be who stand thus in awe of mortal man how happy are they who fear naught but god that fear in due time will lead to perfect love which as st john says casts out fear for fear has torment  to attempt to do justice to mr monck berkeleys gratitude to many noble relations friends and connexions from his first entrance into what is called life would require abilities far superior to those of an almost dying female by whom he had been taught from infancy that he had no right to expect any thing but what is usual the common decent civilities of life from any but his parents that every thing beyond that was to be repaid by gratitude as more than his due  his gratitude to the eminently learned professor hunter of st andrews in offering dr berkeley to become himself mr berkeleys tutor if dr berkeley did not entirely approve of mr bruce an eleve of mr hunter was through life gratefully remembered by him but dr berkeley found the professors character of mr bruce to be perfectly just dr berkeley accordingly asked mr bruce the value of his whole time desired him to dismiss all his other pupils and devote himself entirely to the care of mr berkeley which he did for a considerable time until the arrival of his dear friend mr grimston who came on mr berkeleys account and entered at st andrews and an old intimate eton friend of mr berkeleys in the same form with him there being all as it is termed reading the same books they could not interfere and mr berkeley amiably wishing to benefit mr bruce whom he exceedingly loved requested his father to permit him to become tutor to those two gentlemen only from both of whom he received a large salary which enabled him a few years after to enter at emanuel college cambridge under the protection of dr berkeleys much loved and respected friend the celebrated and worthy dr farmer  mr berkeleys gratitude through life to those who instructed him was uniform he used to say if i would not learn that was not their fault he used always to boast to his father well sir idle as you may think me i can assert with strictest truth that i never have once bowed at professor hills hunters or indeed at any professors lectures an explanation being requested of the word bowing it was thus given why if any poor fellow has been a little idle and is not prepared to speak when called upon by the professor he gets up and makes a respectful bow and sits down again  mr berkeleys friendship for his very learned tutor the reverend mr green on whose sole account he was by his father sent to magdalene hall rather than to his own beloved christ church was very great mr berkeley considered him as the most active and vigilant of tutors who would force young men to learn whether so disposed or not and the great care he took of their morals devoting almost the whole of his leisure time to the common room  mr berkeley was blessed with a wonderful sagacity in discerning characters and often exhibiting them to the diversion of his friends even when the persons whose characters he drew were present he used frequently to say to his father and aunt now i will treat you with an exhibition of my mother last night at mrs s rout and then proceed generally saying well to be sure my mother is a woman by herself for i believe the almighty never formed any thing before her or ever will any thing after her like herself the whole world cannot make her say a thing she does not mean make her answer a question she does not choose to answer nor visit any body she does not choose to visit unless once or twice where my father has interposed his royal authority then she reluctantly sets off this latter part arose from mrs berkeleys resolution through life never to visit any cook housemaid etc who had been kind enough to live with a gentleman six or seven years before she was sanctioned from doctors commons to step into the coach and six and sit at the head of the table and be caressed by all the amiable virtuous dames in the neighborhood mrs berkeley is by no means one of those styled by mr addison  the outrageously virtuous tout au contraire  and her kindness in restoring more than one fallen acquaintance the wives of gentlemen they gentlewomen mothers of large families of young children is well known to many who will read these sheets through curiosity but the case is widely different mary or nan if tolerably cunning wenches reason thus it is hit or miss if i live with the squire seven years  if i can draw him in to marry me why i am a fine laady for life and if i cannot why i shall do just as well for bob the postillion agreed but you ought not to be company for ladies of virtue birth and education nor are ye or ever shall be for one insignificant individual who more than once insignificant as she is has mortified titled harlots of this description one indeed sent to know what she had done that mrs berkeley would not visit her and mrs berkeley bade the lady tell her whether the lady did tell her or not must be guessed the wife of a gentleman may behave very foolishly very idly and it may it must be very difficult to ascertain whether her conduct is criminal or not and if her husband not a known scoundrel does not give her up her friends and neighbors ought not to do it but with mary and nan and the squire there cannot remain a doubt especially when a poor little baseborn brat appears and is owned every year it is the bounden duty of every sincere servant of god to discountenance vice let it be seriously remembered that  himself says  who will rise up with me against the wicked and take my part against the evildoers every individual however humble their station in life may enjoy that honor by browbeating vice as the worthy dr cby of m did when his neighbor the late lord c urged him to visit at    in a country where the question as the torture used to be termed in france ie the rack is not allowed mrs berkeley did not think very highly of her own mental powers in resolving not to answer any homethrust as she termed it however it might excite the admiration of her clever son and sensible excellent friend mrs duncombe the cultivated the enlightened relict of the late very learned amiable reverend john duncombe ma well known in the learned world and of whom the great mr burke once said speaking of him to the editor he was a very considerable man indeed this lady with whom the editor esteems it one of her greatest earthly felicities that she has lived in the strictest the most uninterrupted friendship for the last twentyfive years of her life that is ever since the commencement of their acquaintance and to whom she feels herself deeply indebted for a thousand amiable attentions particularly during her last melancholy visit to canterbury  any attempt by so feeble a pen to celebrate the eleve of mr richardson the friend of mrs epictetus carter the relict of the abovenamed learned wellinformed mr duncombe would be a vain effort unless it were to sing  a hymn to my own praise and glory for having been honored with the friendship of such a woman mrs duncombes own fine pen has does celebrate her fame her praise long may she live to use it for the entertainment the improvement of those who read what is worth reading her letters carefully preserved if printed would give the english a madame sevignee of their own nation it is to be hoped that some time or other they may be collected and given to the world it is certain that they would not cost the pains that those of the lovely lively and in her latter days excellently pious madame de sevignees did for one has frequently heard that it took many months to a patient genius to correct the false orthography of those very entertaining improving letters madame de sevignee had never studied the complete letter writer published some years ago of the minor visitations there are few things more dreaded by mrs duncombe and the editor than an epistle from any lady who has last time they met mrs duncombe read such an epistle to the editor who said my dear friend i am grown very stupid i do not understand it  no how should you without the book the editors father always told his girls letters should be conversation upon paper a most charming correspondent of the editors long since removed to bliss once showed her a letter from a lovely young friend of here is  after a page of chitchat she writes thus oh aye but i forgot to tell you that i was married about a fortnight ago that is true and then proceeds as before the editor greatly prefers miss pges letter as above quoted to the studied epistles of letterbook ladies  although in them would be found some very smart strictures on the writer of these pages this lady like mr monck berkeley has often said that the editor had an art superior to magic in not being made to speak when she had not a mind to speak mrs duncombe can and mr monck berkeley could alas entertain very highly by speaking  the editor it should seem by her silence  mr berkeley having been out of england for several months on his return as usual immediately paid his duty at home after dinner as he sat chatting with his mother she said berkeley your old friend   is married since you left us to lord s niece a very sweet pleasing young lady but i am sure you will not believe me when i tell you that it is a certain fact no flam or fun mr berkeley had the pleasure of living in great intimacy with the family of the late lord and the present very worthy thoroughly amiable dowager lady dacre he had the honor to be a great favorite with that learned accomplished nobleman who used often to say berkeley berkeley how you do love fun as they call it at eton i wish you did not love fun quite so well mrs berkeley used to say it was an hereditary matter quite incurable she believed as derived to him from his mother mr berkeley and his mother often amused themselves with trying to impose on the credulity of each other to the no small diversion of dr berkeley and mrs frinsham i assure you that he wept like a child through the whole of the ceremony never whilst the editor retains her reason can she forget the reception this speech met from mr berkeley he lifted up his beautiful eyes and with the solemnity of a pious judge when he pronounces the sentence of death said weep my dear mother well might he weep poor fellow i shall wonder if he ever does any thing but weep through life  mrs b  why so  mr b  why so why because three years ago he courted a gentlemans daughter to marry her when the devil put it into his head to prevail with her to elope with him and when he had got the poor creature to   house he refused to marry her the gentleman being asked to subscribe to a book mr moores treatise on suicide gaming and duelling which dr berkeley used to say he esteemed to be the first the most useful work of this century laughingly replied to the solicitor of the guinea oh i am in no manner of danger of killing myself that did not appear quite so certain to the person who asked the subscription he is a young noble of very large paternal estate mr moores two volumes are more entertaining than most novels and as pious as most sermons on the publication of the first volume the editor ventured to recommend them in a letter in the st jamess chronicle proposing to have prints engraved for firescreens from some of the most tremendous tales of woe related by mr moore the editor supposes it never reached mr baldwin as he generally finds a corner to insert any hint that she thinks may benefit her fellow creatures dr berkeley made the editor write to the very worthy mr moore to raise his inestimable volumes to three guineas instead of to half that sum their worth to those that well weigh them is beyond all price surely  and the poor unhappy girl cast off by her own family has lived with him ever since behaving in every other instance like an angel might he not well weep my dear mother  mrs berkeley assured her son that she had never heard a tittle of this dreadful business until he told it her  mr b  had i been in england i would certainly have used all my poor rhetoric to have prevailed on him not to load his conscience through life with such a crime but honorably honestly marry her the poor creature is i hear dying of a broken heart for she really loved the little scoundrel with all your saying that girls must beware of men and take care of themselves and never trust them how often have i heard you applaud my grandfathers conduct with regard to his brother who having treated a lady of family in a similar way utterly refused to marry her and many many years afterward when he went to visit him at cloyne absolutely refused to see him although he was then become what the world calls a worthy man this unhappy gentleman married a young lady of vast fortune he was killed at carthagenia in the year  his lady died of grief and left an only daughter who inherits her fathers exquisite beauty her mothers worth and vast patrimony she died about five years ago  but during his two or three days visit there dined as you have often and often heard my father say in the library by himself and no entreaties of my grandmother or my father could prevail upon him to see him constantly saying he is a genuine scoundrel i trust god will forgive him upon his repentance but i will never see him whilst i breathe and i am sure you used to have as much horror of seduction as my grandfather where honorable proposals had been made how often have you rung in my ears the worthiness of your excellent general h who having been educated in the most pious way by his mother lady h used to return the ridicule of his friends when a young man in the guards for his taking up with any drab with well well you may laugh as you please but i would not for all this world has to give have the ruin of an innocent woman to answer for  this excellent gentleman has for near forty years done due honor to his alas for this poor nation very uncommonly pious education  family prayers every day with the lessons and psalms of the day  and the editor hears with pleasure that his exemplary care of his family is repaid by that god whose doctrine he so beautifully adorns by the excellent conduct of his children may they be spared to him long may he be spared a blessing to them  few men perhaps have ever been formed with more qualifications to make a complete orator than mr berkeley a very uncommonly harmonious musical voice with from an infant the sweetest tones imaginable which he could at pleasure elevate like his grandfather bishop berkeley to tremendous thunder taught from four years old to repeat by heart without rant or forced action being told after he properly understood the meaning of what he had learned to repeat it as he felt it on his own mind and being from seven years old accustomed to talk with delight of speaking in westminster hall he took every opportunity of improving himself  when a boy at canterbury school which as has been already observed he quitted at twelve years old during the sessions for the city at the guild hall and for the county at the old castle mr berkeley generally went without his dinner flying off the instant the school broke up to the court to hear the pleadings he once prevailed on his father to permit him to go attended by mr wrightson under a strict promise  of doing every thing that john bade him to maidstone to attend at the assizes on his return home he related all the causes and pleadings and a particular in the summing up the evidence by sir william blackstone as accurately as if he had taken it all down in shorthand which he could not then do he was if the french expression fort eveillie may be permitted to be translated into english the most awaked of all creatures nothing escaped him he caught every thing he saw and wished to know in a moment one instance proves it very strongly soon after he went to eton he had a raging desire to learn to fence which his father was resolved he should not do until he attained to a certain age fixed by him all mr berkeleys arguments that the bishop had let his father learn at fourteen were ineffectual dr berkeley saying that many youths of fashion were often killed by its straining their lungs when they were too tender to bear it mr berkeley was however resolved to learn what he could as he afterward told his father saying i had little trouble when i did learn for i used instead of going to cricket etc to go regularly at the hours of learning and fix myself like a statue at the window whilst the very worthy respectable universally respected mr angelo was instructing his pupils he used to say i think i hardly came honestly by my skill in fencing but angelo is as worthy amiable a man as ever lived and i dare say did not grudge me what i so gleaned from his great skill  when mr berkeley spoke his prize exercise in the parliament hall at st andrews before the then chancellor of that university the late earl of kinnoul when all the prize exercises had been delivered lord kinnoul went to mr berkeley and embracing him said i rejoice sir to embrace the grandson of my dear old friend bishop berkeley and to be able to say that i never heard speech so spoken from this pulpit since i have had the honor to be chancellor here mr berkeley had read his prize exercise near fifty times over to his mother just before he went out he conjured her to hear him once more that he might lay his emphasis exactly right the request was complied with  mr berkeley together with his amiable beloved friend the late learned sir john ramsey and his dear friend mr lennard frequently spent part of their vacation very pleasantly at lord kinnouls seat a droll anecdote or two might be here related particularly a scene in the library but this preface is already too long and the reader has perhaps frequently exclaimed what is all this chitchat to me i wish to read the great actions of great men if so according to the advice of the great johnson and the little editor read sir francis knollyss history of the turks marcus antoninus etc  but to return from this digression it is impossible to omit an amiable attention of a young scotch gentleman who with his wonderfully sensible younger brother thomas constantly attended the service of the church of england at dr berkeleys and who were frequently invited to visit there the young lord of logiealmon came running into mrs berkeleys dressing room quite breathless he threw himself into a chair and on mrs berkeleys enquiring if he was ill and asking whether he would have any thing he replied no my dear madam no but i flew hither to tell you how delightfully mr berkeley has spoken and in what extacies lord kinnoul one of the many guardians of this very pleasing amiable young gentleman said to me i thought it must delight you so i ran every step of the way that i might be the first to tell you of it i was sadly frightened at first poor mr berkeley the editor has heard from others never from her son although from him by letter she heard much of his expected tremors that the first night of his speaking at blenheim even whilst his obliging neighbors the mayor corporation and their families were clapping him which the dear amiable bishop of norwich wrote dr berkeley word the next post they did for some minutes before they suffered him to speak mr berkeley dropped his hat and was unable to take it up so exceedingly did his hand tremble and on the stage it must have remained but that the very accomplished amiable lord mount edgecombe happening to see mr berkeleys distress stepped on the stage picked up the hat and gave it to him trembled violently and was so long before he began to speak that i expected every moment the chancellor would say pray sir begin and that would have made him ten times worse but when he had once begun he got courage and went on nobly and every body is astonished this young gentleman was at that time barely fifteen years old may he as a man through life be what he was in youth  a very extraordinary circumstance happened at the birth of this young gentleman a very aged domestic of the drummond family many years more than an hundred who lived in a little cot by the bounty of the excellent lord on logiealmon estate as soon as he heard that his dear lord had a son walked down about a mile to get a sight of him he was told the infant was asleep he returned the next day the lord walked out lady catharine feared letting the child be carried out of the room he returned the day but one following the lord at home ordered the infant down to be viewed by worthy old steel who taking him into his arms said  lord now let thou thy servant depart in peace i thank thee for having permitted me to see the editor thinks the seventh generation of my dear old first master a somewhat similar circumstance occurred between two relations of the editor old tom leigh of iver the honestest old tory in england aged about ninety  on the birth of the late colonel powney member for windsor  ordered his coach and went over to iver place to congratulate his friend powney he rejected caudle cake etc and to the no small amazement of mr powney said tell your butler to bring us a bottle of wine the infant was desired to be brought down when mr leigh filling out a glass of wine took the infants hand saying little man i have come hither on purpose to have the pleasure of drinking a bottle of wine with you the fifth of your family with whom i have enjoyed that pleasure the powneys are a shortlived family the leighs in general very longlived the editors ancestor of that name lived to a great age  the excellent lord equally delighted ordered him refreshment he walked gently home sat down in his chair saying  now i am happy  and his faithful affectionate spirit took its flight without even a sigh  those medical gentlemen of skill who heard the above fact much spoken of at the time agreed that had he seen the young lord on the first day when he went for that purpose the spirit of the good old man had been freed three days sooner that his ardent desire had detained it one has frequently heard of similar instances of the detention of the spirit in its earthly prison for hours even days what a wonder is the spirit of man how passing wonder he who implants it in the curiously wrought prison the late very sensible unfortunate honorable colonel nairne a great collector who had a fine print of old steel which mr monck berkeley purchased with many other curiosities after his death has frequently told the editor that the engraver mistook in setting down his age one hundred and nine that it ought to have been one hundred and thirtynine one cannot help dropping a tear on the lamentable fate of this very accomplished wellinformed man his father lord nairne unfortunately engaged in the rebellion the son fighting for the hanover family the first duty to which he was appointed was to go and batter down his own noble magnificent castle his late majesty who knew him personally was very desirous to have given him a regiment and other bounties but the duke of cumberland prevented it by telling his majesty it was impossible a man who had suffered so much could ever forget or forgive it thus the desperate despairing poor sinner thinks of an allmerciful savior although he has repeatedly declared him that comes to me  ie during the state of trial on earth i will no wise cast out  there is no saving repentance after death  whilst we are on earth he is a sovereign  mighty to us the lamb of god that takes away the sins of the world the instant we quit the body he becomes our judge  the lion of the tribe of judah the editor is not a disciple of the acute  she has read horbury and thinks with dr young not so our infidels    a god all mercy  is a god unjust   indeed so anxious was mr berkeley to improve himself in public speaking that with the permission of principal mcormick of whose polite attentions to himself and the other english gentlemen students he always spoke in high terms the editor seldom recollects to have seen mr berkeley more angry than once in a large circle when a gentleman said mr berkeley dr gilbert stuart has wonderfully attacked your scotch principal of st andrews and proceeded to repeat what stuart had published mr berkeley reddened with indignation and said he is a rascal  and let him say what he will i say who lived near four years under his discipline that his conduct toward us was remarkably gentlemanlike and liberal and i am persuaded there is not one englishman that would not join me in declaring it and stuart is a rascal i repeat it  he instituted a literarii viginti who were to meet and speak for two or three hours in the evening either once a week or once a fortnight the principals professors gentlemen of the city and neighborhood frequently honored this little seminary of juvenile orators with their presence two on each side were generally chosen to speak and oppose and every one as in the house of commons was permitted to rise and speak on either side those appointed to speak on the subject always carried a speech prepared on paper mr berkeley used always to say hang that paper i am so glad when i have done with it when i throw my notes aside i can speak with spirit i hate to be hampered i love to be as the french say coudes franches i believe i shall do at the bar for i feel twice the strength after all my arguments are opposed and pulled to pieces that i do at going on without opposition it animates it inspires me  one morning after a viginti evening mrs berkeley walking out was met by professors hill hunter baron and many others who all congratulated her on the figure mr berkeley had made the preceding evening amongst the young orators it would be wasting ink to say how much the heart of the mother of an only child must have felt this commendation  a rather laughable circumstance occurred two or three days afterward mrs berkeley taking her usual walk by the sea was met by a lady who after complimenting her on mr berkeleys fine speaking added and my son spoke too and did pretty well i hear mrs berkeley who as her son always said of her would not flatter royalty no not her favorite queen of sheba were she now on earth said she was glad to hear that sweet   had done so well a most lovely excellent young man he was and mrs berkeley used frequently to say to him as she used to say to the angelic mr montgomerie a dozen years before   if i had a daughter with an hundred thousand pounds in her pocket and you had only the coat on your back such as you are i would beg the favor of you to marry her should any one read thus far perhaps long ago they have done it they will probably again exclaim the creature is a fool quite an idiot but the editor never conceived any happiness could arise from setting two sacks of gold together any more than that bread will be produced by setting two sacks of wheat side by side but to return this wise lady proceeded well mrs berkeley as both our sons have spoken and gained credit let you and i make an agreement that they shall not speak any more for fear they should lose the credit they have gained to which mrs berkeley observing the extreme cleverness of the speaker replied oh dear madam you know you are sole directress of   but thank god my son has a much wiser director than his mother dr berkeley is a most excellent judge and judicious director of young mens education and i have no more idea of interfering in parts of my sons education as a scholar than i have of sitting down to write a visitation or assize sermon for his father but i will certainly tell him what you madam say mrs berkeley failed not to do it but mr berkeley went on speaking without losing any of his credit as an orator two of the scotch speakers are now in england the learned entertaining reverend mr james bruce mr berkeleys tutor and the gentle pleasing mr william kemp tutor to mr lennard who was many years ago recommended through dr berkeleys recommendation by his amiable friend the late lord dacre into the family of the earl of beverley where his uncommon merits as a tutor are felt and most generously most nobly rewarded by the noble descendant of the great hero of chevychace  soon after mr berkeleys return to england he began to feel an ardent desire to obtain a seat in parliament how was that wish to be gratified bishop berkeley was too generous to amass a fortune he constantly gave away with both hands after thirty thousand pounds debt paid by mr berkeleys grandmother mrs frinsham and her single sister mrs cherry of their grandfather william cherry esquire and establishing instead of taking as ordered by him if wanted to pay his debts a very good estate left by him to found a charity school in the parish of bray in berkshire where lay a large part of his vast estate it would be a pleasantry to say that the burning of cliefdens  proud alcove finished it but on that conflagration the other day went ten thousand pounds more of old mr cherrys fortune he having lent the duke of buckingham commonly justly called the wicked duke of buckingham that sum to build that delightful mansion mr berkeleys mother and aunt have a note of hand of the duke for seven thousand pounds the editor did not produce it as any part of her fortune when she married the wonder was that so very acute a man as old mr cherry certainly was should lend to such a man as the duke of buckingham so large a sum on only a common note of hand  but mr cherry was immensely rich and lent to every one of his friends that asked him  accordingly his greatgranddaughter finds some of her kind friends much more ready to lend than she is to borrow  for which may god reward them here and hereafter  the south sea bubble had although not beggared yet wonderfully reduced the large remainder of mr cherrys fortune so that during the life of mr berkeleys mother he could not get a qualification that would sit easy on his conscience his mother on learning this offered to give up entirely into his hands her whole settlement adding i have from your infancy ever said if i must be absolutely dependant on any fallen child of adam may it be on berkeley not on dear sweet robert for berkeley has a generosity of soul that i have never seen in any human being through my whole life but in himself alone on saying this he exclaimed jesus avert that i should be such a villian no i would were it necessary sooner carry a brown musket than ever touch a sixpence of your settlement it is too small we all know no never whilst my name is berkeley will i ever diminish it it may i hope please god that i may live to add to it  on his coming home at vacationtime he often mentioned curious causes at westminster hall and the old bailey his father one day said berkeley it does not seem to me that you go often to the house of commons i should think that you would be there perpetually  mr berkeley  my dear sir i never go at all  dr b  never go how is that i am sure you know at least half an hundred members that would take you in  mr b  yes my dear sir i know men enough that would take me in every day if i would go but i will not go i dare not trust myself  mrs b  not trust yourself what do you think you should spring up and speak  mr b  no my dear madam no but i am afraid the devil should tempt me to long so much to get into parliament that i should deceive myself and reason myself into a belief that a sham qualification had no harm in it and therefore the lord being my helper i never will set foot in st stephens chapel unless i can go thither properly authorized to speak so you will never hear any account from me of the orators there  mr berkeley went perpetually to hear hastingss trial he told his father that after listening with all the attention he was possessed of to the harangues of a certain great orator he conceived that his grand argument was a strong arm which enabled him to thump the table violently the orator here described has certainly many other arguments than  thumping the table  but mr berkeley was so convinced of mr hastingss innocence with regard to money matters that he felt indignation at his nearest friends for not seeing it the editor at one time suffered a sort of persecution from her two sons the excellent mr grimston she always styled her second son so as to occasion her threatening to bolt her dressing room door  enter mr berkeley with a thick pamphlet  my dear mother i conjure you to read this and you will be convinced that hastings is an injured man my dear son i have read mr hastingss own letter where he says nothing can be done in this business until mr fowke is removed now you know i have told you a score times that if there is but one honest man upon earth that man is my old friend mr fowke whom i have not seen these last thirty years but men seldom turn rogues at fifty you know the two instances of his stern integrity that i have held up to your imitation since you were ten years old then enter mr grimston with two or three thick treatises on the iniquity of the slave trade  come now my dear madam i am sure you can you will find time to read these and you will see   see what my dear grimston you know that i am a great reader of a very old fashioned book and i read there in leviticus whosoever is found stealing a man shall surely be put to death now i believing with all my soul that argument against the slave trade what would you have more of me when they are stolen would to god all would treat them as does my kindly respected friend john ashley esquire of jamaica none of whose slaves will accept their freedom when asked  it must here be said that mr berkeley was a strenuous assertor of mr hastingss innocence he had put himself to considerable expense to procure documents from india and had prepared for the press perhaps as elaborate an investigation of mr hastingss conduct and character as beautiful a defense as was ever penned which he however the day before it was to be sent to the press sacrificed to paternal authority he brought it to the editor and with tears in his eyes threw it on her table saying there is a sacrifice to duty i beseech you to take care of it it cost me many pounds and much time and might have benefited i think an injured man do not let it be lost perhaps it may some time or other see the light it is as requested still carefully preserved with many other things of mr berkeleys writing for he was never idle but whilst in company when at his fathers he retired soon after dinner and immediately after tea as he very seldom ate any supper as soon as the cloth was removed his servant notified it to him and he came down and entertained his friends with his enlivening conversation and sometimes delighted the soul of his mother by complying with her request to sing to her the hymn sung by the eton college gentlemen it begins  salvator mundi etc it may be asked why the editor who as an old servant of her mothers once said  i dont know latin from english knows not latin but had two kind translators of it and mr berkeleys voice when he sang any thing sacred was quite divine very like mr airsons his father early in life charged him never to sing in company  until the servants came in to family prayers after which he more frequently retired to study than to rest  few persons were ever more strongly impressed with the terror of being called into judgment for idleness than mr berkeley during the latter part of his illness he would frequently exclaim lord forgive me what an idle life i do lead surely god will call me to account for it his mother assured him that  did not resemble pharaohs taskmasters that the work god had then appointed him to was what he daily performed bearing with the most perfect resignation and the sweetest cheerful submission his heavenly fathers gracious chastisements for which when not in actual agony he humbly heartily thanked god for sending him  mr berkeleys delicate attentions to his mothers feelings were thoroughly amiable when he was about three and twenty in the summer vacation he went down to his fathers and one day said to his mother i might have had a fine summer of it if i had pleased for my friend   pressed me exceedingly to spend it with him a charming high were spoken by mr berkeley for the editor who always laughed at the young men of her acquaintance for any thing outre  wishing to brush the moon or break their necks from an elevated phaeton or odious high gig charming high phaeton and four in hand a delightful neighborhood and near    mrs b  well my dear child and why were you such a simpleton as not to go  mr b  no i chose rather to come and spend some part of it with you  mrs b  with me how could you be such a fool have not i always told you as i used to tell your dear father when he was young if any pleasant scheme presents itself never to think you have a wife but enjoy it i will never expect you at home till i see you only write to me that i may enjoy your happiness by rebound so i have always said to you since you grew up do not think of your mother if you are happy she is so  mr b  well but my dear madam the case is this some fellow or other would have told you that   is a deist and they would have told you truth and then you would have been wild for fear of your poor bairne  mrs b  my dear i honor as i ever must the extreme delicacy of your conduct toward your mother from your childhood but i should not have been uneasy for i humbly thank god i am persuaded my bairne is too well grounded to let even the arguments of so learned so acute a man as   have any influence on your faith founded on the rock of ages  about two years before mr berkeleys death his mother said what is become of   i think i never hear you speak of him now  mr b  why no my dear mother i very seldom see him i found it quite impossible for me to do him any good and i was resolved that he should not do me any harm so by degrees i gently dropped him intimate as we formerly were  the blessings of being thoroughly instructed wellgrounded in the true faith in early youth is most beautifully described in a letter of the late dr kenrick prebendary of westminster minister of hambledown father of the worthy lady gibbon during dr berkeleys residence in scotland mr berkeley brought his mother a very dirty old edinburgh magazine with a leaf folded saying my dear madam there is a letter that will delight you it was from dr kenrick the year forgot it deserves to be printed in letters of gold  mr berkeley when staying at his fathers house in berkshire had books constantly from bulls circulating library at bath or from hookhams his amiable spirit led him always to order that some of the allowed number should be such as would be pleasant to his mother he one day coming down into the drawing room to tea with a book in his hand said observe now how persons are rewarded for serving their friends i sent for this book solely on my mothers account not meaning to read three pages of it myself for i am at present very busy and when i opened it to twirl over the leaves i have been so charmed by it that i have read every line attentively and when my mother has finished it i shall read it over again this book was the calvary of the excellent mr cumberland just then published mr berkeley spoke of it as it merits to be spoken of in all companies a learned critic once said sir i am surprised to hear you speak so very highly of it who are certainly a very excellent judge of poetry and began objecting to some lines which he termed prosaic at length mr berkeley replied well sir it is possible there may be more piety than poetry in some of the lines but i think it was worth being born if it were only to have written that excellent work  a gentleman once said to dr berkeley i wonder mr berkeley is not as vain and conceited as he is high so admired so caressed and courted as he is in town mr berkeley in conversation at the other end of the room overhearing it broke off and said alas sir no mr berkeley knows himself too well to be made vain he knows what he is equal to and can never be fool enough to be vain his humility was great when abroad every marked attention that was shown to him by eminent men of great learning or high rank he constantly humbly attributed to his being the grandson of so great a man as bishop berkeley who was extremely well known and highly respected as a wonderful genius in france italy and germany before what a late blackguard publication has called  a few lucky words of mr popes that great man according to the account of his very old intimate friend the late learned richard dalton esquire of lincolnshire who with sir john james accompanied bishop berkeley to america was at least sixtysix years old when the said  lucky words were written bishop berkeley was idolized in england  before he set off for america was offered a bishopric  used to go to st jamess two evenings in a week to dispute with dr samuel clarke before queen caroline then princess of wales  had a magnificent gold medal presented to him by his late majesty when prince of wales as a keepsake at the time that the father of the said publicator dr berkeley used frequently to say to his son i do admire the words of your mothers coining they are wonderfully expressive energetic  the editor when unexpectedly hearing of any base or worthless person or action has ever been addicted to utter her indignation in a word of her own composing if she thought no dictionary afforded one sufficiently strong was employed it is to be hoped not in cheating as bailiff by a noble relation of the bishops that noble goliath in punishing ingratitude and sauciness mr burke has most happily introduced holy job he has not quoted one verse quoted below for which as he mr burke says we do not find job reprehended  whose fathers i would have disdained to have set with the dogs of the flock  job chap xxx verse    it is certain that when bp berkeley dined at his noble relations lady   the father of this acute ungrateful publicator did not dine at the same table with her ladyship and the bishop by the generosity of mr berkeley the account in dr berkeleys own hand was lately shown by the editor to an acquaintance of the publicators  on the universal ourcry on the manner in which dr berkeley and his father are mentioned in that inimitable work the life of the excellent bishop horn one hundred and eightynine pounds at different times were presented to this publicator which must have been a pleasant addition to a poor curacy poor dr berkeley seems tacitly censured in the said publication for giving his honored patron  no rest until he preferred a particular friend the editor has been repeatedly asked who that was and violent exclamation has constantly followed the answer a gentleman within this week told the editor that dr berkeley said to him eighteen years ago until i had gotten preferment for  i used to receive all his publications bound in blue or green morocco magnificently gilt and lettered but since i have never received any even in boards dr berkeley in procuring from archbishop secker preferment for the reverend mr andrews the incomparable answerer of bishop warburton served the most grateful of men  farther this deponent says not at present  all the publicators letters some very curious were preserved by dr berkeley some few were deposited in the hands of the editor and are models of  in one the publicator tells dr berkeley i begin to think it time i got some dignity in the church as i wish to keep a carriage i think i should like a stall at canterbury it may perhaps not be impertinent to remark that the archbishop of canterbury has only three stalls to dispose of and that at this time his ladys nephew the polite elegant dr benson and the son of his friend bishop berkeley were only poor vicars the one of bray in berks the other of shepherdwell in kent the publicator seems to have labored to pour contempt on the name of berkeley but it was renowned in history before he was born every one remembers the answer that poor sir roger de coverley received from the royalist when he enquired the way to annes church soho that she was a saint before he was born and would be after he was hanged see the spectator   the editor hopes that she may not be doing what her honored fatherinlaw never would do when he refused to make the least answer to any of the scurrilous things written against him by that worse than savage monster archbishop king of dublin bishop berkeley saying the noticing them would be like preserving a dirty fly in amber the editor has frequently heard dr berkeley relate the following story from his father this old monster and bishop berkeley then fellow of dublin college a little known in the learned world were both at dinner in dublin at the house of an earl whose title the editor does not at present recollect but who had a beautiful lady and an house full of remarkably fine children during the time of dinner half a score of servants in waiting this purpled brute said whenever i see a parcel of fine children i always look round the table to see which of the footmen is the father of them with these words he threw his devilish eyes around the room the lay peer must have been a saint not to have ordered his domestics to drag the spiritual one nine times through the kennel and the lady must have been either an angel or a fool not instantly to have risen from table they however contented themselves with never admitting his grace within their doors any more the late dr berkeley used frequently to relate this and two or three other stories in order as he used to say to mr berkeley to call your mother out to be sure mrs berkeley used to storm nobly on these occasions to the great diversion of her amiable husband who used to ask what would she have done had she been lady  to which she used to reply why never have visited any woman who admitted that brute into her drawing room an heavy punishment to be sure but the editor insignificant as she is has often mortified fine ladies even of rank in that way she began early about the age of twenty soon after the death of her excellent mother being with her younger sister at a waterdrinking place lady  who had done   the favor to live with him five years previous to her being married to him came thither was visited by every mortal lady  lady  etc etc yet all this availed her poor ladyship with a set of horses two men cooks of whom she made frequent mention and about twenty thousand pounds per annum like haman with mordecai these two little insignificant country gentlemans daughters would not visit her ladyship they were told that it was ridiculous not to do it some of their relations their superiors told them that they ought to do it it availed not they were as stubborn as two little mules well but her ladyship would willi nilhi constantly join the one who drank the waters every morning and converse with her she one morning said she computed all her ill health to a bad lyingin fame said that her ladyship never had lainin at all  the editor and her sister always went to town every spring from windsor where they resided before mrs berkeley married for about two months or ten weeks to look about them and prevent their being rusticated at ranelagh the ridotto etc her ladyship never failed to find them out come to them and make the kindest enquiries a woman of quality once at an installation at windsor said to mrs berkeley then miss frinsham how comes it that you visit lady   miss frinsham  i visit her who told you that i visited her  lady  nobody but just now she happened to see you and said oh there is miss frinsham i must go and speak to her directly and away she bustled her ladyships gait was of that description i thought by her manner that you were very intimate  miss frinsham replied  it was her own fault that she did not enjoy that honor the poor lady is now no longer an inhabitant of this world  such contempt may the most insignificant pour on vice it is not saying  stand by thyself i am holier than thou god avert such pride from every real child of god the editor who during a course of forty years has been frequently in such skirmishes has been often asked if they may not be very penitent to which her constant reply is the poet tells us that  it is best repenting in a coach and six  but the editor has no great idea of the housemaid or the kitchenmaids repentance in the coach and six her penitents are such as the late lovely lady of   who having trusted that most agreeable of wretches too far was ruined and he compelled by authority to marry her she was as countryfolks in berkshire phrase it made an honest woman but the editor has been repeatedly told by an intimate excellent friend of hers who constantly added i had probably shared the same fate as miss  if my excellent motherinlaw had not watched over me at eighteen and never left me one minute alone with   adding i am sure had my mother been asked whether she would choose to leave me alone with   or with a tiger she would not have hesitated to prefer the tiger how different are mothers now in these enlightened days to what they were fifty years ago   was of the sly tiger kind and seldom laid wait for his prey in vain this excellent lady has often told the editor that after miss  was married no one ever saw that she had an eye for she never lifted those beauteous causes of her sad fall from the earth scarce ever spoke in company but little to her most intimate friends and died of grief at the end of two years happily her worthy son resembles his mother more than his father this was repentance although in a coach and six which miss s situation in life might entitle her to for she was the daughter of a gentleman and had a very good fortune  some few years ago dr berkeley going to spend some months at  mr monck berkeley said to his mother now my dear mother as soon as you get to  such a lady naming the name will visit you and you must return her visit you must not know that she broke her first husbands heart by her flirtations with her present husband whom she  but all that is nothing you know to you  no my dear but i am afraid it will be somewhat to her one day or other and must is a bold word for any body to use to your mother excepting it is your father he turned to his father and said i wished to hear my mothers sentiments of that lady  it has been said before that mr berkeley could not rest if he saw any creature in distress from which it was possible for him to relieve him in the year      during the long vacation mr berkeley with two of his temple friends j r baker esquire of lincolns inn fields and another very sensible amiable young gentleman now no more took a trip to the continent during their residence there mr berkeley had it in his power to assist in a very awkward and unpleasant situation a very worthy amiable personage of very high rank his serene highness the then reigning prince of saxe gotha uncle to the king of england the circumstances attending this transaction are too long to be related here in the vessel the prince saw and admired mr berkeleys wonderfully curious highland dog of a very scarce breed so much as to make mr berkeley often regret that he could not prevail upon himself to present him to his serene highness but adding my faithful companion so many hundred miles in so many different countries i found i could not part with oscar mr berkeleys honest scot richie did the honors of oscar told his serene highness many wonderful yet actually true stories of the sagacity fidelity prudence of that lovely beast on the discovery of the dukes rank poor ritchie said to his master lord sir what an a sad thing it is that i must lave ye  mr berkeley  leave me ritchie why must you leave me have you got a better place laddy  ritchie  no sir no but i can never go back to england  mr b  why not ritchie  ritchie  why sir that elderly gentleman that talked so much to you is the kings uncle lord have mercy upon me and that ever i should not know it and should dare to talk to him so about the dog  to be sure the king will have me hanged if i go back to england i will stay till you go and then contrive if i can to slip into scotland  mr berkeley answered for his majesty but some of mr berkeleys english friends to divert themselves encouraged poor ritchies fears his serene highness at parting expressed his gratitude for mr berkeleys services and most condescendingly said i find sir that you are a great traveller i hope sometime or other that curiosity although we have not much of curious may lead you to my court where i shall be most happy to return your wonderfully kind attentions to me by every respect in my power  mr berkeley used often to say ritchie is a true scot he will not own that he sees like the pumkins in the the wellknown story of the english gentlemans ordering his gardener to tie pumkins on a pear tree  and the foolish vain scot saying he had seen the like in the duke of argyles garden in scotland no person is ridiculous for unavoidable ignorance  every person of every nation for pretending to knowledge they do not possess duke of argyles garden any thing of any kind better in england than in scotland one day when mr berkeley came down to dinner he said well i must confess ritchie has at length vanquished me just when i plumed myself on victory as he was dressing my hair just now it occurred to me i will ask richie if ever he saw a crusade in scotland and see if he will answer o yes sir in the loodons i e the lothians i put the question ritchie did you ever see a crusade  ritchie  crusade sir what an a thing is it is it any beasty i e a beast  mr b  no it is a great number of people collected together to go to jerusalem to recover it out of the hands of the infidels  ritchie  o yes sir i have seen that in the loodons his native county when you were in edinburgh last you gave me leave to visit my friends and i heard of them and went to the wood where they were all waiting to go to jerusalem  mr berkeley then recollected to have heard in edinburgh that there were a few deluded poor creatures who had assembled themselves in a wood expecting to be conveyed through the air to the holy land their numbers increased prodigiously afterward as was related and a long account was given of them in some magazine the editor thinks the gentlemans what became of these poor deluded souls she does not recollect to have heard but mr berkeley laughing said i must now give it up as a gone cause the hope of finding out any thing ritchie has not seen in the loodons  the publicator as mentioned before very soon found out that he did not like the situation of his living poor dr berkeley was worried to besiege good archbishop secker to exchange it for another one with a better house and much better income was soon given to this  particular this grateful friend where he commenced his acquaintance and by the elegance of his manners soon formed that intimacy with the present sir edward dering baronet of surrenden which for many months afforded so much amusement in west kent and even in east kent his contentions with that gentleman concerning game could not be that he might send some to his friend dr berkeley for he never in his whole life sent him even a lark  some time after the publicator had been gratified by the exchange of his living dr berkeley went as he frequently did to make a visit of some weeks at lambeth the first day at dinner his grace accosted him thus dr berkeley i hear that your friend mr  has been in town for about a fortnight i hear it for i cannot say i saw him he did not find his way to lambeth poor dr berkeley sat abashed at as he termed it the brutal folly to say nothing of the ingratitude of this particular friend and replied i hope that your grace must have been misinformed  no my good young gentleman i have not been misinformed then quickening his voice as he frequently did for he was seen driving over westminsterbridge in a hackneycoach the publicator had not then a carriage of his own and quickening his voice still more in many other parts of the town to this no answer could possibly be made a mourn silence followed until broken by that loveliest of women the angelic the incomparable miss talbot who to relieve her distressed friend introduced some pleasanter subject than the mavelous as dr berkeley termed it conduct of the particular friend dr berkeley at his return home appeared extemely chagrined on relating it  some time after on taxing the publicator with his unaccountably strange conduct he excused himself very cleverly by saying aye i believe i should have gone but i had not time for to tell you the truth i went to london always to a friends house to show beely and peggy the waxwork and the monuments and the lions and every thing it was very lucky that it did not occur to him to carry beely and peggy to dinner with his grace on a public day and show them the lollards tower there  the publicator seems to have taken pains to tack at the very end of the list of bishop hornes friends dr then george berkeley esquire  a real esquire from his poor unknown fathers rank in life and expending every year at oxford as he has repeatedly told the editor  not in vice she is sure as his excellent father said when on his arrival in oxford dr berkeley said i am ashamed my lord to say that i have spent six hundred pounds in four months  here is the account the bishop made the above generous reply not in vice i am sure child and threw the account into the fire it was great part in virtue a servant to wait on himself and a groom for his horses could not be reckoned extravagant a young man who never tasted wine could not spend more than a thousand pounds per annum but having never been according to his son buffeted through a public school and being quite unacquainted with characters he was perpetually imposed on by designing ungrateful young men to whom he was too bountiful as appears by his accounts now in the editors possession from the day he arrived at christ church he is receiving his reward they no doubt will receive theirs much went in charity to real frequently unknown objects  the editor has frequently heard dr berkeley say that one morning at christ church his servant shaving him he read a sermon preached on charity for lyingin women in aldersgate street the preacher the editor thinks a prelate described the miseries of poor women in those circumstances so pathetically that dr berkeley said i a young man had never thought on i felt it so strongly that with one half of my chin unshaved i made my servant lay down the razor catched up a sheet of paper wrote to my banker an order to pay to the treasure of the hospital fifty pounds to make me a governor for life for fear i should be at any time unwilling to pay the annual subscription  some scotch friend the editor has not been able to disdiscover who has celebrated dr berkeleys charities to the poor during his sejour with his son at the university of st andrews saying that he every year gave away above two hundred pounds with his own hands this is a mistake he very seldom did give with his own elegant hands unless his wifes may be called his own for unless which was frequently the case he enclosed in a blank cover a ten often a twenty pound bank note to any person unable to ask though not to receive charity whose face he had never seen only heard from good authority of their distress how often has he thus  made the widows heart to sing for joy and with holy job the blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon him in other instances with regard to the surrounding poor he always left the pleasing task on mrs berkeley constantly saying i never trouble myself my wife is my almoner adding as mrs berkeley once said to her excellent kind friend dr lynch prebendary of canterbury on his asking her concerning a poor old man  i know nothing of him when once i have introduced an object of charity to you or mrs tatton one of the charitable daughters of the nobly charitable dean and mrs lynch i never trouble myself any more about them but search out some new objects well knowing that they will have ample abundant care taken of them  a scotch minister was once celebrating to mrs berkeley the vast charities of the late earl of lauderdale  a very worthy nobleman he was he began by saying his charities are amazingly great indeed as surely as you sit there madam that man puts a guinea into the plate a plate at every kirk door guarded by two ruling elders every sabbath day and every year three guineas at the occasion the annual kirk sacrament to which a cook of the editors lamentable to tell returned so often to the kirk that she was shamefully intoxicated the expense of wine on these occasions is said to be very great indeed that of bread very small   mrs berkeley replied lord lauderdale has i know not a large paternal estate but he married a very worthy friend of mine the daughter of sir thomas loombe with an english fortune of four thousand pounds per annum so that lending fiftythree guineas annually to the lord i do not consider as being so very bountiful as you sir do i will now tell you of a bountiful donor to the poor the late dean of canterbury father to our equally charitable amiable ambassador at turin sir william lynch the dean had a large paternal estate married one of the daughters of archbishop wake with a large fortune and had considerable church preferment now guess what he gave annually to the poor  scotch minister  i cannot tell  mrs b  guess  scotch min  why perhaps he might give them a hundred pounds a year  mr b  no but he gave them nearer to a thousand for of all his vast income it is universally known at canterbury and forty miles round that he constantly gave to the poor ten pounds out of every hundred he received from whatever quarter it came beside all sort of good things made for the sick poor in his kitchen and storeroom and to this that he kept open house for rich and poor and when the silk manufactory now alas no more was at a low ebb he nobly asked will my new furnishing the deanery with silk damask help to raise it and being answered in the affirmative he instantly ordered five hundred pounds worth of furniture damask to be wove which saved it at that time  it is to be hoped when a score or two more of ladies have been burnt to death by wearing muslin gowns in winter  absurd ridiculous foolish fashions that the editors poor honest quondam neighbors may again use their looms if the editors leisure had permitted she would have advised them in the canterbury newspapers not to elect any member to represent their ancient city in the new parliament who would not promise to make his wife and daughters wear silk gowns at least during the winter season the inhabitants of canterbury are surely as respectable as those of manchester who will not admit of their printedlinens being slightly taxed  the editor has had occasion to remark that the publicator was not very forward to make any grateful return for any favor bestowed on him for he never presented his friend dr berkeley even with a lark see above p ccxxxvi  it is commonly said that in the county of berks during the partridge season there are as many guns as birds therefore game is always a most agreeable present especially to those who keep much company and frequently in their several seasons would arrive hares partridges pheasants etc from the very grateful mr andrews of marden in kent he never suffered any neighbor to go to london without requesting him to take some game and send it down by the maidenhead coach the year that archbishop secker presented mr andrews to this living apples sailed in every county of england except kent which is no great wonder since the farmers of that county pay most careful attention to their trees in winter clearing them of all dead wood moss etc mr andrews packed up his whole crop of apples in hampers and sent them all except a very few stinted ones apples that year were such rarities that mrs berkeley suggested to dr berkeley to send them to lambeth palace which was speedily done a few only being reserved as curiosities and a most acceptable offering they proved dr and mrs berkeley going to make some stay at lambeth palace soon after the first day after dinner from some apples being on the table the archbishop with his wonted politeness said lady and gentleman will you not eat some of your own fine apples how came it to pass that your trees produced this wonderfully scarce year to which dr berkeley replied alas my good lord we had not a score on all our trees they are the grateful offering of a very grateful man mr andrews and my wife thought that as we owed the apples to your graces goodness to him they ought in conscience to be sent to your grace who with his accustomed pleasantry turning to mrs berkeley who had the honor to be a great favorite with his grace said why my good young lady i dont know that i ought to accept thse apples i am afraid they are a little simoniacal to which mrs berkeley replied oh no my lord if they had come before your grace had preferred mr andrews it might have been a case for bishop taylors ductor dubitantium but i think as it is your grace may eat them with a very safe conscience his grace laughed heartily and said i remember arch bishop potter used to tell of a man whom he had given a small living on which grew a remarkably fine peartree he used every year to send the pears to lambeth his grace gave him a second much better living and he used to say whether the pear tree died or the pears were blighted every year i know not but i know that i never saw another pear after i gave the second living this grateful man did not probably like the publicator expect one of the three stalls at canterbury he was at least modest if ungrateful  it is not possible to avoid contrasting two men both of whom were indebted for their first comfortable establishment in life to the exquisite amiability of dr berkeley the reverend dr glass and the publicator when mr monck berkeley was about six or seven years old dr glass said more than once if you and mrs berkeley would confide your little man to me how happy should i be what care and attention i would pay him and i am sure if you would condescend to accept it i desire neither fee nor reward the last grateful offer was of course thankfully declined and from mr berkeleys birth his father determined that if god spared his life he should be educated at a public school often lamenting that the good bishop had not sent him to one particularly after his son grew up often saying he had then got a second guardian bishop berkeley at one time for several years paid four hundred pounds per annum to different masters to instruct his children in music painting fencing riding and french the latin and greek he entrusted to none but himself his sons were never suffered either to ride or walk out unattended by a careful servant  when dr berkeley came to oxford at the age of nineteen attended by a most respectable worthy chaplain of his fathers and his own servant he had never rode a mile alone and he had contracted an habit of meditating and composing on horseback which occasioned his being the most careless of riders leaving the horses bridle so very loose that he was perpetually thrown soon after his marriage mrs berkeley finding this to be the case made it a point that he never should ride without a servant when mr berkeley grew up he joined in what dr berkeley called his mothers persecution and one day said what is the reason i would fain know why your mother lets you ride fifty miles without a servant and over hedge and ditch nobody knows where hunting and will not let me ride to taplow or maidenhead alone to which mr berkeley replied ah my dear sir if you had been buffeted for seven years though eton school i dare say my mother would have let you ride alone as mr berkeley constantly hunted with buckhounds twice a week  frequently with mr claytons hounds it was not so quietly as mr monck berkeley supposed for dr berkeley used to say on hunting days  prays the whole morning  let me go into the dressing room ever so often i am sure to hear  berkeley is not come home  god watch over him and send him safe these ejaculations were frequently continued till the afternoon they were certainly heard by him who hears prayer and as it should seem answered for mr berkeley never once got a fall in hunting  he rode remarkably well he never would cross his majesty in the chase he used frequently to express indignation at a hunting butcher particularly well mounted who used to cross so as sometimes to endanger his majesty saying what can the fellow be made of to be such a savage to which dr berkeley used to say why of bulls hides to be sure quietly as she does me but that is out of the question for ride alone you must not that is agreed on all hands to which dr berkeley replied i am sure you are obliged to me sir i wish i had been buffeted any where in my youth as you have been you rogue  but to return from this digression to the contrast of as mrs george berkeley ever termed him the really grateful dr glass we have seen his kind offer in the preceding page we will now proceed to the publicators polite refusal when archbishop cornwallis visited at canterbury he was of course at the deanery it was impossible that the attendant bishop should be also lodged there on a consultation concerning the place where he should be received and entertained not one of the prebendaries seemed desirous of that honor the generous hospitable dr lynch was not then a member of the choir and it must in justice be said that numbers of the prebendaries who are not in office let their prebendal houses and are only visitors or boarders to their tenants so they have it not in their power to receive any one it was suggested that the prelate must be contented to go to one of the miserably bad excessively dear inns in the city this shocked dr berkeley although only the son of a poor unknown irish prelate and he instantly said bad as my house is it is better than a nasty dirty inn he shall be my guest as soon as it was known who the attending bishop was dr berkeley wrote a polite letter requesting the honor of having his lordship for his guest mrs berkeley requested her amiable consort to permit her to invite his lady with whom she had the honor to be acquainted and whose lovely eldest sister sweet beautiful miss maddox was a beloved friend of her childhood bishop maddox when a welsh bishop had for several summers a house at east burnham in the neighborhood of white waltham that lovely creature died early the editor cherishes with tender care a keepsake a small silver medal given by the good bishop to his sweet daughter to present to her little friend  some days before the arrival of the archbishop etc dr berkeley said the children then both living at home and going to dr beauvoirs school will be horridly in the servants way for we must keep open house for a fortnight what can we do with them mrs berkeley said she would contrive it as well as she could they should get a cold dinner at one and be off to play directly mrs frinsham then at dr berkeleys said you know i am going to ramsgate and i will take one it was dr berkeley replied you are very kind you shall take robert and it has just occurred to me that i will send berkeley to  he will be glad of an opportunity of obliging me dr berkeley was alas ever too apt to judge of others by his amiable self delighted with this idea he wrote to the publicator stating his situation and saying on such a day john will deliver into your care my eldest boy for a fortnight at the expiration of which i shall fetch him home by the return of the post dr berkeley received a letter from the publicator saying that he was very sorry that it so happened that he could not possibly receive his little nor spelt but always so pronounced by the elegant publicator when speaking of the young gentlemen his boarders  my bouys  or of his own son who was a remarkably elegant lad the editor has not seen him since he was a very pleasing youth when she advised his father in return for the latin and greek he taught his son to make him teach him a little politeness dr berkeley said nobody flatters  like my wife on which mrs berkeley fired and said  i flatter him how can you say so  nay i will prove it for whenever he is here you will not suffer any body else to speak but say do pray hold you tongues that i may hear what  says about botany farming etc in which he is well skilled bouy but that he had just settled all matters to take his pupils to the sea to show them the shipping and give them a weeks pleasure  it was unlucky but it could not be helped dr berkeley flew with this letter to mrs berkeley saying well this is the luckiest thing in the world then read the epistle observing it will make berkeley just then turned of eleven years old and as an excellent judge used to say the bestbred properly behaved child of that age in england no affected manly airs but a sweetly polite lad as happy as a prince poor fellow dr berkeley notified this by letter immediately to the publicator who instantly returned the following elegant grateful answer the letter is carefully preserved my dear friend his constant familiar address to dr berkeley i cannot help thinking you very unreasonable in wanting to fasten your son upon me especially at a time when i have told you that i cannot take him the letter goes on in the same elegant style poor dr berkeley was for the time very very angry indeed and mrs berkeley maliciously laughed at the gratitude of his dear friend after some time dr berkeley wrote a letter to the publicator and as was frequently his custom when going out to dinner passing from his study threw half a dozen letters on the table in mrs berkeleys dressing room saying i am in haste i shall be distanced pray seal these unsealed ones and send them all with yours to post the letter to the grateful friend was safely sealed and mrs berkeley having very little of our grandmother eves curiosity in her composition did not ask permission to read it but hollowing it up she with a good pen wrote as plainly as she could contrive to do the little word gratitude off went the letter to the post in a few days dr berkeley coming into the drawing room to tea said i have got a letter from  in which he seems much disquieted he asks what could possibly induce some member of my family to write on the edge of the inside of the letter i last wrote to him the word gratitude my dear do you know any thing about it mrs berkeley from her cradle to she trusts her coffin too proud to tell a lie instantly replied to be sure i do for i wrote it  dr berkeley said why would you write  because i think it a mighty pretty word  your wrath against  like most violent blazes has abated  the editor cannot dismiss the publicator without remarking that had it pleased the divine goodness to have spared dr berkeley to have seen the contempt endeavored to be thrown on his very deeplylearned justly universally admired father his indignation would not have subsided as it for some time did on account of his little son dr berkeley never did never would forgive a greater man than even the publicator for speaking as he thought improperly against his excellent father for which great man and his incomparable writings he had through life the greatest respect rambler john as dr berkeley who generally read a rambler once a week termed that great man his son always called him the noble learned bear the accident happening at oxford was too well known then too well remembered by many gentlemen then present still living to be here detailed suffice it therefore to say that johnsons want of le savoir vivre occasioned his ridiculing bishop berkeleys american scheme by which he meant to introduce episcopacy there always declaring if it was not done in a few years the colonies would revolt from the mother country the event has shown that this unknown prelate was not a false prophet what the father could not accomplish the son contrived to bring about by his interest with the scotch bishops the very excellent very deeply learned bishop skinner the very pious bishop falconer who died soon after and the amiable worthy sir john strachan baronet as now that he is no more may be publicly known in a letter to a friend written some time after dr berkeley says i was well aware that it would never be forgiven but i rejoice that i have done it  dr berkeley selt his amiable heart gratified in rendering every possible service in his power to the repeal of lord hardwickes horrid act after the rebellion in      had dr berkeleys advice been adhered to the first attempt had succeeded when the three scotch prelates came over the first time to solicit it but in most transactions there is generally a marplot dr berkeley was particularly happy in entertaining at his house in berkshire and endeavoring to return the very polite hospitality of sir john strachan to himself and family at dundee and of bishop skinner to his son when at aberdeen where mr monck berkeley had the freedom of the city presented to him as he had of several other cities and towns in scotland and a license presented to shoot on very manor wherever he went he spent near a fortnight at taymouth most agreeably the editor fears to trust her once retentive now alas treacherous memory to say of sixteen gentlemen who sat down to dinner every day how many were john campbell this came out accidentally some one not knowing mr berkeleys partiality for scotland said how ridiculous they are calling themselves by the names of their estates mr berkeley reddened and said pray sir why so how would you have them distinguish themselves  why by their christian names as we do  that will not do sir the mode of distinguishing several brothers in a public school major minor etc will not do nor will first second third do he then mentioned as above related the worthy learned lord of ahaladar certainly not spelt right by the editor although so pronounced and his accomplished amiable eldest son both much beloved by mr berkeley were two of near half a score john campbells mr berkeley retained a most grateful sense of the kind elegant hospitality at ahaladar talking frequently after his return from college of jack ahaladar his brother asked who is jack ahaladar of whom you talk so much why the young lord a charming young man  you would like him  probably now the elegant lord of ahaladar as the editor thinks she was told the worthy old lord is dead he presented mr berkeley with a very curious original letter which when the editor can afford to print the second volume of literary relics will be published in it  to return from this digression dr johnson had no sooner finished his rude sentence than dr then mr berkeley then a little turned of twenty rose from his seat reached his cap made his bow and to the no small distress of the gentleman who had invited him to meet dr johnson quitted the room in great indignation before supper on some of the company intimates of dr johnson reproaching him for his  conduct he made a sort of amend honorable by saying why i think the bishops scheme no bad one but i abused it to take down the young gentleman lest he should be too vain of having had such a father some one presumed to say mr berkeley was exquisitely wellbred not at all insolent to which he replied no not at all but i thought it might do him good to mortify him a little dr johnson wished to have written the bishops life but dr berkeley said he would not furnish him with any documents which mr monck berkeley used exceedingly to regret saying to his father my dear sir it will never be so written as johnson would have written it to which dr berkeley used to reply it may be so but i was resolved he should not write it you may if you please dr johnson through a common friend made many attempts to visit dr berkeley in berkshire and once said i have a good mind to go down to cookham and see what they would say to me mrs berkeley hoped that her beloved partner would have said we should be very happy to see him but his reply was no the man that could speak slightingly of my great father shall never be entertained under his sons roof it is therefore probable that this respectful mention of bishop berkeley by the publicator would have completed the business begun by the smothering of the consecration sermon for four years  dr berkeley preserved all the letters he received except now and then one which he flung into the fire before he appeared to have read it through and like his father and dean swift some he never opened at all but threw them into a drawer after his lamented death the editor found a bakers dozen fourteen from a fleecing ingrate with the seal unbroken as she told the man when obliged to hold a short conversation with him it has been often said of the editors grandfather the celebrated francis cherry esquire that he met with more ingrates than any other man ever did i suppose of most persons of very large fortunes and very liberal minds it may with equal truth be asserted dr berkeleys fortune was by no means large but his soul was noble he by his wise advice and direction made the fortunes of great numbers mrs berkeley used often to say to him my dear friend you can make the fortune of every one you take in hand but yourself and your son and you will not stir a stroke for him his reply constantly was i cannot help it i cannot ask or push for myself or for him if others do not it must remain undone by me both are now happily provided for by  that friend who sticks closer than a brother both are receiving the reward of their labor of love to real friends and base ingrates whom may god for christs sake forgive prays the editor  having been obliged necessarily obliged to descant so much on that odious temper of the mind ingratitude she turns with double treble pleasure to what her beloved respected friend mrs duncombe has ever obligingly observed is the prominent feature in her character to whom that lady has repeatedly said no one can do any thing for you but give you a dish of tea a very delightful solace a pleasure now almost totally lost to the editor  a poor oldfashioned creature who does not like that solace at halfpast seven or eight she not being able to sleep without a small quantity of maltliquor a most excellent safe narcotic so much so that for very many years she never took it at night as it prevented her rising at five in the morning  when she was young to improve her own mind afterward to attend to her childrens not long ago about a quarter after nine just as the editor was sitting down to her slice of french roll and glass of beer her servant announcing the arrival of a lady in the drawing room the editor involuntarily said if it had been five minutes later i had supped and it would have been so pleasant to have enjoyed   conversation after supper which was that night unavoidably deferred until halfpast ten the editor rejoices that her spirit is not as wilful as her sadly weakened stomach which suffers direfully if it does not get the very small dinner it will receive at three and so on in course according to the vulgar hours in use  0 years ago  surely in pleasant company without your setting about to think what return you shall make them the editor ever did still does labor as lord burleigh in his letter advises his son robert on a very different principle to advance his own interest to find out something that may be acceptable to his great and noble friends the editor having been still being joint possessor with her excellent sister of some curious things collected by their accomplished grandfather francis cherry esquire a great antiquary and curious collector before antiquarian societies were formed has generally been so fortunate as to select some token of her gratitude to offer to her sons friends of highest rank more substantial than words well remembering the saying of a witty old servant of her mothers who lived with her before the editors birth and died at near an hundred last summer this worthy womans uncommon wit introduced her as nurse to all the lyingin ladies and sick gentlemen and ladies in the neighborhood whose spirits she by her wit kept up when the apothecarys cordial failed to do it this humane woman when at her own home always nursed the poorest of her neighbors gratis she was a pious woman and is now receiving the reward of her labors of love she when persons said much and did little would looking archly sing from an old song aye aye words fine words are but wind etc   so has ever thought the editor so may she ever think whilst she possesses any thing else to offer but there are those who withhold even those witness the learned publicator and another infamous ingrate who owed to dr berkeley wonderful obligations indeed being in the receipt of near two thousand pounds per annum at the time of his death but he is spared for the present his excellent amiable brother having accidentally stumbled once on mr monck berkeley at bath and having there and ever after until his death paid him every polite respectful attention and it would wound the lovely tender heart of that gentleman to see his worthless brothers corrupt base putrid heart dissected some few years before his universally unlamented death he condescended to visit dr berkeley he was often for weeks within three miles of him without doing it one morning the honorable mr  came in saying i should not have visited you just yet as i am much in debt but that i come to bring you a message from doctor  he has been staying with me these last ten days  doctor berkeley replied so i heard or i had visited you  this morning when he was going away he said nonchalantly mr  i beg the favor of you when you see doctor berkeley to give my compliments to him and tell him i should have waited upon him but the weather has been so catching i could not venture to cookham  mr replied oh i shall see him very soon for we meet often  so i have come down to day on purpose to bring you the message not for fear i should forget it adding i did long to have said there are plenty of postchaises at marchs and that you have money to pay the hire of one is owing to doctor berkeley in a large company some gentleman gave doctor berkeley for his toast and turning to doctor  said i am sure sir you will drink my toast in a bumper he rolled his boiled fishes eyes exhibited his exceedingly fine teeth and asked why so sir the gentleman spiritedly replied if you do not know sir i shall not tell you the very learned very worthy mr whitaker formerly curate of his beloved friend doctor berkeley was one of the company  on this persons getting his first preferment dr berkeley generously lent him one hundred pounds to get things a little decent in his house and had some difficulty a few years after to get it repaid dr berkeley was gone out on horseback mrs berkeley heard the bell of the front gate ring nobody appearing she rang to enquire who it was the servant above named said it was dr   how came it that he he did not come in  i told him madam that my master was out he asked for you but i thought you did not wish to see him so i told him that my master and you were going out to dinner  and i believed you were dressing this honest man when waiting at table had so often heard the honorable mr  and other gentlemen of the neighborhood abuse this ingrates shameful inattention to dr berkeley that he very naturally supposed his mistress who ever resented ten times more for her friends than for herself was not very partial to him he is no longer an inhabitant of this world dr berkeleys goodness probably hastened his removal to  another world  two very different personages are now coming on the tapis two grateful or rather one gently amiable the other amiably grateful  some days before archbishop cornwalliss arrival at canterbury as before mentioned one afternoon the servant announced the arrival of that loveliest of women in mind as well as person the late mrs tucker as soon as seated she began in her sweetly musical voice saying that having heard that dr berkeley was to have the attendant bishop for his guest she came to beg that master berkeley might be her guest for the next fortnight that she had prepared a bed for him and that the utmost care should be taken of him that no one in the county of kent could doubt where her fame as well as in many other counties was as it justly merited blazed abroad  a young gentleman of large fortune at canterbury school the amiable richard tilden esquire who boarded at the second masters mr tuckers was nursed by mrs tucker through a dreadful fever mrs tucker although then lyingin caused his bed to be removed into her own chamber that she might see he got his medicines at the appointed hours as soon as sufficiently recovered he was conveyed home where he had not been many days when he requested his mother he was an orphan to order the coach to carry him back to mrs tucker saying that he liked her nursing better than home nursing and the request was complied with this happened before the editor was resident at canterbury but has been frequently related to her by her very sensible worthy friend the late lady head and by many other persons  mr tilden was a more than father to the editors youngest son of whom he was so very fond and to whom he was so very kind that the little creature one day said to his mother mamma i shall never want money for dick tilden it is the custom at canterbury school to call the eldest and all the brothers by their christian name bids me whenever i want a shilling come to him and if any great boy that i cannot manage beats me he always beats him soundly for his pains mr tilden when the amiable protector of the beauteous little robert was eighteeny ears old soon going to the university he staid to mourn the death of his grateful little protege how amiable are some youths what odious savages are others but the exquisite unaffected sweetness of mrs tucker the editor allows unaffected sweetness gentleness etc etc not only infused sweetness into her own children but into most of her boarders generally sons of the first gentlemen in the county often from other counties  the instance of an amiably retentive grateful mind is now to be adduced from one of those boarders the editor received the account from such authority as precludes a possibility of her having been deceived besides as it is often said facts are stubborn things  the present lord thurlow immediately on his receiving the great seal applied to a kentish gentleman has my dear old mistress mrs tucker any son that i can provide for  no my lord her eldest son is but twenty  dont tell me of twenty the living of gravesend shall be held for him till he is four and twenty that very learned worthy careful now private instructor of youth with his amiable partner has been many years at gravesend blessing the noble gratitude of the generous grateful lord thurlow why is gratitude so very rare so scarce a plant in human hearts but that man is a fallen creature lions have it dogs have it in a high degree even the feathered tribe have it some of the wildest of them the worthy woman above named as having served the editor above twenty years is as well as her old fellow servant mr wrightson wonderfully tender and kind to the brute creation the editors cook so much so as to have occasioned the housekeeper one day telling the editor that mr wrightson and herself had at length extorted a promise from the cook that when she married she would not keep a cat as they were sure she would starve it to death the worthy woman married from dr berkeleys and her cat and self are both en bon point now living at cookham rather negligent of them the housekeeper amused herself with feeding a parcel of guinea fowls in general very wild birds these creatures although never fed but once a day used to run flocking around her every time she went into the meadows where they wandered and more than one sunday it was with considerable difficulty that she got into the church without near forty of her feathered friends escorting her she had reared near thirty of them difficult as the task is the hens being very bad nurses they well knew the hour of feeding was past it was gratitude shame to human nature which the famous dr cheyne used to say was without gods grace a compound of brute and devil but these poor quadrupeds and winged fowl have not gods grace and yet they shame mankind  the incomparable mrs tucker is not held up here as a grateful person in contrast to the publicator for she owed no gratitude either to dr or to mrs berkeley unless it was for uniting with the whole church city and neighborhood in admiration of the angelic manner in which she treated and attended to the bodies and souls of mr tuckers house full of young gentlemen boarders aided by her sedate wise excellent eldest daughter her beautiful lovely second daughter then too young for any thing but to be universally admired and beloved which she continues to be in an eminent degree by all who have the pleasure of knowing her and what is above all by her thoroughly polite accomplished husband mr symonds a gentleman of large fortune in leicestershire long may she be spared to him and his children  the editor regrets that she has trespassed so long on the patience of the reader having delivered her sentiments freely on gratitude and ingratitude it would be unpardonable in her to close this long preface without acknowledging the great obligations she feels that she lies under to several amiable friends of her excellent son and of her unworthy self not for any the smallest assistance in scrawling these undigested immethodical pages it would be injustice it would be more it would be cruelty to let it be suspected that any literary friend learned male or cultivated female had the smallest share in this poor performance the editor is at present too far removed from the press and franking being alas almost annihilated she has not had it in her power even to consult a friend capable of directing or advising her one only excepted who was too tenderly affected at hearing half a dozen lines read however excellently qualified to direct advise or correct any hobbling sentence  the editors son used often to regret that his mother would not write poetry saying he was very sure she could if she would as did a poetical friend of her youth whose name often appears in dodsleys collection of poems had either lived to see how lamentably she acquits herself in prose it had saved her some persecution both were more angry at her repeated declarations that she did not love poetry very rarely read it excepting dr youngs night thoughts and some parts of milton etc the poetry of de la crusca must charm a savage  in mr monck berkeleys benevolent vindication in the authors preface to the poems he exhorts people to remember that the reviewers are but men if those gentlemen condescend to review a few pages written by a feminine pen the editor wishes them to remember that she is a woman a suffering old woman with most of the accomplishments at threescore that most females have at the age of man ten years later  that she served an apprenticeship to extreme anxiety and anguish for very near seven years  seeing daily the declining state of health of the two nearest and dearest connections in life obliged to affect ease and often cheerfulness whilst her heart bled at every vein unfortunately for her both father and son through their lives declared that if the editors constant even cheerfulness never high never low failed both would give themselves up to absolute despair the strong exertions necessary to act the part to their satisfaction have certainly brought on a premature old age and the editor according to the witty wise pious bishop tailor is quite readydressed for the grave whither she seems hasting apace the bishop in his holy dying says dim eyes gray hairs stiff joints etc etc are all so many  dressings for the grave he does not add dulled faculties i am sure he might although perhaps he might not feel it his own wit being too well tempered to have the keenness of its edge blunted by aught but death itself that is the lot of but very few perhaps the great mr burke may escape it who yet ten years ago complained of his tongue and his fingers they have however enabled him to hold his pen to bestow heavy although very just chastisement where it was meet and right to do it long may he wield it a terror one should hope to all who offend through malicious wickedness to whom the psalmist speaking by the holy spirit beseeches god the father not to be merciful  to attempt doing justice to the goodness of friends some now no longer inhabitants of earth to mr berkeleys or to his parents gratitude would require a ream of paper now like most other things become a very dear commodity through the course of this work written by hasty snatches sometimes laid by for many months untouched so as to have occasioned much disagreeable tautology the copy was never transcribed so that it was sent rough to the press and much gratitude is due to the printer for his patience in decyphering all the interlineations in it without the aid of the worthy sir francis wills  the same person and the same action brought twice on the tapis when once would have done  but much fault has been found with the author of anecdotes of the two last and present centuries for not relating every thing at the same time of many of the personages perhaps they might not come to the authors knowledge until the first part was printed off as many things have occurred to the now treacherous memory of the editor after it was too late to insert them in their proper place she has therefore taken leave to insert them in a less proper one for which she thinks she ought rather to beg her own pardon for being such a fool as to insert the mat all than the readers for inserting perhaps at page   what if method had been attended to ought to have been placed at page    the amiable generous kindness of mr monck berkeleys relations at eton the reverend john hayes now eldest son of james hayes esquire of holyport and the laborious endeavors of his brother charles both several years older than mr berkeley of course being excellent scholars much higher in the school to make his little kinsman as studious as himself have been noticed above as also the partiality of his beloved respected tutor the learned dr norbury and the kindness of dr langford whilst in the lower school who yet once offended him most highly  dr berkeley finding fault one holyday that he was not advanced in greek as he ought to have been he indignantly replied ah i wonder i am not worse but i am sure i shall be well improved by the next holydays  dr berkeley  how so child  mr b  why i will tell you the truth at  such a time so many of us were to give in an exercise and when dr l had read them all over he said berkeley yours is a very much better exercise than mr s naming a noblemans son who with that elegant wisdom which has ever marked eton school and rendered the youths even the little boys the best bred polite beings one can see whilst some other great schools as a very learned accomplished man always used to say are a set of savages a nest of hornets are always styled mr  the sons of private gentlemen without that very proper distinction mr s exercise is not near so good as yours but he shall gain the place because his is as good an one as he is capable of writing and yours is not your best by any means good as it is i know and you know you could have made it a great deal better therefore he shall have the place on this declaration i was so exceedingly angry that i resolved not to learn a word of greek for six months the time is just now expired and so i shall set to it again  dr berkeley exclaimed good god child how could you be such a fool  i cannot help it sir i was angry and i made a vow and i resolved to keep it come what would mr berkeley was as has been shown before steady as a rock  later in life he made a more important vow one night at brookss he and his learned beloved eton st andrews friend the learned t hobhouse esquire were drawn in to play deeper than mr berkeley at least ought to have done the amiable worthy mr hobhouse has a very good maternal estate mr berkeley as is usual won a frightfully large sum soon lost it again and all the money in his purse and much more than he had at his chambers to pay it very providentially mrs frinsham happened to be in town early the next morning he posted off to duke street mrs frinsham somewhat surprised at hearing from her servant that mr berkeley was come before nine oclock went out to him the case was related and that generous friend instantly enabled him to discharge his first his last gaming debt telling him that she never felt such pleasure arising from having money at command she has in her youth often relieved so very largely as to deny herself for months the elegant necessaries of young ladies to accommodate a particular friend or an old acquaintance mr berkeley going down soon after to his fathers on the evening of his arrival asked his mother if she had heard what a fool her son had been to which she replying that she did not recollect having ever heard him called a fool by any one but his father and mother now and then he related the abovementioned circumstance adding my dear mother you may set your heart at rest from any fear of your sons ever becoming a gamester for as soon as i got home to the temple i kneeled down and besought god to cast out my prayer if ever i again played for any sum more than i could well afford to lose playing now and then with ones neighbors in the country on a winter evening it has i believe been mentioned above that mr berkeley whenever he did play which was very seldom and a very indifferent whistplayer he was almost constantly won  all his winnings went to relieve the poor  but to return dr berkeley told his son that dr l acted highly right and that he should have esteemed it rather a compliment than a punishment to which he replied no no sir not if you had ever been at school and knew what it was to lose a place he said aloud that mine was by much the best exercise and he ought therefore in justice to have given me the place mr berkeley was then a child he thought differently of the matter a few years afterward  mr berkeley certainly did not inherit his wonderful daring resoluteness either from his amiable father or from his mother but probably as well as his fine figure from his mothers father whom the editor has frequently heard relate the following fact concerning himself mr frinsham lost his beautiful mother at twentyfour just when he was five years old his father lived a widower near fifty years some time before her death the servant went into the room where they were at breakfast saying that master would not eat his mess for breakfast but wanted coffee like his mamma  up sprang his father saying  i will give him coffee went and gave him a good whipping  still the mess was refused  a second whipping with no better success  at length a third when his mother called out mr frinsham let him alone if he will not eat it now he will eat it when he is hungry dont whip him any more  i will whip him till tomorrow morning if he does not eat it before the editor has frequently heard her father say that he had resolved to endure seven or eight flagellations but the declaration that they should be continued until the next morning determined him to eat it immediately which he accordingly did always observing how wise it was to break children of stubbornness in their infancy it probably eradicated it in mr frinsham for a sweeter tempered child never lived as the editor has frequently heard a worthy woman declare who went to keep his fathers house on the death of his mother  she lived to near ninety and always made an annual visit at mr and after his death at mrs frinshams  that he was the most amiable of children and of youths when mr frinsham sent his sons to oxford this careful servant went to take care of another and a third set of poor motherless children by which means and the little bounties of her adopted children she obtained sufficient to maintain her more than decently genteely she was ever a parlour guest in all the gentlemens families whom she had brought up she had by her father in very early youth been married to a gentleman who deserted her and went to live abroad she was therefore a safe housekeeper for young widowers her first service was mr frinshams fathers the editor has frequently since she grew up heard her say that her mother going to visit her soon after she went thither addressed her thus my dear child this is a very heavy charge that you have taken upon yourself if you do not take the utmost care the same care of these beautiful little children mr frinshams younger brother was a remarkably handsome man never expect my blessing but my curse shall surely light upon you poor mrs grove used to say i felt horror at the thoughts of my mothers curse  it was mentioned above that a desperate ague obliged mrs berkeley to resign the task of nursing her son to another the person who a few years before had nursed charles hayes esquire now fellow of kings college was by his dear tenderly beloved mother of whose amiable sweetness to the rich and godlike charity and compassion to all the surrounding poor the editor often thinks sometimes talks with extatic delight when she reflects that she is gone to him who inspired and is now rewarding those lovely tempers may her sons when they venture to marry meet with ladies as amiable as worthy as their lovely mother as sensible as their great grandmother not famed for sweet temper the editors great aunt eldest daughter of william cherry esquire as a reward for their kind care of their little kinsman at eton  the editor says  venture marriage was always a lottery never resembling mr pitts   not two blanks to a prize  but where there are not two prizes to two hundred worse than blanks how can ill educated girls make good wives but men must thank their own folly  this lady was as beautiful as she was lovely exceedingly resembling a very fine original picture of anne boleyn in the collection of an hereditary friend of the editors the late james warren esquire great uncle of the brave worthy sir john borlase warren this brave excellent officer some few years ago met with it is hoped a singular instance of ingratitude that more than nineteen out of twenty voters at great marlow bucks know a from b is owing to the noble charity school founded by the ancestors of sir john borlase warren who resided at his feat at little marlow and laid out much money with them and a very few years ago these worse than sea monsters ousted him of his seat in parliament for marlow sir john borlase warren with proper spirit the spirit of his very ancient family sold his great estate in bucks and removed from that county one of its most ancient respectable families had the editor time she would relate a very curious anecdote of the great gratitude of sir john borlase warrens greatgrandsire who married the rich heiress of sir john borlase and which has been repeatedly related to her by his son the above named james warren esquire  mr warren meeting mrs hayes sometimes at the editors mothers house always termed her cousin anne  judge hayes used frequently to say that his son charles and dr berkeleys both owed their bold intrepid spirits to their nurse the most courageous of females having once nearly killed a young man who attempted to take some improper liberties with her when she could hardly be styled a woman mr charles hayes and mr monck berkeley were very generous to her when they grew up mr hayes always admired the wonderful genius of mr berkeley who sometimes passed the short holydays of whitsuntide at holyport with his kind kinsmen the judge one day exclaimed well i never saw such a creature in my life as berkeley i am persuaded that if i were to say i am in distress how to get five hundred pounds conveyed to the lord mayor of york berkeley would instantly start up and say dear sir give me leave to go and carry it for you not feeling any impropriety at the idea of a boy of just then thirteen being so employed and what is more i am sure if he undertook it he would execute it as well at thirteen as any man of three and twenty he is a most wonderful being indeed his bright genius shone forth in a splendid manner to the last breath he drew  mr berkeley ever retained a grateful sense of kind invitations from friends at windsor  the late lady colerance his mothers near relation the amiable excellent mrs chessyre the lady of his mothers old very intimate friend the late agreeable dr bostock canon of windsor and his relation good mrs hayes and the very worthy mr trevanian  any attempt to enumerate and descant on as they merit the innumerable amiable respectful attentions paid to mr berkeley even by strangers to every thing but his name and connections in the land of kind hospitality would fill almost as many pages as the learned accomplished mr malone has filled in defending his favorite the immortal shakspeare had mr monck berkeley been living it had doubtless roused the ire of that young poet but mr malone needs no coadjutor in any business that worthy gentleman takes in hand  the antiquarian society of edinburgh did mr berkeley the honor to elect him a member when he was only nineteen years old an honor perhaps never before confirmed on one so very young on his sending them a most excellent account of a very curious quarry in the heart of the highlands mr berkeley had the honor to have the freedom of aberdeen and some other cities and of many towns presented to him he constantly delivered them to his mother requesting her to take great care of them  how would mr berkeleys spirit have been roused had he lived to hear the the thoroughly brave are never cruel there are few who have not heard the bravery of lord balcarras at saratoga under general burgoyne his lordships gun did his coat still does remain no doubt at balcarras a proof of it  the editor thinks she mentioned it in the st jamess chronicle she has not now time to turn to the paper she has been told when indignantly reprobating the charge that it was occasioned by envy  the holy scripture asks who can stand before envy not even the amiable worthy lord balcarras  how much less then the little insignificant editor who has alas suffered sorely from that odious passion that to her unnatural disease of the mind having thank god never felt it she conceived herself too unimportant in the scale of beings to have exited it gentle pleasing mild lord balcarras accused of hunting men to death with bloodhounds his able pen would instantly have been employed in vindicating his noble respected beloved friend the feeble one of the editor ventures to assert that a few years must have wrought a wonderful change in that very amiable gentle nobleman if it is not as probable that he would horsewhip his lovelyhearted countess as did the late horrid colonel d his lady aided by his still more horrid footman or of guillotining his beautiful sister the countess of hardwicke those who have had the pleasure of living four years in his lordships neighborhood once when mr monck berkeley was gone to spend some happy days at balcarras it occurred to lord balcarras that mr berkeley had never slept in old nolls bed still standing in that beautiful mansion always styled by the editor the scotch cliefden  there is great similarity in the situation etc and he declared he should sleep in it  to which mr berkeley replied not unless i have your lordships sword by my bedside for the old villain knowing how much i detested him will certainly visit me before midnight  it was not very likely mr berkeley should have been retired before that hour from such agreeable company at another time when mr berkeley was staying at balcarras a very agreeable sensible relation of lord balcarras being more than a little fou the elegant scotch word for our ugly word drunk there was much difficulty in conveying him to his chamber when arrived there all retired but lord balcarras and mr monck berkeley  whilst they were cajoling him to let them undress him he prayed very earnestly to god they smiled at his repeatedly asking them what must become of his beautiful soul at length lord balcarras said my dear berkeley how devout  is now that he is ou this gentleman not famed for devotion had received a very pious education and was always devout when drk if not too far gone could as readily believe that the sun shone at midnight to light these hunters  to the introduction of his friend mr lennard mr berkeley was indebted for the happiness of enjoying an intimate friendship with the excellent sir j clarke of pennycuicke and his charming lady daughter of mr dacre of the north to whom mr lennard was related he admired their amiable virtues and revered their goodness and invitation whenever he was in edinburgh and had no more agreeable engagement to visit that excellent pair it was impossible should ever be obliterated from the memory of mr berkeiey or his greateful parents the goodness of their very agreeable worthy countryman commissioner wharton and the excellent lady sophia to dr mrs and mr monck berkeley on their first arrival in edinburgh to whom they were introduced by the worthy hereditary friends of mrs berkeley mrs edlins daughters of the excellent baron edlin whose pious lady and daughters remarkably bountiful to the poor are still the subject of admiration and praise in edinburgh are still dwelt on with unfeigned gratitude and delight happy the poor who reside near the few still surviving ladies of that worthy family  when at st andrews in scotland mr monck berkeley used to say well it is a mercy that i am not quite so much in love with lady elizabeth lindsey as my mother is if i was i must run away with her not as we say to scotland but to england and that would be a fine story the lovely polite unaffected sweet real gentleness of that lovely lady are doubtless the source of much domestic felicity to her lord her ladyship is the editor verily believes or nothing should cause her to write it one of the very few genuine gentle spirits scattered here and there to be admired and alas for poor unlucky simple men to be counterfeited dr berkeley used always to say there was nothing he disliked so much as  a mighty pretty sort of young woman mrs berkeley used to reply that she hoped nobody would ever style her such when he was present he used to say that he detested insipidity such as she was he had her  for better for worse thirtyfour years one of those horrid horse leeches ever draining her too too generous husband having since his death told her at her lawyers chambers that dr berkeley married her for her money wonderful assertion as mrs berkeleys fortune was only a few odd thousands and when he was urged to take a lady much in love with him who had more than a hundred thousand pounds the editor feels herself obliged after this wonderful assertion from a lowlived divine who educated by john wesley perhaps never saw any university until at dr berkeleys expense to say that dr berkeley has repeatedly declared to his son in her presence have not i told you over and over that had i been duke of norfolk or robinson crusoe your mother is the woman in the whole world that i would have chosen for a wife adding what it is impossible for the editor to write                    and she could and would make matters comfortable pleasant on that island adding i have always told you i believe your mother has the best temper to live with for happiness of any person in the world not many weeks before his lamented death he said to several persons friends and servants she is the best wife in the world god knows that she feels ever did feel how far she fell short in most relations of life of the resolutions she made very early in life to labor if ever she did marry to make the best wife in the world and if god blessed her with children the best mother alas she repeats it she feels that she fell short and yet such is the frailty of our fallen nature that were the time to be gone over again she fears she could not much mend her hand as mistress of a family she from early youth resolved to treat her servants just as she would wish them to treat her were they instantly to exchange stations perhaps this has sometimes gone rather too far a beloved friend of here is nicknamed by the editor in her youth the centurioness  i say to my servant do this and he does it frequently told the editor she was a most incomparable governess of her children and of dogs and cats but that her servants did or did not obey her orders just as it suited their own convenience adding i think they are mighty good kind of people to do any thing you ask them so quietly pray now will you do so  the editor as above shown with her children did not deal in showing authority with servants as well as children when she set about any thing in good earnest calmly saying  i will have this or that done she has ever with both found that her word was a law servants are much to be pitied they have often jobs to finish as well as their superiors it is grievous to a generous mind to drag them away when half an hour later may do just as well the editor perhaps is weak illjudging in that as in many other things she had been married more than seven years when her amiable partner a little warm as the honorable mrs  says  all men are  they certainly are lords of the creation and how much is warmth of temper to be preferred to sullenness came up into her dressing room saying  do go down stairs and try once in your life if it is possible for you to find fault with a servant or not richard has done  or has not done  the editor does not recollect which this worthy man was sometimes a little slow in his motions his master was very quick in his his surname was hyde he was related and as many gentlemen learned in the law supposed heir to a vast unclaimed property in the funds left by a general hyde who died in the reign of george the first if it were duly considered by masters and mistresses of families that they and their domestics must one day ere long stand together at the same righteous bar they would surely prepare to answer when asked if they had taken care to instruct them in their duty to their master in heaven or spent the time that might have been so employed in reproaching them for neglecting their duty to their master on earth these governors of families will be asked did you not allow them time to read some portion in the book of god every day if so why did you not at stated hours god says shall i hide this thing that i do from abraham  seeing that i know he will command not gently civilly ask them  but command his children and his household etc etc  compel them to assemble together and hear it read in your own presence then whether they will hear or whether they will forbear thou master or mistress have delivered thine own soul as speaks holy scripture  where there is no learning little logic little time the faculties of the mind and body both debilitated by illhealth brought on by severe afflictions as in the editors case the word severe ought to be expunged if another could be substituted it must be heavy for nothing can ought at least to be termed severe that is inflicted in love by our heavenly father on alas a lamentably ungrateful child whose heart is however perpetually quoting from the inspired prophet wherefore should a man complain a living man for the punishment of his sins by which the editor for very many years past has conceived the holy spirit meant to imply by a living man any one on this side the grave any one who is out of hell for if through grace mercy is at the latest period sought it will infallibly be found witness the thief on the cross and a modern thief  alas no poor wretch he was only a murderer for he had not the heart to rob when he beheld the blood he had shed converted brought to christ not alas by one of those who rush into the priestly office the editor heard some time ago when the wretched mrs reed now mrs edgar was in gloucester gaol that the chaplain is a worthy divine  the editor always regrets when using an irish common prayer book given her by her beloved partner that the very fine office for prisoners is not bound up with our even commonest cheapest books of common prayer the very fine prayer for those under sentence of death might being read by the children of the poor at least keep them from the gallows a few years ago a fine youth at one of the great schools was so charmed with it that he requested the irish youth where it was to exchange with him for a very superb english common prayer book his father was a pious although very eminent barrister the large irish prayer book of bishop berkeley was after his death presented by his son to the gaol of oxford  that they may remain idle and ignorant or that  they may eat a morsel of bread see the first book of samuel  this was effected by that brave excellent officer general rooke who kindly amiably offered the very old friend of the editor the sensible pious t hughes esquire when a few years ago high sheriff for glocestershire to rise at four in the morning in march to accompany him on his dreary journey of sixteen miles to attend the execution he felt the unpleasant dreary journey mr hughes must have and amiably offered to accompany him his sweet nature was shocked on their arrival at gloucester at seeing the poor wretch quite hardened that he begged mr hughess permission to talk to the poor creature a little to which the pious amiable mr hughes who related the happy tale to dr berkeley and repeatedly to the editor repiled my permission dear sir aye and my best prayers for your success the execution was delayed and the blessed general to whom the editor regrets that she has not the honor the happiness to be known succeeded so effectually succeeded that a poor creature who at seven in the morning said he had never heard of the savior of sinners expired at noon believing in him with all his heart asking and will he save such a wretch as i have been  rejoicing with joy unspeakable and full of glory  to the great comfort of the jury as the high sheriff told dr berkeley for he had constantly denied the murder and the man being not robbed they were uneasy at having found him guilty the preceding and succeeding context might be here with propriety inserted they may be sought and the whole chapter red with advantage by those who have never murdered a man the editor however feels herself obliged to vindicate herself from the bare suspicion of antinomianism by quoting no xliv of the deep things of god though a child of god glories in this that  where sin has abounded grace does much more abound yet no child of god can sin that grace may abound  on this one of the selected numbers being read to mr monck berkeley by his mother he exclaimed with an earnestness hardly to be described god forbid oh god forbid it was mentioned before that the editor constantly on quitting her sons chamber wrote under every number his comments ejaculations etc upon it she most carefully selected what she felt suited the then state of the soul  mr berkeley did not want instruction in his duty to god or his neighbor he did not want to be awakened to be shown how direfully he had broken the holy law of god nor to be made sensible of the penalty to be inflicted for such breach but to be convinced that christ had received him which his deep humility prevented him from believing although the hope of it was his sole support  one night when he supposed himself expiring at dover mr berkeley desired his friend mrs frinsham might be called out of bed to him he said i beseech you to pray for me you see me going perhaps from misery here to everlasting misery adding i yet feel some hope that god hears my mothers prayers and that christ will not quite cast me off  it ought to have been mentioned in its proper place that mr berkeley wrote to his mother from oxford desiring her to summon all her fortitude to her aid and prepare her mind not to be shocked at seeing the shadow of what was once her son the original idea was that of mr berkeleys going to gloucester to be constantly under the eye of dr chestern he therefore wrote requesting his friends to meet him on the road accordingly the minute the post arrived they accompanied by their incomparable friend mrs d monck set out and reached the inn at burford about five in the afternoon and about seven mr berkeley arrived attended by his own servant and a youth of about eighteen the son of an old irish friend of dr berkeleys then staying with dr berkeley who had been dispatched to meet mr berkeley who had done amiably as he ever did to warn his mother not to be shocked etc it required all her fortitude to see her idol with difficulty get out of the chaise and enter the room supported rather difficultly supported by his servant a man about his own stature  mrs berkeley had gone to town to visit her son and dear excellent mr grimston whose goodness caused his remaining in town all the summer with mr berkeley until august when they set off for hastings five months of almost unabated torture had wonderfully weakened mr berkeleys  earthly tabernacle dr berkeleys great weakness apologized for his appearing dispirited and mrs berkeley forced herself to appear not to feel supreme anguish of mind at the sight of her idol thus debilitated  dr berkeley rising about ten oclock said to his son my dear child i am so weak and so wearied that i must wish you a good night i am quite unable to sit up any longer mr berkeley begging his fathers benediction wished him a good night as he did his excellent friend mrs monck on his mothers going to shake hands with him and retire he said best of mothers you have not been ill like my poor father you can sit up and i greatly want a little conversation with you the above mentioned youth was of course making his bow when mr berkeley said you need not retire sir i rather wish you to stay when mr berkeley thus commenced i am probably now not far from the end of my course and i wish to say some things to my dear mother to bless her for having forced me to be regular and constant in my attendance at public worship and at family prayer long before i felt or saw the necessity of it myself i am convinced well convinced that it is the only way to train up a child and as my mother has quoted a thousand times to us taking in his little brother so convinced am i of it that of which there is very little probability now should i live ever to have a family of children or servants i will force them to attend i will drive them before me to the house of god and to family prayers the young man stared to hear the energy with which mr berkeley uttered this sentence he turned round and looking steadfastly at him said yes sir so convinced am i of the wisdom of it that if i could get them no other way i would kick them before me driving out his foot with amazing strength it is the only way to make them wise unto salvation in their youth  it is has been before observed that mr berkeley said i have some little consolation in thinking that if all i ever printed and all i ever wrote lay on the table and a standish by me and i knew that i had but half an hour to live i would not erase one word of it for from a boy i always resolved never to write a line which dying i would wish to blot  in all i have ever published or written i have labored to render vice odious and ridiculous and to hold up virtue to respect and admiration mr monck berkeley from a boy had it strongly inculcated on his mind never through life to ridicule those who minister in things sacred even in a false religion his mother constantly saying to him if ever you travel in turkey or india or amongst the hottentots always pay respect to the priests of the country however erroneous or absurd their religion may be for without some sort of reverence for the supreme being man degenerates so lamentably as to become worse than the beasts that perish how strictly mr berkeley attended to this admonition may be plainly seen in the generous rustic or spanish memories and above all in his last excellent legendary tale of heloise in the siege of rhodes with the last edition of which is joined the vicars tale originally published in the oxford olla podrida the village there described is the beautiful village of witeringham in northumberland of which the agreeable worthy mr twentyman was many years curate mr monck berkeley one day speaking with extacy of the wit contained in fieldings writings his mother said hold your tongue if you talk of the wit i will talk of the wickedness of them  oh my mother they abound with wit and humor  well my dear sir will you be pleased to tell me what sum would bribe you to have written joseph andrews and tom jones in each of which the clerical character is held up to supreme contempt in the person of parson adams and thwackham  religion in youth wounded through the odious blyfieldt  he gamekeepers wife a parsons daughter proclaimed an harlot by her own harlot daughter  no opportunity omitted of disgracing the clergy and their poor starving families a mourn silence ensued but his mother continuing her harangue he replied why i should not have chosen to have written just those parts  no my dear sir i know that the riches of both the indies would not have bribed you to do it thank god therefore  but alas what is that how have i fallen god help me and how often have i envived my dog as he lay sleeping by my bedside and said ah thou dear happy brute god will not call thee into judgment as he will thy wretched master  mrs berkeley quoted many gracious promises from holy scripture and the promise of promises him that comes unto me i will in no wise cast out but all this was in some degree in vain it was reserved for her excellent friend sir richard hill by his incomparable book the editor conceived that she had before mentioned mr berkeleys delight in a little book of sir richard hills entitled a present for your neighbor without which he had never traveled for several years before his death always taking it in his trunk but not finding it on carefully reading over the printed sheets she mentions it here returning early one day from hunting and it happening to rain he entered the house through the servants hall where this little book lay open in the window the title caught his quick eye the servants all dispersed to their different occupations he took it up and went to his room some time after he came into the editors dressing room holding a little book in his hand saying pray my dear madam how came you not to give your son one of these books as well as your housemaid the editor answered in the same way why my dear sir because i did not think that my son wanted it  you were much mistaken he wants it very much and i desire you will be pleased to give him one directly nodding to that end of the large bookcase where he knew the books for the poor were kept mrs berkeley replied indeed i cannot for i gave away the last three days ago  very well my dear mother i am sure you will get a freight down soon for i am certain you will not be long without such books as this so i shall keep this in pawn till you redeem it i know you are a very honest lady and will not cheat your housemaid mr berkeley used to divert his father by saying i believe my mother is the honestest woman living where my aunt and i are not concerned being in haste to pay every one else if she borrows of us it seems to sit quite easy on her conscience she certainly thinks it no fin to cheat us of a guinea now and then above named to pour the balm of perfect peace  that peace of god which passes all understanding  into the dear humble contrite troubled spirit of her unspeakably dear son  that peace for which the generality pray at least once a week but which so very few labor to obtain when obtained they feel that the yoke of christ is easy and his burden light  it was near two oclock in the morning before mr berkeley apologizing to his mother told her that he would detain her no longer fearing that the want of a good nights rest might injure her health mr berkeley always knew that the loss of sleep is almost death to his mother whose mother and sister could and the dear survivor can pass weeks in health with scarce any sleep at all mrs berkeley in that as in other things resembles her father  when young her mother used to tell the editor that she thought she could not be her child because she used to wish to leave a ballroom at four oclock  her mother telling her often that she used to stay till eight then drive home several miles exchange her balldress for her morning one and not go to rest till twelve next night or rather morning for her mother mrs cherry never retired to her chamber till twelve and constantly rose winter and summer at six until within two years of her death at sixtyeight when she rose not until seven oclock it was little likely that mrs berkeley should enjoy much sleep after so interesting a conversation of four hours  mrs berkeley is said by all those who have known her most intimately from her childhood to be of the most hopeful temper they ever knew she preserves with tenderest care a hair ring given by her dear son an elegant figure of hope leaning on her anchor one hand pointing up to heaven with this motto in hair  heavens best gift to man it is very certain that until she saw her son the day after his happy spirit had quitted his fine form she did flatter herself that the mercy of god would spare him to her under the idea of having labored from her youth to obey oblige delight her own excellent mother in order to make her feel less poignantly the loss of an almost adoring husband that god would vouchsafe to reward her in kind and spare her son but alas her son was her idol and idols must be given up the editor was supposed to be idolized by her mother of whom it used to be said mrs frinsham loves her so much that she never lets her walk across the room without looking at her little insignificant figure with pleasure in her eyes that delight must have arisen from thinking she bore some resemblance to her excellent father the editor has the pleasure to reflect that there was nothing she would not have sacrificed to please the best of mothers and that she always prayed to god that he would be pleased to spare her life if it were only for one week beyond her mothers that she might be spared the affliction of seeing her go before her the editor felt that she was the cause of much sad anxiety to her mother not having had the small pox as her excellent sister had when a child at mrs sheeless school and its being lamentably fatal in mrs frinshams family her eldest sister being one saturday esteemed the most beautiful creature in london the beaux of that day bestowed the following subriques on the three coheiresses of mr cherry all beauties the eldest above mentioned the duke cherry fit for a duke the second the fine black cherry from her dark hair her complexion lovely the third mrs frinsham the finest figure of the three was termed the heart cherry she proved her right to that pleasing subrique by rejecting for the sake of the editors father with a small fortune but uncommon worth numbers of brilliant splendid matches her ideas on that head descended to her daughter and her grandson it is a little remarkable that there was a very strong resemblance in the faces of dr berkeley and mrs frinsham so as to strike dr berkeley himself the first time he saw her pictures neither of her daughters resembled her in the smallest degree either in her exquisitely fine tall figure which used to occasion her being followed in the park mall etc where young ladies exhibited in those days and which she retained to the last as well as her fine red and white and the exquisite sweetness of countenance the distinguishing temper of her soul as well as of the editors angelic delightful friend the late mrs catharine talbot of lambeth palace these two lovely ladies pictures hung near each other in dr berkeleys eatingroom it is probable such kindred spirits are united in the realms of bliss  and the next the most deplorable object mortified all over and much blacker than an ethiop in the latter part the editor has no doubt but she had resembled her lovely aunt had she not been inoculated by mr sutton himself who attended her at her own house at acton with great assiduity dr berkeley being then rector of that parish they were sensible of the blessing of such a preacher multitudes came every sunday to acton church to hear one who according to st paul did not as he observed to the editor in his last illness preach himself but christ jesus the lord adding he knows i preached him in sincerity always dreading to be a popular preacher a pleaser of the people  the following observations are intended solely to benefit some few unfortunate families where the small pox is worse than the plague mrs berkeley having not long weaned her second son and duly prepared by mr sutton her friends all conceived that inoculation would be to her what by the blessing of god it is to thousands to millions not to herself she conceived if she escaped with life that would be all but the sufferings her not having had that frightful disease had occasioned to her mother did constantly occasion to an almost adoring husband and the tenderest of sisters determined her one way or other to deliver them from their incessant anxiety accordingly she together with mr monck berkeley then between four and five years old were both inoculated on the same day with the same matter the latter had only three pustules and did not lose half an hours play through indisposition his mother had but few in her face those on her nose pitted to the bone a vast number on her head a frightful quantity in her throat and several on her arms fingers and feet all showed their malignity by being confluent and not turning until three and twenty days  a plain proof but for mr suttons method of treating the small pox she had shared the fate of her beautiful aunt miss cherry mr sutton asserted to dr berkeley and others mrs berkeleys friends that he had never before had such a patient he was much alarmed and exceedingly attentive saying that had mrs berkeley caught the small pox in the natural way she would have mortified in a few days that had mr monck berkeley caught it in the natural way it had probably never have been known that he had had it mrs berkeleys mother mrs frinsham had only ten pustules when a child about eight years old a singular symptom attended mrs berkeleys small pox that of her eyes being for more than three days set in their sockets so fixed that she could not move them at all could only see in an absolutely straight direction yet she had not one pustule in her eyes or on her eyelids it was quite internal  mrs berkeley had been at first at sutton house but having always a wonderful partiality for her own home which she conceives would be the case if her home was a neat clean barn begged mr suttons permission to return to her own house with which he very obligingly complied on condition of her going to him when he could not call on her which she punctually did her horses having nothing else to do but drag her then wretched frame to take the air as directed half a dozen times in the day she being unable to walk mrs berkeley in her visits to sutton house used to enquire of the sensible wellbred reverend mr houlton chaplain to mr sutton when her eyes would be better his constant answer was oh dear madam you will be in heaven to morrow i assure you the next day mrs berkeley on entering the drawing room enquired of her fellow patients where mr houlton was that she might tell him she did not like his mr houltons heaven at all the very witty canon bowls of salisbury being one of the patients opened the door and called out houlton come down her is mrs berkeley the lady of a divine that declares she does not even wish to go to heaven  come down man and talk to the poor lady  a lady whose name is not at present remembered by the editor came down one morning looking much distressed saying i am very ill indeed she sent for the sensible clever consoling housekeeper and exhibited her chest covered over with a most tremendous erysipelas the housekeeper said do not fear madam if it please god you will get safe through the lady turning to mrs berkeley said  if i do i shall be the first of my family that ever did it did please providence to bring her safely through and spare her to a most anxious husband who visited her with trembling tenderness perpetually  mrs berkeley suffered much from the kind persecutions of dr berkeley and her sister to suffer sir william duncan and dr addington dr addington used frequently to tell the editor that the first fee he ever received was at the house of mr frinsham a gentleman on a visit there was taken suddenly ill dr hayes was his physician but dr addington happenned to dine at white waltham he prescribed and as he said got his handsel in berks he got a better treasure in berks than gold than rubies the best and most sensible of wives one of what the editor always styles house builders see the proverbs of solomon chap xxxi not castle but house builders are real treasures to sons and daughters this md narrowly escaped one of the weakest and obtained one of the wisest of women to be sent for which mrs berkeley resolutely opposed fearing it might injure the cause of inoculation the greatest blessing surely that ever was granted to the terrestrial part of man mrs berkeley resolved to live or die as it should please the allwise disposer of all events by mr sutton alone being at that time a little in the world and a little known she conceived that calling in regular medical aid would easily be turned into mrs george berkeley would certainly have died by suttons method if so and so had not saved her life mr sutton felt himself so obliged by her conduct that he at different times inoculated poor people gratis whom she recommended to him obligingly telling her one line from her at any time sent by a poor person should be sufficient introduction to his care and his kitchen  it is the fashion with persons of a certain description to disbelieve what they cannot comprehend and to laugh at what they do not understand and many persons explode the idea of the small pox generally proving fatal in some families  several years after one night at a large rout at canterbury there was universal lamentation over a family who had lost a darling child by inoculation in the common way mrs berkeley naturally said alas poor people why did they not let sutton attend it he is the man where it proves so fatal in families a canterbury physician not remarkable for his worth now no more meaning to turn mrs berkeley to ridicule said and so madam you believe the doctrine of the small pox proving more fatal in some families than in others and proceeded to harangue at a wonderful rate against the absurdity of that doctrine when amongst other ladies and gentlemen approached the elegant mrs p t saying surely dr  mrs berkeley is right at least she thinks exactly as baron dimsdale does for when he inoculated my daughter he expressed his astonishment that a little creature so healthy with so fine a complexion should have it so much more severely than was the case with inoculation in his method with one in five hundred mrs p t told him she could assign no reason for it unless it could be admitted as one that her father the worthy dr d prebendary of canterbury died of it a desperate sort to which she said the baron replied you have fully accounted for it madam in the few patients i have had who have suffered much with it i have always found that some of their families on one side have for generations died of it the editor knows one family where for above two centuries not one attacked by that tremendous disease ever did recover until the introduction of inoculation and in such unhappy families their children should be carefully kept out of the reach of infection until old enough to take remedies to prevent being choked as it usually attacks the throat and infants cannot take remedies to ward off that frightful attack as was the case with the editor her throat being quite lined with pustules  we have an high authority for knowing he that waters shall himself also be watered again mr berkeley experienced it at least in one very pleasing instance his introduction to his noble highlyhonoured respected friends their graces the duke and duchess of marlborough had mr berkeley been living how sincerely how tenderly would he have sympathized with that illustrious pair on their late loss the editor rejoices that their graces have still two sons although she had none a very amiable young nobleman and a very fine youth who by having his late learned accomplished brother held up as a pattern may be stimulated to resemble him before mr monck berkeley considered his health as irrecoverable he one day said to the editor if god spares my life until next summer i mean to step abroad and visit my friend lord henry spencer the editor does not recollect where his lordship then was mrs berkeleys constant advice to her son was whilst persons of high rank or station treat you as a gentleman a man of family although untitled always remember that they are your superiors but the instant they forget have nothing more to do with them mr monck berkeley never would visit or meet notwithstanding all her ladyships submissions a poor silly peeress his near relation who having a very short memory had quite forgot her kinsman until she learned in town that it was ton to be acquainted with mr monck berkeley so much for the present of her ladyships wisdom when the marquis of blandford went to eton the then dean of canterbury who went down with him desired mr monck berkeley about two or three years older to take his lordship under his protection ie as the editor conceives to see that they are not too much buffeted by their own or an higher form a certain quantum is excellent for  the editor had almost said kings however certainly for lords and commons dr berkeley having known this and his sons telling him that the marquis of blandford was at christ church on mr monck berkeleys first return from oxford to the oaks said i suppose lord blandford had quite forgot you it is so long since you left eton near seven years mr berkeley replied indeed my dear sir you are mistaken being engaged to dine one day at the noblemens table at christ church and seeing lord blandford come into the hall i determined to wait thinking he might really might have forgotten me but the instant his eye caught me he sprang forward and took me by the hand saying my dear berkeley how do you do i am happy to see you this young nobleman has as mr berkeley always said he had a very amiable heart every one at the time near thirty years ago heard the rencontre of the then very sensible polite agreeable master in chancery master ps with lord b after his return from his travels and his congratulating his lordship on being a man as he was a boy of sense at eton  for which he was solely indebted to his very old friend the reverend dr king now chancellor of lincoln mr berkeley happened to be at his fathers when dr king was appointed to dr tanners vacant stall in the church of canterbury immediately on hearing it he with his wonted sweetness when asking a favor of either of his parents said to his father my dear sir i should take it as a very great favor if you would have the goodness to invite dr king to be your guest when he comes down hither to be installed as i believe although a most excellent scholar he is entirely ignorant of all matters of this kind and you are au fait in them he was exceedingly kind and good to me when i was at eton and when we used to go over together to lord inchiquins that elegant nobleman one of the friends of dr berkeleys very early youth at cloyne most amiably kind to mr berkeley when at eton and to sir adam gordons a very old friend equally kind and it would delight me to have it in my power to show my gratitude to him  dr berkeley desired his son to write immediately to dr king and say that although he mr berkeley must probably be absent dr berkeley requested the favor of his company accordingly at the proper time dr king arrived at dr berkeleys house in the oaks accompanied by his sensible brother john king the present worthy highbailiff of westminster  esquire dr king expressed his sense of the little attentions it was in mrs berkeleys power to show him more highly than they merited she requested him if it was in his power to do her son the honor to introduce him at blenheim mrs berkeley having ever from a young woman before she married declared if ever she had a son she would try to introduce him to that noble family in preference to any other in england his graces father the late duke was very uncommonly amiable and had much worth  the editor cannot avoid dropping a tear over the too early grave of a most amiable young gentleman who accompanied dr king in his second visit to dr berkeleys his brotherinlaw  manby esquire secretary to the duke of leeds any attempt to do justice to the amiable mild gentle elegant merits of this young gentleman would require an inspired pen instead of one dulled blunted by age and affliction probably all who knew him would be ready with the editor to take up the language of shakspeare and say i never shall look upon his like again   good dr king more learned than attentive had brought mr manby down with him to the summer audit and knowing that dr berkeleys house was not very large had deposited him at one of the wretched inns at canterbury after being at the oaks two days one morning at breakfast the good little doctor said he must go before he went into the audit room and see after his young man mrs berkeley knowing that the doctor had no son enquired what young man  dr king   why why he is mrs kings brother i brought him down to see canterbury  mrs berkeley  where is he  dr k  why at one of your inns down in the city  mrs b  who is with him  dr k  why nobody that is the thing  mrs b  how old is he a man grown up or a youth surely it is not at eton at the same time with mr monck berkeley now deputy high bailiff of westminster  a very polite young gentleman as polite as an irishman  for he is amiably attentive to aged matrons and dowagers to prevent their breaking their bones when in dangerous situations  prob the editor some years ago at dover   dear dick after whom i heard my son enquire of you so kindly and charge you so strictly to give his affectionate regards  dr k  no no he is older than dick it is his eldest brother  mrs b  well who shows him the lions of canterbury  dr k  why poor fellow nobody that is the thing  mrs b   the thing indeed  it will by this time be easily perceived by those who have the pleasure of knowing intimately the learned doctor that mrs berkeley had taken upon herself the government of this little great man mrs berkeley always asserting that although we are forbidden by the apostle to govern our own husbands that prohibition does not extend to our neighbor and mrs berkeley is by her friends esteemed a pretty good hand in that often very necessary the editor sometimes reflects with pleasure that through her instrumentality more than one couple of her married friends have acknowledged that by her advice always delivered in the humblest the most secret manner they live in good harmony before unknown when any of the editors friends marry she always writes them a letter of advice mixed with congratulations if she has leisure it is a full sheet a gentleman some time ago wrote her word that he carefully preserved her letter and frequently read it over and meant to do so as long as he lived he has been very happily married business but to quit this folaterie which the editor brought into the world with her and which maugre all her afflictions her present exceedingly indifferent health seldom well a whole hour together in a week she seems to feel will never quit her like the excellent sir thomas mores wit and good old lady banisters humor who dying at an hundred and nobody knows how many more years old told all her great grandchildren not to stand crying over her for that they could not think that she was dying an untimely death in the prime of life  the dear lively bishop of norwich one day at dinner at dr berkeleys said my dear madam how came you to let my brother king go to church this morning without a band  oh my dear mr dean if you did but know the trouble it costs me every day to prevent his keeping your eminences a title bestowed by mrs berkeley many years before on the dean and prebendaries waiting dinner for him you would pity me all my eloquence cannot inspire him with due veneration for the collected body  the conclave  mrs berkeley feeling the unpleasantness of mr manbys situation besought dr king to bring him to dr berkeleys mrs berkeley her son being in london sent immediately to a very amiable worthy young man who felt great gratitude for some very essential services rendered him by mrs berkeley repaying his attentions when a boy to her little boys much younger at the kings school the worthy mr william jackson son of the collector of excise and afterward an alderman of canterbury this grateful wellinformed young man died after a very few days illness universally lamented as he was universally beloved and respected his wonderfully lowlived parents gave rings of his hair set with diamonds to many of the ladies of canterbury who would not have known that he existed as himself used to say but for mrs berkeleys gratitude which when he at nineteen quitted the kings school led her to invite him to play at cards at the round table with the younger ladies and gentlemen at her routs mrs berkeley introduced him to her learned friend the reverend john duncombe and his lady and requested them when she left canterbury in      to take to him his mind received much cultivation from that learned worthy wellinformed pair to mrs berkeley the old woman sent into berkshire mrs berkeley being there at the time of his death a piece of catgut worked with her sons hair saying that mrs berkeley did not want diamonds poor young man he often when living felt her low absurdities when she insisted on exhibiting to her sons company he repeatedly said to numbers of people but for mrs berkeleys goodness and i had been in such a set naming several aldermens sons etc some now violent democrats who were kept in their own line of company whilst jackson was in the first company in the church and county his father at his death left legacies to all his sons friends excepting to mrs duncombe and to mrs berkeley to neither of whom an hundred guineas for a ring would have been unacceptable but the new legacy bill will never affect mrs berkeley for as mrs frinsham says when any of her rich relations die childless sister to be sure they forget that you and i exist or that we know how to spend a little money for none of them ever name us even for a ten guinea ring  but quitting this subject for a much pleasanter jackson immediately presented himself in mrs berkeleys dressingroom when she introduced him to mr manby requesting him to become his guide to conduct him to every thing worthy notice in the church or city to repair to the oaks every morning at breakfast and every day at three to take their dinner with mrs berkeley and spend the afternoon the prebendaries dining together at each others houses during the audit the tables generally being full and taking their tea in the auditroom  on the day when they dined at dr berkeleys on mrs berkeleys entering the eatingroom the dinner served the bishop of norwich then dean going up to her presented her with a pamphlet saying madam entirely in obedience to your commands there is the sermon that i preached on trinity sunday if it produces any good it is entirely owing to you for it has been often preached and never was intended for the press but you insisted upon its being published and i have obeyed your orders many of the prebendaries said the public were very much indebted to mrs berkeley the bishop when sitting at dinner said i must request you my dear madam to give me a list of your friends whom you wish should read it that i may send it to my bookseller mrs berkeley felt as it merited this very polite attention from her most excellent old friend and said she would request a few to send to some of her friends in scotland that her english friends could provide themselves then said  i must pull this incomparable discourse all to pieces and get some of my pocket mps so mrs berkeley always styled two amiable baronets who used at all times to convey her simple chitchat to her friends adding i do wish to convey one entire to dear lord leven what method can i take my dear mr dean can you advise me sweet mr manby with pleasure in his eyes replied my dear madam i can render you that little service and shall be most unfeignedly happy to do it you know we can send any thing from the secretary of states office  when the audit was ended and the good little doctor the next time mrs berkeley saw her son after his good friend dr kings visit at the oaks he enquired how she liked his old friend she replied as all will reply who know him intimately at the same time asking mr monck berkeley what is mrs king like  like my dear madam why like a queen you never saw such a woman i promise you in your whole life those who have seen mrs king will be apt to think that mr berkeley had improved in his knowledge of beauty since his dear friend miss m used to style a very plain woman one of berkeleys beauties mr berkeley was then only seventeen and ever such an admirer of a superior understanding that provided he heard wisdom he regarded not the mouth and his brother going to quit canterbury this most amiable of young gentlemen thus addressed mrs berkeley my dear madam what can i do what can i say to you for your thoroughly polite attentions for your wonderful goodness to me i am utterly unable to express in any degree the sense i must ever retain of it if at any time in any way i can render you any service you will delight my spirit by only pointing it out to me mrs berkeley conjured him not to distress her by saying a syllable more to her for having only done just what every other person not a savage had they known his situation would have done  the editor cannot here forbear relating a little anecdote of her sons lovely amiability of which she was only very lately informed he never having mentioned it a lady who was a stranger visiting at mrs berkeleys happened to sit opposite the fine portrait of mr berkeley painted by his amiable accomplished friend mr peters she in a low voice said to the lady who sat next to her i never saw so like a picture in my life mrs berkeley although she cannot see yet hears remarkably quick thanks to gods blessing on the skill of mr maull in piccadilly exerted about twenty years ago said i did not know madam that my son had the honor to be known to you to which the good old lady very politely replied madam i had the honor to be known to mr berkeley one year returning from margate we wished to see the cathedral of canterbury we walked up and could not see any one to tell us where to find the person who showed it we saw a great many gentlemen walking backwards and forwards by the side of the church after some time one of them detaching himself from the rest came up to us and in the politest manner said ladies are you in any distress in which i can assist you the ladies told their wish to see the cathedral and their utter inability to find out how to do it mr berkeley said if you will have the goodness to wait two minutes i will get the verger to attend you he stepped into a shop sent off a lad for the verger and again joined the ladies on the arrival of the verger mr berkeley escorted them into the church pointed out to them some particular beauties of that glorious temple of god charged the verger not to omit showing them some things as he named then saying he had an engagement made an elegant bow wished them a pleasant journey and took his leave the ladies enquired of the verger who that young gentleman was to whose politeness they were so much indebted he replied that it was mr berkeley son to one of the prebends the ladies expressing gratitude the verger said yes madam every body loves mr berkeley exceedingly he is so kind and condescending to every one  dr and mrs berkeley both had been for some time wishing to obtain for their worthy old servant mr wrightson when he should marry and quit service the place of one of his majestys messengers he having repeatedly flown with incredible velocity over this kingdom and to and from ireland on dr berkeleys business and probably had it not pleased the allwise director of all things small as well as great to remove to the society he so strongly resembled on earth the angelic mr manby the poor of canterbury had not been blessed with quite so excellent so judicious and so kind a governor as successor to their former very worthy master mr not it is surely a delight to every feeling heart to see the aged poor made happy the young instructed and brought up industriously the way to be happy here and hereafter  the editor is much addicted wherever she resides or stays any little time at a place to visit the workhouses feeling tender pity for those who have not a penny to buy tobacco snuff or a little two shilling tea and sweetened sand called sugar to season it her feelings suffered much whilst at oxford as she really conceives from what she herself saw the relation of two of her old servants whom she frequently sent thither that most wellregulated bridewells are paradises compared to the oxford workhouse in short nothing out of the infernal regions can be worse or worse conducted mrs berkeleys maid sent thither one day to see after a poor sick woman was obliged to take shelter in a room some poor creature opened to her an audacious harlot flying through the house with a great knife to murder the then poor stupid ignorant mistress they have no poundage from earnings once in the year at the races they have some twopence some sixpence given them as one of the guardians told mrs  to figure away with on the course  mrs berkeley one day on going out gave a poor woman who had called the mistress to her and shown her the uncultivated wretched garden a shilling the poor womans gratitude and extacies were sorely distressing adding i have not seen a shilling before for two years this poor creature had lived comfortably in london her husband a mason killed by the breaking of a scaffold when alas she was wretched enough to belong to some parish in oxford mrs berkeley enquired whom among the guardians were tenderly disposed toward the poor and was told mr slatter the baker and mr ayton the grocer mr slatter serving dr berkeleys family with bread she instantly set off to call on him and never recollects to have seen a more sensible wellbehaved humane person in humble station he would make a better figure in an higher than many who have scrambled up to it he assured her that unable to combat with the majority of the guardians in defense of the poor he had in despair relinquished it entirely  she then went to mr ayton and received a similar answer she exhorted both but she fears in vain however unpleasant it might be to continue to fight the battles of the poor she assured them there would come a time when they would rejoice that they had done it their answer was that the lowest and most mercenary of the tradesmen were appointed guardians and there was no opposing them how different from canterbury two most respectable tradesmen out of each of the sixteen parishes are annually chosen sometimes she conceives rechosen as when she wished to get a poor creature going in comfortably deposited she constantly went to dr berkeleys baker the very worthy sensible wellbred mr johnson educated at the university of cambridge on the death of his father he most dutifully and affectionately went home to assist his worthy mother in carrying on her business mr johnson if not in office himself constantly took care to apply to some worthy man who was the editor is no democrat feels horrors at the vile idea of equality  but such direful inequality as a rich bonvivant oxford tradesman  and the poor almost poisoned poor creatures in that vile workhouse must hurt every heart who has ever read in the bible who makes thee to differ from another etc  the editor after delivering her sentiments very freely on one class of people in oxford cannot quit the place without taking notice of a very different class whom she once had it in contemplation to address in the oxford mercury as she did not feel happy to quit oxford without offering her very grateful acknowledgements to them  the young gentlemen of the university it is a general an almost universal complaint amongst the fair sex the editor begs pardon for a misnomer she ought to have written the red sex for almost all now resemble rouge dragon in heraldry to be sure the present dress makes them resembles heraldic animals and swifts yahoos the editor famous amongst her friends for never wearing any cap or hat that did not become her sort of face nor any color that did not become her complexion and was perpetually consulted on that subject by her friends cannot help thinking that the father of mischief has been the inventor of the present mode of dressing particularly the vile scooped out hats or rather straw caps she therefore styles them diabolls it is no wonder that husbands go astray from wives so odiously disfigured  that all polite attentions from gentlemen to ladies is at an end is a charge perhaps too well founded an excellent exaltedly pious friend of the editors but lately gone to glory the lady of the late very worthy amiable thomas baber esquire of sunninghill park and who had the happiness to be the mother of edward baber esquire well known to all in the east for his inflexible honesty he had the happiness of thoroughly pious as well as accomplished parents this lady once a most celebrated beauty used to say the young men of this day are quite hottentots all i expect of them is that if i happen to fall down they will be so good as to kick me aside and not walk over me the editor fears the charge may be too true but she feels it a duty incumbent on her to say that if politeness to females is banished from every other place it has taken up its residence amongst the young gentlemen of the university of oxford  true politeness extending ever to aged females  the editor as has been mentioned before has at sixty every accomplishment that some are without at eighty frequently if walking alone stepping into a gray puddle mistaking it for a nice clean broad stone the polite attentions from young gentlemen in assisting her to cross the street sometimes accompanying her half a streets length to direct her to a shop opening the door for her always giving her the wall not driving her off the pavement as two officers did a few years ago at newcastle she leaning on her husbands arm  he being dressed in a short cassock they supposed him a bishop as they said en passant and knew worthy wights he could not challenge them but he severely reproved their brutality the editor happened to hear that the wife of one of them amply revenged her quarrel he almost deserved it  the editor certainly owes her life to the polite humanity of one gentleman whose name although she took much pains to learn it she never could find out until the evening before she quitted magdalene lodge at the close of november      or every grateful respectful attention would have been rendered to the reverend mr williams subwarden of wadham college  a lady of fashion well known in the polite circles now of an age as well as the editor to dress for comfort not for show having an house in the neigbourhood of oxford often walking in the street with the editor said your remark is very just that the young men here are certainly very wellbred if they were not they would laugh at us  for to be sure you with your black beaver gypsey hat tied down and hiding half your little politeness prevented her adding withered face and your rusty black cloak and i in my old hat and old great coat are two curious enough figures the editors excellent relation and herself are both oldfashioned in making it a point to pay their butcher and baker every monday morning and the editor used always to tell dr berkeley and her son when she got a lecture for walking out in a morning without a servant that she did not like a footman attending her when she did not appear as if she could pay him his wages  the editor never met with any impertinence but twice during her sejour in oxford  one day walking by baliol college a poor creature in she supposes a servitors gown expressing his dislike of her hat and after she was passed said  he would give a crown to know who she was the editor languished to have turned on her heel and have said young man save your crown to buy truslers edition of lord chesterfields advice to the amiable phil stanhope  i will tell you without reward that i am the wife of dr berkeley prebendary of canterbury but having with her a lady who always returns pertness by silent disdain which affects not fools it may wise persons the editors generosity in gratifying the poor lowlived creatures curiosity gratis would have hurt her dignity the other was one very hot evening the editor had taken in her hand a parasol a shower coming on she held it over her head to protect a very good hat not far from christchurch she met a number of gentlemen pushing home from the shower who all passed her with their usual politeness stepping off the very narrow pavement to avoid incommoding her the rear was brought up by a little insignificant looking animal in a gown who in a voice resembling any thing but that of a young man squeaked out look look here is a lady holding a parasol over her in this violent shower  what a fool she must be the editor heard two or three of the gentlemen say not at all  it did not rain she supposes they added when she set out the name of this wise little miss in a black gown is concealed in pity to his poor parents  it is enough to be burdened with such a poor little creature without seeing him held up to public contempt  a very worthy friend of the editors whom she has not had the delight of seeing for many years mrs m jeffries of richmond used formerly to say one has no pleasure in hearing scandal from mrs george berkeley for the little dl will never tell one the name until all the town rings with it the exquisitely kind attentions of this wonderfully agreeable worthy lady to the editors angelic friend the late mrs catharine talbot when her excellent friend the marchioness de gray lent her house at richmond to mrs talbot during her lingering illness must ever endear her to the editor although it is little likely she should every see her again until they meet in the region of spirits as both are much attached to their own abode  quiting these two curious beings the servitor and squeaking miss to thank themselves for these animadversions the editor returns her best thanks to all and every sensible polite young gentleman of the university they resemble in some respects holy job who says  eyes was i to the blind feet was i to the lame etc the editor sincerely hopes that they may never be afflicted as he was and that those of her polite assisters who choose to marry may meet with wiser and more pious wives than at first fell to the lot of certainly a favorite of the almightys he naming him one of the three with noah and daniel who should deliver their own souls this is mentioned to show to those who believe the inspiration of scripture the folly of supposing the history of job a pious fable and that holy man an ideal person see poor dr durells simple book and in all other respects the accomplished mrs chapones wise one on this subject  since writing the above the editor has had the distress to hear of the almost sudden death of a thoroughly amiable man who accidentally meeting her at tea at a neighboring gentlemans house and learning not from the editor who is not addicted to entertain her friends or visitors with lamentations that she had much intricate it is impossible for her to omit offering her public acknowledgements to mr wilberforce the mr wilberforce the friend of all the distressed whether their complexions are black or white perhaps in this instance might with more propriety be said brown having found it is impracticable to assist her in getting the lords of the treasury to remit the very heavy duty on the foreign books of bishop berkeleys library removed from ireland for sale in england most generously wrote her a very polite letter offering to lend her the money he had never seen or perhaps heard of her until applied to to use his interest with mr pit it was most gratefully accepted and will be most thankfully repaid the editor wishes she could get her income from ireland as easily as her books which alas have been so ill kept that they have not defrayed the expense of carriage and duty but that many of them being wanted to complete sets in england it had been wiser to have permitted the irish worms to have finished them in their native country the customhouse officers would not seize that a widow in one kingdom and her jointure in another is rather unpleasant is sometimes sorely distressing  unpleasant business to struggle through visited her the next day saying he was going to town in a few days and if it was possible for him to render her any service in any way he should esteem himself very happy if she would as he politely said honor him with her commands the editor accepted most gratefully his kind offer and took leave to employ him in a very fatiguing matter in which his amiability led him to be indefatigable that it is not yet accomplished nor probably ever will was not to be attributed to want of every exertion of the amiable dr sergrove master of pembroke college this produced a degree of intimacy mrs berkeley ever wishing with little ability to benefit all her friends children took the liberty to recommend to his attention and protection a very sensible fine youth of his college a son of the very worthy mr andrews surgeon at stanmore in middlesex one of fourteen olivebranches to whom this thoroughly amiable hearted benevolent man was exceedingly attentive and kind and told the editor that it had pleased him and he dared say would please her that young andrews had on dr johnsons rooms becoming vacant earnestly solicited to have them assigned to him young andrews and his whole family have as strong understandings as dr johnson they are famed for it may he make as good use of it as did his predecessor in the rooms this agreeable friend visited at magdalene lodge three days before he went to town  to return alas no more  requesting mrs berkeley and mrs frinsham earnestly to honor him as he politely termed it by drinking tea and spending the evening at the masters lodgings saying he would invite some ladies whom he named the rector of lincoln and some other sensible agreeable friends to meet them the very tender state of mrs berkeleys health forced her to decline it which she now regrets he promised to visit datchet alas may his obliged friend meet him in a still pleasanter place  mrs berkeley on her revisiting oxford for a few days offered for the reverend mr williamss acceptance and which she hopes he received one of the copies on royal paper gilt etc so decorated for some lords spiritual and temporal of dr berkeleys famous long smothered sermon preached at lambeth palace chapel at the consecration of his beloved old friend bishop horn which she solemnly promised dr berkeley on his death bed at his earnest injunction should be published  the editor as perhaps she may have before mentioned never had any very great dread of the disapprobation of sinful mortals like herself and as she one day said to her beloved partner the removal of her dear son had annihilated that little fear if she can approve her conduct to what dr young with his wonted energy terms the god within us and to god in heaven she little regards the censures of any prelates or potentates on earth this non chalance of the opinion of what is called the world she by no means recommends to young persons of either sex or to mothers who have daughters that they wish to marry off tout au contraire she dehorts them from it a proper respect for the then world she is persuaded did in the last century prevent some of our greatgrandmothers being exhibited at doctors commons and before the house of peers to be sure they had also a little fear of a great personage that our modern belles and beaux many of them never even heard of from their wise prudent parents  the late excellent lady  once said to the editor my father and mother were what the world called mighty good sort of people and yet i do declare neither of them ever mentioned any thing of religion to me nor ever even told me that i had a soul to be saved upon the editors saying they must have done it but you have forgotten it she reddened with anger and answered no no you are the only human being that ever talked to me on the subject of religion her father lived till she was twentythree her mother until she had a grandchild of this daughter marriageable the minister of her fathers parish was what the world termed a very good clergyman probably he had not studied he must have read as it is a sunday lesson the thirtythird chapter of the prophet ezekiel  the once gay as vicious is too frequently termed lord holland in his account of himself written a little before his execution praises the wonderful mercy of god in the following words oh the astonishingly gracious mercy of god that i should owe my salvation to a child the incomparable angelically pious lovely countess of suffolk this heavenly creature was in mercy to her wretched fathers soul snatched from the brink of the grave just before his afflictions commenced she attended him in prison every day and the night preceding his execution sat up in an outer room and entered with his gentleman in the morning she was certainly spared from death temporal on purpose to rescue her father from death eternal she went a very few months after to join her penitent parent in the realms of bliss of my own  i who have so sadly neglected the instruction of my children and servants in piety and the knowledge of god i always did take care to have a good chaplain in the house to read prayers daily and instruct my children and my servants in religion but i ought also to have done it myself as ehildren attend much more to what comes from a parent than from others not so interested for them etc etc  the editor some years ago returning from scotland to canterbury amused herself with visiting every noblemans house in her road or that did not take her too far out of her road to view the fine pictures etc she saw a chapel at every one and constantly said to the attending servant i suppose that you have prayers here every day  no madam never here must be excepted the chapel at alnwick castle the question asked was answered by the sensible obliging mrs carr the housekeeper o yes madam every day excepting sundays when his grace the late duke of northumberland always goes attended by all the family to the parish church his graces children and servants will not rise in judgment against him at the last great day when every peer as well as every pedlar must meet every servant they have ever had under their roof may they do it with joy and not with grief  the reason assigned by god for his regard of an holy patriarch was for i know abraham that he will command not civilly desire his children and his household after him and they shall keep the way of the lord etc the lord printed in capitals always implies   it is great pity as sweet dr watts observes that our translators have not always translated it as in some few places jehovah it would have prevented the writing of many volumes and much cavilling let them divert themselves with cavilling as long as they can  there are no socinians or arians in hell let the honest ones among them read mr hawtry and the astonishingly curious treatise of the late very learned reverend meredith jones chaplain to the present father of the bench the reverend sir william ashburnham lord bishop of chichester whose exquisitely polite amiable attentions to the late dr berkeley were were ever so gratefully felt by him that he constantly brought his lordships letters to the editor to preserve carefully  after an absence of some months from england on his return mrs berkeley said to her son oh my dear berkeley i can introduce you to the most delightful of women  mr b  pray my dear madam do it then for you know how much i admire a woman of superior understanding and i am sure if she was not such although you never despise those who have not you would not style her delightful  mrs b  she has indeed and it is so cultivated and so wonderfully well informed by much traveling so highly polished and withal  bears her faculties so meekly as your idol shakspeare speaks that you will be in raptures with her  mr b  well my dear mother who is she  dr b  why she is a jewess you know i often tell your mother that she has friends amongst  jews turks infidels and heretics see one of the good friday collects  alluding to mrs berkeleys having one beloved friend alas who believes not in god some roman catholic and some presbyterian friends she has really now a jew friend and a most pleasing woman she is  mr b  well but her name my dear sir who knows but i may make up to her convert her to christianity and marry her for to be sure she is rich being a jewess  mrs b  marry her why although the levitical law allows of polygamy much as you and i have both studied it i do not find that it allows the ladies to have a plurality of husbands that is only allowed to one cast in the east indies where the woman is allowed four who all like wise men vie with each other who shall be most assiduous most agreeable present her the best gifts whilst we european women that is some few old fashioned creatures are studying perpetually how to please our husbands as that horrid old fashioned writer st paul directs the woman that is married cares for the things of the world how she may please her husband  the wonderfully witty sister of the editor often says aye aye it might be so in st pauls time but their care now seems to be to please every man but their husband and he poor soul is left to please himself as well as he can well well there must be a reckoning for it some time hence poor silly creatures  mrs berkeley told her son that if he was ambitious of uniting himself with a descendant of the father of the faithful the friend of god  delightful title which all should strive to merit  all who do strive in earnest may attain  he must look out for himself for that her lovely friend had been many years the happy wife of the sensible learned highly accomplished thoroughly polite raphael brandon esquire  mr brandon writes english as correctly and very much more elegantly than many eminent english scholars the editor has letters of this gentlemans carefully preserved that prove the truth of this assertion she expressing some surprise at it was told by mr brandon that on his coming from portugal to england at about seventeen the master appointed to teach himself and brother english recommended it to them to study diligently bishop lowths english grammar which he has done to excellent effect the editor advises all youths sons of her friends who are going into navy army or the east unable to enjoy that great solid blessing of an english university education to purchase and study it many have followed the advice and blessed her for it it distresses one to hear a brave admiral or valiant general speaking as incorrectly as an abigail  the writing the word jew brings to the editors recollection and she cannot deny herself the pleasure of writing and she hopes some few feeling hearts the pleasure of reading a little anecdote of mr monck berkeley and some canterbury jews about the year      the shop of a very respectable woollendraper and mastertailor was broke open and robbed of goods and money to a large amount every one was at a loss to guess who had done the deed excepting the worthy sufferer a gentleman of large fortune of strict integrity on whom the editor bestowed the title of rhadamanthus as apt to say unpleasant things as his sweetly amiable son is to utter pleasing ones thought proper to say mr  the name not recollected by the editor had robbed himself this naturally rouzed the honest man who said he must now find out the burglarian at any rate he immediately procured a warrant to apprehend his journeyman who had served a seven years apprenticeship to him and behaved himself in the most exemplary manner he immediately accused his accomplice a journeyman hairdresser they were both examined by the mayor and committed to prison mr berkeley coming home the editor at dinner asked him if he knew this young jew who had committed the robbery to which he replied poor creature he had never committed this nor probably any other robbery if he had not been drawn in by a vile rascal of a christian as he is by courtesy styled a villain it was moving to hear how excellent a character his worthy master gave of him until he said within these last few months that he became acquainted with this christian rascal when he became idle and of course vicious no human being surely ever had a greater dread of idleness than mr monck berkeley and often during the latter part of his illness used to exclaim what an idle life i lead surely god will i fear call me into judgment for it i do nothing i write nothing  mr berkeley lamented that through the stupidity of the then town clerk the poor creature had not been admitted to bail after dinner he retired to his own apartment and consulted his law books he was to leave canterbury very early the next morning in company with his very amiable neighbor william deeds junior esquire of st stephens canterbury both being obliged to keep term that day at the temple  mr deeds that he might not idle away a large estate which he now possesses and spends most worthily mr berkeley that he might get one as he probably would have done had it pleased god to have blessed him with health  about eleven oclock at night mr berkeley came home and thus accosted his mother my dear madam you must be pleased to promise me that you will go tomorrow morning the minute you have breakfasted before you go to church to this poor creatures parents and tell them that if they do not retain garrow to plead for their son he will certainly be sentenced to death  that garrow can and will get him off i know he has a cause this assize at maidstone and if they will give him sixty guineas he will come on to canterbury dont let them hackle with him for he will not come for a less fee and i know he will come for that and i repeat it and i desire you to say that nothing else can save their son  poor fellow  mrs b  i know not even where they live  mr b  oh john will find that out for you  mrs b  i do not know them and they would think it very odd in me an ignorant woman   mr b   odd or even best of mothers if you dont this minute promise me solemnly that you will go and say what i have desired you i will take my hat and knock them up and tell it them myself  to prevent her sons going mrs berkeley though with but an indifferent grace made the promise and after prayers the family retired in the morning a little before five the hour the chaise was ordered mr berkeley crept into the chamber like a zephyr that he might not disturb his father a very bad sleeper and repeated in his mothers ear all she was to say the promise once obtained he had no uneasiness on that score the editor after breakfast set off for bests lane where she witnessed such a scene as her dear compassionate son being removed she trusts and thinks no one can ever again compel her to witness  on entering the house she saw affliction personified in the figure of a decent middleaged woman mrs berkeley conceiving her the mother of the unfortunate young man began condoling with her soon coming to the point telling her who she was and delivering her sons message the poor woman exclaimed my god what goodness that such a gentleman should condescend to think about such a poor wretch as i am oh may god reward him well to be sure somebody did tell me that a fine young gentleman one of the prebendarys sons did say walking on the parade with other gentlemen that my poor boy need not have been committed to gaol she instantly rose and called her husband on his entering the room she repeated mr berkeleys message with delight  when horrid to relate  what can one call him not a descendant of abraham by sarah not a saracen as the descendants of esau style themselves that they be not mistaken for the descendants of abraham by hagar he must have been an ishmaelite worse than an ishmaelite for not only his hand but his horrid tongue was against his own child for in an hoarse surly voice he said  no no i shall do not such thing let him take his chance if he cannot get off he must be hanged mrs berkeley on seeing the agonies of the poor distracted mother longed to have said to him  you will be damned she did however restrain her indignation a little and joined the supplications of the wretched mother elevated with mr berkeleys message into confidence of her poor sons life now thrown into the deepest despair never did the editor so much wish for a large fortune as at that moment to have given the mother the fee for the counsel that mr monck berkeley so earnestly recommended after finding all soothing utterly in vain she gave a loose to her indignation saying every thing that it suggested to her at length bidding farewell to this wretched mourning mother she returned home without deigning to look at the old father much it may be supposed he felt this not so his kind adviser mr monck berkeley one of the editors minor punishments for her children when young until ten or twelve years old was you have not behaved well in so or so i will not look at you until tomorrow dinner time this was so keenly felt by her eldest son mr monck berkeley that he would often in the sweetest voice supplicate now do forget it and look at me a little a proof this of what the editor frequently asserts that a little common sense and great steadiness may rescue children from much corporal punishment and make a more lasting impression on their minds  compassion carried her sometimes when taking her morning walk to visit this  house of moarning this melancholy affair happened several weeks before the assizes the wretch remained inflexible and the poor mother in such a state of despair as never to wash her hands or face put on or take off her clothes sitting the whole day without uttering a word at length just before the trial was to come on some more powerful orator than mrs berkeley probably some modern tertullus prevailed on the old wretch to send and retain mr garrow who came on from maidstone to canterbury and as mr berkeley had foretold got the poor young jew off for transportation for life some kind christian neighbor for she and her children were esteemed by all as the poor soul justly said for more than twenty years past flew out of the guildhall and told her the  joyful tidings  she started up fell on her knees thanked god went up stairs dressed herself neatly as formerly went out to the fishmarket and ordered hom her matters for her family as usual  dr berkeley on hearing it as all the city was talking of it expressed his astonishment that the mind could so soon after such length of time recover its wanted energy the editor it may be supposed did not fail to call in bests lane and obey the delightfully pleasing injunction of the apostle  rejoice with them that do rejoice the worthy womans gratitude ascribing the temporal salvation of her son to mr monck berkeleys judicious amiably kind advice in which all agreed was very delightful to the fond heart of his happy mother  it is impossible to omit mentioning here that in the year      dr berkeley had with him at canterbury mr patrick satterley eldest son of the skilful successful humane mr satterley surgeon and apothecary of hastings for whom dr berkeley had taken a lodging accidentally at a silversmiths in palace street whose worthy wife was sister to the young man rescued from the gallows by mr berkeley mr satterley getting a violent fever and dr berkeley going to him they discovered that he was the father of their brothers benefactor and immediately declared that no nurse was necessary for that they esteemed it their duty to render every possibly attention to any friend of that dear good mr berkeley who had been the means of rescuing their poor brother from an ignominious death  mr berkeley on going to hastings was told by his surgeon in town mr blicke that he would find a most skilful attentive medical man in mr satterley this gentleman is famous for rescuing persons from the house appointed at length for all the descendant of adam  apostate adam as good dr joshua smith styles him in his hickess psalms the aged he by gods blessing on his great medical skill preserves in comfortable health to extreme old age  the dreadfully rash young who presume to rush uncalled into the presence of the great judge of quick and dead by his great chirurgical skill the editor knows two thus happily rescued by him and she knows of several others  one old wretch the late  the murderer of her amiable accomplished friend the late judge advocate of   mr satterley presuming to give himself a few holydays to make a visit to his eldest son a very elegant amiable young man at oxford of whom he said to mr monck berkeley that young man from a child has never done that thing that i wished him not to do this horrid old monster dismissed mr satterley and called in other medical aid who in one short fortnight dismissed him  to a place whence he will never return until called to meet the amiable thoroughly honorable mr  this old monster had prefixed to his name by birth that pretty elegant word which should remind all who possess it not to disgrace it honorable   the editor is sometimes by one or two of her gnatstraining although not camelswallowing friends accused of want of charity in guessing at the place of abode of some departed spirits to which she replies from her oldfashioned book the holy spirit declares that without holiness no man or woman either however beautiful etc shall see the lord do you think that general  or mrs  were holy persons the editor has no doubt but that many very one of our witty as well as pious ancient divines says hell will be paved with good resolutions filled with good sort of people good sort of people will declare that the editors preface deserves to be burnt by the hands of the common hangman but if it benefits or consoles one single soul she will esteem herself happy  the last time the editor visited canterbury alas she called on the worthy israelites to thank them for their kind gratitude shown to mr patrick satterley when they repeated to her what they had as above related said to dr berkeley there are certainly some  double distilled superfine elegant christians in canterbury who might have learned gratitude from these jews in humble station  when mr monck berkeley was a very little boy the very respectable  henchman esquire of the india house losing his worthy father before he was fourteen was sent off to india on bidding adieu to his elegant mother he threw his arms about her saying farewell my dear mother god only knows whether we shall ever meet again in this world but comfort yourself with this that as i leave you an honest boy whether i live or die by gods blessing you shall never hear of me but as an honest man so saying he quitted the house and from what the editor gathers from her newspaper mr henchman seems to keep his charming early promise the editor has not the pleasure of being at all acquainted with him having never seen him since his return from india the above little anecdote is related verbatim as it was told to dr berkeley and herself at the time by their sensible agreeable friend the late reverend humphrey henchman fellow of all souls college oxford both these gentlemen were grand and greatgrandsons of bishop henchman of london this story was very frequently told to mr monck berkeley by his mother during his childhood and youth with exhortations to make the same resolution mr berkeley used frequently to say whatever faults i have i thank god and my dear mother that i am an honest man he was in truth so and it may with equal truth be asserted a man of the strictest honor when mr monck berkeley was a very little boy his mother made him get in memory the lines of mr pope a little altered for his particular use reflect that lessened fame is never regained and boyish honor once is always stained when about six years old he came one day to his mother with pope in his hand saying my dear mama  here is a man that has got your verses and printed them but not quite write for he says virgin honor mr monck berkeley when grown up used to say what a little fool i must have been not to find out that my mother was the alterer not mr pope mrs george berkeley incurred some ridicule for thus early instilling into her little boy a sense of honor but where conscience is concerned she ever did by gods grace ever will defy ridicule which let the wretched lord shaftesbury say what he will is  not the test of truth for such a genius as his lordship may ridicule the whole life of the savior of the world his lordships death merited ridicule bishop berkeley has frequently told his son that so lamentably illtempered was he in the latter stage of his life that his poor lady used when any company arrived to post out of the room and conjure them for her sake to assent to every thing her lord asserted or said or it would put him into such a passion as might kill him happy philosophy for one on the brink of the grave   the editor has to return her most grateful heartfelt acknowledgements for the wonderfully kind amiable attentions of the reverend dr lynch prebendary of canterbury for his incessant unwearied exertions in endeavoring to lighten her heavy business at canterbury it was her misfortune not his fault that he happened to pitch upon the last man in england whom she would have appointed her surveyor and more particularly as he owed very great obligations to dr berkeley the editor some weeks ago being advised by a printer to apply to a papermaker a very rich man for paper to print off the second volume of literary relics prepared by mr monck berkeley the supplying it was civilly declined the editor remarked that she was sure before she wrote that it would because he was under very important obligations to dr berkeley the very worthy bookseller the obliging mr cook of oxford said do i understand you right madam  yes sir i have in repeated instances since my loss of dr berkeley experienced it as through the goodness of god i have met with numerous instances of real friendship where neither on dr berkeleys or my own account i had any right to expect any attention but civility it is impossible for the editor to pass on without inserting here the name of the witty worthy william hey esquire commissioner of the customs for his unwearied exertions to serve her the noble the angelic conduct of the worthy mrs tailor of clarges street piccadilly an eleve of the lovely mrs catharine talbot who had the happiness to live with her many years who hearing that the editor not caring to coin was in some difficulties most generously wrote to her offering to sell out her whole fortune to lend to mrs berkeley the stocks then at sixtyfive it may easily be guessed what answer the editor returned to this wonderful offer  may he who sees in secret reward her openly  indeed she has as many friends as acquaintances yes may he who rewards every man according to his works reward these worthy compasionate friends  compassionate i repeat for an aged matron without a son although not quite a beggar may be very often is a great object of compassion  the editors thanks are particularly due her prayers are daily offered at the throne of grace  may they be heard and answered an hundred a thousand fold on them and theirs  to her excellent old friend sir richard hill for the trouble he has taken is perpetually still taking concerning her affairs english and irish to the amiable dr lynch as above mentioned to the very learned grateful mr sawkins student of christ church for literally forcing money upon her when she could not procure a guinea from ireland enabling her to pay a quarters salary to one of dr berkeleys curates who wrote twice before dr berkeley had been dead three weeks the salary became due on the   st of december      mrs berkeley lost her beloved partner on the  th of january      exactly sixteen days after dr berkeley whether he received money or not from ireland was always most scrupulously conscientiously careful to pay his curates salary from the time that he had the happiness at twentysix of having his beloved respected friend the very learned mr john whitaker this worthy gentleman is a lineal descendant of the spirited walworth lord mayor of london his uncle the late major walworth was the last male descendant of that noble magistrate of the city of london  the able the unanswerable vindicator of mary queen of scots in that relation to him as also the excellently pious philip gurdon this excellent gentleman is now residing on the large estate on which the conqueror found his grandsire  long may he and his descendants enjoy it they owe it to the most wonderful instance of true friendship perhaps ever performed by any merely human being the editor here sets down the story as it has often been related to her by the excellent mr gurdon when curate to dr berkeley at cookham  in the year       gourdon as it was then spelt esquire was nominated one of the judges to try the unfortunate king charles  he determined to attend  the minister of his parish used many arguments to dissuade him but all in vain the night before he was to commence his journey to london he stayed with him till eleven oclock a late hour in the those wiser times telling him that setting aside the indignity of the business it would be the destruction of his ancient family and large estate at length the excellent pastor unable to prevail on his steady patron took his leave early the next morning mr gurdon set out for london a long narrow lane lay between his house and the high road  on a sudden the coach stopped with a violent jerk in the narrowest part of the lane the coachman called out to the postillion to know why he dared to stop so suddenly he replied the horses will not go on   whip them then  i cannot for dr  name forgotten by the editor lies across the road all in the mud  mr gurdon putting his head out of the coach enquired the cause when his heavenly pastor spoke as follows my dear friend you are going on a most iniquitous business i have said all i am capable of saying i am now doing all that i am capable of doing if you will go you shall drive over my body mr gurdon struck the editor can never relate it without her eyes filled with tears fell back in his coach then recovering himself said thou best of men i will go back come into the coach to me  no not unless you swear to me that you will give up the matter which mr gurdon did and by so doing preserved his estate for the present excellent amiable possessor of it on the kings return mr gurdon was attained as one of the kings judges his name is in the list the editor thinks in nalsons life of charles the first but it was happily proved that mr gurdon did not attend   of assenwick hall in suffolk both gentlemen of fortune but the idea of detaining a curates salary however rich he might be always hurt him it is supposed the worthy man who applied so expeditiously to his relict conceived that she could not be hurt but by a pair of red hot pincers  a young sprig of divinity also too old to have acted thus whose worthy father ever gratefully acknowledged himself under high obliations to dr berkeley on many accounts pecuniary as well as other employed a lawyer to write to the editor before the interment of her beloved partner demanding the payment of  a not very large sum borrowed by dr berkeley of his father during dr berkeleys chancery suit in ireland the editor is indebted to the goodness of dr berkeleys worthy old friend the reverened the dean of hereford for answering the lawyers letter and adjusting matters with this grateful divine who in his early youth was one of the many quarterers on dr berkeleys wonderful hospitality pity to the father of the divinity sprig prevents his name from appearing in these pages the editor involuntarily exclaimed with the ancient sage thrifty careful of the main chance as this young man is i had rather have my dead son than two such living ones he wrote a very fine letter apologetic to the editor for his prudence to which as she was not by her friends permitted to answer in her own style when wounded she never returned any answer at all and only laments that his zeal to recover so speedily a sum considerably under two hundred pounds should have reduced him to the meanness of falsifying as the attorney however clever could not by inspiration have dictated the carefully preserved epistle to the editor without orders from his employer indeed he therein says he had orders etc  should this preface happen to be read by the curate or the sprig of divinity if they keep their own counsel the editor means not to publish their names nor to make them known to more persons than their own wonderful conduct naturally introduced them to  quitting these prudent persons the editor turns to more pleasant ones  the worthy friends of mrs berkeley who in that very early period of her affliction visited the house of mourning labored to heal not to tear open her deep wounds they thought not they acted not like these two divines but as was most elegantly expressed in a polite kind letter of enquiry to a friend from mrs trenchard of hendons house my heart bleeds for those two  ladies before their deep wounds for the loss of mr berkeley are healed to have them thus torn open afresh there subsisted between dr berkeley and his sisterinlaw mrs frinsham the sincerest tender friendship  mrs trenchard cannot probably translate greek nor write latin quite so well as these divines but she has a highly cultivated mind and a most feeling heart  the names as above mentioned are not communicated because the editor believes the hasty curate a really worthy man although not blessed with quite so much delicacy as the worthy daughter of farmer strange of heddington near oxford who about five months after the death of dr berkeley presented a bill to the editor for corn and hay on her coming into the room to receive her money a pretty considerable sum mrs berkeley enquiring of her why she had not applied before as she might probably have been glad of it with the spirit of a princess of an angel she replied good madam how could i think of troubling you for a few pounds in your deep affliction i wonder i could do it now but i heard you were about to leave oxford and i thought perhaps you might not know of this bill but if it is any inconvenience to you to pay it now i am perfectly willing to wait for it may this worthy woman never experience the loss of her good husband and an only child  the forming this kind wish for this amiablehearted woman brings to the editors mind what occurred many years ago walking out one evening she called at a farmhouse to enquire for some pigeons the mistress presented herself mrs berkeley wishing to shorten her walk home requested the good woman to direct her the nearer way in crossing the fields mrs berkeley not to appear proud began enquiring what family she had the reply made she added ah madam i have thrice known the sorrows of widowhood it had not much injured her health she was remarkably plump and well favored perhaps she may have suffered the same sorrows again she might perhaps be as great a philosopher as her daughter who kept a shop in the next parish where dr berkeleys family bought many odd things whose daughter a fine girl of seventeen was dying of a consumption mrs berkeley one sunday at church enquired after the young woman on hearing there were no hopes of her recovery she condoled with the mother who made the following reply it is set down verbatim good lackaday madam why she and i did not come into the world at the same time and why should we think to go out at the same time probably these good women mourned the loss of relatives as did a tenants wife of the late worthy agreeable capt bartlam of moore hall the day after the death of her husband mrs bartlam called to see her and began condoling with her to whom she replied o good lackadaisy madam it is a sad thing to be sure i have been crying all the morning long and as soon as ever i have ate this bit of bread and cheese and drank this drap of ale a pint i must go to it again as hard as i can for my life  how often has the editor seen a table full of company at dr berkeleys laugh until unforced tears bedewed their cheeks when this story was related and acted by that best of storytellers the late delightfully witty reverend james hamilton grandson of lord abercorn formerly named in this preface as also that he spent the whole of the summer at dr berkeleys his curate constantly going to mr hamiltons house in warwickshire in may and remaining there until november in order that mr hamilton might as dr berkeley used to say give him all the time he could spare from his friends the beasts of the field the fowls of the air and the fishes of the river mr hamilton although an excellent scholar was wonderfully fond of hunting shooting and fishing dr berkeley living on the banks of the thames had always a large pleasureboat of his own in which mr hamilton an excellent sailor and rower was perpetually on the water alone early in the morning but frequently took mr monck berkeley with him mrs berkeley dreading his too volatile agility feared that in attempting to assist mr hamilton in sailing or rowing he might be drowned notwithstanding her strong opinion still retained by the editor although often laughed at by mr hamilton that infants if put into the water would swim naturally as well as puppies kittens calves etc he often urged her to try the experiment on her own little boy mrs berkeley told him she was not an experimental philosopher and was terribly afraid he might be drowned with his garments not provided by nature like kittens etc during mr berkeleys stay at the kings school nothing could prevail upon him to swim out of his depth to the great discontent of his mother one day after having been some time at eton a young gentleman from eton came over to see him and happening to relate something said to mrs berkeley you know he swims as well as you do  to which the editor replied that is not at all i suppose  o yes madam berkeley is i really think the best swimmer in the school i dont suppose any thing could drown him but the boat fastening him in the mud  he swims like a duck mrs berkeley asked her son how this came to pass he replied why they found what a fool i was so a party of them took me out in a boat and when we were got into deep water contrived to throw me overboard then rowed away they kindly waited to see whether i could swim in order to take me up if i could not i horridly frighted instantly swam after them and have swum as he says like a duck ever since i am sure i was much obliged by them adding eton for ever say i the editor had frequently before her son was born heard lady  relate this practice of the etonians to a new comer and it actually occasioned her worrying her lord out of his determination of sending his son to eton folly thy name is woman accordingly lordy as they style the peers eldest son in scotland had nothing of eton about him when he came out into life the editors kindred had always been etonians and oxonians she does not remember to have heard that any of them turned out foolish vautriens mr berkeley like most eton men was a very excellent rower as was most happily experienced by a party of ladies and gentlemen in his fathers boat dr berkeley etc had gone up the river to dine at medenham abbey  soon after they had entered the boat to return a most dreadful storm of thunder lightning and rain came on some of the ladies were much terrified which mr berkeley perceiving said to mr wrightson come john give me your oar and the editor fears to set down in how short a time mr berkeley and his fathers gardener formerly a most excellent waterman now an helpless aged almshouseman at maidenhead rowed eleven miles  the boat seemed to fly but mr berkeley exerted himself so violently happily for the party for within ten minutes after their landing the storm became frightfully tremendous indeed that he could scarce use his elegant astonishingly strong fingers for three days after  mr monck berkeley and several of the monck family have that sort of fingers which seem as if they have neither sinews or bone in them but when called into action feel like iron the editor used frequently to request her son when he had given her his hand feeling like peeling satin to stiffen it which he would instantly do and she conceives that no two men without he chose it could have unbent it neither his father nor his brother had their fingers so wonderfully formed by nature  begged mr hamilton to reject his suit and leave him on the terrass one day seeing mr hamilton preparing to sail he screamed oh dear jemmy pray take me with you  no i must not your mamma is afraid you will be drowned mr berkeley immediately walked into the thames in his petticoats being then little more than three years old and pursued the boat mr hamilton instantly putting back asked him if he was not afraid of being drowned as he must have been if he had not put back the spirited little creature replied aye aye but i considered before i walked in that you would certainly come back and take me before the water got up to my chin because mamma would have been so grieved if i had been drowned the same sound judgment and resolute spirit accompanied him through life  a scotch gentleman of consequence one day at st andrews said to dr berkeley sir i last night saw your agreeable son as fou with water as most of the company were with wine dr berkeley who himself drank nothing but water expressed his wonder at it mrs berkeley supposing the gentleman was a dealer in the mavelous mentioned it to her son in that way to which he replied yes my dear madam it is very true i am often as drunk with water as others are with wine with this however very material difference that when it is proposed to break bottles glasses and burn chairs tables etc i instantly become as sober as a judge and have sometimes prevented much mischief  when mr berkeley entered at the university of st andrews one of the college officers called upon him to deposit a crown to pay for the windows he might break mr berkeley said that as he should reside in his fathers house it was little likely he should break any windows having never that he remembered broke one in his whole life he was assured that he would do it at st andrews he therefore made the deposit the cause of which he some time after learned on the rising of the session several of the students said now for the windows come it is time to set off let us sally forth mr berkeley being called upon enquired what was to be done they with one voice replied why to break every window in college  for what reason  oh no reason but that it has always been done from time immemorial mr berkeley sedately replied that he begged to be excused joining the party having never when a boy at eton and sometimes with more wine in his head than was good for him performed such a valiant feat he should feel himself exceedingly ashamed to be guilty of it as a young man he spoke so sensibly on the subject that the practice was from that time entirely given up and has probably never been revived the money continued to be collected as the following little aneodote will show a very good kind of man formerly coachman at lord balcarrass the college porter was the collector he one day told a very intimate friend of mr berkeleys the young lord of kincaldrum i am just come from a poor student indeed i went for the window croon he cried begged and prayed not to pay it saying he brought but a croon to keep him all the session and he had spent sixpence of it so i have got only four and sixpence how he is to live i cannot tell for they are very poor away flew the amiable young lord saying i must make a collection for him amongst the students he first met mr halket eldest son of sir j halket a beloved scotch friend of mr monck berkeley this charming youth said here take these few shillings it is all i have till i hear from home again the young lord said such an one will give a shilling and such an one half a crown and i will make my dear berkeley give a crown the idea of his saying make diverted the whole university who all knew mr berkeleys wonderful liberality to the poor he soon met mr berkeley who not only tossed out the crown but said we will make a good collection go you bower the young lairds name to the scotch and i to the english mr berkeley posted home and made his father mother and aunt subscribe largely as also all the english gentlemen students the subscription when closed was a very noble one this poor youth was the son of a labourer who having two fields about eight miles from st andrews kept three cows one cow was sold to dress him for the university and put the lamented croon in his pocket to purchase coals all the lower students study by fire light he brought with him a large tub of oatmeal and a pot of salted butter on which he was to subsist from the  0th of october until the  0th of may the space of five months but for this lucky affair of the croon and the lovely nature of the young lord of kincaldrum as accomplished as amiable in what is called in scotland an high dance this young gentleman could keep himself more than half a minute  near a minute  in air no one who has not seen a company of highland soldiers dance can form any idea of it more than our greatgrandsires could of electricity before dr franklins time  the very humane worthy college cook agreed with the young lord and mr berkeley to provide him a good dinner of flesh or fish through the session the editor is sorry to say some of his countrymen said that it was not quite roight of these young gentlemen to make this subscription  they might be made every day  this brings to the editors mind the indignation of she is very sorry to say a divine against her son at hastings for a similar offense on the arrival of the three hundred french clergy within two days at hastings mr berkeley said to his friend mr grimston it is impossible to let these poor persecuted strangers starve in a foreign country we must try and make a subscription for them mr grimston jelon son coutume tossed down his guinea mr monck berkeley cried stop stop my dear friend not so fast you will ruin all no i will draw up their case and you and i will set down against our names halfacrown each halfacrown cannot distress any one who has any thing to give we may give as much more as we please but set down only two shillings and sixpence they accordingly did so and amongst their acquaintance got many subscribers the paper was left at one of the circulating libraries the following account was related to the editor by a gentleman who was an eyewitness of the transaction the door opened and a stout man entered saying who is this mr berkeley that makes himself of such consequence picking peoples pockets for these french ragamuffins who is he what is he mr berkeley happening to be in a corner of the library reading rose and advancing with a very graceful bow in the mildest voice replied sir mr berkeley is a man of no sort of consequence nor pretends to be of any but quoting the latin line  as a man i must feel etc he felt it impossible not to try to alleviate the sufferings of these poor unfortunate servants of our blessed master and as by your habit sir you appear to be of the clerical function i should have hoped you would rather have forwarded than abused the attempt to relieve their real necessities no one is compelled for this reason the editor always wishes the prime minister to make plenty of lotteries because then persons of small incomes may choose whether they will be half beggared by taxes or not the editor used generally to get share of a twenty or fifty pounds prize but lately the blind goddess has deserted her which is rather unkind as she is now half blind in cases of subscription mr  name not at present recollected the librarian kindly permitted it to lie here mr berkeley then bowed and retired to his book again leaving the oratorical parson the editor always styles an unworthy clergyman a parson ready to faint with shame one day after mr berkeleys arrival at cheltenham his family all in the drawing room he asked pray my dear friends do any of you know mr  of   no was the unanimous voice well you have no great loss i am sorry to add that he is a divine mr berkeley then related as above  had these poor people applied to this divine as they did to mr berkeley on the death of a french marquis whose title the editor forgets they had not perhaps been as much consoled as they were by a young lawyer they came to mr berkeley in great anxiety to know whether it was possible for him to get the marquis buried in consecrated ground he assured them it would be impossible for him or any one else to prevent it adding we protestants are certainly better christians than you papists for had i died in france you would have buried me in a cabbagegarden or on the ramparts this point settled the next would le pauvre cher marquis have aucune office said over the editor cannot omit mentioning here a ludicrous occurrence on her first arrival in scotland sleeping at the neat pleasant town of kelso let swift say what he will of hellso as soon as she was up in the morning she walked out and seeing a funeral she joined it wishing to hear the scottish funeral service she enquired whether it was a young or an aged person to proportion her sorrow  ever lamenting the young  and where hope is not precluded rejoicing that the aged are delivered from the burdens of the flesh etc the answer was a very aged woman near ninety  on her arrival in the kirkyard the civility of every the lower scotch to strangers where there are no bawbies in the case made way for her to approach close to the house appointed for all living the editor did not endeavor to find out a minister robed in a surplice well knowing the horror in which that innocent white robe is held by all diffenters from the church of england and of rome  but for a black goon no such could her then tolerable eyes espy the corpse was soon let down into the grave which was filled up when every man took off his hat bowed at the grave and the crowd began to disperse mrs berkeley exceedingly shocked at what she had witnessed asked a very sensible intelligentlooking gentleman if he could tell her what could have induced so very aged a person to have been her own executioner not as the newspapers phrase it  put a period to their existence  alas alas that they cannot do  the gentleman replied did she poor woman i never heard that i should think she died of old age quite worn out  but sir if she had not destroyed herself she must certainly have received christian burial  the gentleman smiling said madam i presume you are an english lady  i arrived in scotland only yesterday evening sir  i supposed so madam we have no burial office in scotland  were you ever in england  oh yes ever at a funeral  at many  do you not think our burial service very fine  exquisitely so indeed and surely there is neither superstition or poppery as the scotch speak popery in praying for ourselves when god removes our friends or neighbors this gentleman the editor learned was a worthy physician of kelso at her return to the inn relating her anxiety on account of the poor good old scotch woman and her dialogue at the grave doctor and mr berkeley laughed immoderately dr berkeley used frequently to relate it to his scotch friends at st andrews mr berkeley used to say it was treating their dead friends just as we treat favorite dead dogs mr monck berkeley always made his fathers gardener dig an handsome grave in one of the kitchen gardens at cookham for his dogs and himself used to plant two rosetrees of different sorts one at the head and one at the foot of their graves which were always kept nicely turfed he had wonderful tenderness and loveliness in his nature dr berkeleys carriage on their journey to scotland frequently overtook and was overtaken by the hearse containing the corpse of the sensible amiable welljudging lord robert kerr who died at newberry in berkshire at the age of twentyeight his regiment had been quartered at canterbury six years before his unassuming manners a colonel at twentytwo his attachment to the worthy old greyheaded major always consulting him in every thing relating to the regiment endeared him to all who knew him the editor used to tell several worthy scotch ministers that she grieved to think sweet lord robert should be dragged so many miles to be buried like an english dog  had mr monck berkeley retained in full force the ideas of his childhood they could not have applied to any one more likely to assist them when under four years old playing one morning in the dressing room he on a sudden flew to his mother saying oh mamma lay down your work and see about it for there is dick states the famous old sexton of bray burying a poor little child by himself without either my papa or mr harmer to pray over it or mr wells the clerk to say amen this pious accomplished curate of dr berkeley has an exquisitely accomplished son educated at oxford who is the editor fears since dr berkeleys death a distressed divine in london his skill in music and french were he not a divine must have procured him a large salary his father was a wonderfully fine performer on many instruments and had the finest voice also in preaching and reading as well as in singing that the editor ever heard mrs berkeley told the young zealot that it was some poor little infant that having died very soon after its birth had not been baptized the editor took care to have all her own babes baptized within the hour after their birth lest a fit should carry them off mrs berkeley used to express her astonishment to her mother that she permitted her to remain unbaptized ten days after her entrance into this  vale of tears it could for the first part of her life hardly with propriety be styled such to her as after pushing forth one short cry to notisy as the scotch phrase it that  she was in life as an infant she never did cry at all which occasioned a learned honest physicians being consulted to know whether she had not some inward disorder that prevented her crying as infants usually do he replied not she she is a pure healthy goodhumoured little puss so does not plague you or herself by squaliing  mr berkeley said why mamma you tell me that god knows every thing before it happens now if he knew that he intended this little child should stay such a very short time upon earth i think it was hardly worth his while to give himself the trouble to send it down here at all it is needless to add here the editors comments to her little inquisitive sceptie who if the expression may be permitted watched gods dealings with man with a most jealous eye hoping to espy a flaw his comments on the twentyseventh chapter of genesis which he stumbled on rather than searched out for himself finding he had been made to miss it in his course of reading cost the editor much trouble to rectify although she retained an accurate remembrance of every word of a sermon preached on that whole chapter by the late very learned archdeacon of berks dr dodwell when she was about sixteen years old   him  oui certainement   ah grace au bon dieu quoi monsieur quoi  mr berkeley said he would show it them but he went too far there was not a french common prayer book to be procured in hastings he therefore most amiably took his pen and translated the whole of our delightful burialservice into french for them excepting the lesson and psalms which he showed them in his greek testament and latin bible they were in extacies with it they wished to attend the marquis to the grave but feared as the french ever did being knocked down by the english mr berkeley assured them the english were not such savages but all in vain was his rhetoric unless monsieur berquelee would  avoir la bontee to walk at their head as chief mourner for le cher marquis which by the undertakers omitting to bring a cloak he did in his royal archers coat in a letter to his mother he says do think of your son marching in procession at the head of three hundred french priests as chief mourner to a poor persecuted french noble  the elegant accomplished bishop of the editor thinks avranches on quitting the house of a very respectable clergyman who kindly received and entertained him and requested mr monck berkeley to visit and converse with him the gentlemen not speaking french his gratitude to mr berkeley for what his lordship termed his etonante bonte to his poor brethren and exquisitely polite attentions to himself he declared himself at a loss for words to express he conjured mr berkeley when things were again settled in france that he would visit him at his palace alas thou elegant amiable prelate  thou will probably visit paradise before thou do paris  mr berkeley often mentioned with pleasure the worthiness and propriety of many of the three hundred clergy not a man would receive a shilling who had brought any money with him others who had friends in town would only take barely enough to defray the expense of their journey to london  had the editor time to look over her sons letters she would give his account of the landing of the good old curate of dieppe aged    the farewell between him and his flock of sailors the editor remembers mr berkeley says there was not i believe one dry eye english or french on the shore the good old pastor is now gone to london i have the delight of thinking that god will go with him wherever he goes  but to return to the subject of dancing in which the young lord of kincaldrum has been already noticed how delightfully do the scotch dance every thing but a minuet the first time the editor saw her son esteemed a very good dancer having learned in england and in france for ten years de suite dance a countrydance and cotillon in scotland it turned her quite sick she thought he danced like a ploughman until some minuets were attempted between the countrydances which a little consoled her the next morning she requested mr berkeley to let her treat him with a master that he might learn to dance like a scotchman the offer was gratefully accepted and the very able mr jenkins attended mr berkeley every day greatly to the improvement of mr berkeley as has been above mentioned and exceedingly through his kindness to the finances of mr jenkins who just before or soon after mr berkeley quitted st andrews by his wise advise migrated to london where he attended by mr berkeleys recommendation many young persons of high rank and fashion  mr berkeley made it a point when at oxford and the temple to spend every christmas vacation with his parents they although the house in the oaks was not peculiarly calculated for a ball yet by the clever contrivance of mr monck berkeley ever fruitful in expedients twenty couple used to dance get negus and cakes in the eatingroom and eat their soup and petit soupe in mr monck berkeleys sittingroom up stairs which occasioned lady d one day asking dr berkeley when in town has mrs berkeley any room in her house at the oaks that i have never seen by removing all the furniture sideboard etc ten couple danced two dances  then ten more  could not bear the idea of mr berkeleys dancing at many of their neighbors houses and not seeing them in return the house could not hold all their numerous acquaintance in and about canterbury so of dames dune certain age as the french speak of a middleaged lady none were invited to cards but the mothers and of course the fathers of dancingyoungladies mrs berkeley saying like the old father mentioned by mr addison in the spectator that she did not feel it right to invite young ladies to be made whirlygigs without inviting their natural their best chaperons their mothers to attend them one year a most thoroughly respectable lady the late amiable thoroughly pious mrs wadham knatchbull  excellent woman she has now met mr berkeley in a gayer place than a ballroom may those who loved them here strive to join them in the realms of bliss said to the editor madam i have a great favor to request of you  you may command me madam  it is that you will permit me to come to your house next tuesday for one hour i do not wish you to invite me to the ball or the cardparty i know you cannot do it but i hear so much from every body of mr berkeleys wonderfully fine dancing that i do long to see him dance and i never go to any assembly so that i have no chance but your admitting me for one hour i will not stay any longer say what you will i am resolved  the very worthy dr lamb prebendary of worcester became principal of magdalene hall not long after mr berkeleys entering there he happened to be in the hall when dr lamb arrived and most of the other members were absent mr berkeley instantly waited on his new superior and with his usual polite benignity offered his services in every way in which they could be useful the editor recollects to have heard her son say that after certain necessary things performed and dinner ended the new principal asked mr berkeley if they ought not to go to chapel to which mr berkeley replied in the affirmative if they could get a reader and muster a congregation the editor thinks it was either the commencement or the end of the term and that there was only one member in the hall besides mr berkeley who she thinks was the very worthy amiable now reverend mr sloman a beloved respected friend of mr berkeleys who has frequently delighted the editor by saying that he conceived he owed his life to mr berkeley as did many other gentlemen at the same time  a party of gentlemen many of them members of the hall had agreed that on the first fine day they would sail down the river some miles  the editor does not recollect to what place but thinks it was to godstow abbey the party consisted of eleven and mr berkeley ever delighting to give pleasure to young and old begged to take with him a lad son to a lady a relation of his mothers at home for the holydays accordingly on easter monday they set out when they had sailed two or three miles some accident happened to the boat the waterman saw it coming and threw himself out for which mr berkeley always when mentioning it styled him a sad villain adding he left the whole number to perish for he did not know that any of us could swim the boat instantly overset only two of the party could swim mr pearce nephew to the late bishop of rochester and mr monck berkeley being both eton men they were good swimmers and soon escaped to shore when mr pearce humanely said berkeley we must try to save them all let us go in instantly to which mr berkeley replied if we do we are dead men pearce no we must wait till they are more spent or they will infallibly cling so fast that they will sink us this wise advice was followed mr berkeley first rescued his little kinsman as considering himself in some sort responsible for him as a lad of eleven years old of whom he had taken the charge after some little time mr pearce and mr berkeley plunged in and by the blessing of god brought every one safe on shore they sent to oxford for coaches and on their arrival getting rid of their drenched clothes mr berkeley immediately wrote to his mother assuring her that whatever lamentable history the newspaper might happen to make of it by the mercy of god he had still the happiness to be able to subscribe himself her dutiful son etc his attentions to the feelings of his mother for an only son were incessant the editor had from his youth told mr berkeley that if he should be expelled from eton or get his name entered in the black book at oxford she was very sure that she should lie down and die of grief as she and he verily believed she would have done he would frequently through life say if i do so or so i shall kill my mother he is receiving his blessed reward it may perhaps be said by those who were intimate in the family that mrs berkeley was a kind obliging mother the editor bred up by her mother with an aversion to affectation of every sort or kind and instilling the same aversion into her son they never complimented each other by the poor humble now humbled title of mr and mrs berkeley when speaking to each other or of each other or to those who were acquainted with them the editor always telling her son that until his father had stood behind a counter she should never call him any thing but berkeley or monck for were she to live to see him lord chancellor his name would be berkeley if in a large company of friends mr berkeley spoke two or three times to his mother and she did not attend to answer him he used to say well madam if you do not listen to me i protest i will call you mrs berkeley and that i am sure will make you mind me the editors sensible agreeable friend and quondam neighbor admiral sir g y pursues the same plan with his thoroughly worthy lady frequently saying aye she wont mind me i may call nanny till i am hoarse i will say lady y and you will see she will listen to me in a minute  she labored to be such after the time ceased when she was to be held up to mr berkeley in terrorem that is when he grew up to be a fine sensible youth when solomon tells us a word enters more into a wise man than a thousand stripes into a fool a very tight rein in early youth no rein at all after a certain period no influence but what arises from friendship the editor never could conceive that if a young man or young woman chose to live single till thirty years old or till twentyfive or under that god speaking by moses or by st paul meant they should be treated as at thirteen or fourteen the editor has repeatedly observed that irish parents are very apt to suppose that their authority is to continue to the end of life the editor in early youth admired and revered the conduct of that wise worthy lady the duchess of st albans who on her amiable daughter that humblest sweetest of women lady diana barrington first lady of the very amiable bishop barrington completing her twentieth year thus addressed her my dear lady die from this day we cease to be mother and daughter we commence beloved friends when you wish to go into public if i am able i shall be happy to attend you if not you have many friends who will her wise very early wise grace as the editor has frequently heard her mother relate and lady die ever after lived as most affectionate sisters  one of the magdalene hall gentlemen of the party who had escaped being congratulated by the principal some of them said we meant to have gone yesterday but berkeley would not be of the party because it was sunday meaning to divert the principal at mr berkeleys expense that worthy gentleman replied  i honor mr berkeley exceedingly for it i wish all paid the same reverence to the lords day it would be well for them and they will wish it some time hence  the dear excellent bishop of norwich used to say to dr berkeley we all say that mr berkeley is principal of magdalene hall and a very good principal he is dr lambes own good sense makes him admire mr berkeleys good judgment and propriety so much that we all tell him he may do whatever he pleases mr berkeley certainly used this delegated power most respectfully to his excellent governor and wisely at least in one instance at the time of his entering every gentlemancommoners dinner cost him every day three shillings and six pence mr berkeley although generous as a prince was a very good oeconomist he enquired and found that at no other hall or college any thing like that sum was paid he immediately set himself to rectify it made all the necessary proper enquiries then applied to the worthy principal who felt the force of mr berkeleys reasonings and summoned the provider of these costly slices of beef and mutton before him who declared meat not then at the frightful price it is now on holy thursday the  th of may      seven pence per pound the great rich butcher of this place one day sent the editor four pounds of beef steaks off the neck of the ox instead of its rump or rib as ordered by the editor herself walking by his shop the youngest servants in her family when broiled could not make their teeth penetrate them but on paying the bill he would not abate of eight pence per pound this great man is king of the place and once a week makes a pompous feast to all his numerous dependents another butcher attempted setting up but the poor people say ah but muster  would not suffer it most villages have a tyrant it is generally the baking mealman the editor entirely approves of one king in a kingdom but not of petty kings for as a very sensible sille de chamber who waited on her the last time she visited france said  pour moi madame moi jaime detre gouverners par mes superieurs pas par le canaille the editor and mademoiselle therese are quite de meme avis  no wat tyler no jack cade says she  it was quite impossible to furnish the dinners in the hall cheaper without ruining himself mr berkeley being present said  that would be a cruelty which he was sure the gentlemen of the hall would be exceedingly sorry for then turning to the principal he told him that apprehending mr  name forgotten by the editor might object to the reduction he had applied to a person who would be very glad to supply the gentlemen every day with a good dinner at one shilling per head on hearing this the honest provider begged some time to consider of it whether it would be possible for him to do it or not mr berkeley a pretty tolerable accomptant said the calculation would be easily made and requested the worthy principal that it might not be long delayed as notwithstanding his fathers generosity in giving him a large allowance he knew there were several gentlemen who felt the pressure of this heavy daily sconce very inconvenient to them as well as himself the honest man returned at the time appointed to the principals lodging mr berkeley by appointment being present when he said that although he should lose much by it yet as he had served the hall he might have added so well he did not care to give it up and would accept the terms offered for this service every gentleman of the hall acknowledged that they were indebted solely to the wisdom spirit and activity of mr berkeley  all complained aloud but he alone attempted to redress the grievance  the good bishop of norwich then dean of canterbury always coming at the two audits toward the end of june and november dr and mrs berkeley used of course to enquire when their son talked of visiting canterbury to which that facetious witty as well as wise amiable man once replied come hither i dont know that he can come at all  mrs b  not come at all what do you mean my dear mr dean  bp of norwich  why i dont know how magdalene hall could go on without him the good principal loves and admires him more i think than you do he talks more of him however and they have a poor unhappy gentleman this sensible very accomplished gentleman was one of those mentioned as owing the preservation of his life to the great skill of mr satterley after every other surgeon had pronounced his wound incurable he recovered to bless gods great mercy and mr satterleys great skill he died a natural death a few months ago the editor found amongst her sons papers a most charming letter of this gentlemans to his kind friend mr berkeley there who is more than a little deranged at times and nobody can do any thing at all with him as a gentleman of the hall told me some time ago but mr berkeley  he has a method of his own of soothing and quieting him and persuading him to do just as he wishes to the no small comfort of the hall  this accomplished gentleman of an ancient family had very nearly run through a large fortune in dissipation and alas vice he felt too pungently his then situation and contrasting it with what it might but for his own fault have been and the having involved in misery a very worthy lady it frequently dethroned his reason  the editor when listening to the melancholy accounts sometimes related to her by her compassionate son of this gentleman has thought of what the wits of that day said of the bishop of peterboroughs the very learned dr white kennet grandfather of the reverend john and thomas newman both residing on their respective livings in essex and of her excellent kind unwearied friend white newman esquire of newgate street the editor wishes it were possible for her to do justice to the gratitude she feels for the incessant unwearied assistance she receives from that thoroughly worthy friend and his two obliging amiable sons messrs white and thomas newman the very grateful father of mr newman knowing that his fatherinlaw the bishop owed all his preferment to mr cherry and feeling himself under personal obligations to that excellent man from their youth charged his sons as they valued a fathers blessing never to omit any opportunity that presented itself of rendering every possible service in their power to the descendants of mr cherry the editor has frequent occasion to tell her amiable friends in newgate street that they are resolved to ensure their father and grandfathers blessing were the editor a duchess instead of a poor disconsolate widow or their sister or mother the attentions of the whole family could not be more polite amiable unremitting for which that god may reward them here and hereafter prays daily earnestly their obliged grateful friend it was formerly an invariable rule with all the bishops to deal with mr newmans father  lesprit de corpse funeral sermon on the duke of devonshire that a man of sense could repent more in half an hour than a fool could in seven years in that sermon the bishop says that the sensations of a man of superior understanding on seeing the error of his ways would be so much more pungently felt that it is an evil and bitter thing to depart from the lord than one of less naturally strong less refined understanding could possibly do  some of mr berkeleys intimate friends used to say he knew how to manage every person of every description a very intimate beloved and respected friend of mr berkeley a very brilliant genius whose elegy on the death of dr johnson was universally allowed by all the great judges of poetry to be superior to any published on that occasion  this gentleman apt sometimes to be hipped had been some time a close prisoner in his chambers declaring to all his friends that he was extremely ill and in a very bad way on mr berkeleys arrival in town every common friend began lamenting the unpleasant situation of mr  mr berkeley replied i suppose he is really very ill  no he ails nothing at all  oh very well then i will cure him i promise you in a few minutes off set mr berkeley from harcourt buildings to the kings bench walks on entering the usual enquiries of health being made a numerous list of ideal maladies were mentioned mr berkeley assuming a very solemn countenance said my dear friend i am exceedingly grieved to find you so very ill to be sure you have sent for a lawyer and made your will as i know you do not mean your heir at law should enjoy your fine estate   made my will my dear berkeley what do you mean made my will why then you really think me very ill  to be sure i do very dangerously ill  god bless my soul i am not ill  let you and i go to the opera directly up he sprang rang his bell told his servant that he must dress that minute for that he was going with mr berkeley to the opera accordingly mr berkeley escorted him thither in triumph to the great joy and no small diversion of his numerous friends for he is exceedingly amiable the next day in the hall mr berkeley was complimented on his skill as a physician another very ludicrous anecdote of mr berkeleys extricating the same friend from a disagreeable situation some time after this might be related it is certain that mr berkeley after he grew up a man never undertook the management of any difficult affair that he did not accomplish it to the satisfaction of all the parties concerned not long after mr monck berkeleys arrival at st andrews he went one afternoon to the shop of the to st andrews students wellknown mungo dick to his no small surprise it was shut up he knocked repeatedly at length a neighbor appeared and mr berkeley enquired whether mungo was broke and runaway  no sir he has locked himself in he is bating his gewd weef  a villian how dare he lock the door  he must sir or the neighbors would see it mr monck berkeley used to be diverted by his mothers saying she would have an irish lover an english husband and a scotch cousin the irishmen of high fashion are exquisitely elegantly polite which is mighty pleasing during courtship the english in general if their wives comport themselves as they ought to do when under the yoke the irrecoverable words uttered at the altar in general good kind husbands with a little humouring and a little winking at the editor often says to suppose that our grandfires were all angels on earth is a folly too great to be believed for a moment they were probably the best of them sometimes fractious sometimes drank too much and sometimes played them false as in these days but here lies the difference our grandmothers in their affliction applied for consolation and direction to some reverend pious aged divine who poured balm into their poor fretted spirits from gods word applied by their wisdom in our times it is the fashion to apply to a smart captain of the guards or to some silly ignorant young peer it were surely wise to try the old doctor one scotch cousin is worth fifty english ones as we see every day dr berkeley was very urgent with the late lord camden to obtain an appointment for a scotchman for whom he had the goodness to be interested lord camden very politely and honestly flatly refused it in the following words i should rejoice to pay attention to dr berkeley and for any englishman i will do it but i have many years ago sworn that i never will introduce a scotchman into any office for if you introduce one he will contrive some way or other to introduce forty more cousins or friends would james the first have acted by a scot as good queen mary and queen anne did by a very worthy relation of theirs a mr holden who was many years clerk to old mr cherry the counselor he always dined at the second table died at shottesbrooke house and lies interred in the church queen anne allowed his aged mother twenty pounds per annum and she went to court once in the year in her new gray gown she was a widow and her majesty always spoke kindly to her and called her cousin holden the queen was not a scot   to be sure they would and prevent it a rascal to beat a woman  aye sir so men always lock their doors that nobody may ever say they have seen them do it mr berkeley called aloud and vowed vengeance if he did not leave off beating her mr berkeley went the next day and gave him such a lecture as prevented his chastizing her again during mr berkeleys sejour at st andrews on the editors asking her son if he thought he would mind what such a youth as he could say mr berkeley replied very seriously i hope he will for i made him heartily ashamed of himself  at the age of nineteen mr berkeley had the honor of being elected a corresponding member of the society of antiquaries in edinburgh in consequence of a very accurate sensible account transmitted to that society of a curious quarry of marble discovered some years ago in the heart of the highlands it had some curious particularities but of what nature they were the editor does not recollect probably they were not understood by her although so excellently investigated and described by her son she however means to present that society with a valuable antique in her sons collection  mr berkeley was a member of the royal archers and during the war in      a number of scotch gentlemen of rank and fashion formed themselves into a corpse the editor thinks they were styled the royal edinburgh volunteers mr berkeley accepted a commission they were summoned once if not more to assist in quelling a riot the mob being employed in demolishing some mills when flour was little more than half its present price this occasioned a gentlemans asking mr berkeley if he had thoughts of going into the army on which he replied no sir i am much indebted to the wisdom of my father who would not suffer me to enter on a military or naval life when i was a boy leaving eton there is but one thing now that can ever make a military man of me his majestys erecting his standard when i should feel it my bounden duty to repair to repair to it  mr berkeley in the year      visited the accidentally native country bp berkeleys father was as well as all his ancestors born in england his grandfather as before mentioned expended a large fortune in the service of king charles the first and in remitting money to king charles the second and his brothers the only return was making his son the bishops father collector of the port of  in ireland a more respectable post than in england noblemens sons often accepting it this occasioned the old gentlemans leaving his malediction on any descendant of his who should ever in any way assist any monarch of his renowned grandfather the attentions mr berkeley received in that kingdom from all ranks and degrees must have been exceedingly flattering to any man less humble than mr berkeley who in a letter to his mother speaks thus i am indebted to my grandfather for this honor the provost and fellows of dublin college did him the honor of conferring on him the degree of llb an honor never before conferred on so young a man not educated in that university of which great favor mr berkeley and his parents ever retained a most grateful sense the survivor means to show her sense of it in something more solid than words  i have little merit of my own but i am the grandson of bishop erkeley the representative of archbishop usher bp berkeley was nephew to archbishop usher as was his cousingerman general wolf mr monck berkeley when a very little child one day flew up stairs to his aunt burst into her room crying oh madam miss frinsham if you will have the goodness to lend me a shilling here is a man below with a box at his back that says he will show me the death of my own poor dear cousin cardinal wolsey killed at quebec fighting for this country  when the fit of laughter brought on by this philippic ceased the purse was produced and the little man flew off in extacies  i hope i feel as i ought the honor conferred upon me and trust that although i cannot equal i shall never disgrace my famous ancestors  that mr berkeley should meet with much attention in the hospitable polite kingdom of ireland celebrated as well as her sister kingdom for pleasing conduct to strangers is not to be much wondered at his father having the honor to be related to many of the noblesse of ireland his gratitude was great for the thoroughly amiable polite attentions of the excellent marquis and marchioness of waterford his parents felt it as it merited the survivor still feels it as she does the very worthy lord john beresfords amiability for so condescendingly interesting himself in her intricate affairs in ireland she must ever retain the most grateful sense of the exquisitely polite condescension of the excellent lady isabella monck the highly respected mother of the marchioness ever since she had the honor of being connected with her ladyship by her union with dr berkeley that excellent lady once taking leave of the editor on her quitting england spoke as follows as i fear madam that there is little chance of my ever having it in my power to pay you the respect that i wish to do in ireland and that your very great attention to all dr berkeleys relations i am sure demands i beg that if ever you have any relation or friend that visits dublin you will be pleased to let me know that i may at least have the pleasure of paying them the attentions that i should be happy to pay you there  the editor trusts that she felt this amiable conduct as it merited she availed herself of this goodness but once it is not to be supposed that she would introduce every country gentlemans daughter of her acquaintance who being smitten with a red coat followed the camp to ireland when the sensible elegant miss doyley daughter of the late sir thomas doyley married dr newcombe then bishop of ossory the editor wrote to her ladyship requesting permission to introduce mrs newcombe who added to her great personal merits was descended from one of the most ancient families in england on mrs newcombes arrival in dublin to the amazement of all the ton world of dublin her ladyship visiting very few persons but of her own family and connections and making no new acquaintances at all of any rank she immediately honored mrs newcombe with a visit the sensible lady of the learned bishop of ossory soon learned enough of dublin to know that to be visited by lady bell monck was a greater honor than to be visited by the viceroys lady a rarer honor than to be visited by the lady she represents   the editor had the pleasure of adding much so much that mrs berkeley almost dreaded to see any of their common friends they being reiteratedly charged to repeat and rerepeat good lady doyleys most grateful acknowledgments to the happiness of that excellent incomparable woman the late lady doyley whose whole life from the age of seventeen when she married the worthy sir thomas doyley was one continued uninterrupted journey in the path of duty on miss doyleys marrying into another kingdom she said to an intimate friend of hers and the editors i have never lived for myself at all since i was seventeen years old the time of her marriage  she lived alas to lose the only child she ever had  the editor visiting her not long before her death found her as ever resigned and cheerful much wishing mrs berkeley to see what she wished a strong resemblance between her fine little granddaughter about seven years old and her departed mother there certainly was a resemblance miss newcombe was handsomer than her elegant mother this young lady is lately married in ireland and it is said means to prove her claim to what the editor has always heard from her youth that her mother of course herself had an undoubted right to after the death of her two uncles sir john and sir william both dead childless  the barony of hook norton in oxfordshire as the late lord dacre used to say a clergyman on a small living in the vale of berkshire whose name the editor does not recollect had to that of berners how much wiser are the scots in many instances than the english every almanac has the list of dormant titles with this wise addition the representative of this family is   surely this is very wise for an ancient hereditary title is certainly no unpleasant thing for any family to possess however nabobs slavemerchants and upstarts may affect to deride it in words for in actions they do not being very fond of uniting their plebeian blood with noble the editor will not say as sir   said on a match made some time ago oh he has i find taken a rag of quality  the excellent lady doyley took great pains to make a very happy match for her eldest brother a very worthy gentleman of large fortune in the west of england with a very sensible most highly accomplished young lady without any fortune this noble disinterested lady lived to see the lovely the only offspring of that marriage the first lady of  cresswell esquire member of parliament for cirencester left an orphan by the death of both parents before she was two years old a beloved friend of the editor grow up adorned with every thing that could render an uncommonly fine wonderfully strong understanding cultivated to the height by her maternal aunt her more than mother  she had in fact been a more than mother to her halfsister the young ladys mother ten years younger than herself  the excellent mrs woodford who died in april      in very advanced age at the seat of her other niece the amiable worthy lady guise at highnam court in gloucestershire full of days and full of piety the editor laments that it is not in the power of her feeble pen to do justice to the very rare merits of this wonderfully wise accomplished excellent friend nor to her own great gratitude to her and to god for having put it into the heart of this excellent lady to attach herself to the editor fifteen years younger than herself when a girl of ten years old she had however then sense enough to listen to the wise advice of this extraordinary lady as to an oracle of wisdom and prudence and continued to do so until she bade her adieu for the last time in      at highnam court trusting to meet again when the editor hopes to be as wise as her ever respected beloved friend her powers with regard to the education of young women were so highly esteemed by the editor that she had conjured dr berkeley to promise her that should she die leaving a young daughter her highly respected friend mrs woodford might have the direction of her education rather than her own excellent sister whose exquisite compassion for a motherless child would have caused her to humor such an one in every thing she wished and have so ensured a miserable life a melancholy death for her the editor is to this day sometimes reproached by her too tenderhearted sister of not having sufficiently humoured her children she always delighted to gratify them in every thing proper and not injurious ever wishing to make her dog and cats happy another female friend used to accuse the editor of not treating her children like rational creatures her word being a law without assigning to them any reason why they were to go or not to go  to stay or not to stay etc to which the editors reply was are children of three to thirteen years old rational creatures that they have reason often fine strong reason  but that does not imply that they are always rational creatures  vide half the grown up children that one sees in the world she has however the delight of having both her children bear testimony to her wisdom in that instance her eldest particularly as has been mentioned elsewhere in this preface the editors horrors of deceit and cunning made her always resolve that if ever she was blessed with children they should not be taught to tell lies as children are when bid to say  they do not know which they love best papa or mamma unless they are fools they must and do very early know and the editor always ordered them to tell the truth boldly the youngest almost adored his dear father who never contradicted him but humoured him as much as might be without destroying the authority of the mother over the sons as speaks the scripture which says god has confirmed the authority etc he loved his mother exceedingly one evening coming in from play he sprung into her lap threw his arms round her neck and began caressing her she said robert tell me whom you love best in the world why you  stop mamma as a child whilst one is a child it is natural to love those best that humor one and spoil one a little so i love papa best but if i should live to be a man i shall then love you a vast deal the best for having never humoured me or spoiled me at all this is set down verbatim as if delivered upon oath   last year a very short time before the death of this revered friend the editor had the real pleasure to become acquainted under the thoroughly hospitable roof of her very excellent amiable kind old friends the very learned sensible recorder of canterbury and his sensible worthy lady with the amiable very highly cultivated and accomplished miss gld neice of mrs robinson to whom the editor has been much indebted for introducing her to the knowledge of a very worthy man who has been of great service to her in some of her difficult unpleasant busineses this young lady one day asked mrs berkeley if she was not acquainted with mrs woodford the editor replied that she had that felicity very early in life and esteemed it one of the numberless gracious vouchsafements of providence having owed to that dear friends wise pious advice that together with many other things she had frequently escaped the most unpleasing of all reproach selfreproach by having early in life left entirely to the allwise disposer of events every concern of real importance never to pray or wish anxiously that events might turn out to ones own wish this excellent lady would frequently say behold me a monument of the folly of anxiously wishing praying for any thing of presuming to carve for ourselves i besought god at different times when young to vouchsafe to grant me three requests all were granted  and they have every one brought on me such distress as i hope all my young friends taking warning by me may escape perhaps the greatest fortune in england never had more lovers more offers of marriage than this excellent lady the editor knew some of the gentlemen wise enough to persevere very long but all in vain the lady of the late mr granger of shiplake author of the biographical history the editor has heard her mother say it was supposed for very many years of her life she never passed a whole month without receiving an offer of marriage she was an exquisite beauty not so dear mrs woodford hers were chiefly mental charms   miss gld by some accidental meeting had the happiness such she professed to esteem it to become acquainted with mrs woodford late in her journey toward the realms of bliss her wonderful powers of mind appeared as strong as ever the last time the editor saw her but her earthly tabernacle was debilitated most lamentably indeed for the present adieu thou beloved thou revered thou excellent friend may at least one bright jewel be added to thy crown of glory for the benefits received from thee by thy thoroughly grateful affectionate friend etc eliza berkeley  on dean swifts introducing mr afterward bp berkeley to the then earl of berkeley it was in this singular way my lord here is a fine young gentleman of your family i can assure your lordship it is a much greater honor to you to be related to him than it is to him to be related to you the earl of berkeley was then lord high admiral of england the last nobleman who had that honor which some of his descendants pleaded as the cause of their great pride  some of the uncommonly sensible grandsons of the honorable colonel berkeley a person whose name was not originally berkeley one day talking to one of the most amiable of those brothers said my dear c what is the cause that you berkeleys are so diabolically proud is it because for its great antiquity no noble family in england has had quite so many hts and sls in it  no my dear madam no it is because we are so horridly poor we are afraid of being trampled upon  never fear that my dear c no man of so ancient so noble a family as yours has cause for such apprehension from persons of sense if it is not his own fault st paul speaking by the holy spirit to timothy says  let no man despise thee it is therefore absolutely in our own power to prevent our being despised it is one thing to dislike to hate and another to despise the inspired writer therefore does not say let no man hate thee or persecute but let no man despise thee is a command given from an aged to a young bishop there are countries where perhaps the younger prelates might so admonish the elders to their profit to the admonisher of mr c berkeley when saying that no persons of sense would despise him etc might had he known it have retorted the famous dr rocks answer to sir edward holse physician to his late majesty who driving one day down the strand was stopped by the mob listening to the oratory of dr rock in his gaudy equipage seeing sir edward hulse look out at his chariot window he instantly took a quantity of boxes and vials gave them to one of his belaced lacqueys saying give my compliments to sir edward tell him these are all i have with me but i will send him ten dozen more tomorrow sir edward astonished at the message and effrontery of the man actually took them into his chariot on which the mob with one consent all cried out see see all the doctors even the kings buy their medicines of him in their youth they had somewhere been fellow students rock not succeeding in a regular way metamorphosed himself into a quack in the afternoon he waited on sir edward to beg his pardon for having played him such a trick to which sir edward replied my old friend how can a man of your understanding condescend to harangue the populace with such nonsense as you talked today why none but fools listen to you  ah my good friend that is the very thing do you give me the fools for my patients and you shall have my free leave to keep the people of sense for your own this anecdote of these two different doctors was related to the editor by a medical friend of great eminence who had often heard sir edward hulse relate it to divert his friends adding i never felt so like a fool in my life as when i received the bottles and boxes from rock  mr berkeley felt himself much indebted for numberless polite amiable attentions from lord durraghmore for which he was probably indebted entirely to his own personal merit and the great good sense of that young nobleman to whom should he chance to read this it may not perhaps be unpleasant to observe what mr berkeleys father once said to the editor on her saying how very lucky berkeley is in becoming acquainted with so many learned men so much his superiors in years and knowledge  lucky to be sure he is lucky if you call it so in having an understanding that must make him admired by those who have very superior understandings themselves that is the luck of it they did not perhaps as mr berkeley who having dined out in a large company at his return asked his mother if she was acquainted with a young baronet whom he named she replied yes that she had known his mother very well  mr b   i am resolved to become acquainted with him  mrs b  why  mr b  because two of the most empty foxhunting coxcombs i ever met with have been laughing at and abusing him to the company all the afternoon so i conclude he is a man of sense and worth  mr berkeley also felt himself much obliged as the editor does by the very polite friendly attentions of his fathers honorable relation sackville hamilton esquire of dublin castle he felt himself flattered by the attentions of the learned reverend william hamilton bd who presented to him his very curious entertaining work printed during mr berkeleys residence in ireland in his return from ireland by the way of scotland he made some little stay with his amiable old intimate friend sir william morres at his seat in the county of  name forgotten he could not contrive to reach the house of his learned friend mr tailor of noan several translations from the greek poets of this gentlemans were published when he was about nineteen  in a letter to his father whilst in ireland he says my grandfather and swift are still remembered with gratitude in this kingdom by some their memory is venerated as they merited  mr berkeley having been always told by his father that dean swift was the introducer of his grandfather when he came young into england to the learned and the great occasioned his from a boy being a great admirer of that wonderful man and his so zealously laboring to vindicate his fame in the preface to his literary relics from some horridly false aspersions and palliating his sad conduct to stella and vanessa unless it is allowed what the editor herself firmly believes from what she learned from dr berkeleys very old beloved friend dean delany  that both dean swift and mrs johnson were actually the children of sir william temple and the heavy tidings arrived not until the day on which the indissoluble knot was tied surely a spiritual court ought to have power to set such unfortunate persons at liberty some years ago the eldest son of a gentleman of great estate was exceedingly in love with an heiress of large fortune the father threw cold water on it  the old gentleman persisted in refusing to give his consent  at length violently urged by his son to find an objection to an accomplished beautiful rich heiress he replied you dd fool the world is wide enough for you to find a wife without marrying your own sister that young lady is my daughter therefore give up all thoughts of her he did so and married another lady the beloved object for ever gone miss  married the first man of large fortune that her parents recommended to her but the loss of her first accomplished lover gave an unfortunate shock to her fine understanding she early in life became a widow the last time the editor saw her there appeared a sort of melancholy restlessness that could not fail to distress every feeling heart that knew the cause this lady had every thing this world could furnish to produce happiness two fine children a son and daughter both magnificently provided for but she had not the society of the only man on earth whom she could love she saw him happy with another had she learned to feel as well as say thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven it had been happy for her had she humbly patiently submitted instead of sadly murmuring and sadly cavilling as she used alas to do at some parts of scripture but what piety was it likely should be instilled into her mind by her direfully adulterous mother who was not suspected until this affair of the match  mr berkeley was not in england when that book was published but a copy by his order to his bookseller was sent to every member of his family on his arrival in england he immediately paid his duty at his fathers and after dinner one day said to his mother that he hoped she had received the literary relics which he had ordered to be sent to her before they were published  she replied that she was much obliged by his attention  mr b  have you read them my dear madam  mrs b  to be sure i have my dear child  mr b  well and what do you think of my account of swift  mrs berkeley with what her son used to term one of my mothers wicked looks replied my dear son it has determined me if ever i should have a desperately bad cause to plead to retain you for my prime counsel  to which mr berkeley in a sweet melancholy voice replied ah my dear mother dont say so i have not defended his wrong conduct i have only said all that my conscience would suffer me to say in extenuation of it you know his kindness to my grandfather in his youth when he came first to england it grieves me that you say that i should be your prime counsel  mr berkeley showed his gratitude in another instance to dean swift during his short sejour in dublin he discovered that the old servant mr richard brinan in whose arms dean swift expired was poor as well as aged he relieved him and ordered his fathers agent to pay him a small sum every month to lighten the unavoidable sufferings of old age which needs not the aid of poverty to render it unpleasant dr berkeley continued this annuity as does the editor at least she trusts that the poor man receives it as she sees it constantly in her accounts she hopes for his sake it is not as difficult to get a small sum paid in ireland as it is to get any sum out of it  it has perhaps been before mentioned that mr berkeley resembled his unworthy mother in never forgetting a favor received and his lovely self in never remembering an injury done to himself any done to his father he would not pardon as too plainly appeared in his siege of rhodes which the editor never saw until it was printed or she had certainly made it a point with her obedient son as in another instance where only themselves were concerned not many months before his death saying here i stand my dear madam ready to obey whatever you shall be pleased to command the  of  had certainly treated dr berkeley like a  and mr berkeley ever now and then threatened him dr berkeley used to say the man that can act as he has done is beneath your notice do not soil your paper with such a  mrs berkeley begged him off on account of his worthy family with whom in her youth she had been acquainted mr berkeley used to say no man shall maltreat my father whilst i can hold a pen any more than asperse my mothers fame whilst i wear a sword mr berkeley used laughingly to tell a very intimate friend of his you are so apt to boast of being will with the ladies of all ages and all descriptions that i am sure the only thing that prevents your hinting that my mother is partial to you is that you know i would run you through the body immediately had mr berkeley lived to read the grateful mention of his father in the curious life of bishop horn he had certainly resented it as it merits to be resented dr berkeley was a too generous friend to numbers whose present pride and covetousness has quite obliterated from their minds the poverty from which the amiable generosity of dr berkeley long since rescued them he is gone to receive his reward they must in due time follow to receive theirs  it has been mentioned that mr berkeley in his first nove the generous rustic has shown his love and gratitude to the french friends of his early youth in his second the spanish memoirs many of the characters are the real ones of english and scotch friends and acquaintance in that of father alberto the reader is made acquainted with the very sensible highly accomplished wonderfully entertaining polite pious bishop geddes who had spent many years as a bishop in new spain and has often delighted the editor when visiting at dr berkeleys with accounts of the wonderfully affectionate respectful attachment the amiable peruvians still retain for their inca and his royal progeny supplying him with fish venison game etc and the stratagems the spaniards were obliged to employ to convey the then inca from new to old spain where he is a grandee his two sons hold considerable rank in the king of spains guards they are fine young men although one draws a sigh over their reversed fortune they are perhaps happier to guard than to be guarded the editor has often listened with delight to accounts of conversations related to have passed between the inca and himself tete a tete in old spain al hough the inca is not a man of very shining abilities perhaps for politic reasons very little cultivated he was not dead to what he was nor to what he ought to have been  this excellently wise mild prelate by the great wisdom of the then pontiff replaced the flaming popish bishop who presided over the roman catholics of edinburgh when the zeal of john knoxs disciples burned down the chapel to the great distress of the amiable liberal dr robertson the worthy witty dr webster father of the excellent colonel webster the agreeable dr carlyle and many other worthy scottish ministers of edinburgh on that occasion the zealots of the party exhibited a caricature print of which the editor has a copy of dr johnsons beloved  willy robertson with the triple crown on his head a label etc etc may that sensible agreeable head be now more suitably crowned  mr berkeleys superiority of understanding led him to feel great gratitude for bishop goddess devoting so much of his time to mr berkeley when in edinburgh in vacation time he felt that it was condescension in a very learned man of between fifty and sixty to say to a youth of nineteen whenever you please sir visit me at all times i shall be most happy to see you to give you any information you may wish that i am capable of affording the editor is aware that persons may say oh that was to make a papist of him mr berkeley was early in life made by his mother to read most of what has been well written pro and con in that controversy between the church of england and the church of rome at before ninetten mr berkeley was a zealous protestant not because his grandmother was one  to be sure he had like timothy from a child known the scriptures which poor oldfashioned st paul thought and said were able to make him wise unto salvation  see st pauls third epistle to timothy chap iii verse     bishop geddes very soon discovered before he had ever seen mr berkeley only an anonymous piece of his without the least clue to find out the writer  this is written by a very uncommon genius indeed be he whom he may  the duke darundina mr berkeley told the editor was the late earl of  whom mr berkeley never forgave for turning his own unfortunate nephew his brothers son from his door the amiable miss  daughter of lord  told mr monck berkeley that the poor unfortunate young gentlemans father was at lord s when his only son was chased from the door the editor hopes that the young lady had been misinformed as he was an highly respected friend of dr berkeley and the editor alas alas that parents would consider in their anger against their perhaps illeducated offspring how will this action appear to me when i come to lie on my deathbed god himself says oh that they were wise that they would consider their latter end  but most so far from considering it banish it from their mind lest it should make them melancholy this illfated young gentleman reached a wretched alehouse in northumberland and there ended his miserable mortal pilgrimage there is a day coming ere long when the editor thinks she would of the two rather choose to be the poor very weak shatterbrained nephew than the sensible solemn pompous uncle who is well characterized in the person of the spanish don duke oh that parents and near relatives whom god has blessed with understanding had some compassion on those to whom he has not been so gracious and consider that there are very many who want guardians through life and the father and mother of a shatterbrained man or simple daughter should look out for a proper guardian in a wise husband or wife like the late mrs  of   who soon after the death of her excellent husband said to her very uncommonly sensible daughter a very old friend of the editor we must now cast our thoughts about for some very sensible young lady of small fortune who will take your brother or else before we have left   six weeks either the cook or the dairy maid whichever has most cunning will marry him the plan was pursued he lived some years a very happy respectable life with one of the sensible daughters of the worthy sir   bart his son does not squander the six thousand pounds per annum which the wisdom of his grandmother esteemed a stingy woman because she paid her bills regularly rescued from molly dairy and entrusted to the wise management of miss    the unfortunate young man driven from the door was once very desirous to have married the daughter of a clergyman a dignitary of the church of  well educated but no great fortune the joy of his mother on its being prevented was so great as to occasion dr berkeleys calling her fool and saying she would live to repent it it is hoped she did for she must meet her injured son at the last great day  mention has been made before of mr berkeleys being sent when he was little more than six years old to town to get a tooth inspected by that very honest dentist the late mr hemmet who happened to be out of town the amiable friend who took the charge of him said well we will go to mr beardmore or some other eminent man to which mr berkeley replied no sir if you please i will go to no other for i heard my mamma tell you that hemmet was the best and i am sure she knows and i will go to him this occasioned his being detained a few days longer in town and his wise kind host fearing that a child who lived all day in the open air might suffer in town sent him every day to walk in the park with his own worthy careful valet de chamber this man happening to be intimate with the gentleman of the late excellent lord berkeley of stratton one day in returning from the park called in berkeley square with mr berkeley in his hand who of course went into the stewards or housekeepers room where his sweetly engaging manners soon so won the hearts of all present that they asked his kind guardian permission to lead him up to show him to lord berkeley and the excellent mrs anne egerton he was introduced as the little grandson of the great bishop berkeley his noble relation was charmed with the great good sense and propriety of the little man and after he had been there a short time his sensible guardian telling him it was time to go home he rose made a very graceful bow dr berkeley followed the example of his learned father who from the time that his sons put on the habits of men used after dinner to make them practice over and over coming in and going out of a room gracefully saying every man and woman you see is a judge of those things therefore learn to do it like gentlemen dr berkeley and his son were both very apt scholars and it has been repeatedly remarked to the editor how very gracefully both dr and mr berkeley came into a room as if they had both learned of the same dancing master they had in fact learnt of the same master the learned prelate who was remarkably attentive to the minutiae with his sons as well as to their latin greek and letterwriting always saying learn to write letters properly on all occasions many people may hear your letters read that will never hear you speak viva voce when dr berkeley was a boy about eight years old he worried his father to let him go out with him to some visitation for three or four days the good prelate not understanding with all his learning the management of boys as well as his grandsons mother and having no mind his little boy should accompany him said well if in these two days you can make me eight latin verses the editor thinks it was you shall go with me  be it what it might the prelate knew or thought he knew that the poor child could not do it dr berkeley has often told the editor that it was what he had never done had never been taught to do but wild to go this journey he set his astonishingly quick wits to work and produced the eight lines or verses in due time on his presenting them the bishop exclaimed well george you have been too many for me i did not think it possible you could have done it but as you have done it i must keep my word and so you must go the editor used to tell dr berkeley that  she was angry with the bishop for being such an egyptian taskmaster to a poor little creature for no mortal in the house could assist him but his father why could he not have at once taken the beautiful little creature or told him that he  must not go dr berkeley was esteemed the most elegant writer of latin of any of his contemporaries at the university as the editor has repeatedly heard messrs hamilton whitaker bishop horn say some excellent aged scholar name not recollected said to every one that dr berkeleys latin speech when he was collector was the best he had ever heard during his twenty years residence at the university to the lady and then to my lord who untying his purse was presenting him with five guineas to buy him a fine horse saddle etc at the toyshop mr berkeley having told him that he had a live horse at cookham his worthy guardian stepped up saying i must beg your lordship to excuse master berkeley he must not take it his mamma never suffers him to take a guinea or a sixpence from my master when staying there for months not even from his grandmother or his aunt telling him how shamefully mean it is to accept money from any one but his own parents when they are at hand this injunction was withdrawn when mr berkeley went to eton near an hundred miles from his fathers house that then if any old friend of his family called and tipped him a guinea or two he might accept it as his father and mother had often tipped the sons of their friends he then declined it telling his mother i dont like it somehow not having been used to it and john hayes his amiable relation is a goodnatured fellow and will always lend me a guinea whenever i ask him till i see my father or john a gentleman once expressed his astonishment to dr berkeley that calling at eton to see mr berkeley he could not persuade him to accept money  mrs berkeley having always a dread of her childrens being led to practice any meanness of any kind never suffered either of them to receive any sum small or great from any one but dr berkeley or herself from either parent they were at full liberty to receive as much as ever their eloquence could extract the editor from early youth always declared however well she might like a smart cap or elegant gown that she would much rather wear an old gown and a rusty cloak as she does at present than not pay the butcher baker etc every monday morning the doing that in these blessed times of plenty is hardly sufficient and such is the shameful selfish covetousness of most english traders in that class that they make those pay to the full as much for their commodities who pay every seventh day as those who do or do not pay after seven years credit in scotland the traders although in general the rudest in the world excepting the dutch if you pay ready money twenty pounds or thirty pence they always throw you back a considerable discount as did always the late mr goodchild the great linendraper at charing cross the editor when buying at st andrews even a common chequered apron for a pure auld gewd weef value half a crown has repeatedly had three halfpenny worth of white silk nicely folded in paper presented to her by the very worthy really respectable dean of guild kaye the first shop in st andrews saying be pleased madam to take your discount i will not burden you with halfpence he had been long enough in england to learn the civility of our traders not long enough to learn their cunning of making those who do pay pay for those who do not whilst dr berkeleys family was at st andrews they were told by several of their neighbors that a certain earl who has a mansion near perth one day walked in and purchased half a guineas worth of tea and sugar laid down the money on the counter which the grocer took and put into the till the earl asked  where is my discount   oh my lord i thought your lordship had lived so much in england that you would not take it  not take it i have not lived long enough in england to learn their foolish customs this nobleman is remarkable for a strong understanding was educated at westminster and christ church college oxford and being a most able speaker in the house would do the honest part of english gentry and traders an essential service if he could introduce this wise scottish custom south of the tweed the editor has one scottish friend who resides much in england who constantly when he purchases any thing puts the cash or notes in a paper writes on it what it is to pay and constantly keeps it in his desk twelve months because the english traders will not allow him discount saying that they are a set of rascals for not doing it  after mr berkeley grew up some one speaking highly and justly as he deserved of lord berkeley of stratton mr monck berkeley said i am sure he was a goodnatured man he would once have made me the happiest of mortals but for my mother  how so mr berkeley then mentioned what has been related above  on which mrs berkeley said bless me my dear child do you remember that  mr b   remember it my dear madam why i never felt such happiness before nor ever expect it again on earth as the half minute that the five guineas were chinking in my paw until mr  the name of mr johnsons valet forgotten told me that i must give them back to my lord for that you never suffered me etc as before mentioned i had in idea purchased half the globe with those five guineas lord berkeley said i was the grandson of a great good man lord berkeley of stratton and bishop berkeley were extremely intimate in their youth doctor berkeley had vast numbers of lord berkeleys letters to his father a very unhappy event in lord berkeleys life when a young man occasioned all his own relations breaking all intercourse all connection with him whilst wonderful to relate those of his unfortunate illfated lady pardoned it one of her near relations resided entirely with him for many years before his death the very worthy mrs a egerton to whom he showed his gratitude at his death this lady resided some years at frogmorehouse where mr monck berkeley whilst an etonian and his very wonderfully sensible clever acute friend mr kirk nephew of colonel egertons lady always found a most cordial reception of which mr berkeley often spoke with gratitude lord berkeleys life very many years before his death had been not only exemplary but exaltedly pious the editor will take leave to relate an anecdote of his lordship and the princess amelia mrs berkeley happening to be staying at lambeth palace when archbishop secker related it to the late amiable bishop trevor of durham it made so deep an impression that she can set it down verbatim  bishop of durham i cannot conceive what is come to princess emely lately people dont usually grow better tempered as they grow old but from having been all her life the     the blanks must be filled up by those who read she is become so humble so affable so condescending so kind and charitable her royal highness used frequently to send dr berkeley ten guineas with a request that he would distribute it as he thought best amongst the poor of his parish of acton that it delights one to hear it every body wonders but nobody can tell what has caused this astonishing change every one at the table professed themselves glad and contrasted it with her royal highnesss conduct when ranger of richmond park and the odious styles erected to deter persons from crossing it the archbishop in his usual deliberate manner and in his wonted deliberate tone of voice said i can inform your lordship what it is that has wrought this wonderful this very happy change in her royal highnesss manners and conduct you know that my lord berkeley of stratton is always one of her royal highnesss select party  one day she told him she found that she grew old and she wished his lordship would recommend some good book to her to read to make her better his lordship bowed and said he would endeavor to find one to suit her royal highness according the next time he went to gunnersbury house he took a large folio in his coach and carrying it in under his arm presented it to her royal highness saying that he had obeyed her royal highnesss commands and had brought her a book that he hoped and believed she would like her royal highness did like it has read it and studied it and that my good lord is the cause of this happy change in her royal highness that every body is so wondering at the princess soon fell in love with the prelate which may many that are neither princesses nor peeresses do who may chance on running their eye over this preface to read and study that divine writer the delight of the editors spirit that true church of england prelate is ardently wished by the writer of these poor pageswho if she is the humble instrument in the hand of providence of consoling one poor humble contrite penitent male or female or benefiting one soul is content to be derided as an old fool  a most monstrous ridiculous creature the editor inserts female as they never were formerly forgiven by the world although now we see some much caressed seldom think of applying to him who forgives and upbraids not  but that delighted me not like the guineas chinking in my hand  mr berkeley as well as his parents had a most affectionate regard for his eminently worthy agreeable respectable and it may with the strictest truth be asserted universally respected relation major james berkeley one of the grandsons of the honorable colonel berkeley whom on his dreary journey from dover to cheltenham he was sadly disappointed at not finding at rochester he being then in barracks at chatham now alas abroad in a situation of great danger may god in mercy spare that best of sons and brothers to his worthy mother elegant sister and to his idolizing beautiful accomplished lady may their son if he lives to grow up be if an officer as wise and worthy as his father and as valiant as his mothers illustrious ancestor  valiant john talbot mrs james berkeley is a sister of  talbot esquire of stone castle an old intimate friend of mr monck berkeleys this worthy young gentleman is also indebted for an appointment under government to the gratititude of lord thurlow oh that all grateful persons were compassionate but they would then be angels and soon removed to the celestial choir  proceeding on the road between rochester and dartford a postchaise drove most furiously by the coach mr berkeleys quick eye saw it and said to mrs frinsham there goes dear james and his lovely lady i wish to speak to him his servant on horseback endeavored to overtake and stop them but in vain for they outstripped the wind he was affected as he wished exceedingly to bid a last adieu to his sincerely beloved respected kinsman  major berkeley has a younger brother a very uncommonly sensible man in mind not person a genuine berkeley on the famous   th of july every man between himself and the earldom of berkeley were engaged in actual service the honorable george berkeley only brother of lord berkeley captain velters cornwall berkeley of the navy major lionel berkeley and major james above named should mr george berkeley marry a lady with a mind like his own their offspring may discover what is transacting in the stars discovered by dr herschel mr george berkeley has as the editor used to tell dr berkeley and her son  they had eyes that could see an insect a mile off a learned friend of the editor not shortsighted used to say of his lady  she can see a crow upon a churchsteeple when i cannot see the steeple it must surely be very pleasant to be blessed with such eyes the editor was always anxious to find out when infants whether her children had their dear fathers fine eyes or their mothers both could like mr george berkeley and their father see the mountains in the moon  this very sensible young divine once when staying at dr berkeleys the editor seeing him very careless of his health said to him if you dont take more care of yourself berkeley will come to the title at last he briskly replied surely i think there are enough of us to keep your son from it the editor well remembers to have frequently heard her very sensible agreeable intimate friend mrs jones sister to the present highly worthy excellent marquis of winchester say that when he was a little boy of five or six years old and intimate friend of his mother used to say stroking his head aye my dear george this little white head of thine will one day wear a coronet i am old and shall not live to see it but i promise thee thou will one day be marquis of winchester the present honor to that very ancient title was then the seventh from it the manner in which his ladys wise father recommended it to her with her vast fortune to marry mr george pawlett then a younger brother does him more honor than even his very ancient title promised to him by the old lady in this instance it can hardly be urged that prescience is unpleasant for a coronet if honorably obtained is no unpleasant prediction yet how merciful is god in hiding from his creatures the future unless by foreseeing we could prevent how gracious was god in the year    0 and several subsequent years in concealing from the unworthy writer of these pages she then spending from the beginning of may to the end of september at cheltenham on account of her dear sisters health by no means in a dangerous state which must have prevented her enjoying balls parties etc  had it been made known to her that in the year      and      she should pass as many months of extreme anguish of spirit and at length lose an only child one of the finest young men in england it would it must have totally destroyed her innocent mirth and gaiete de coeur enjoyed there above thirty years before  the honorable mr finch great uncle to the present lord aylesford being told by a fortune tellers that he would die by means of a gray horse occasioned his living twentyfive years in miserable anxiety but did not prevent his being killed the twentysixth by a gray horse in a very remarkably odd way as some west kent gentlemen have related it to the editor  mrs berkeley takes this opportunity of returning her grateful acknowledgements to many amiable acquaintances at cheltenham at the time of dr berkeleys long confinement after the extreme danger of his illness before mentioned was over who used obligingly to give up the rooms and afford him the pleasure of their pleasing society the very agreeable miss nevilles the worthy mrs andre mother of the amiable unfortunate major andre and the delightfully sensible highly cultivated miss andres the wonderfully wellinformed pious mrs wells of cheltenham the editors old friend the very amiable worthy mr de la bear the worthy mr llewelwyn mr fitzgerald the sensible agreeable son of an old friend of dr berkeleys and his very learned brotherinlaws old friend mrs boswell sister of lord bellamont and the highly accomplished agreeable miss boswells  after mr monck berkeleys arrival at cheltenham little society could be kept up but the attentions of the worthy captain abbot and his lady at the next door to prevent extraordinary noise in the house or court are gratefully remembered and the unwearied polite tender attentions during mr berkeleys short life and the polite tender attentions after his lamented decease of the very learned accomplished mr dunster and his elegant lady were most gratefully felt by dr berkeley and will be for ever registered in the retentive memory of the editor  it has been mentioned that mr berkeley never went out but twice at cheltenham he had therefore never the pleasure of conversing with mr dunster which he lamented for he was a great admirer of his writings some days after mr berkeleys arrival at cheltenham he one day said who is this mr dunster that you all seem to like so much on being told he exclaimed mercy on me is it that mr dunster indeed that you have got here so saying he rang his bell took out his key and ordered his servant to bring down his poems all then written out fair for the press when the book came down he desired the editor to carry it immediately to mr dunster with the following message his compliments that he had sent the manuscript volume for mr dunster to peruse on this sole condition that he would sans ceremony mark whatever he thought might be amended mrs berkeley saying she would get her hat and cloak he said best of mothers pray go as you are you know very well that you race all over the garden at cookham and down the southcote walk to give your orders to the gardener and do not catch cold and this is only three doors  but the people here will think me mad  if they do it will be because they are fools best of mothers go for fear mr dunster should be gone out the editor obeyed apologizing to her polite friend pleading her sons carnestness to learn his strictures they were read  were much admired  and mr dunster declared that there was not any thing that could be altered for the better    de la bear esquire father of mr de la bear died only a very few days before mr berkeley who felt very sensibly the amiable delicacy of mr de la bear in ordering only a few strokes of the knell lest it should affect mr berkeley alas it affected his relations more than himself he constantly enquired every day what account had been received of mr de la bear and one day said i wonder which of us god will call first he was through redeeming mercy as before mentioned prepared for that journey that all must sooner or later take may all who read take the advice of our adored redeemer  be ye therefore ready etc the invalids in the elegant houses in st georges place are considerably incommoded by the ringing of bells a considerable time before service begins on sunday morning  when mr berkeley passed a bad night and could have slept in the morning the noise so very near prevented it dr berkeley sent to the exceedingly obliging mr edwards one of the churchwardens to request that they might ring less time he most politely sent word that he would take care that no bell should move through the week only just one bell toll five minutes before service began  mr berkeley felt so much gratitude for this favor so amiably conferred that he desired mrs berkeley would call on mr edwards and return him his best thanks  dr berkeley  i have sent a message of thanks to mr edwards  mr b  a message my dear sir no i beg that my dear mother will go herself she will say what a message or card cannot say she will express what i feel i therefore entreat that she will go  accordingly to gratify the amiable heart of her dear son mrs berkeley went immediately and endeavored to express to the worthy mr edwards how sensibly mr berkeley and his parents felt his kind amiability  mr edwards the winemerchant had been many years gentleman to bishop johnson of worcester whose angelic gratitude to the relict and daughter of his earliest friend when reduced to poverty can never be forgotten by any who have heard it and to which he by gods appointment owed his wonderful rise in the church  the excellent lady hesketts delightful society and improving pious conversation assisted the editor much in drawing off her mind from incessant meditation on the sufferings of her dearest relatives her ladyship was a cowper she is worthy to be nicee of the editors mothers excellent neighbor in berkshire the excellent mrs madan mother of the present bishop of peterborough  the poor unhappy female the infamous lady vane in her latter days after she had lost the use of all her limbs took a house in her native country of berks in order to be near a very eminent german apothecary so extremely was her ladyship afraid of culinary fire that she had a machine made to twirl her instantly out at her window in case of any such accident in the night  the editor has been twice awakened out of a very sound sleep to escape from fire the last time when wrigglesworths the great inn at york was on fire she has no machine but her garments are regularly every night so placed by herself and her maid with her at york as to be ready for instant flight  from dread of culinary fire as lady vane traveled down the vale of years toward the cold mansion appointed sooner or later for all the daughters of adam however beautiful in youth however strongly varnished in age her poor ladyship began to apprehend that one part of her might soon be in danger of a fire from which no machine could possibly twirl her the very worthy witty agreeable mr henchman fellow of all souls used frequently to ride over to cookham and take a family dinner at dr berkeleys some time after lady vane had taken her house in bray churchyard he diverted all the company present by relating a dialogue that had the day before passed between her ladyship and his worthy neighbor the german medical man who had just told mr henchman how much her ladyship had distressed him the day before by asking him if he thought it possible she should be saved the worthy man in broken english said upon my vord my lady i cannot tell  should hope that  that  that  god voud not  voud not  i did not know vat to say to her pir lady she seemed so troubled so frighted  so i said your ladyship had better ask somebody that understands such tings better dan i do i was quite ashamed i did not know vat answer to make to her at all mr henchman said i told my good neighbor that he should have said to be sure it was impossible that the almighty should think of dg so public spirited a lady the editor greatly wished her ladyships parish minister or some wellinstructed divine to have visited her and have shown her that one gracious promise of the savior of great as well as of little sinners  him or her that comes unto me i will no wise cast out  come unto me all ye etc etc  she was once going to take the high house at cookham but being an absolute cripple the structure of the staircase would not admit of her men carrying her chair up and down if she had taken it the editor having no daughter and thereby feeling herself at full liberty to visit or not visit whom she pleases declared to the no small amusement of many of her friends that  she should infallibly visit lady vane alas poor soul she like most of the children of adam was a selfdeceiver always declaring that had her dear lord william hamilton lived she had remained as chaste as diana the editor knows from too good authority that for some time before the death of that singularly amiable worthy young nobleman her ladyships conduct had made him often very wretched he was removed hardly in time for his own peace of mind his stay would not have prevented her sad fall she had run away from her proscribed father south sea hawes with lord william hamilton and the editor has from her youth delivered it as one of her maxims that the lady who will run away with a man will generally run away from him perhaps it may be said tant mieux there are to be sure some few exceptions to all general rules but a girl of fifteen or sixteen must be a bold little wretch to quit a parents house and set off with  that persidious creature man it requires some courage to set off to the altar led by a tender parent or kind guardian  at least so thinks the editor  mr monck berkeley descended from two men so famous in their generation as bishop berkeley and francis cherry esquire in whose person all that was mortal of those excellent men ended neither having now any lineal descendant that can carry their eminent amiable virtues to posterity should the editor at any time have it in her power to erect a monument as dr berkeley intended to do in cheltenham church by the wonderfully powerful chissel of her worthy old acquaintance j nollekins esquire the broken pillar must alas compose a part it cannot however be recorded that the light of those two great men was extinguished in smoke blessed for ever praised by the mercy of god the blaze was brighter in death than even in life and those two excellent spirits must have hailed with pleasure on his arrival in the region of happy spirits the lovely spirit of their last descendant who in one respect a very unimportant one our blessed redeemer does not appear to have thought decent funerals and monuments to hand persons down to posterity things wrong when he tells his covetous disciples that the lovely penitent mary magdalens gratitude in anointing him to his funeral should be rewarded by being recorded in the gospel and so she be remembered to the end of time in isaiah god threatens a king of judah that he shall be buried with the burial of an ass cast out etc much might be said very different from what is usually said by very pious persons on both these subjects but time and place and health are all wanting many may say excelled themselves  the having had at least a faithful sketch of his life given to those of the public who may choose to spend an hour in reading it of every attempt of a life of bishop berkeley yet published his son used to say they are lamentably imperfect when mr monck berkeley as abovementioned used to regret dr berkeley had not permitted dr johnson to write the life of bishop berkeley  there are a thousand very curious very diverting some very ludicrous ancedotes bishop berkeley retained the famous pasquilino four years in the palace at cloyne to teach his children music giving him l 00 per annum and keeping him a little chaise and pair of tolerable horses the following ludicrous anecdote was some time ago related to the editor by the very worthy mr angello of eton dr berkeley was esteemed the finest gentlemanperformer on the violincello in england as his brother who died at sixteen was a wonderfully fine performer on the violin bishop berkeley had a fine concert at his own house every evening in winter when he did not dine from home signior pasquilino was to have a very fine concert at cork one day at dinner the bishop said well pasquilino i have got rid of a great many tickets for you among my neighbors to lord inchiquin lord shannon mr lumley etc to which pasquilino bowing said  may god pickle your lordship i pray him all the company laughed immoderately the poor italian said vell in de grammar that my lord give me to teach me inglish it is printed pickle to keep from decay bishop berkeley most kindly invited his brother the reverend doctor robert berkeley father of the dean of tuam and mrs hamilton lady of sackville hamilton esquire to send his seven children one fixed day in every week to learn music dancing etc of his childrens masters of that great and good prelate that dr berkeley and his mother used to relate of the good bishop even from his childhood thoroughly diverting the editor is much addicted to watching children before either the masque is fitted on to hide or grace infused to suppress to rectify  the lamentable dose of original sin  the editor has more than once heard the late lord  say that he often pressed a beloved friend of his to marry he at length said i have long resolved not to marry that i may not be the means of propagating a race of devils  of devils my dear friend is it probable that any thing sprung from such an angelic being as yourself should be devils  yes my dear friend to be sure i do for i am one myself all that you and many others so much admire in me is gods grace for i am by nature and it bloomed most direfully in early youth before you knew me the most illhumoured badtempered malicious diabolical being i believe ever born into the world i think i must have sprung from the insernal regions now as i am sure if i should have children they will at least some of them inherit my horrible temper and as i am by no means sure that the same measure of grace may be granted to them as has through the great mercy of god been vouchsafed to me i am resolved to let my vast estate about which you are so anxious go to my uncles family they may perhaps be better than i am sure mine would be nothing can ever shake my resolution it has been long unalterably fixed examine the lines of my face attentively and you will be convinced of the truth of what i tell you his lordship said there appeared some lines subdued of what the excellent man asserted to be in his spirit every one knows how honorably socrates justified the skill of a famous physiognomist who on coming to athens and pronouncing socrates almost every thing that was bad was treated as an impostor until that noble philosopher declared him an excellent judge etc  on the commencement of the hard frost in      0 the bishop went down to breakfast the first sunday without a grain of powder in his wig mrs berkeley the chaplain and some company staying in the house on a visit all called out at once to enquire what ailed his lordship  bp berkeley  a great deal ails me for our poor are all about to be starved we shall have a famine we shall have a very long frost and i am sure it has already killed all the potatoes in this kingdom therefore the poor must depend upon flour so no powder will i or shall any individual of my family wear until next harvest  they assured him that it disfigured him exceedingly and that the men would look dirty all persuasion was vain he during the frost and until the summer gave either in gold or in a bank note every monday morning twenty pounds to proper persons to distribute amongst the poor of the little town of cloyne besides what they received daily hourly out of his kitchen and housekeepers room  it was a ludicrous message enough which the bishop received from one old woman her duty to his lordship and she was very sorry that she had not lived better the good bishop sent her word that he hoped she would send for mr  the name forgotten and talk with him and lead the short remainder of her life differently she returned for answer that his lordship mistook her quite she had no trouble about her soul but was sorry as she now in her dying state got such good things from his house that she had not constantly enjoined them before and could enjoy them so short time now it is to be supposed that this good womans ideas of the joys of heaven were very low  the editor has been often told by a very intimate sensible friend that her ideas of heaven are very high very singular such as they are some of her intimate friends now and then conjure her to treat them as they are pleased to term it with her account of heaven she was once brought to public shame for this private conversation for it is not to be supposed that the editor is quite fool enough to cast her precious pearls that seem to deck her wings for flight to those delightful regions before such sne see the words of our blessed savior in the gospel as frequently surround a drawing room or cardtable  a very fine lady once requesting dear dr berkeley and two other learned men to hold their tongues that she might hear more distinctly mrs berkeleys account of heaven it was so enchanting this so shamed poor mr berkeley that it almost turned heaven into hl dr berkeley laughing said it is wonderful how many people love to hear my wife talk of heaven she has never been there yet but  calling her by her name knows the bible by heart from end to end there is certainly much to be gathered from that sacred volume concerning the state of happy spirits much more than can be imagined by those who do not read it very attentively and with a view to discover the hidden treasure with regard to what relates to our salvation he that runs may read blessed be the mercy of god  a smart young divine a relation of dr berkeleys had one day after dinner a contest with mrs berkeley about a text of scripture when he very intimate in the family said my dear madam is it not very strange that you will contend with me who am a clergyman concerning scripture he was then about twentythree dr berkeley said oh george it would be very happy for you and many other divines if they were as thoroughly acquainted with the holy scriptures as that lady is i frequently apply to her the editor has little other knowledge to boast of and that knowledge must in every instance exclude boasting but had she not some of it she must have been a doleful dolt indeed having been made to hear or read four chapters every day of her life at family prayers at her fathers with her leadingstring at her back as mentioned in a letter in the st jamess chronicle near eighteen months ago combating the learned dr beatties treatment of his son with regard to the existence of a supreme being and thenceforward until this present day and she humbly trusts to the last hour of her life besides every days private reading alone some portion of that allinforming volume  but to return from this long digression to mr monck berkeleys noble and nonnoble the editor has perhaps here selon sa coutume coined a word as she did many years ago when in the world when the honorable and worthy mrs berkeley mother of lady woodhouse was living there were frequent mistakes although the editor always left her cards as it became her to do mrs george berkeley and always ordered her servants to announce her mrs george berkeley but to save trouble the ton lacqueys often dropped the george a bad pun might here be made in ascending the staircase which now and then occasioned her being received with a formal respectful face and then  oh my dear friend is it you a gentleman once said these ladies should be announced the honorable and the  the editor exclaimed  i will not be announced the dishonorable mrs berkeley for i have never disgraced the noble name i am content to be announced the unhonourable mrs berkeley  a very polite lady said you should madam be announced the honored mrs berkeley grandsires the editor does not recollect to have read in any of bishop berkeleys lives that mention is made of his utterly refusing to enclose the great common at cloyne where the poor used to cut their peat turn their cows pigs and poultry the doing which had nearly cost the present earl of bristol his life he being obliged to be guarded out of cloyne by an old friend of dr berkeley mr lumley of ballymaloo castle riding with a cocked pistol close to the charitable prelates ear declaring that the first man who threw a stone was a dead man as that gentlemans mother told dr berkeley in his drawing room the editor being present it were to be wished that worthyspirited gentleman or some as worthy and fearless had been on the jury who acquitted cld how often has the editor rejoiced to hear her son thank the goodness of god that the said support of the poor was not united to his small patrimony by his episcopal grandsire  no regular life of mr cherry has ever been attempted as of bishop berkeley to be written a short sketch appeared in      in mr nicholss leicestershire collections see the history of hinckley p      where his chaplain the rev francis brokesby is mentioned the irish demosthenes once did him the honor to say it is a shame madam that the life of your grandfather has not been written mrs berkeley once met with a small diverting humiliation on account of being descended from that excellent man to the no small diversion of dr and dr mr monck berkeley returning from her morning walk clad as usual in the morning the editor never wastes the morning in walking but in winter some years ago when dr berkeley resided at cookham the editor escorted by three elegant beaux used generally to walk an hour and a half in the southcote walk by moon or starlight enjoying the conversation of the very learned accomplished d m esquire his son s m esquire and her own delightful youth then about seventeen on their return to dr berkeley and mrs frinsham he used to say on their creeping into the fire i wonder your mother and you two such chilly souls are not perished  it can only be ms conversation that can prevent it  to be sure if any ones can it is his  dr berkeley himself never sat into a fire he was a great admirer of that gentlemans fine understanding and deep learning  she being now too tender in excessive cold weather to venture to walk after dinner for health although it is wonderfully beneficial for those who dining at a reasonable hour at three oclock can do it as the editor does experience and has seen in various persons with a black beaver hat tied under her chin and wrapped round in a rather rusty black mode cloack she stroled into dr berkeleys room not knowing that any one was with him there happened to be a person more esteemed in the world for his great learning and true worth than for his title and rank in society in the course of conversation mr cherry was named dr berkeley said a relation of my wife the visitor probably wishing to hear some anecdote of that excellent man turned to mrs berkeley saying pray madam do you know any thing of mr cherry supposing her as it should seem by the sequel a distant relation she replied he was my mothers father he started astonished and said  what madam are you a granddaughter of the great mr cherry mrs berkeley smiling said she had that honor the enquirers politeness and good sense prevented his apologizing by saying madam i ask your pardon i did not conceive that such an insignificant undressed little being could possibly be descended from the very handsome noblelooking mr cherry  universally esteemed the most completely accomplished fine gentleman of his time a picture of mr cherry by richardson is in the picturegallery at oxford mr cherry bequeathed to the bodleian library a box of very curious old genuine manuscripts the editor has often heard her mother say that in the box was a small manuscript book written entirely by queen elizabeth the cover of pale blue cloth embroidered with gold and silver leaves and flowers by her royal fingers much better employed as she now feels than when signing the deathwarrant for the unfortunate mary  or the noble earl of essex the editor in her youth very seldom went to a new play the first night of acting she however was persuaded to go to brookes earl of essex where she heard the finest soliloquy put into the mouth of old burleigh that even the genius of brook could compose incomparably uttered  and the editor is esteemed by her acquaintance a tolerable judge of speaking she formerly read pretty well having an absolute command of her voice in reading it never was spoken but that once when the tragedy was published it was omitted the editor admiring it very much made enquiry but could never meet with any person who remembered it insomuch that she began to suspect that she must have dreamed it mentioning it a few years ago in a large circle a gentleman of the company said i was at the play that night and heard that glorious soliloquy he then repeated the substance of it to the company joining with the editor in supposing that one of burleighs descendants had prevailed on mr brook to throw it out it must have been the late very amiable lord exeter as the late lord salisbury would not have cared had brook made burleigh the actual butcher of essex the editor honors dr thompson for the employment he has assigned to that cruel wretch elizabeth in his very entertaining work a voyage to the moon as also for the easy delightful way in which he dismisses the late earl of k who ceased to be his patron no one knew why on some little caprice of the earls as was supposed as the editor has heard her son say mr monck berkeley admired dr thompsons worthiness in providing an early easy grave for the worthy minister that is lord k in the journey to the moon  presented after his death by his lady and daughters  the editor and her sister have a very fine picture of mr cherry painted by riley in a fullbottomed twentyguinea wig when mr cherry was a gentlemancommoner of edmund hall not quite seventeen years old this tremendous peruke does not so absolutely disguise him but that on attentive inspection he appears a very beautiful youth  mr cherry married soon after he was twenty his house which at the revolution made up seventy beds for the officers and soldiers quartered on him was the hotel devoted to friendship to learning to distress  with sir constantine phipps grandsire of the present lord mulgrave he formed an acquaintance at oxford he was a native of reading and went off from archbishop lauds school to st johns college oxford it was a very advantageous connection for the barrister who until his appointment by queen anne to the seals in ireland had no country residence but shottesbrook house where himself lady three girls sometimes the amiable t phipps his angelic eldest son their coachhorses saddlehorses and three or four servants constantly spent four months every summer  the respected and respectable friends of mr and mrs cherry bowdler esquire his excellent lady and family grandfather etc of the pious resigned miss bowdler author of the essays  the seraphic bishop kenn the editor when a girl about sixteen remembers to have read what she then thought and believes she should now think a very dull stupid life of that cheerful gay as well as exquisitely pious prelate she was so disappointed that she told her mother she thought she could write a better life of him herself it is very lucky for damsels of sixteen to have wise mothers perhaps the editor had commenced author at sixteen  some will perhaps say better than at sixty her cheerful gay spirit had been frequently exhilarated by the lively tales told her by her mother of the agreeable bishop she however once told her mother that she sadly feared the bishop was a little of an hypocrite  an hypocrite child exclaimed her mother what can make you talk such horrid nonsense  why my dear madam in one of his works the editor does not now recollect which he laments that  his heart is deceitful desperately wicked etc and he was you say an angel  to which the editors wise judicious mother only replied well my poor dear child that only shows that he knew his own heart this and mrs frinshams answer to the editor on the conduct of poor wretched miss blandy whose honest father transacted mrs frinshams business only made the poor ignorant editor conceive that all the excellent of the earth were in unison to be what she not then knowing her own heart thought affectedly humble and to show their humility falsified the law is the only schoolmaster to teach us to read that black book  our own heart the editor cannot forbear mentioning to the honor of a sort of favorite of here is she believes for his exquisite politeness charles the second the anecdote that placed bishop kenn on the bench she does not recollect having ever seen it in print when the king and court went down to winchester the house of dr kenn was destined to be the residence of mrs gwynne the good little man declared that she should not be under his roof he was steady as a rock the intelligence was carried to the king who said well then nell must take a lodging in the city all the court divines etc were shocked at dr kenns strange conduct saying that he had ruined his fortune and would never rise in the church militant some months after the bishopric of bath and wells becoming vacant the minister etc recommended as is always usual i suppose some learned pious divines to which the king answered no none of them shall have it i assure you what is the name of that little man at winchester that would not let nell gwynne lodge at his house  dr kenn please your majesty  well he shall have it then i resolved that he should have the first bishopric that fell if it had been canterbury the wise and pious bishop horn says in a sermon before the university  and be it known to our adversaries that god can if he see it good for his faithful servants advance them in this world just after the deprivation of the bishops a gentleman meeting bishop kenn began condoling with his lordship to which he merrily replied god bless you my friend do not pity me man  my father lived before me he was an honest farmer and left me twenty pounds a year thank god he spent his time between long leate and shottesbrook house he every morning made a vow that he would not marry that day mr cherry used frequently on his entering the breakfastroom to say well my good lord is the resolution made this morning  oh yes sir long ago  he rose generally very early and never took a second sleep   mrs frinsham always told her daughters after they ceased to be quite children girls never assent to a thing because i say it think for yourselves turn it in your own minds and if you think differently from me politely tell me so and we will examine the matter together the editor well remembers having availed herself of this liberty at eleven years old when reading the history of england a legard de queen elizabeth whom she thus early abhorred for her horrid deceits her conduct to secretary davison   found a second home at shottesbrook house dividing his time between the marquis of baths grandfathers famed mansion ye lads and ye lasses who live at long leate etc  and mr cherrys dr grabe and many other learned foreigners spent much time at shottesbrook house  the very learned charles leslie was concealed six months by mr cherry in regimentals not under his own roof but at an house of mr cherrys at white waltham then called the hill house now waltham place he went to rome at mr cherrys request and at his expense to attempt to convert the old chevalier de st george a wonderful idea to enter into the heads of two so very sensible men to convert an ignorant papist forbidden by his cunning confessor to search the scriptures lest he should see the all sufficiency of christ to save lost sinners in a letter from rome to mr cherry he says it would be much easier to turn the course of the thames at london bridge than to convert his majesty this princes health was constantly given every day at mr cherrys when only nonjurors were present after the death of several of the conscientious nonjuring bishops the few remaining pious nonjuring prelates who were anxious not to continue the schism in the excellent church of england and all the pious nonjurors agreed throughout the kingdom to go to their respective parish churches on the same day always taking care to avoid praying for the queen as queen  the editor has frequently heard her mother laugh at the different dispositions of mr cherry and his friend mr dodwell every time during the service that the queen was prayed for her father rose from his knees fine gentlemen kneeled to god in those oldfashioned times  the editor hopes they will take to it again to distinguish them from the profane ladies of these times who almost all now sit when they should kneel although they do not worship  alas for them poor souls and stood up facing the congregation mr dodwell used to slide off his knees and sit down upon his hassock  mr cherry a native of windsor forest was to the end of his life perhaps the keenest staghunter in england esteemed to ride better than any man in the kingdom always in at the death of the deer he had one hunter a very fine iron gray an entire who never suffered any one to mount him but mr cherry the groom was always obliged to lead him to water he once crossing maidenhead bridge got himself and master half over the rails and there remained no one daring to go near all trembling for mr cherry the idol of berkshire boats in abundance put out to endeavor to save him when this spirited beast should throw him off in that tremendous situation he remained near a quarter of an hour and then got the beast on the bridge again one of mr cherrys granddaughters not the editor who had only skill enough to spring off her horse three or four times in a mornings ride seemed to have inherited the skill of her grandfather without having learned as he had to ride the great horse for she never has got a fall not even when learning to ride and whenever she heard of any ladys being thrown her remark was i suppose she chose it i should like to find any horse that could get me off his back if i had not an inclination to go she accordingly would often lend her own beautiful spirited horse and ride any wild or stupid beast for her amusement if they leap there she sits if they go on both knees there she sits if they rear up there she remains dr berkeley used to tell her she could sit a stag she used to say she seemed to have been born on horseback the late dr james once told a gentleman of the editors acquaintance a prebendary of canterbury if god had meant men should ride so constantly he would have sent them into the world booted and spurred it was more witty than wise perhaps it was politic  less of that excellent medicine jamess powder would be sold if persons rode more on horseback a tenants wife of old mr cherry having purchased an old hunter used regularly to ride to windsor market when farmers ladies were not quite so fine as in these days with two large paniers of butter and eggs one hunting morning hearing the hounds the poor old beast pricked up his ears and set off every effort of the old woman to hold him in was in vain  away he flew and soon reduced the butter and eggs to a fine liquid it dashed yeomen prickers lords commoners and even his majesty to the great diversion of the witty charles who would not suffer any one to attempt stopping the horse at the death of the deer his majesty ordered the butter and eggs to be amply paid for and told the honest old woman who began begging pardon etc that he should be glad of her company often upon the field adding i have not been so entertained for a long time   archbishop potter told the late archdeacon dodwell the following anecdote of his fathers excellent friend  king william who valued himself much on his horsemanship was frequently mortified by hearing his courtiers admiring mr cherrys wonderful skill in riding and resolved at length that he would follow mr cherry every where after some days mr cherry finding that it was not chance that constantly kept his majesty just behind him determined to try to serve his as he conceived lawful sovereign by breaking the neck of the usurper he went over many very dangerous places the king excellently mounted and a very good horseman still followed one day when the stag took the soil mr cherry instantly plunged into a frightfully deep and broad part of the thames the king went to the brink looked and looked again then shook his head and retired his majesty thought the actual possession of three kingdoms better than the fame of being as good a horseman as mr cherry thus yielding the palm to mr cherry he never followed him afterward to the great comfort of his majestys attendants the late sir robert gayer the editor and her sister have a most beautiful miniature the property of mr cherry done in italy of this wonderfully beautiful extraordinary man with whom their grandfather was exceedingly intimate when he lost his lovely lady for whom he mourned seven years he never changed his linen walked about the park unshaved in an old black long loose freeze coat almost a nebucadnezzar the editor has heard her mother and her old intimate friend mrs baldwyn his granddaughter and mother of  annesley esquire of blechingdon say that the poor women of stoke would threaten their bawling brats with  if you keep crying i will give you to sir robert at the expiration of somewhat more than seven years he dressed like a rational being went and made a visit to mr cherry at shottesbrook house and on entering saluted mrs cherry now alas comes the thoroughly tragical part of this tale which the editor when young used to tell some gentlemen of her friends she would print and to humble the lords of the creation have bound up with the history of the ephesian matron  lord what is man after some time poor wretched sir robert married a beautiful widow his own near relation lady christian roll by whom he had several children his first so singularly lamented lady left four fine sons all of whom he bred up gentlemen to no profession at his death his very large estate fell unavoidably to his eldest son who married the very uncommonly sensible lady elizabeth annesly on opening his will it appeared that this what must one style him  monster of cruelty is a milkandwater title for him  had bequeathed to his three younger sons of the thus lamented lady only five hundred pounds each  good god and to the editor thinks six children of lady christian roll each six thousand pounds attend to the fate of the three maltreated young gentlemen one died within a few months of a broken heart another was deprived of his reason and never perfectly recovered it although he lived to possess one can hardly say enjoy his horrid fathers great estate at hurley berks now the property of the excellent duke of marlborough after the death of his nephew the late robert gayer esquire of hurley the third of these injured sons patiently resignedly sunk his five hundred pounds in an annuity and went to board with a farmer at stoke  the at that time wellknown witty joe hewett who was in all the gay parties of the nobility and gentry of the neighborhood he had been many years valet de chamber to  and had not the beautiful lady catharine  been pulled back when getting out at one of the windows of  his grandson had been a peer of england this made a little noise at the time the only son of sir william  was going to marry the beautiful nan fisher the chambermaid of the sun inn at maidenhead berks but nan would insist upon going to town to buy wedding clothes alas they were converted into mourning weeds for the earl and sir william met made up a match between mr  and lady catharine  and they were a very decently happy couple as the editor has frequently heard her mother and many other friends of that day relate her ladyships conduct as a wife and a mother was excellent a writer of romance would certainly marry the agreeable joe to nan fisher he married a very rich farmers widow by whom he had a very worthy agreeable daughter whom it was supposed that the resigned mr gayer would have married that happytempered injured gentleman the editor remembers he did not die until after she was grown up a woman goodtempered persons generally live longer than bad ones and it is certain that their lives are much pleasanter  of stoke park near windsor absolutely refused to let king william in to see his house his majesty waiting in his coach at the door  poor lady gayer supplicating  his answer no he is an usurper every man in england is king in his own castle he shall not come in so his majesty returned to windsor and died without seeing stoke house  during the reign of king william mr cherry always on hunting days rode up to the princess of denmarks calash the chaise in which her royal highness hunted was so called to pay his respects the princess admired his conversation his uncommonly fine understanding and exquisitely high breeding as politeness now said to be horridly old fashioned a lady who does the editor the honor to rank her amongst her eldest friends having had the real pleasure to have been well acquainted with her since she was seven years old the wonderfully well informed allaccomplished countess of orkney  who has more than once said to the editor there are two things however oldfashioned in which i am resolved to persist i will not give up the little politeness i possess nor ever dress like my housemaid the editor has always had the honor to resemble her ladyship in that idea before lady orkney was born when going into a drapers shop in york street to purchase a morning gown constantly saying be pleased sir to show me some linens that my maid would not wear several years ago at a very large rout at the worthy lady heads a gentleman came up to the cardtable where the editor was playing and accosted her thus well mrs berkeley have you heard how the king has flummered your young neighbor lady mary obrien  not i  oh then i will tell you she was presented the other day and the king said he saw that it was possible to be exquisitely wellbred without having ever been in town  in the world did you ever hear such flummer in your whole life every one said that was a very highflown compliment to her indeed the editor said rather briskly  by no means i who have the honor to know the young lady well throw down my gauntlet to prove that it is no flattery at all her father is i do in my conscience really believe the most completely wellbred man in europe poor good lady orkney although unable to articulate almost equally so the editor then related two particular instances one when lady mary obrien was about nine years old the other when doctor berkeleys family were one day dining at taplow court so silencing the gentleman and entertaining the company the editor at her return home related this to dr berkeley who never staid longer than twenty minutes in a routroom saying that he did not love burnt air as he always termed the air of hot rooms he said aye his majesty and lady mary could not have a better advocate than  calling the editor by her name that gentleman did not know the young ladys father or he would not have termed it flummer the editor who knows we must account for every idle word ie our common conversation and for every deceitful compliment  many obliging polite things may be said to and of many persons without deceit here takes the opportunity of saying that she thinks that the most agreeable whole day she ever remembers to have passed in her life was spent tete a tete for the worthy lady anne obrien cannot with propriety be considered in a conversation as a third person with lady orkney when going and returning many miles on a day visit to their common friends the very worthy general and mrs bs  was termed in those awkward days on her obtaining a crown she lost the conversation of mr cherry who was too correctly well bred to think of approaching that thoroughly respectable princess to insult her and no bribe could ever have induced him to acknowledge himself her subject whilst her father and brother were living mr cherry took great pains as far as the oath of a woman of the bedchamber to king jamess queen could ascertain it to be fully convinced that the chevalier de st george was actually produced by his queen the oath of the facts to which the lady swore was carefully preserved by mr cherry and accordingly the first day that her majesty hunted after her accession to the throne mr cherry kept aloof from royalty her majesty called to her officer known in those days by the name of the bottleman saying  peachy if my eyes do not deceive me i see mr cherry upon the field  peachy  yes please your majesty he is yonder pointing with his whip  the queen  aye he will not come to me now i know the reason but go you and carry him a couple of bottles of red wine and white from me and tell him that i esteem him one of the honestest gentlemen in my dominions  the editor although not so nobly descended as her beloved partner sometimes feels a momentary pleasure in knowing she is descended from honest ancestors and the character always given by the sensible elegant lovely mrs sheeles of the editor and her sister when girls at school was  they are honest to the bone when the editor was a girl about eleven years old dining one day with a very intimate friend of her mother together with three or four more of mrs sheeless young ladies the good lady recommended to their kind care miss  daughter of colonel  who was going the next week to mrs sheeless school every one said civil things excepting the poor editor to whom the lady said my dear miss frinsham why dont you tell me that you will be kind to my little friend   because madam i never make any promises for fear i should break them if you please i will stay till i see how i shall like her on the young ladys arrival she proved a little of the  humdrum kind and no one paid her any attention but the editor as the good lady told mrs frinsham mrs sheeles with her wonted excellent skill furbished her up she is a very worthy lady as the editor hears and when the ancient title of  devolves to the gentleman she has married she will make a very good countess  they have no deceit in them  when mr monck berkeley sometimes saw persons acting polite deceits he used to say well whatever faults i have thank god and my mother i am at least an honest man a very witty friend of the editors youth well known in the world for his bons mols now no more used to say when men of a certain rank in the world acted like scoundrels well he will not be hanged for no poor wretch ever goes to the gallows whose confession does not begin that he was born of poor but honest parents  but to return to mr cherry he did not return his duty to a sovereign he did not acknowledge as such he requested mr peachy to present his very humble respects and best thanks to his mr peachys mistress for the high honor conferred on him the favor was frequently repeated  mr cherry died just one year before the queen after the rebellion in      mrs cherry in her coach with her two daughters driving down ludgate hill met several coaches filled with the unfortunate gentlemen who had been in the rebellion returning to newgate after their sentence she exclaimed oh my dear girls bless the goodness of god that your excellent father is dead or he had been amongst those unhappy men for i am sure he would never have worn a sword without drawing it in this cause and he would certainly have been hanged  king william sent repeated offers of any thing and every thing to mr cherry if he would go to court and take the oaths queen anne it should seem was too well acquainted with mr cherry to make him any such offers she showed her esteem for that thoroughly honest man in other ways  a considerable part of mr cherrys very large estate lay in windsor forest it is to this day a lucky circumstance for the beautiful county of berks that mr cherrys wonderfully acute father when in the country resided there rather than at his estate in surrey  on the first laying on the land tax meetings were called by the sheriffs in every county in england at reading nearly central always the county town until the old lord harcourt contrived to get electors and jurymen dragged down to abingdon the last town  parish  in the county  at reading the whole county met and were harangued by a ministerial orator telling them that the tax was only to be levied one year and every gentleman and yeoman was to give in the full value of his own estate some few of the gentlemen zealous friends to the new government for berks was always an honest tory county and others from motives of vanity gave in the value of their estates more than double saying come let us do the thing handsomely generously when an entry was about to be committed to paper that the editor often contemplates with admiration the very wonderfully sensible thoughtful sedate countenance of her great grandfather in a very fine portrait of that great lawyer painted by richardson at an advanced age she would have been pleased to hear the sensible la vatres sentiments of it the editor notwithstanding her being shortsighted was from her youth a great physiognomist and has generally been right in her conjecture the spirit will force itsef through the clay acutest of barristers stepped forth requesting to be heard a few words his oratory was different from that of many modern barristers it was rather laconic the editor remembers to have heard it often repeated always applauded since she was seven years old  gentlemen  we are told that this tax is laid on for only one year it is possible it may be taken off at the expiration of the year but it is much more probable that our greatgrandchildren may see it trebled and then they will not bless the wisdom of their forefathers in having so greatly overrated the value of their estates as i well know many of you have done    the greatgrandsire of the present lord le despenser cried out mr cherry speaks like an oracle i am sure in my hurry i have given in my estate too high it lay in what is called the ancient demesne of bray and the editor has frequently heard her mother say that sir william pauls the editor from the very amiable character that she has heard of the present lord despencer conceives he knows not that his beautiful greatgrandmother from whom he enjoys his very ancient title the second daughter of the earl of westmorland lies interred in bray churchyard at least her grave was visible a few years ago without even a brick frame to protect it from hogs who are remarkably fond of routing in cemeteries it is pity all parishes do not follow the example of fairford in gloucestershire  lay down iron grates over which swine cannot tread the editor learned this humiliation of her grandmothers noble beautiful friend by accident when about seventeen the late thoroughly amiable worthy bacon morritt junior esquire on a visit at the editors mothers asked mrs frinsham what could be the reason that a woman of that high rank lay thus neglected mrs frinsham replied that her unworthy only daughter by whom she had to her great injury acted most generously having quarrelled with her mother had suffered her to be buried as a pauper adding i dare say if sir thomas stapleton knew it he would order a protecting monument to cover her once exquisitely beautiful elegant form to which morritt replied if he does not i declare i will alas dear youth this and every other amiable purpose of thy excellent heart was broken by the dart of death this excellence could not rescue thee from an early yet untimely grave leaving all who knew thy intrinsic worth to mourn thy loss this young gentleman eldest son of that eminently amiable father of eight worthy sons and daughters bacon morritt esquire of rookby hall yorkshire going from trinity college oxford where he was a gentleman commoner into yorkshire in the long vacation was seized with a violent fever which carried him off in a short time leaving few that resembled him  the editor does not mean in person or fine figure but in loveliness of nature the editor most intimately acquainted with him from the time he was an etonian of twelve years old she a girl of eleven never saw him once out of humor fretful or displeased to bystanders he scarce seemed to have been a descendant of false adam adieu thou sweet spirit  may we meet in the realms of bliss estate at bray was then called a good four thousand pounds per annum almost every other gentleman followed sir william pauls example and all gave in their estates much under par many not half their real value by which means berkshire is next to yorkshire said by those who have really investigated that matter to be the lowest taxed county in england and accordingly it is in the upper part of it windsor maidenhead etc the dearest the farmers butchers gardeners mealmen etc the most covetous and griping any where to be met with  mr cherrys greatgreatgrandson george monck berkeley esquire lived to see although not to feel in his own person his mother and aunt alas surviving him the fulfillment of his grandsires prediction  the editor having trespassed too long on the public with her own imbecil pen in order to make some amends presents her readers with two letters from very superior pens the two abovenamed great and good men from whom mr monck berkeley had the honor to be descended one from bishop berkeley on the death of his favorite son the other from mr cherry to his lady ordering his own interment  letter of bishop berkeley uncertain whether it is addressed to lord egmont or to bishop benson this letter as well as mr cherrys is borrowed from amongst those of potentates princes and plebeians of the second volume of the  literary relics by george monck berkeley esquire all ready for the press at the time of his death when they will see the light is now uncertain amongst them is one of bishop berkeleys to his beloved friend bishop benson written on february    a few hours after the death of his son the editor has heard her beloved partner say that on his entering his fathers room to announce the heavy tidings he had one arm in his nightgown rising to go to his son four in the morning he drew it out again saying the lord gave etc and lay down in his bed on the day of the funeral his brother and attending friends dined with him and no one would have supposed that he had lost his idol the bishop used frequently to say to dr berkeley i see him incessantly before my eyes  my dear lord i was a man retired from the amusement of politics visits and what the world calls pleasure i had a little friend educated always under mine own eye whose painting delighted me whose mr william berkeley played incomparably on the violin as his brother dr berkeley did on the violincello music ravished me and whose lively gay spirit was a continual feast it has pleased god to take him hence god i say in mercy has deprived me of this pretty gay plaything his parts and person mr william berkeley was as beautiful as finely made as his elder brother dr berkeley taller and more slightly built a most uncommonly elegant youth danced as did his brother remarkably well  his innocence and piety his particularly uncommon affection for me had gained too much upon me not content to be fond of him i was vain of him i had set my heart too much upon him more perhaps than i ought to have done upon any thing in this world the editor sometimes consoles herself that even the great bishop berkeley and the eminently pious mrs a had not been able at least had not avoided  setting up their idols in their hearts see the prophet ezekiel how much less could she hope to avoid it the pious prelate speaks himself to his friend by letter the good lady has frequently vivd voce said to the editor ah my dear friend god has been gracious to me he has taken away all my idols one by one my eldest son a lovely youth my angelic daughter the first lady of the present lord  my sons first lady on whom i doated then adding cheerfully god has spared my son whom i love very much but the squire is not a thing to make an idol he is a very worthy gentleman  thus much suffer me to say in the overflowings of my soul to say to your lordship who though distant in place are much nearer my heart than any of my neighbors  adieu my dear lord and believe me with the utmost esteem and affection your faithful humble servant g cloyne cloyne   march    0  the following letter is inserted with the notes as it was made ready for the literary relics  letter from francis cherry esquire of shottesbrook house in berkshire to his lady eldest daughter and one of the five rich coheiresses of john finch eliza the eldest married francis cherry esquire mrs cherry was supposed to have made the greatest match of all mr finchs daughters though her granddaughters are now the poorest of the family but they have enough man wants but little nor that little long says the poet they bless god that they have so much instead of murmuring that they have not more a famous old ferryman at bray island used to say we were not all born to live in cheapside his ideas of cheapside must have been entertaining we cannot all have coaches and six as good bishop tailor says the editor when a very young woman used always to assert that she had rather have an income of eight hundred pounds per annum than one of eight thousand to the diversion of her friends and her sister she still continues in the same mind knowing that little or much we must render an account of our stewardship mrs frinsham with her wonted wit often says to the editor when you have your eight hundred pounds and i my eight thousand you may do so or so but i promise you i will do  she might with truth add good to every distressed creature that i could hear of far or near mary the second married john sawyer esquire of henwood house berks dorothy the third married william wright esquire a welsh judge and recorder of oxford father of that very learned upright english judge the late sir martin wright of barton stacy hants the worthy recorder has still one most worthy descendant the excellent lady guise relict of the amiable sir john guise of highnam court bart in the county of gloucester may the fine olivebranches round her table resemble the parent stock the fourth sarah married to william york esquire of pirton in the county of wilts who left no child and fifth johanna married to john dalby esquire of hurst park in the county of berks nephew to bishop juxon the family of the late j dalby esquire had a fine original picture of his pious uncle the idea that the picture of the bishop drawn after his death and in the gallery at lambeth palace being the only picture ever painted of that pious prelate is erroneous the good bishop had one of the six rings given by king charles at the block which is exceedingly curious indeed and is still carefully preserved by the editors worthy relations mrs e and mrs s dalby now residing at reading who obligingly permitted the editor to take a drawing of it which she keeps with a lock of the royal martyrs hair in a snuff box with a very fine enamelled picture in the lid of his unfortunate grandmother the murdered mary  esquire of fiennes court berks my dearest creature i have several times begun to give you some directions for your behavior after my death but always found you so impatient of any such discourse that i have reason to believe you remember very little of what i have said to you upon that subject and therefore think it necessary to leave in writing the few directions following with which how unreasonable soever they may seem to you i assure myself of your ready compliance from the long experience i have had of the greatest duty and affection that ever woman showed to an husband and for which i return you these my last and most hearty thanks first as to my funeral which will be the first trouble i desire to be buried if it may be the morrow night after i shall die and so private that i would have no person know it or be invited to it except four of the poorest of your tenants to carry me to my grave to each of which i desire you to give five shillings in money i would have no achievement escutcheon or pall i desire to be buried in the churchyard of shottesbrook house between the vault where my father lies and the chancel belonging to shottesbrook house i would have a brickwork of two or three foot raised over my grave and a plain black marble laid upon it without any arms name or other inscription but this which follows hic  iacet  peccatorum  maximus anno  dom mdcc supplying the date of the year of my death mr cherry died in september      his directions to his excellent lady were in general complied with the burialground was after his interment railedin with iron railing and planted with cypress and other funeral shrubs which the present lord of the manor and the late rector conceiving to be injurious to the church they removed them to the great regret of his descendant the late george monck berkeley esquire   second i desire you to take warning by me and not to engage yourself or children in any of my troublesome concerns which have broke my heart and will never suffer either you or them to enjoy any happiness or quiet if you meddle with them i therefore beg of you as the last and greatest instance of love that i can show you to content yourself with what was settled upon my marriage and the addition settled since by my father in pursuance of our marriage settlement articles mr cherry marrying before he was of age could only enter into articles to sign fulfill etc when of age part of mrs cherrys fortune was in land which could not be properly shared until her four younger sisters became of age  there you have a right to both in law and conscience antecedent to any debts either of myself or my father and therefore may with a good conscience claim and enjoy them but as to the rest of my estate both real and personal i desire you to let it go to the payment of debts this will draw down a blessing upon what you have left and vindicate in some measure the honesty mr cherrys honesty wanted no vindication a short time before the death of his father he happened to see in his fathers study a book containing a list of his debts he purchased one estate with debts upon it which he knew had life been lent him he had soon wiped off on the servants announcing in the night to mr cherry that his father was released three days after the glass of the chariot was taken out of his head he said to his lady  i am now thirty thousand pounds in debt for i am resolved to pay every shilling that my father owed so far was quite right surely but alas he immediately took up his fathers bonds and gave his own mr cherrys fine judgment certainly failed him here almost every one pressed on him to be paid immediately knowing that should he have a son born he had buried two the estate was so entailed that it could not possibly be sold as it was with only daughters they were obliged after the death of their excellent father to get an act of parliament to sell it at a meeting of creditors one day at a judges chambers the editor has often heard her mother say that mr spinckes author of the sick man visited one of the creditors came up to mrs cherry and said it may perhaps madam be an odd thing for a clergyman to say but i must say that mr cherry was a too honest man why not let us wait and receive out interest punctually as we always had done from old mr cherry the celebrated mrs barbara porter arrested mr cherry for her debt of only two hundred pounds for which his granddaughter the editor always hangs her beautiful small picture in the storeroom his other granddaughter often threatens to hang it in a more ignoble place the temple of  to be sure she had a fine face and a clever brain  but the beast had no heart she was mr cherrys godmother he certainly did not learn his exquisite kindness to the distressed from this lady the respectful sheriffs officers conjured him to go to reading gaol in his chariot but he would not took his cane and walked with them he remained there but a few days but the editor has frequently heard her mother say it cost him above an hundred pounds for all the noblemen and gentlemen of the county went to visit him mr cherry experienced the truth of one text of scripture on this event a nephew of his lady who was under very great pecuniary obligations as well as a thousand amiable attentions in his youth begged to be excused being bound for mr cherry saying that he had promised his wife when he married that he would never be bound for any one what a convenient thing a wise sometimes is to  the very worthy vicar of the poor pitiful living or rather starving of white waltham in the gift of mr cherry set out immediately to a gentlemen who had married a near relation of mr cherry desiring him to be joint bondsman with him for mr cherry the gentleman not a very brilliant genius hesitating a little mr griffith said sir mr cherry would be torn to pieces by wild horses sooner than fly from his bail the clergy are certainly in general some few exceptions of dignitaries of the church of  a very liberal body of men the editor takes this opportunity of making her public acknowledgements to the polite amiable mr hambley of herts the present vicar of cookham for his very pleasing conduct to dr berkeley when dr berkeley quitted that lovely spot and to the editor since dr berkeley always left all unpleasant business to the editor as he always made her open letters that he suspected to be unpleasant he charged her to write him word how she liked his successor she wrote him word that in mr hambleys bearing armorial was a lion but that she thought he ought to apply to their friend sir isaac heard to exchange that ferocious animal for a dove or a lamb as also to the exquisitely polite mr barker who succeeded dr berkeley as chancellor of brecon but he has only ten children and he has the excellent bishop stuart of st david for a patron at which the editor most sincerely rejoices those that are judges know that mr barker is a gentleman of profound erudition and that the good bishop has honored himself by preferring mr barker a stranger to his lordship as his very polite son of christs college told the editor until he became his diocesan of  thy unfortunate but truly loving husband f cherry  copia vera verbatim  no date it was written several months before mr cherrys death which he had seen approaching with such entire confidence in the glorious promises of our allgracious redeemer that on the saturday preceding his death which happened on the wednesday he danced until the clock struck twelve his beloved nephew eldest son of his eldest sister james hayes esquire of holyport father of james hayes esquire late one of his majestys judges for north wales then recently married mr cherry said one day to his lady we have not had the newmarried couple to dinner yet we must have them the last venison we shall have this season is fit to dress for every body but myself mr cherry frequently had a haunch hung up like his nephew dr cherry hayes of windsor until it was ready to shake from the bone send over a servant to invite them for saturday of course some other families in the neighborhood were invited to meet them during the time of dinner mr cherry said it is just come into my head that i must have a dance with the bride  mrs cherry objected lest it might injure him he replied my dear i am as well able to dance now as i was the first time i had the happiness there had been a quarrel between the gamekeepers of mr finch and mr cherry their manors joining so there was no visiting mr cherry however met the lady at a neighbors and as in ancient times danced the whole night with her at breakfast one was saying how soundly they had slept and another that they had slept little mr francis cherry said i cannot tell how it was but i could not sleep at all an acute lady said to his anxious mother mr cherry a sort of isaac born after his sisters were almost women  i can tell you why frank did not sleep it was because the finches kept such a twittering at his windows it was impossible he should sleep mr cherry told his single his favorite sister who fell into a consumption and died for the loss of an accomplished young gentleman to whom she was going to be married that if ever he married he then hardly twenty she had seen the lady she replied oh my dear brother that is impossible you know there has been a quarrel between the families  well then i will make peace he did so for never did family live in greater harmony than old mr cherry his excellent lady and mr and mrs f cherry they had no other home either in town or country but shottersbrook house and arundel street  the house now made into three old mr cherry allowed his son l  00 per annum to fly about to astrop bath etc and to relieve distressed objects  a favorite amusement of mr f cherry as well as of his great grandson george monck berkeley esquire to dance with you the young lady one of the most amiable of women  the hayes family are remarkably lucky in choosing sweettempered women at least mr hayes and his son were so may their worthy descendants be as fortunate as their father and grandfather  when these gentlemen lost their lovely mother the editor lost a most sincerely beloved friend and all the surrounding poor a real visible guardian angel adieu sweet spirit  this lady may perhaps like to think that she has danced with her old uncle mr cherry was esteemed one of the finest dancers as well as the first horseman in england and he certainly did not esteem dancing a sin he was not one of the gloomy christians disgracing instead of adorning the doctrine of god our savior he was a great studier of the holy scriptures and had no doubt often read as well as his granddaughter mrs george berkeley although perhaps he had not occasion in those days to quote it so frequently the promise of god by the prophet jeremiah thou shall again go forth in the dances of them that make merry the late john wesley says in his ridiculous account printed by himself of his seminary for educating young hypocrites the children at certain times are allowed to recreate themselves there was surely need that they should be recreated after being under his tuition for the word play is never used never heard of amongst them now god speaking by his holy prophet zechariah says there shall yet again be boys and girls playing in the streets of jerusalem chapter viii ver   it is lamentable to remark that those who affect so much more strictness rigidity or what you please than is enjoined by god himself generally fall into the shameful breach of part of the second table this loading men and poor little children with these heavy burdens and grievous to be borne is often a blind to conceal the breach the open breach of the seventh or eighth commandments mr cherry was certainly not one of this sort of christians for until the end of his life he his lady and daughters the youngest near sixteen at the time of her fathers death always danced several nights every full moon at his own and several neighboring gentlemens seats fathers mothers sons and daughters all danced together young ladies were at least as virtuous in those oldfashioned days as they are at present the house of peers was not quite so often applied to for dissolving marriages as they are at present alas let us remember that god speaking of the jewish nation says they assembled by troops in the witty wise pious dr young in his centaur not fabulous says the ladies houses they were as fed horses etc shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this he expressly avoids saying on this nation but on such a nation as this where or whenever seen by his allheartsearching eye we have seen it on france where the hoinous sin of adultery was not as formerly there winked at but gloried in let us of this stillspared nation beware lest we fall into like condemnation it is in the power often of the most unimportant person to browbeat this dreadful growing sin and woe to those who can by their high rank and station in life do it if they do it not to the utmost of their power mr cherry died at    then turning to the butler he ordered him to send the groom over to wooburn to fetch the music it soon arrived and to dancing they went and continued their dance until the clock struck twelve mr cherry went to church on the sunday and died on the wednesday morning following his intimate friend mr nelson the editor has frequently heard her relate the following she thinks curious anecdote of her excellent intimate friend robert nelson esquire when dying he lay several hours speechless perfectly composed taking no nourishment showing no signs of life but it was perceptible that he continued to breathe about four in the afternoon the day preceding his death he suddenly put back the curtain raised his head and uttered the following sentence there is a very great fire in london this night  then closed his eyes and lay some few hours as before the poet says  standing on the threshold of the old etc etc went over from cranford house to spend the day with him and found him dying he stayed as late as he could to have carried the news to lord berkeley that his friend mr cherrys noble spirit had taken its happy flight to the realms of bliss which it did at four in the morning of the next day and it may be hoped the worthy earl some years after if he attended to the rules given to him at his own see lord berkeleys meditations and the countess of s funeral sermon etc both now very scarce books request by his angelic friend mary countess of warwick the favorite sister of the seraphic robert boil  it is impossible to dismiss the short account of that real patriot bishop berkeley without mentioning his voyage to america one grand design of which no doubt was to introduce episcopacy unadulerated episcopacy that of the incomparable church of england into the western hemisphere his lordship frequently declaring if sir   and lord  do continue to succeed in defeating every scheme to introduce it there that noblest grandest part of the british empire of the whole world see bishop berkeleys fine poem on america will be lost they will shake off the mother country in a few years nothing but introducing bishops amongst them can keep them together can keep them loyal as does plainly appear at this time in france the late dr berkeley many years ago once said in a sermon i am persuaded that the sole cause why so idolatrous a church as that of rome has been spared thus long is because they have so strenuously maintained the coequal godhead of the savior of the world and about two years since that very learned divine and excellent preacher the rev dr neve prebendary of worcester said when preaching the reason i am convinced why god has delivered up to such distress devastation and destruction the great kingdoms of france poland and hungary is because they have given up the godhead of the lord jesus christ which in france every one knows was owing to that monster of villainy for he certainly was not an infidel but a rascal voltaire oh why did providence prevent the great earl of peterborough from running him through when his sword was unsheathed to do it gods ways are unsearchable  church and state in every country must stand and fall together what the learned father so ardently wished so earnestly labored after the acute son happily accomplished but it was  after the steed was stolen that the stable door was shut for america is lost now that he is gone to receive the reward of this  good deed and can no longer be browbeat dr berkeley in a letter to a friend  it will never be forgiven i was well aware when i did it it never would but i care little for that  i have great delight in having accomplished it  for it it may be known to those who did not oppose it as it has long been to those that did that dr berkeley prebendary of canterbury by his wise arguments persuaded the learned sensible pious prelates of scotland to consecrate bishop seabury to their honor and the delight of his own amiable spirit and it may be hoped to the everlasting happiness of many thousands of souls for when the opposers saw that one protestant bishop had been furnished to america notwithstanding all their opposition they even sent a few more why such opposition has been made to the conferring of that invaluable blessing on the western world for almost three quarters of a century the opposers best know and at a certain day we shall all know perhaps some may venture a guess before the arrival of that great day   that day for which all other days were made dr young  the editor has frequently heard dr berkeley and his mother who was there say that in rhode island about twenty miles in circumference there were at the time of the bishops residence there no less than sixteen different sects in religion presbyterians baptists of various sorts etc and it was customary for strangers to ask their visitors pray of what religion are you and discourse with them on the subject of their dissent from the other fifteen all however excelled the majority alas in england at present in agreeing that it was necessary to keep one day in seven holy to the supreme governor of the universe accordingly on the bishops making this usual enquiry it was sometimes answered i am a fridayman  i a saturdayman and others acknowledged themselves seekers  that they were seeking for the best religion and had not yet found it these it is to be feared excel thousands in england who never our blessed savior in the holy gospel tells us many shall seek to enter in and shall not be able that we must strive etc the witty dr young speaking of mighty good sort of gentle polite christians one supposes says  who make an unobtrusive tender of their hearts to heaven etc etc etc night thouhgts seek at all when two persons of different sects married a bargain was constantly made that if they changed their religion which they often did twice in six weeks if they did not turn to the husbands or wifes and would exchange it for a new one that new one should be the church of england so tacitly acknowledging that to be best of fifteen different religions surely ladies who are fond of new fashions would find it mighty pleasant to reside sometimes at rhode island  a quite new wateringplace  this account has been confirmed to the editor by the very worthy amiable samuel johnson esquire of connecticut before mentioned in this preface who was a privycounsellor of connecticut the only church of englandman that colony had ever elected he was sent over here before we lost america to solicit a cause before his majestys privy council he was many years here  about seven his father dr samuel johnson a very learned man an eminent presbyterian minister was convinced by bishop berkeleys arguments and saw the divine right of episcopacy he preached several sundays upon it and at length told his congregation that he was so fully convinced of it that the next sunday he should attend episcopal worship and wished them all to accompany him which most of them did telling them that  he should not presume to minister any longer in things sacred until he had obtained episcopal ordination which he soon did he wrote several very learned treatises and a very good hebrew grammar his excellent son had the degree of lld conferred on him by the university of oxford during his residence in england he always spent great part of every summer at dr berkeleys and constantly until after the breaking out of the american war sent over two immense double barrels of fine american newtown pippins the finest growing on long island of which his elder brother was proprietor  the editor used to delight all her friends and neighbors by presenting them with some and herself by making her gardener every year sow some pips in the melonframe and at proper times plant them out there are now eight fine trees thicker than herself bearing six different fruits only one of them resembling the parent fruit one quite through the color of an orange exquisitely finely flavoured for about six weeks when it becomes so nauseously sweet that nothing but her chinese pigs will eat them one a green strong sour apple that keeps till may the editor is a great gardener and made her children such telling her friends that when god created man he placed him in a garden not in a house it was sin that made an house necessary as well as clothes the young women now contrive to do without clothing the editor wishes some contrivance could be found out for aged matrons to do without houses as rent and taxes run away with much of a small income  in one thing however the different sectarists both men and women all agreed viz in a rage for finery to the great amusement of bishop berkeleys two learned elegant friends sir john james and richard dalton esquire the men in flaming scarlet coats and waistcoats laced and fringed with the brightest glaring yellow the sly quakers not venturing on these charming coats and waistcoats yet loving finery figured away with plate at their sideboard or rather beaufait one to the no small diversion of bishop berkeley sent to england and had made on purpose no such thing being to be found a noble large teapot of solid gold and enquired of the bishop when drinking tea with him whether friend berkeley had ever seen such a  curious thing on being told that silver ones were much in use in england but that he had never seen a gold one ebenezer replied aye that was the thing i was resolved to have something finer than any body else they say that the queen queen caroline has not got one the bishop delighted his ridiculous host by assuring him that his was an unique and very happy it made him  oh the fools say rather the knaves if the kingdom of god as speaks st paul does not consist in meat and drink can it signify whether an insignificant individual wears a coat or gown of one color or another  the editor once met a rich quaker woman at tea at the house of a person of quality in her neighborhood and happened to have on a pair of very fine point ruffles purchased at the time of her marriage for she loved her children too well to buy fine point or lace afterward after tea the company as is surely pleasant in summer went out to stroll in the garden when the lady of the house called the attention of the quaker to the editors lace she piously shook her wise head and said  i doubt thee be proud of them vain of them the editor quietly replied i hope not why should i i am a gentlemans daughter and a gentlemans wife and i have from my cradle been dressed as such and if thee  the editor always thees and thous them  they like sir or madam much better but if they will not give it they ought in conscience not to receive it  and if thee wilt excuse me i do not think that i have half the vanity that thou have for i have not once called the attention of any of the company to my ruffles and thou have gone to every individual in the room to show them that bauble at thy watch telling them it was given to thee by lady  and taking that opportunity of showing a very fine watch besides as that is a solid pebble not an egg that opens to hold something to regale thy nose i fear it must be deemed a vain ornament now ruffles keep my arms warm a circle gathered round the lady who exhibited the ruffles friend  and mrs berkeley they all laughed much and the poor quaker said thee be right it is of no use i will take it off when i go home and lock it up  when dr berkeley was rector of action a female quaker who lived in the next parish and was said to rouge her cheeks hearing the same of dr berkeleys preaching desired to go to acton church with mr and mrs w a day or two after mr ws family dining at dr berkeleys mrs w said mrs  was a little out of luck last sunday then related as above adding that ever she should come to hear her people so tuned the sentence alluded to was all christians of every communion agree in this point excepting the quakers if indeed they can be styled christians who have no sacraments at all and who do not allow of water baptism despising that important denunciation of our adored redeemer except a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of heaven the friend however told mrs w that dr berkeley was a very fine preacher  bishop berkeley was a real patriot not a patriot as that prelate always wittily styled his own bawling as he called them countrymen the contrasts to himself dean swift dr madan and a very few more temporal at the head of the list the excellent marquis of waterford it has been mentioned above that dr berkeley had the honor to be nearly related to the marchioness at dinner one day the editor asked dr berkeley if he had read the paper he said no he had been out riding  why then you have not seen that the king has made a marquis of your cozen lord tyrone  he has done very right in so doing he would not have overpaid him had he created him a duke  why so  because lord tyrone has saved ireland he was the only man who could and he has contrived to get the arms out of the hands of the papists when that poor  sir   had been weak enough to put them into their hands he knowing nothing of the politics of that kingdom how indeed should a lshire squire saviors of ireland the power of the drapiers letters all know bishop berkeleys letter to the roman catholics of the diocese of cloyne as mentioned above had its deserved attention from the wise clergy of that communion throughout the nation the lower rank of roman catholics all round the neighborhood of cloyne with one voice used to declare that they did not trouble themselves who had the best right to the crown king george or king charles but my lord ie the bishop knew very well  and they would therefore fight for whoever his lordship bid them one popish gentleman alas forfeited his vast estate at the age of only eighteen for having raised some of his tenants in the service of king james just after the battle of the boyne he had not marched them off his own estate but unluckily that estate lying conveniently for two of his protestant relations it was forfeited and he reduced to extreme poverty residing in a cottage with a wife and two daughters when bishop berkeley went to reside at cloyne in the year      he found the unfortunate mr fitzgerald as above described and in his grand climacteric he habited him comfortably gave him an invitation to dine at the palace every day bought him a quiet horse on which he rode out in fine weather the bishop keeping it and one of his grooms attending to it when any person dined at the palace beside the bishops family mr fitzgerald at his own entreaty always dined at the stewards table to whose room he every day retired to smoke his pipe dr berkeley and his brother when there was not company frequently attending this  cullen of other times to hear as youths and girls of sense always wish to do what was transacted before their parents were born  mr fitzgerald had a small potatoe ground and two cows the editor honors the lower ranks of people in ireland for their kindness to their fallen superiors as mrs fitzgerald kept no maid the neighboring poor women milked her cows made her butter scalded her vessels etc saying often to the bishops lady that it was not fitten the poor laady and her daughters should do such drudgery so they amongst them did it for them bishop berkeley on his leaving ireland to go to reside at oxford to superintend his sons education there left a certain establishment at cloyne mr fitzgerald dined there every day as usual his horse being kept etc  on hearing of the death of bishop berkeley he exclaimed my only friend is gone leaned back on his chair and instantly expired he died speaking the truth the editor has no doubt the worthy successor of bishop berkeley would have continued the same amiable attention for although bishop stopford grandfather of the very worthy earl of courtown was esteemed a very covetous man  perhaps he was a saving man a very different thing  the editor feels pleasure in an opportunity of publishing the conduct of  dear jemmy as bishop berkeley always styled bishop stopford dr berkeleys mother one day saying your father kept every thing in as good repair as you do for at his death even stopford could not make any demand for dilapidations to which dr berkeley replied pardon me my dear madam it was that he would not saying i will not have any thing overlooked for i will not take a shilling dilapidation from the family of my dear friend bishop berkeley the editor cannot here refrain from relating a bon mot of her honored fatherinlaw which if she could envy any body any thing she should envy bishop berkeley his predecessor once on a visit at cloyne to bishop berkeley asserted a vast circle at the table that  all mankind were either knaves or fools bishop berkeley instantly said pray my good lord to which class does your lordship belong he hummed a little while then replied why i believe to both bishop berkeley made a graceful assenting bow and when relating the ancedote used to say there never was a truer character given by man  of any man  as he conceived for the editor has frequently heard mrs berkeley say that neither of the earls his kinsmen who divided his estate ever gave him a shilling it was not pleasant to them to hear him named  one day when they their ladies and families had dined at bishop berkeleys just as the coaches were driving out of the courtyard a violent clamor was heard scolding screaming crying it was alas poor mrs fitzgerald and her daughters reproaching their noble rich not alas very  rich in good works etc kindred with avarice and cruelty enjoying their estate and leaving them to starve but for the good bishop  the very grateful mr fitzgerald had made a will the editor has frequently been told by bishop berkeleys learned agreeable friend richard dalton esquire that his friend sir john james baronet told bishop benson that he had bequeathed his very large estate excepting a few legacies to his dear friend bishop berkeley bishop benson wrote what he lovely man thought the pleasant news to cloyne and received in return a thundering letter as mr dalton termed it saying do you tell james that i will not have his fortune bid him leave it to his relations i will not have it sir john on hearing this bequeathed it to the old chevalier de st george  so of course his relations got it he had after bishop berkeley went to cloyne boceme a papist a very long letter of bishop berkeley to sir john james on that occasion is one of the letters which will compose part of the second volume of berkeleys literary relics if it is ever printed as also a very curious singular case of conscience submitted to and determined by another eminent prelate of the church of england  which was sent to mr berkeley at christs college bequeathing in case the house of stuart should ever come to the throne and the poor proprietors have their estates restored his whole property excepting fortunes to his two daughters to bishop berkeleys eldest son and requesting the possible king to grant the title conferred on him by king james of baron monteagle on the bishops son  neither doctor berkeley nor his son could ever be persuaded by their friends to go to court and be presented without any cause calling them thither both laughed at the idea of almost every country squire and unpreferred divine going to st jamess he used to answer one old friend who often urged him on the subject by saying when his majesty wants me he will send for me he knows who i am and where i live and my curate that surely finest of all fine preachers the late pious mr harmer goes frequently and that is enough  dr berkeley felt gratified by a gentleman of his majestys household once telling him that on asking leave of absence for a few days his royal master asked whither he was going he replied to dr berkeleys at cookham his majesty said  his father was an honor to human nature his majesty had not a more active zealous friend than dr berkeley nor certainly a more disinterested one  dr berkeley was at a very great expense to disperse his famous sermon on the thirtieth of january only a few months before his lamented death he printed the sixth edition on common paper and had one thousand of them dispersed over england on its first publication it went through five editions in four weeks he has repeatedly told the editor that the notes of the fifth edition in small duodecimo not now to be purchased for any sum are all except one answers to letters from lords and gentlemen some admiring some with nicodemus enquiring how can these things be see the third chapter of the holy gospel as recorded by saint john  to have answered all the letters received on that sermon he said would have taken a ream of paper one from the editors not dr berkeleys old acquaintance soame jenyns written a very short time before the death of that entertaining agreeable great genius and at length devout christian is carefully preserved by the editor who lately found an odd glove in her cabinet that happened to be dropped by a beloved friend the last time she ever visited her about twenty years ago the editor has a picture of her friend and other souvenirs yet the glove is still preserved with care why is it perhaps it brings the last idea of the beloved object to the mind one knows not why else perhaps the mind of man can never be fully defined by man yet it is a delightful study surely next to observing the wonderful ways of providence of both like the late queen of prussia on her deathbed as related by her royal descendant see memoirs of the house of brandenburg written by the late king of prussia before his acquaintance with voltaire the editor hopes ere long to know more  perhaps two sincerer more disinterested patriots have not existed in any country at any time than bishop berkeley and his son dr berkeley both very great politicians the bishop publicly his son more quietly frequently suggested hints to the minister for the time being for the benefit of the country some of which he had the pleasure of seeing were attended to although the letters when the advice was thus conveyed were generally anonymous he using to say if the advice is wise a man of sense will attend to it come how it may adding i write frequently to mr pit and sometimes send him a message dr berkeley suggested and it was attended to some additional benefit for the poor common soldiers the editor is no politician  not that she does not esteem females equal to politics sir robert walpole used to say that an old friend of the editors father mrs waller of hallbarn near beaconsfield grandmother of the present mr waller  understood the interests of this nation better than any man in it mrs waller a daughter of old aislabies had a very superior understanding  dr berkeley was universally admired as a letterwriter he wrote such the editor fears to set down lest it should seem incredible during archbishop seckers life the annual amount of the postage of dr berkeleys letters  the editor always keeps the letteraccompt separate and an heavy enough account it is most years even her own now  when her beloved friends were living it was sometimes quite frightful  and after his graces death numbers of persons who had never seen his face wrote to him to request his advice how to get a place or preferment he benevolently answered them all and generally directed them into a track that led them right the plan he pursued was once practiced against himself at the election of the late amiable lord lichfield when standing for the chancellorship of the university of oxford during the reign of george the second his lordship being an honest tory was likely to be hardrun his lordship lamenting one day to a relation of the editor the late sensible cynical richard rowney esquire fellow of all souls college that he feared mr berkeley of christ college would not vote for him asked if mr powney had any interest with dr berkeley just then made vicar of bray ives place is in bray parish the editors acute kinsman replied that he could not take the liberty to ask mr berkeley for his vote but added  i can put you in a way to secure it if you are acquainted with the archbishop of canterbury  lord lichfield replied yes intimately so  oh then i will promise you mr berkeleys vote  go yourself to lambeth and request his grace to ask mr berkeley to vote for you the advice was exactly followed the editor has repeatedly heard dr berkeley relate to various persons  it happened before she was acquainted with dr berkeley  the archbishop wrote to dr berkeley the letter still exists dr berkeley answered it per return of post telling his grace that according to one statute he had sworn to observe lord lichfield was not eligible and although he respected lord lichfield his conscience would not permit him to vote for him  that he had always determined not to vote against him and most sincerely wished he might be elected chancellor soon after dr berkeley went to stay at lambeth he told his grace that such a statute said so and so his grace replied hah i believe it may but i never understood it so before you were or are quite right sir in not voting for lord lichfield for according to that he is or was  the editor forgets whether this conversation was prior or subsequent to the election quite right in not voting for his lordship  as the editor does not read latin she is no judge of this matter but she knows it is happy for the poor patients in the infirmary that his lordship was chancellor numbers so alertly for his friends and common acquaintances to serve them indeed the chief business of the trio father son and grandson seemed to be to assist serve and benefit every one but themselves  it is supposed by many that knew him through life in early life and until nearly the latest period of life that dr berkeley had by his advice direction and assistance made the fortunes of more men than any private person not in station to do it than any man in the three kingdoms so as sometimes to occasion mrs berkeley to say to him my dear friend you can make every mans fortune or put him in train to do it himself but your sons why do you not try to get some appointment for him to help him until he can at least will help himself by going to the bar his constant reply was alas no poor fellow i cannot ask any thing for him or for myself he must make his own fortune for me god may raise him some friends  mr monck berkeley by his mothers earnest advice to him in youth never meddled with politics she always telling him it was time enough if ever he should be in a station to require it how many creatures stamp themselves for fools by bawling for or against a party when they have hardly left bawling for a good whipping  a gentleman many years ago said to the editor what a man dr berkeley is the day before yesterday at  some public dinner it was said that an officer one of the company was going to ireland some one asked if he had many acquaintances in that kingdom  not one  dr berkeley politely asked in what part the colonels regiment was quartered and then said i will do myself the pleasure of giving you two letters sir that perhaps may be of some little service to you although they are very hospitable in ireland he called for pen ink and paper twirled his chair round to a small table and in i think little more than five minutes produced two such letters to the colonel we all talking and babbling the whole time as i am sure i could not have written in five hours my gd what a clever fellow he is  mrs frinsham sometimes when going into the library and seeing half a score letters lying on the table would say well well what a pity it was your father did not put you prentice to be secretary of state you would have scribbled away so finely to all the princes and potentates that it would have done their hearts good to read your epistles to which as when many persons have said how remarkably dr berkeleys talents seem calculated for the diplomatic line  my dear donna anna mrs frinshams nickname amongst her intimate friends i would not have been put prentice to any thing but a clergyman no not if at twentytwo and an half i had received a revelation from heaven that i never should have had any thing more than a curacy of forty pounds a year through life  not many days before dr berkeleys lamented death the editor consoling him with the delightful thought that he had been a most zealous preacher of christ not elegant moral essays from plutarch or seneca he lifted up his still exquisitely fine eyes on her and replied i have my dear and he knows i preached him in sincerity you know i always dreaded being a popular preacher i never wished to please men from the pulpit  bishop berkeley and his grandson both assumed an additional motto of their own choosing as did mr cherry  conscientia mill testes dr berkeley contented himself with the beautiful blessed one of his ancestors dieu avec nous the bishops was non sibi sed toti mr monck berkeleys assumed by him when he was about or rather under twenty on an almost miraculous preservation of the life of himself two other gentlemen his intimate friends still living and their postillion and horses vivat post funera virtus which he engraved in the strings of his crest as is seen in the print prefixed to the poems that mr berkeley from his cradle or rather no cradle as has been before stated to his coffin had numerous hairbreadth escapes from death has been mentioned some time after his death two very extraordinary things occurred which will not be here related one very soon after his interment to an entire stranger to every thing but his name having never even seen him the other to his mother about five months after his decease  the editor again begs pardon for trespassing so long on the public and wishes that she resembled her excellent son in many instances particularly in burning without mercy not as he did whole quires at a time of beautiful essays poems etc for in early youth her manuscripts consisted only of innumerable letters to friends which she trusts they consigned to the flames and a diary of her own very unimportant life from the age of seventeen when being a very early riser in summer and her mother never coming out of her closet to breakfast until ten oclock for the family prayers at mr frinshams were the editor thinks very inconveniently not offered up until after breakfast when tradespeople are coming and the door must be answered in private families  excepting at the house of the late excellent mr and mrs pierce of windsor forest who either in town or country never suffered even the kitchenmaid or groom to answer the door until prayers lessons and psalms were gone through at lambeth palace during archbishop seckers life every servant including the porter went into the chapel at nine in the morning dr berkeley and the editor when resident at acton were one morning a very few minutes too late  the footman dismounted and knocked violently  dr berkeley assured him it was in vain so the glasses were drawn up and in about half an hour the gates were opened the editor on her marriage found the custom at dr berkeleys much better that of assembling before breakfast at nine oclock perhaps not always quite so punctually to a minute as did for more than half a century the pious mother of that just judge sir w h ashhurst what a blessing to individuals sometimes to thousands is a wise pious mother  the editor has frequently heard her mother say that the mother of judge buller although the daughter of bishop trelawny was an angel on earth  she has been one in heaven almost half a century the late worthy charitable marchioness of abercorn was a granddaughter of this lady the poor lamented bitterly at the death of both these ladies  the editors idea is perhaps in most things an almost universal one to take most care of the most valuable things she takes more care of a little fine dresden china than she does of her milkpans and as she used frequently to tell her dear amiable old friend the late lord  when he used to tell her that she took too much care of her soul going to church on weekdays and sunday afternoons that it were better to stay and chat with her friends her constant reply was this little insignificant frame of mine must be laid in the dust one day or other sooner or later but the little spark within must exist for ever therefore i must take some little care about it say what you will and if i cannot make you take a little more care of the spark that animates your noble case why hereafter i shall be noble and you ignoble alas dear amiable friend my mind cannot follow thee with delight beyond thy grave but leave thee in the hands of him that  judges right thou certainly were not of the number of those to whom the psalmist prays god  not to be merciful for thou did not  offend of malicious wickedness thou were neither profane deist nor arian thou had a simple ignorant thoughtless mother and no father from five years old  if the editor by any thing contained in these sheets should induce any in a certain rank of life of her fair she corrects herself she means her red countrywomen for almost all are now become rouge dragons to attend a little to the education of their children and not devolve that very very important charge upon in general a poor ignorant lowlived foreign animal with no other recommendation than that she cannot speak english   it has been of late years much the fashion to decry schools for girls the editor notwithstanding the wish of her amiable friend lord lyttelton that she might have half a dozen girls to educate having neither daughter nor niece and not very intimate with many of her kindred that have girls knows little of schools but thus much she knows of swiss and french governesses that the schools must be bad indeed if not better than these gouvernantes  the swiss gouvernante at lord s used regularly when lady  was in the country and gone visiting to take the young ladies in the evening to visit and drink hot elder wine with the hucksters the bakers the butchers wives of the neighboring village and sometimes to drink tea etc with some of her more distant friends the farmers ladies this the editor knows from ocular demonstration the following fact was many years ago related with horror to the editor by lady p  going one morning in town to call on her cousingerman the late lady  who not being up sent her little girl aged eight years to entertain her the young lady soon began such a conversation as was terrifying on being asked what could make her talk thus  young lady  why to make you laugh  lady p  make me laugh child why i am ready to run up the chimney i am so frightened to hear you whom have you ever heard talk so tell me directly or i will tell your mamma  young lady  why mademoiselle and papas gentleman and they do laugh so at it that i thought it would make you laugh  this illfated illeducated young lady when completely educated made mamma weep instead of mademoiselle laugh  the unfortunate lady  soon after she married lord  told several of her friends that she wondered she was not a streetwalker for that she generally spent every evening whilst the family were in town in a nightcellar with her governess when her careful mother thought her in bed  this unhappy woman has been long divorced and is not remarried she was some few years ago at a waterdrinking place no living soul noticing her an object of great compassion to the editor who never doing any thing in haste was meditating on calling upon her but a very few days ended those charitable meditations for her ladyship alas for her poor creature was soon exhibited leaning on the arm of an hostler ah me her careless mother must one day meet this injured castoff daughter and hear her call aloud for vengeance on her horrid cruel negligence what will she then do  a few years ago a lady asked the editor if she was acquainted with lady  she answered i have not that honor i only know and revere as all must do her great worthiness of character the lady replied alasaday a friend of hers is almost frantic on her account she has got a devil incarnate for governess to lady charlotte it is certainly known that in her own country she was an adulteress and many assert the murderer of her husband and she is so artful so insinuating a creature and has so wound herself in by her seeming worthiness with lady  that she will not believe a syllable against her although she has heard it from several of her friends and i think you might perhaps find some method to convince lady  what a wretch she is the editor assured lady  that she was unequal to the task it must for her be left to god probably his mercy kept the wretchs mask on for lady charlotte has been married several years and the editor has not seen her name in the newspapers as being handed up to doctors commons may she never carry any grist to that mill not for grinding old women young but reducing young women to a worse condition than even old ones  does not the almighty exclaim by the prophet jeremiah shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this jer chapter v ver    the almighty does not expressly confine that tremendous threat of his being avenged to the jewish nation but on any which is guilty of that dreadful crime placed second to murder in the decalogue written by the finger of god himself on mount sinai it would exceedingly delight the editor if she thought that any of the fine ladies and fine gentlemen described in the first ten verses of the fifth chapter of the prophecy of jeremiah who may chance to read this whilst their hair is dressing may be benefited by it it being customary with many people to read some trumpery book at that time the editor generally reads in an old thumbed bible for the powder and pomatum would spoil a good one to her maid which she hopes benefits both parties she means it should as she explains as she reads or rather when she is requested to lay down the book because while the frizzing etc is performing the reading cannot go on especially as the editor is shortsighted  it is now and then some consolation to the editor who hopes these nations may be spared from french brutality a little longer at least till she has made her exit when she hears these lamentable divorce bills sued for that she recollects that at the time of publishing a magnificent edition of the works of that patron of adultery that vile inciter to it that monster voltaire it was said  every christian prince in europe had subscribed to it but the king of england the editor very well remembers her beloved partners comment on it i am sure he has shown himself a christian by not doing it and god will reward him for it dr berkeley on leaving lambeth palace after some days visit on his return to berkshire when he came just to the entrance of the park recollecting that there was a poor dying prelate at knightsbridge called his servant and sent him with an howdye saying i will wait here that you may not heat the horse a very fine one to overtake me just then his majesty rode up dr berkeleys wonderfully fine face caught his majestys eye  turning to the attendant lord he said whose coach is that my lord  please your majesty i cannot tell  i want to know  his majesty rode round and looked in  dr berkeley solus  his majesty asked another attendant at length dr berkeley heard some gentleman say his name is berkeley for the mans arms are the ten crosses  dr berkeley once said to mr monck berkeley alas child we have crosses enough in their arms the editor said she hoped she did not make the ten eleven both laughed and proceeded to talk of something pleasanter   the old prophet jeremiah would be a very excellent tutor to many very fine people of both sexes as the third chapter of isaiah would to many of the quondam fair now red sex the editor recollects that there is a text in her oldfashioned book a kind of threat to ladies  thou rendest thy face with painting  it is we see so very oldfashioned one wonders that fine ton ladies practice it the poor old immensely vulgar editor does honestly own it ever did ever must whilst she retains her senses occasion her not respecting although she loves some who do it  as the editor is writing this her sister is reading to her the direful catastrophe of lord c t about three years ago the editor was told by her friends that she ought to write a preface to her dear sons poems when she determined to give the opinion of two wise men and her own although an imbecile female of a book which dr berkeley declared he esteemed to be the first the best work of this century mr monck berkeley said that if young men of sense would read it only cursorily that it must prevent their gambling the editor charmed with it on reading only thirtyfive pages of the first volume then at canterbury laid it down put on her hat and cloak and posted off into the city to the booksellers to subscribe for herself  her sister then at her own abode  and her son then abroad mrs berkeley ever delighting to benefit her fellow creatures in her very narrow sphere did many of her friends the kindness to compel them to subscribe to a treatise on suicide gaming and duelling by the reverend charles moore of boughton blean kent the editor used constantly when soliciting subscriptions after the publication of the first incomparable volume to say it is for your own sake not mr moores although he is a very old acquaintance a very highly respected friend on dr berkeleys going to cookham in the summer mrs berkeley invited several of her berkshire friends and neighbors to subscribe among these was her very worthy respected neighbor lady y who replied oh my dear mrs berkeley i cannot afford it cannot afford it poor soul shall i lend you a guinea  why i did not bring my husband quite fourscore thousand pounds and yet i have afforded it who laid it down as a rule since i had children never to buy a book but at a stall i do not think my friend sir george will either thrash or scold you  no no but i cannot afford it mrs berkeley declared she would not lend it her unless she would subscribe another neighbor did as the sequel of the little tale will show two or three evenings after mrs berkeley called on lady y to ask if she would take a walk with her to view the progress of her ladyships castle of  then building on the servants announcing mrs berkeley her ladyship sprang from the sopha exclaiming my dear madam i am so happy to see you you cannot imagine i have been this hour determining every minute to go to you to ask if i am too late to subscribe to mr moore it is surely the most excellent book i have read a long time do pray take my guinea  all that mr moore would suffer to be paid for those two excellent volumes in quarto  i was not able to quit it and luckily you are come  the editor would not take this ladys subscription for she never receives any money but what is her own due lest as she tells her friends as we say in scotland  she is not over rich she should forget and spend it on herself to prevent which when compelled to be treasurer for any friend for a few weeks she always seals it up and writes on it to whom it belongs she however promised to write directly to her worthy old acquaintance mr rivington to learn about the matter and the name of poor lady y appears in the additional list of subscribers  some time afterward this worthy friend of the editor at her request procured a very advantageous appointment in the army in india for the eldest son of mr moore who although a very excellent scholar as dr berkeley told the editor was resolved to be a warrior and we had then happy days the editor although no politician is clearly for carrying on the war until there is some established government in france with whom to make peace or peace may be much more horrible than war it is like a silly girl marrying because she has a stern father or a cross mother poor souls  no war of our own in europe mr moore and his lady and the editor dares believe the young gentleman felt great gratitude to good lady y for exerting her influence with her brotherinlaw sir j c the editor wishes that for the benefit of society mr moore would put forth an edition in halfcrown numbers there are anecdotes enough to furnish a fine print for every number for as mr monck berkeley used to say it is as entertaining as a novel with this difference that the facts are real and as pious as thomas a kempis thousands would then read and profit by it who otherwise will never hear of it  bishop berkeley used to say if i had the voice of stentor i would become hoarse in calling on all particularly on persons of high rank take care of the education of your children if my lord ms has done so he may meet his children in a more august court than that of st jamess without horror see a most excellent sermon of the pious learned dr doddridge  on childrens turning out wicked  if not perhaps it might be wise in him to place himself in the situation before the throne of mercy in which thirtysix years ago in the summer of    0 he thought proper to place mr c a very respectable gloucestershire gentleman at the swan inn at cheltenham on both his knees begging this great mans pardon not only all the gentlemen who dined there witnessing it but all the town the sashes being up standing on each others shoulders to behold so wonderfully noble a conduct  at the time when this circumstance happened the editor and her sister were returning from drinking tea at the rooms to their lodgings below the swan inn such a crowd none could pass after waiting some time they desired their footman to push through and learn what occasioned this violent concourse after some time the servant returned he was a very worthy gloucestershire man so knew mr c saying oh madam it is young mr c upon his knees begging pardon of an officer  both the miss frinshams at the same instant   upon his knees  servant  yes madam and he is making a long speech and all the gentlemen are standing round them looking very grave  the next morning the walks echoed with this wonderful transaction  three of the editors old intimate friends the late sir william and sir septimius then colonel robinson and the sensible worthy philip sharp esquire clerk of the privy council lamented over mr cs having unluckily said that he understood not the use of the sword could not fight that declaration all present agreed produced the genuflexion cheltenham rang with this noble deed during the season it determined the editor then a young single woman that if ever she did marry and should produce a son he should learn to use a sword although she trusted he might never meet with a son of the noble m never draw it in any private quarrel  mr monck berkeley had the honor the pleasure to be well known to the sweet amiable lord l eldest son of the m as he termed him on the editors asking in her wonted way what is he or she like it may be hoped this dire calamity may bring this noble m on his knees  the idea of a nobleman or gentleman upon their knees to any but god brings to the editors mind a circumstance of a noble duke upon his knees not to beg pardon repeatedly related to her by her mother  it has been mentioned before that the great controversial writer charles leslie greatgrandson of the excellent bishop of rothes the only scotch friend of the unfortunate queen mary as good sir nicholas throcmorton was her only english one spent much time at mr cherrys mr leslie was staying with mr cherry at his house in town at the time of the great storm in   0  mr cherrys lady always winter as well as summer rose every morning at six oclock until within two years of her death at    when she lay till seven she never went to rest till between twelve and one her daughter mrs frinsham and one of her granddaughters not the editor could live almost without sleep mrs cherry used to say finches were early birds in the morning at halfpast five when the housemaid went in to light mrs cherrys fire mr leslie followed her in saying is the report true or are my good friends living both at once blessed the mercy of god that they were he replied the whole street have been up all night except yourselves and are telling each other ah poor mr cherrys family they are all killed servants and all i lay till my bed was quite covered with bricks from the chimney  i then got up and went to the farther corner and have sat there ever since the first hour mr cherry had gone up to see after his little girls  their excellent french governess entreated him not to awake them so they slept through it  where she had often heard the following little anecdote related by mr leslie as the origin of mr leslies four short marks to ascertain the truth of historic facts related as having past long since and which the editor has repeatedly heard from many learned men cost the late dr conyers middleton twenty years trying but all in vain to refute  an excellent lady a friend of mr cherry was very intimate with the then duke of leeds who was a deist they often disputed on the subject the lady happened one day to lament that although the duke would never pervert her to deism she should never be able to convert him to christianity for he took all her arguments to pieces in short his grace was a better logician than the lady who said now if mr leslie would teach me some arguments i could urge them and perhaps rescue my noble friend from his sad error mr leslie replied i will endeavor to furnish you with some arguments that if his grace has an honest mind will convince him of the truth of revelation accordingly the four marks were given to her and she soon produced them to her noble friend  the next morning as early as it was proper to send to a fine lady perhaps rather earlier at the end of the seventeenth than at the close of the eighteenth century the duke sent to request that the lady would have the goodness to desire the gentleman who had written that paper to visit him with her on mr leslies entering the apartment the duke went toward him and like cornelius to saint peter acts chap x  fell on his knees burst into tears thanked him and besought him to pray to god to forgive the having lived so long in ignorance and error said that he had sat up the whole night reading it over and over impatient for the arrival of the morning to see and bless the hand that had rescued him from eternal misery  whoever has as honest a mind as this wise excellent duke may read these four marks almost verbatim transcribed by the pious mr nelson in the monday and tuesday in whitsunweek in his feasts and fasts the very learned late reverend meredith jones rector of guestling prebendary of chichester chaplain to the present bishop of chichester in a most incomparable work of his written when a young man without his name and printed for b white in      says i defy any honest arian not to be convinced by the proofs here produced the book is almost as scarce as it is excellent it proves that the filiation of the savior of the world did not commence until after the angel gabriel had been sent to the blessed virgin the excellent and very deeply learned mr roman says that the distinction in the trinity of father son and holy ghost are only office names for he was oldfashioned enough to believe that in this trinity none was greater or less than another etc see the anathasian creed the book on which the witty frank coventry has placed his hero pompey the little when conversing with his friend puss in his old mistresss closet the editor cannot here forbear setting down her idea of the triune god at seven years old earnestly reading on saintsdays etc this oldfashioned creed she puzzled her little overinquisitive brain to find out some similitude at length standing one evening by the cardtable when the family etc were playing quadrille basto was played and lying some time alone on the table it occured to her young mind that the ace of clubs was the emblem of the triune god  this entirely satisfied all her skeptical doubts at seven years old and they have never blessed be god troubled her since it was a wonderfully odd idea for a child but it entirely delivered her parents from her worrying to explain the trinity to her  the very learned mr hawtry has lately published a similar work for very learned persons few females of the editors acquaintance excepting her two old friends and namesakes mesdames eliza carter and eliza lawrence  the latter styled by dr johnson the english sappho  are perhaps qualified to understand all its merits probably not the learned miss  of whom the editor has heard her son speak who have a little greek a little learning is a dangerous thing would always call the roman orator kickero  a boy should have received a kick for such folly mr monck berkeley detested every kind of affection as much as his mother he delighted much in the conversation of the two abovenamed uncommonly sensible as well as very learned ladies the editor has frequently heard dr berkeley say he would prefer were he to publish a greek work the criticism of miss eliza lawrence now lady of the member for canterbury to most men he knew these two really learned ladies are also two of the best housewives that the editor knows  she thinks that in that absolutely necessary knowledge both these learned ladies equal her ignorant self  the title of mr meredith joness work is the doctrine of the trinity as it stands deduced by the light of reason from the data laid down in the scriptures to which are added some remarks on the arian controversy also a postscript containing some observations on the writings of justin martyr and irenaeus  the editor trusts for her own sake as well as that of others that she draws near a conclusion of this very long preface not quite unexampled for one of the acutest writers of the latter end of the last century that wonderful genius charles leslie in his incomparable book entitled the snake in the grass perhaps it might not be amiss if some of our learned divines who are such strenuous advocates for universal unlimited toleration to all the open and sly underminers of the excellent church of england  until she as in the last century receives her toleration from them when archbishop usher taught school for a groat a week and two poor suffragan bishops joseph hall and jeremy tailor for twopence a week  if these learned modern divines would take a hint from an aged matron and now that leslies snake is coming boldly out of the grass just peep upon him in the grass  they might be better prepared to encounter his hissing  has made his preface considerably longer than the work itself the editor is conscious that she ought hardly to presume to write her name in the same paragraph with that great man yet is certain that she has the happiness to resemble him in one thing  a most ardent wish to advance the glory of god and the salvation of souls she hopes for pardon at least from those who never give themselves the time or trouble to consider whether they have souls to be saved or not  a young man now no longer an inhabitant of this sublunary world on being one day asked if a friend of his had any religion replied of all the young men of my acquaintance i do not in my conscience believe that excepting  and  there is one that ever gives himself the time or trouble to think whether he has a soul to be saved every one has read the request of a pious dying father to a thoughtless dissipated son  to retire for one half hour every day into a room without either pen ink or book we are told it had the desired effect  he was compelled to think  the editor being oldfashioned and vulgar enough to believe a future state of rewards and punishments and wonderfully addicted when she loses a friend or an acquaintance in idea to follow them over the dark irremiable flood the river of death and to rejoice that whether they would hear or whether they would forbear  for the generality are most  thoughtless that she has suggested to them that it might be wise to think a little about it now and then lest like the wretched lord chesterfield they should when too late experience what he certainly said if i believed one word of the bible i would live like   and some years after not long before his death i have a frightful long journey to take in the dark and i do not know one step of the way could one of those friends return to earth how would they reproach those who forbore to warn them to flee to the only true consolation in time and through the countless neverending ages of eternity  the editor ever addicted to scribbling to composing  for she amused herself with writing two sermons at eleven years old  has long been in the habit of composing prayers for her own sole use not for her own sole benefit  takes leave here to subjoin a part of one used by her every morning as soon as she opens her eyes and to her wonder finds herself an inhabitant of this thorny wilderness       grant i earnestly beseech thee o my god that i may not pass this day or any succeeding one of my life without doing some good to the souls bodies or fortunes particularly the souls of my relations friends benefactors servants neighbors and acquaintance or those that i may chance to meet with and this i beg for the merits death and passions sake of him who went about doing good to all  who died for all who truly call on him  jesus christ the righteous the editor daily uses the very short beautiful prayer of armine nichol the famous pious german maid servant now as much higher as she was here holier than perhaps any of her contemporary princesses of the whole germanic body that every one who reads this may profit by it is the ardent wish of the editor eliza berkeley  of mr monck berkeleys genius many of those who read what he has written may be competent judges to attempt to do justice to the exquisite amiability generosity and nobleness of his heart the wonderful strength and soundness of his judgment the brilliancy of his imagination and ready wit his wonderful wilfulness in youth the great steadiness of his temper and the exquisite loveliness of his nature even in very early youth would fill a small volume which would be an entertaining one and would require the knowledge of the writer of this preface and the pen of his favorite dr johnson  mr berkeley like the excellent honorable captain hamilton of the lancaster man of war father of the marquis of abercorn never could behold a cloud of distress on any brow even on that of a perfect stranger without not only wishing but even endeavoring to remedy or alleviate their sorrows in which they both often succeeded with high and low many curious instances of which might be related  of the excellent amiable captain hamilton the editor has frequently heard his very worthy brother the honorable and reverend mr hamilton canon of windsor relate the following story which shall be given in his own words  my brother was going one day from town to dine with several of his friends at lord s name forgotten by the editor it was at the time when westminster bridge was either building or repairing captain hamilton got into the great ferryboat after having seated himself he observed a middleaged farmerlike man sitting with his arms folded regardless of all that passed no one perhaps but my excellent brother would have thought of enquiring into the cause he spoke to him two or three times his answers were as laconic as might consist with civility this only served to convince my brother that the man was under some distress which it was possible he might alleviate if he could but find it out accordingly he requested one of the passengers to exchange seats with him he now placed himself close to the poor man and said my friend you seem unhappy  farmer  yes sir i am so  capt h  can i do any thing to relieve you  farmer  no sir i thank you  capt h  do my poor friend tell me your distress perhaps i may be able to assist you  farmer  no sir you cannot  nobody but my brother would after this have persevered he entreated the man to tell him the cause of his distress who began thus  oh sir you are so kind i must tell you about a fortnight ago a man came to my house in devonshire telling me that a relation of mine had died very rich and left me and my brothers his money but that i must go to london to see after it or we should lose it i took him in made him very welcome and in a few days set out with him for london mounted on two of my best horses he said i must carry a pretty good bag of money the editor thinks it was about l 0  just to fee the lawyers and bear my expenses in town i paid the road all the way up the morning after we came to town he took me to westminster hall where we saw a vast many lawyers in black gowns but he said his lawyer was not there that day and we must go again but advised me as he was more used to london than i was to let him carry the moneybag we walked about a day or two to look at fine places and yesterday we got in one place into a great crowd and i lost him i have been looking for him and for the inn where we lodged and cannot for the life of me find either i am afraid the man is a rogue and i shall lose all my money but that i do not value if i could but have got my poor horses for they are very fine and worth a deal of money  my brother asked him in what part of the town his inn lay  he replied that never having been in town before he knew not nor the sign of the inn only that it had great gates  my brother said well my friend instead of going to my friends you and i will go back to london in the boat and try to find your inn and your horses  the poor mans countenance brightened they returned set out on this benevolent wildgoose chase my brother charging the man to keep fast hold of him if they got into any crowd every inn from whitehall quite through the city the strand and holborn was shown to him after some hours they got into aldersgate street at the upper end of which the poor man exclaimed oh god bless you sir this is the inn he flew into the yard went to the stable where stood his two fine horses which the sharper had not taken away my brother enquired if he did not want money to take him home the honest man replied no god reward you sir luckily i took three guineas loose in my pocket before i gave him the bag to take care of    the angelichearted captain hamilton left his party to dine without him and joined them not until the next day it is almost superfluous to add that whilst he resided at bearhill house in berkshire he was the idol of all his neighbors high and low  he enjoyed the peace of god which made him ever cheerful and he had wonderful good will toward man an attempt to describe the sincere lamentations at his early one must not presume to add untimely death the editor cannot forbear to insert here part of a letter written at the time by an old intimate friend of her early youth  the learned benevolent author of  christianity not founded on argument  your excellent neighbor poor captain hamilton got on the keel of the boat three times and was washed off again he humbly earnestly begged the sailors pardon for having brought them into such peril told them how merciful god was in granting them that little time to fly to christ for mercy he preached like an apostle upon my word christianity cuts a noble figure in the hands of such an hero a naval officer not many months ago told the editor what she never heard before that captain hamilton had not been drowned at last but that he was pinioned  he was endeavoring to take off his coat when the waves washed him off the third time who can reget that he went to glory in heaven so many years sooner than by the course of nature would be as vain as fruitless  this excellent man lived to christ was owned by him in death and is now rejoicing with him in glory captain hamilton was convinced that not every one that says lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven he acted as well as talked like a christian having constantly prayers twice every day onboard his ship and when on land his family was constantly assembled as often an eminent divine says although adams sin does yet grace does not run in the veins captain hamiltons mother was not a saint i e sancta like himself  mr berkeleys mind from the time he could articulate appeared to be of so very extraordinary and singular a turn as determined his mother to watch over him with the utmost vigilance during the time that to use the language of the wise lord halifax in his advice to his daughter we are entirely under your government and indeed through life you have so much influence over us that it behooves us to take the greatest care that you females are well educated  mr berkeley when grown up used frequently to say let a man commit whatever he can except the not being a good greek or latin scholar my mother constantly says that was his mothers fault poor young man  mrs berkeley as constantly charged the improper behavior of young ladies on the father if he was a man who had lived in the world it would be cruel to charge it on a man entirely devoted to study but there are few such now amongst persons of a certain rank in society  mrs berkeley from long observation saw how naturally youths are attached to the mother and girls to the father the reason is obvious the mother is not finding fault with her sons slovenly latin and greek exercises nor the father of the young ladys monkeytricks when she should be learning history geography drawing music etc so much as often to occasion the late excellent lady p the bosomfriend from early infancy of the editor to say it was impossible that children particularly girls should love a mother that did her duty as she ought by them she as her friend always assured her she would experienced the contrary her children when they grew up were lovely and loved her much she was indeed lovely she has frequently wept with vexation that she had not the clam not to be shaken steadiness of mr berkeleys mother it was perhaps according to the old french proverb  dieu done la robe selon le froid mr berkeleys maternal grandfather with the same lovely nature as mr berkeley had when a child of only four years and an half old on his fathers whipping him the third time for wilfulness resolved as the writer of this preface has often heard him say to tire his father out and he thought that about seven or eight times would do it luckily for him his mother entreated his father to give it up to which he replied no i will whip him till tomorrow morning rather than let him get the better of me that he thought would be rather too long so instantly submitted  it was really entertaining to hear from mr berkeley when grown up his wonderfully deeplaid schemes to conquer his mother but he used to add i never did once succeed yet still i persevered till reason pretty early in life convinced me of my folly he would frequently exclaim oh the wise king was inspired when he gave his lessons for education in the book of proverbs and blessed be god my mother had the sense to make his directions the rule of her conduct god knows what would have become of me by the time i had been ten years old with my sort of spirit and temper  from two years old until the last breath he drew perhaps no one ever loved a mother with such exquisite tenderness as mr berkeley of which a million of instances might be related mrs berkeley used often to say on showing any curious thing presented to her by mr berkeley i am persuaded if my son visited any odd place where nothing was to be procured but tanned bulls hides he would say pray pick out the very best and send it directed to mrs berkeley the oaks canterbury  mr berkeleys gratitude to his father was very great on several accounts particularly on two mr berkeley from a child and through life was an enthusiastic lover of music like most he was exceedingly anxious to learn to play the violin which his father early very wisely told him he never should do and mr berkeley used always to say he was sure had he learned it would have been his destruction  in the early part of mr berkeleys life he played on the german flute but an hereditary illness the asthma attacked him at the age of about seventeen the advice of the very judicious worthy dr biddle of windsor so entirely cured him that he never had a second serious attack the doctor said mr berkeley was the youngest patient he ever attended in that frightful disorder he bade him lay aside his german flute and charged him never to give the view halloo mr berkeley at that time hunted regularly twice a week with the buckhounds mr berkeley used frequently at his return on hunting days to say there is a fellow a wellmounted butcher that i longed to knock down he seems to delight in crossing the king so as really sometimes to endanger his majesty nothing ever makes me do it i wonder what the wretch is made of to which dr berkeley used to reply why of bulls hides child to be sure his heart certainly was not cast in the same mould with the amiable elegant butcher standing to represent the town of hythe in parliament whose conduct on the hustings to the peer that opposed him is well known to every kentish person  he wisely obeyed both injunctions  the father and mother of bishop berkeley although not at all related before their marriage mrs berkeley was aunt to old general wolf father of the famous general of that name both died in the same week of the asthma and were interred at the same time in the same grave they were a happy pair through life and happy in not being divided in death it cannot be said that they died an untimely death old lady bannister aged more than an hundred grandmother of the late lady abdy when her children and grandchildren were lamenting over her with her wonted vivacity said children dont stand crying and whining over me i am sure you cannot say that i die an untimely death  both being near ninety they lived to breed up six sons gentlemen bishop berkeley received his school education at kilkenny he had like other boys cut his name with a knife on some post or table it was protected and shown to strangers a very few years ago an irish gentleman told dr berkeley that a malicious boy one day cut it clean out for which the master flogged him very severely the editor does not recollect the name but thinks it was not jones perhaps the poor stupid boy did it on the same principle on which the lowlived wretch acted who burned the temple of diana at ephesus  they lived to see the eldest a bishop some years before their death  a bishop who did honor to episcopacy by his learning his munificence his piety his wonderfully welljudged charities  the sunday after the hard frost set in the bishop appeared at breakfast with his cloynemade wig all the bishops own clothes as well as his liveries were constantly made at the little village of cloyne he permitted his sons to employ a cork tailor the bishops wig was without a grain of powder on his ladys expressing her astonishment at his wonderful appearance he replied we shall soon have a famine and i have expressly ordered that none of the servants put any powder into their wigs neither will i the chaplain secretary and all took the hint a certain bishop as soon as the tax was laid took out a license for three men and his ladys maid bishop berkeley during the frost and scarcity gave every monday morning twenty guineas to the poor  primate boulter gave to the poor that winter ten thousand pounds the then lord bishop of cork dr peter brown whoever has not read bishop peter browns sermons those which describe our frail no longer frail bodies when clad with glory has much pleasure to come  uncle to the late agreeable archbishop of tuam and great uncle to the editors young  old friend jemmet brown of riverstown in the county of cork who frequently spent his holydays when at westminster at dr berkeleys a single man gave thirty pounds every week one day the mayor his almoner came when the money being all gone the good prelate gave all his plate  the bishop of cork was great uncle to the reverend james brown of rivers town the present possessor of the fine ring the only jewel which his truly honorable grandsire would accept from the spanish lady after colonel brown had said cease fair lady cease this strife i have in england a fair lady wife i would not falsify my vow for gold or gain no not for all the fairest dames in spain   to be sure colonel brown had some odd ideas perhaps from his grandmother from which most of our modern heroes are entirely free as to the generality of our fair dames of these days if they chance to meet with a humoursome or unkind husband parents are wretches who marry poor girls of sixteen or seventeen to animals to hodmadods because they are rich the editor had formerly two friends thus sacrificed at sixteen one had thirtyfive thousand pounds the other had seventy thousand pounds neither had they been permitted to remain single until twentytwo would have taken their husbands for underfootmen the six thousand pounds per annum was alas still is a noisy mischievous baboon the other a poor quiet stupid rake who several times endangered in fact ruined his ladys health  but peace to his manes  he died a penitent and left his relict immense riches all he had the other lives perhaps to get the silken halter which the editors sister mrs frinsham promised a lady who said that she thought he deserved every thing but an halter mrs frinsham in her wonted way said yes yes hang him you may give him a silk halter if you please both these very sensible highly cultivated ladies made most excellent wives one alas still does  almost too good for she suffers this wretch to force her to request her excellent worthy eldest son to enable the father to beggar by degrees himself a woman owes a duty to her children as well as to her husband  they fly to an officer of the guards instead of to some old reverend divine for counsel and consolation as our greatgrandmothers were wont to do for to suppose that there were no unpleasant husbands in the last century would be to suppose that miracles had not then ceased but the beauteous young dames were then differently educated and decently attired  a few years ago mr brown taking his ring off to wash his fingers after dinner three ladies hid it from him for three days he supposed it lost and was as he well might exceedingly distressed they deserved a trip at least half way to botany bay for their cruelty since which he has never worn it but keeps the invaluable jewel locked up and only shows it to those friends who wish to see so noble so honorable a curiosity  in one of mr berkeleys idle fits he was wild to go into the army that he might take a handsome leave of greek and latin and by a noble connection of his fathers he had the offer of a cornetcy in the oxford blues this at the age of fifteen put him into an extacy and he used all his eloquent rhetoric on his father to obtain his permission but as he used to say happily in those things my father was as steady as my mother in other respects where she was concerned  dr berkeley used to say to his son if after you have left eton and spent four years at oxford you wish as it is possible you may to go into the army you shall have my free consent  dr berkeley valued an english ie not a foreign university education as highly as did the editor from the age of fifteen nothing could have tempted her to marry a gentleman who had not passed some years either at oxford cambridge or dublin it certainly infuses something into the brains even of the most hairbrained youths that they very rarely get elsewhere several gentlemen of the different regiments of cavalry constantly quartered at canterbury had received that advantage and dr berkeley who sometimes dined at the mess with his military acquaintance at his return home used to say i wonder all the young men when they see the deference paid by the whole regiment to captain or major  do not use their time of absence at the university  mr berkeley during his residence in scotland accepted a commission in the royal edinburgh volunteers raised to quell some riots in the neighborhood of that city which occasioned a gentlemans asking him if he had not some thoughts of going into the army he replied no sir my fathers wisdom kept me out when i was an idle boy and my own will keep me out now that i am a man nothing but his majestys erecting his standard will ever make me a military man in that case i should feel it my duty to repair to it  one trait more of mr berkeleys singular temper shall suffice like all other children he had been early told that it was utterly impossible to form a syllable in any known language without the aid of at least one vowel it was mrs berkeleys constant custom to go every night before she sat down to supper to the rooms of her children for she never suffered them to sleep together to see if they lay straight and had closed their eyes before they went to sleep as many eyes are injured by sleeping without this necessary care one night on entering mr berkeleys room she saw his fine eyes rolling about and began to give him a lesson for not going to sleep as soon as he went to bed at seven he replied i cannot sleep for thinking  the misery of too many older persons it certainly occasioned the death of that wonderful genius the late agreeable amiable excellent mr gainsborough dissenting minister at henley upon thames elder brother to the justly celebrated painter mr gainsborough of bath but it may be in general avoided by care as the editor knows by experience and when grown up a man taught her son  for which he blessed her her  the marquis of lansdown has complimented the wise old king by adorning his lovely first ladys costly monument in high wycombe church with several verses from the book of proverbs not engraved in verses but as a long sentence and at the bottom solomon  dr berkeley felt much gratitude to the polite marquis for his very amiable attention in repeatedly obtaining his majestys permission to omit his residence at canterbury during the years he was attending his son at st andrews the marquis and dr berkeley were at christ church at the same time     mrs b  how dared you set to thinking what are you thinking on  mr b  why you have often told me that it was impossible to form a syllable without a vowel and therefore i have long resolved to do it and tonight have been thinking till my head runs round and i believe i have tried five hundred words throwing out the vowels but i have not yet compassed it  before six years old he could spell every word in the english language without book and before he had completed his eighth year knew how to introduce them with propriety when occasion served which rendered his language remarkably elegant  not all mono and dissyllables as is often the case with children insomuch as to make the learned accomplished sir john temple of america say my nephew at near sixteen a pretty good latin and greek scholar can no more express his sentiments in the language of this little creature than i could scale the skies adding i shall watch him as he grows up and farewell to my sagacity if he does not make a most extraordinary man indeed the worthy sir john needs not bid adieu to that trait of his fine strong understanding the editor has not heard of any of her beloved respected american friends for many years  mrs george berkeley being little addicted to going from home and dr berkeleys hospitality very great mr monck berkeley when any of his ton friends or acquaintance were going to the continent margate ramsgate etc etc used to give them a letter of introduction to his father or his mother which occasioned the latter to say that she was the good woman who kept the sign of the berkeley arms this so tickled the fancy of mr monck berkeley that the next time he visited at home he brought a print of lord berkeleys arms framed and glazed  the next day mrs berkeley passing through the hall seeing something that she had not been accustomed to see called to mr wrightson to know what it was he replied that mr berkeley had ordered his man to hang it up this worthy man from his first coming into the family a lad before mr monck berkeleys birth was an excellent hand in assisting dr berkeleys young friends from oxford and his relations from ireland together with the ladies of the family in a joke to enliven dr berkeley when out of spirits he continued it for his beloved mr monck berkeley one of which jokes was a ring at the front gate just as it was dusk to make dr berkeley believe that his dear jemmy hamilton was arrived as mr hamilton never fixed the day this worthy domestic showed his good judgment at fourteen one of the maids saying to him if i was you  i would not help to make a fool of my master so often to which as the editors servant told her mr wrightson sensibly replied indeed i shall dont you think that my mistress the ladies and the young gentlemen know what liberties they may take with my master better than you or i do besides my master was never once angry with me for it in his life only says jack you are are a sad rogue   mrs berkeley having recourse to her glass soon discovered her sons fun and on seeing him told him that his fathers ten crosses had no right to supporters except himself and his mother who ought to take care not to make the ten twelve that if he wished for crowned supporters he must begin to open his mouth in westminster hall one of the earl of berkeleys supporters is crowned as dr berkeley has told the editor to mark that the family are descended from a king  of denmark   mr berkeley conjured his mother to let it hang up to which she consented on condition of its being removed from the hall into the antiroom leading to the eatingroom in the oaks  the arms still hang up  and if any of the editors old friends scotch or english should wish to breathe a little of the soft air of chertsey and happen to recollect that she lives at that beautiful town and call she cannot with truth say that  here is good entertainment for man and horse but she can and does say that there is hearty welcome to  if they are in luck  a slice of leg of mutton  if out of luck  hashed mutton and a tart  and whilst the editors now small stock lasts a bottle of good old port or sherry but after her one glass per diem has exhausted it she believes they must bring their bottle under their arm as the new winetax has quite scared her  mrs berkeley cannot pretend to assert that the berkeley arms is the best inn at chertsey for the swan kept by the uncommonly sensible clever mrs daniel mother of the messrs daniel who have lately published some fine things which the editor cannot afford to purchase and if she could has not time to contemplate and admire as she hears all others do certainly excells the berkeley arms at present for the editor conceives that mrs daniel the postmistress here could conduct a post most innkeepers widows find out very soon that a helpless widow cannot carry on business so  marry their waiter hostler or some such proper man the editor has known in her life three or four who have not she feels unfeigned respect for such wise women when a young woman she always despised mothers  who were threatening their boys with i will tell your papa of you always declaring if god sent her boys she would try if she could not manage them without calling the aid of papa dear lady p used to say you have kept your word to a tittle batchelors wives and maids children is not your case my dear friend you have a knack that is certain i wish i could learn it of you sweet friend thou learned better things  and procure a posthorn the pleasantest music imaginable without sending every letter to and from stains some days there are more than fourscore as the editor is informed  mrs berkeley one day received a letter from her son saying that in about a fortnight she would receive a visit from the princess de lambelle and that he was sure she would have pleasure in making her highnesss few days sejour at canterbury as agreeable as possible in answer to which epistle the editor wrote as follows  my dear son if you will inflict princesses as guests upon your poor mother i hope you will at least have the goodness to instruct her in what manner she is to comport herself toward them she has had the honor to entertain baronesses etc etc up to duchesses but when she comes to princesses she is quite out of her diocese this sentence was a cant phrase in the family a poor lady in the neighborhood of cloyne being seized with a phrensy fever and continuing long ill bishop berkeley being out early one morning before enquiry had been regularly made stepping into the coach asked his faithful old coachman if he happened to hear how mrs  did he replied oh very ill indeed my lord she is quite out of her diocese indeed who is to be invited to meet her what is to become of her suite to be sure they are too fine for john etc   to which an immediate answer was returned of the following purport  only   must be invited to meet her with regard to her suite they will all be at the lion whither i have recommended her highness the marchioness of  and the count and countess of names forgotten will dine with her highness at the same table in the humble eatingroom at the oaks  matters thus adjusted the editor who during dr berkeleys life always kept an excellent cook set her spirit quite at rest expecting in due time the arrival of a fine french lacquais announcing when she must go to the lion request the honor etc  one morning before the expiration of the fortnight on going down to breakfast mr wrightson delivered to her a letter which she saw was directed by her son it contained only  my dearest madam you will have the honor to receive this from the hands of the princess de lambelle and i am persuaded that my father to whom i request you to present my duty and yourself will have great pleasure in doing yourselves the honor to pay every possible attention to her highness in doing which you will greatly oblige  your most dutiful affectionate son and obedient servant georgemonck berkeley   it may perhaps be asked how became mr berkeley so well acquainted so interested for this lovely unfortunate princess his noble friends at blenheim did him the honor to invite mr berkeley during her highnesss visit at their delightful abode mr berkeley escorted her to nuneham and waited on her whilst she viewed all the noble buildings paintings etc at oxford she said she much wished to see cambridge but that if she went she feared she should not find a mr berkeley there  mr berkeley with his wonted amiablility and alertness told her highness that if she wished to go thither he would with great pleasure give her a letter of introduction to the vice chancellor who was a very intimate friend of his father and with whom he had the happiness to be well acquainted the very learned accomplished polite dr farmer master of emanuel college  he accordingly did so she said she wished to see every thing that was curious during her stay in england adding i hear that there is a curious cathedral at canterbury i saw nothing but a very old city and a vast multitude of people  asking mr berkeley as he seemed to have a large acquaintance if he happened to know any one at canterbury to whom he could be so good as to give her a letter of introduction  just to show her what was worthy attention there  mr berkeley told her  that he could most certainly do for that his father and mother resided there and would have great pleasure perhaps mr berkeley in this instance resembled sponsors at the font who promise a great deal indeed which the editor never would never will do whilst she retains her poor faculties promising what pleasure his mother would have  the pleasure would have been by rebound gratifying her lovely son entertaining princesses is too mighty a task for a poor quiet country gentlewoman indeed mr berkeley only said she would receive every attention that her highness certainly and probably would have accepted more graciously than did an english titled dame of mr berkeleys inflicting who talked during the time of dinner as ton dames frequently do  but on the drawing room filling with ladies and gentlemen in the afternoon every way her superior save in birth never opened her mouth but to dr berkeley and the editor which occasioned mrs berkeleys asking her son when he came to the oaks if   was not a very stupied woman  no my dear mother but she despised your visitors she can talk at a fine rout in town i promise you the editor forbears setting down her answer dr young shall now speak  how will ye weather an eternal night  etc etc  on hearing this her highness exulted expecting probably to find as good a showman in the father as she had found in the son dr berkeley could most elegantly most highly entertain his friends in almost every other way but as a showman he was so notoriously bad that a gentleman a very near relation of his used to say george is the idlest dog upon earth one may come from ireland stay a month at cookham live on the fat of the land and but for mrs george berkeley go back again without seeing even either cliefdens proud alcove or windsor castle to say nothing of half a score other beautiful places within a drive of his house to which with much ado mrs berkeley drags him as she will not leave him to dine at home without her the editor laid it down as a rule when she married and she strictly adhered to it never to go any where in a morning that would not admit of her placing herself at table at three oclock unless dr berkeley ordered dinner later  dr berkeley was famous when at oxford for not going on parties so as to occasion mr james hamilton aforenamed to say berkeley had always one answer at oxford oh not i indeed i have seen blenheim  so now it is  i have seen windsor castle etc the fact is dr berkeley on his arrival at oxford the first long vacation flew half over england added to which any bodily exercise brought on with him as with his father who used no exercise at all but in the easiest hung coach for many years a constant hectic feverishness  mr berkeley did not at all resemble a late worthy fellow of all souls college the editor one day many years ago asking a very witty fellow of that college if he was acquainted with dr br of his college he replied in the affirmative adding he is a very worthy man but never thoroughly happy when he has not some prince of the germanic body to escort about the university  the princess de lambelle although she did not see was seen at canterbury the day after her passing through canterbury from dover the editor met her old very highly respected friend captain gostling the editor the last time that she visited canterbury enquiring after her old friend of his wonderfully witty sister mrs h gostling who could banish solitude from a desert whether she was to ask after him as major or colonel replied oh dear madam neither he prides himself no great honor to others on being the oldest captain in the service had the old excellent duke of montague who got for him his ensigncy at thirteen been living he had not now whereof to glory thus  who reproached her for not having stepped down to the city to look at the princess de lambelle saying i think every body but yourself was there to which the editor replied that she was too old and too stupid to go to see any body she did not add  hear any thing for she would if she could afford to hire horses willingly drive twenty miles at least once every week to listen to the conversation of mr burke adding i dare say the wise folks were all disappointed to which captain gostling replied i was not for i think in my conscience i think in my conscience the editor does verily believe that her old friend captain gostling has a conscience as  void of offense toward god and man as most men have ever enjoyed and so his soldiers think  that she is altogether the very finest woman that the almighty ever formed the editor begged as she always does to except her lamentably curious grandmother eve before the fall why would the silly woman the witty and as the editor has heard her mother say worthy bishop hickman in one of his sermons says that the sad dialogue between the lady and the serpent ladies should not be familiar with the serpent however beautiful their outwara appearance may be has the following sentence eve in conversing with the devil adds to gods command of not tasting the forbidden fruit one of not touching it she broke her own command and found no inconvenience she then ventured to break gods and so brought misery on all her descendants etc the editor as atheist gibbon says quotes this from memory not having read it since she was sixteen years old but she frequently finds occasion to quote it to those of her acquaintance who seem to wish to be more righteous than god the editor writes it with due veneration but there were always pharisees wish to know evil as much good as you please sir serpent but no evil for me  a gentleman very many years ago mentioned to the editor that he had been taught by a very learned anatomical gentleman a method of separating the soul from the body without a possibility of being suspected of suicide adding that he would tell it to her she begged to be excused hearing it lest at any time of deep affliction the enemy of her soul might tempt her to practice it she also conjured him to let it die with him as angelic boil did his secret of discharging ink the editor believes her friend took her advice as he is dead and she has never heard any thing of this dangerous secret  mr monck berkeley in one of his letters to his mother speaking of her after much eulogium adds i am afraid i am really in love with her without knowing it  some pains were taken to conceal from mr berkeley just then within a few days of his death the dreadful fate of this lady and of poor louis the sixteenth but in vain it was said that the monster who murdered this lady received the wages of his iniquity in england at the bankinghouse of an old amiable friend of mr monck berkeley mr chambers in bond street one poor hundred pounds only our blessed master says what shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose his own soul but few papists are permitted to read the book of god  this brings to the editors remembrance a dialogue that many years ago passed between the late king george the second and the french ambassador at herenhausen one day at dinner when a relation of the editor the late richard powney esquire fellow of all souls college had the honor to dine with his majesty who when abroad laid aside royalty and wished his guests to forget that he was a king  the ambassador a lively man said you poor kings never made so pitiful figures as when joshua had seven of you shut up in a cave together  the king replied ah you papists do not read the bible or you would know that he had but five of us in the cave  mr powney who entertained a table full of company at dr berkeleys with this anecdote said every one admired the ready wit of the king and all the company laughed heartily  this lovely  must one style her unhappy or happy  princess could not avail herself of mr monck berkeleys politeness  an order arriving in england from the unfortunate louis xvi for all his subjects to return to france an express followed the princess to cambridge the editor thinks she recollects hearing her son say that she had been there some days  this order was so urgent that the princess only stayed in canterbury to change horses for dover at three in the morning at eight mr monck berkeleys letter mentioned above as to be received from the fair hands of the beauteous princess was brought to the oaks by the honest hostler of the lion and delivered with  mrs lambelles best compliments to mrs berkeley and she was very sorry she could not visit her as it was so early but that she should be in canterbury again very soon when she would come  and that mr berkeley the gentleman who wrote the letter which mrs lambelle charged him to deliver safe was very well  the princesss degradation by the honest hostler afforded much diversion to dr and mrs berkeley and their friends alas what degradation did her lovely lifeless from suffer after it was lifeless for it is very certain she never saw although she tasted as every mortal must death for her sweet spirit was dismissed from the lovely casket in a single instant happy if found washed clean in the atoning blood of god clothed with the robes of his righteousness and her spirit renewed by that spirit which he died to purchase for all that thoroughly turn to him see the viiith chapter to the romans which glorious chapter the editor has heard dr berkeley say his greatgrandfather mr monck of grangegormond when old and visited at times perhaps not very often by his fine young lady and gentlemen grandchildren used his large bible always lying on the table to request them to read to him which occasioned their supposing that the old gentleman doated  the late very pious dr booth dean of windsor was so addicted to talk on the same delightful subject that the editor well remembers a gentleman coming in one evening to her house when she resided at windsor thirtysix years ago and happening to say he came from the deanery a gentleman asked did you hear any news  mr trevanion the worthy uncle of the present member of parliament for dover   no  gentleman  what did you talk about  mr trevanion  why on the deans beloved topic the great blessing of redemption the wonders of redeeming love aye aye good man he never seems to enjoy any other conversation how happy in age to resemble the friends of st paul whose conversation the apostle tells us is in heaven etc etc may that of the editor and all her beloved aged friends be daily more and more so is her ardent wish  when last at canterbury the editor requested her worthy friend the thoroughly elegant amiable mrs hughes to say to her relation the reverend mr hambley the present vicar of cookham how very sensibly dear dr berkeley and herself felt that universally beloved gentlemans polite generous pleasant conduct on dr berkeley resigning that lovely spot lest it should have slipped that ladys memory the editor inserts part of a letter of hers to dr berkeley who as well as her son preserved all her scrawls you bade me draw the character of your successor at cookham you observed that he had lions in his bearing armorial to that they are confined i really believe he seems to have much of the lamb in his nature and manners and i do not suspect that he is a wolf in sheeps clothing which i abhor suppose we get our worthy friend sir isaac to exchange the noble savage for the lovely lamb for him mrs berkeley gladly embraces this opportunity of holding up to its merited praise so amiable a character  it may be asked what could mrs berkeley have to do with dilapidations during the life of dr berkeley she has alas had too much to do with them since his lamented death dr berkeley never took dilapidations but at acton a very trifle and at canterbury not forty pounds and immediately expended on the prebendal house more than two hundred pounds the editor asked him how he came to take any as he never had before and dr stedman did not die rich he sweetly replied because i had not you here to remind me not to do it  dr berkeley used always from the time he married to leave all business that he thought might have any thing at all unpleasant in it to mrs berkeley laughingly saying it was the pleasantest thing in the world to have a wife that one could metamorphose into a steward that although  calling mrs berkeley by her name had always declared when she was single she was resolved never to marry any man who took a woman merely as a disinterested housekeeper to see that the servants did not cheat him from morning till night and to bring him an heir yet she had not declared against being a steward as was the case of the little quiet mother of a worthy baronet now a peer whose father had at least twenty thousand pounds per annum  one day an amiable countess a lovely friend of the editors youth dining at the said wise mans with other company after the ladies were retired to the drawing room the butler came whispered the lady after some time he repeated his visit and oh beware of the third time says the old proverb he entered and whispered loud enough for every one to hear madam if you do not please to come and weigh out the hops they cannot go on with the brewing and the beer will be all spoiled the editors father was famous for having the finest strong beer in berkshire and she was resolved her husband should be as famous she routed out all his brewery books mr wrightson studied them as berks and canterbury can testify to excellent effect   beer is generally spoiled by hops and the editor has been repeatedly told that there is still an act of queen elizabeth unrepealed forbidding the planting or cultivating that pernicious weed called hop the editor has heard from her youth that the law for extinguishing fire on the tolling the curfew bell is also unrepealed  she is sometimes tempted to wish it was enforced perhaps there are few persons who fully know the wholesomeness of aged hard beer the editor has frequently heard the late excellent mrs tucker of canterbury say that when her father was head master of the kings school the second masters and the other boarding houses had summer after summer a very bad fever amongst the boys but her father mr gurney had not a boy ill which he attributed entirely under god to their drinking very hard homebrewed beer he brewed as they do in all wise gentlemens families only twice in the year in march and october all the world have of late found out the virtues of beer without hops new or as it is commonly called sweetwort is excellent for worms in children and for scurvies in men and when the poison of the strong rank weed hop is gone off it is aqua vitae to many to the editor even when almost vinegar but a table spoonful of stale brewers beer is almost death to her qu why is this  the lady however begged excuse went and did her duty as housekeeper her husband built a very fine house but would have no back door that he might see the motions of his half hundred of servants all day long the editor then about seventeen offered to lay a wager with a gentleman that within two years he would break out a back door he did it within one  the editor now experiences the want of a back gate at least she has few servants but thank god they are not eye servants so want not watching but there are many beggars who do for these beasts of the people on being constantly refused relief leave the front the only gate open for the beasts of the common to rout the garden direfully indeed  the editor and a lady with her went a few weeks ago into a shop a girl about thirteen shabbily dressed came in asked for a pennyworth of gingerbread it was cut and also for a pennyworth of sugar candy the mistress of the shop sensibly asked would you have both  beggar   yes i eats um together  this being at the time when bread was at its very highest price and wise people believed we had no corn in the nation the editor asked if she lived at d that she might avoid relieving her family  beggar  no  mrs b  where then  beggar  no where we travels the country  mrs b  what do you sell laces and pins  beggar  no we only travels about  that is we are common beggars can it be charity to relieve such  the editor at length getting sight of most of the sheets at once is confirmed in what she suspected that she has been guilty of tautology of egotism or rather editorism it is said of the excellent lord chancellor clarendon that in his incomparable history of the rebellion the chancellor of the exchequer is too often introduced  the editor has always thought that there is at least as much if not more in the circumlocution often practiced and she is certain a vast deal of affectation which she ever abhorred does still abhor especially in matrons and pities in girls in persons relating transactions in which they were necessarily principal actors front figures who cannot be thrown into the background without ruining the picture as is done by  at  by using circumlocution in mentioning themselves it is like a very plain woman decking herself violently it calls attention but does not according to the editors humble opinion in either case create respect it must be considered that through life there was so constant an intercourse whether present or absent between mr berkeley and his mother that she has during the writing these sheets frequently studied how to put herself in a dark corner which has been much more difficult than the doing that kind office to her dear son until he attained to the age of five when that mode of punishment ceased and another somewhat similar was substituted  the editor perhaps having described herself as the most resolute of all females where her children or her conscience were concerned owes it to herself to say that it is most certain that she is not cursed with a stubborn or a saucy spirit both were pretty easily by her wise mother nipped almost before they were in bud when she was not quite four years old being very busily employed in underssing her doll to put it into the cradle in an arbore at the farthest part of a very long walk her mother called her thus importantly occupied she conceiving that it could not be heard uttered the following soliloquy  i will not come till i have done very soon appeared the amiable woman who had taken care of here from a month old for thank god her mother was her nurse with oh fie miss how came you to say such a naughty word to my mistress  what word  why you know miss you said i will not come miss did not deny it knowing from the time she could articulate that a lie even with her father was a threat of being whipped  all but to death  the little culprit was delivered to her mother standing at the garden door to receive her she can almost fancy that her wrist when she thinks of it feels the grasp of her mothers elegant long fingers and hears her say  you will not come madam will you in she was taken shown a nice slice of bread covered with current jelly on the table look you there i called you to give you that for your supper you will now go to bed without any supper but a good whipping which was instantly administered to teach her never to say i will not again to her mother or father it proved effectual for the editor can with strictest truth assert that this was the first and the last time that frightful word was ever pronounced by her to either parent  it pleased the gracious giver of every good gift to spare that excellent mother until her daughter was twenty years old although at the time of her fathers death no one would have given half a years purchase for her life and she has frequently told her daughters when grown up that every breaking up when she returned them to mrs sheeless that she conceived she had taken her last leave of them the editor often cannot refrain exclaiming to her excellent sister how gracious was god to us in sparing our angelic mother  to show that the editor needed not much discipline to bring her to submit to lawful authority a simple little story may she hopes be excused the fault is obliterated from her memory the punishment never can and her consequent sufferings one of the fathers describing woman says  she is an animal delighting in finery a very pretty pale blue the editors favorite color from her cradle for herself to this time bonnet had just arrived with some things of her mothers from town which she had contrived to get sight of half a dozen times during the morning and was told she was to wear it in the afternoon to go visit miss sloper sister of general sir robert sloper mr and mrs sloper then lived at waltham place this young lady died at mrs denniss school whether elated by so frequently contemplating the beautiful bonnet or in what else she offended whether by flying up one pair of stairs and down the other of the old house a favorite amusement with both sisters when their mother was out of the house be this however as it may the culprit was called welljobed and told that instead of going out visiting in the new bonnet she was to stay at home tied by the arm to she believes the first flytable ever made in england made according to mrs frinshams own directions given to a country cabinetmaker and which she the culprit could have drawn all over the house she supplicated for pardon but in vain she was made to sit down on the floor under the table tied by the left arm she was tied with a good long needleful of common white silk taken from a ball in her mothers indian workbowl she wept much a little while but being naturally of a very cheerful disposition soon dried her eyes and began to amuse herself with scratching a tree and some flowers on the shining old oak floor with a large pin that she had coaxed out of her frock behind  the editors delight in drawing and mixing colors commenced she remembers before she left off her backstring thus amused she forgot that she was a prisoner and had crawled quite to the stretch of her tether on finding it she was in such terror lest the silk should break and that her mother should think that she had dared to liberate herself that she crept so close to the leg of the table as to let the silk hang in a loop for considerably more than an hour not amusing herself in any way but the delight arising from her happiness that the silk had not broke  it may perhaps by some be thought strange that a very docile girl should make so very resolute a mother her disposition is naturally yielding except when duty called for steadiness as in the case of mr berkeley his brother was as easily governed as his mother  the editor had the happiness she still feels it such that her mother bore testimony to the amenableness of her temper a very few months before her slow sudden death a beloved friend of the editor was strenuously asserting that every human being was stubborn and would if possible get their own will that nothing but superior absolute force prevented it adding show me any man woman or child that is not stubborn and i will show you a black swan some late travelers have discovered this rara avis  the editor constantly opposed the doctrine of universal stubbornness and insisted that although she had many faults she was certainly not a wilful being and respectfully requested her mother to say whether she thought her so mrs frinsham laid down her work and lifting up her sweet eyes which exactly resembled dr berkeleys said oh no my dear indeed you are not stubborn you never gave me five minutes trouble in your life from wilfulness  the mentioning of these things brings to the editors recollection a conversation with her son not many months before his death telling a friend who had a violenttempered little boy that she should contrive to prevent his crying and screaming so violently as described as it was dangerous and often productive of bad consequences to boys health adding that she always took care to prevent it with her own boys that when she had locked them into a light room no child should ever be shut into a dark room sad consequences have arisen from it and got the key in her own pocket that no servant might kindly administer consolation she always stood to listen till the roaring ceased  hereupon mr berkeley said my dear mother did you could you think that i was fool enough to scream a moment longer than i thought you were in hearing i strained my lungs that you might hear as long as i conceived it possible you should hear mrs berkeley had often observed that the last shout was the most violent i then immediately reached down some book the prison was generally the editors book closet to amuse me till the hour or the two hours according to my sentence was elapsed i never shed a tear  that his father often remarked i only roared like a wild bull to as i conceived punish you for punishing me  blessing on you for your wisdom  the editor on perusing the sheets quite ready for publication finds that she has omitted many anecdotes that must have heightened the ideas of mr monck berkeleys wisdom and amiability and his undaunted courage his rescuing a poor little child late one night near covent garden as he was going home to his chambers he met the thief soon after at the old bailey and she was transported his rescuing an amiable friend of his from the jews whose wise guardians did not at twenty allow him as many hundreds per annum as the next year he was to inherit thousands and assisted by his learned amiable friend mr h from the gentiles at four in the morning when going along covent garden they saw a coach and some kind of bustle and struggle  hereupon mr berkeley said it is very late let us go and see if all is right there  on drawing near they saw a gentleman lifting  dragging into a coach by three females assisted by the coachman mr h exclaimed good god berkeley it is your friend    mr berkeley sprung forward and said my    where are you going   extremely intoxicated replied i do not know  mr b  yes you do you are going with us  mr bs friend  yes yes  the nymphs began raving and said the gentlemen had no right to take their guest from them   was going to spend the evening with them  the coachman said the gentleman belonged to the ladies they had taken his coach to carry him home  mr berkeley said haveacare my friend i have taken the number of your coach already and if you act like a villain as surely as i live till morning you shall appear before the lord mayor i fancy the ladies can walk home by themselves and do you assist us in putting   into the coach and at your peril drive to any place but where i order you  they accordingly drove to  s lodgings where they delivered him his bourse bien chargee not des louis but guineas and his very fine watch safe into the hands of his valet de chamber with directions to put him to bed  the editor rejoices very sincerely that providence has some time ago delivered his lordship into the hands of a very sensible worthy lady who has brought him a son and heir to his vast estate may he grow up as amiable as his father as sensible as his mother  the editor on perusing the sheets of this wonderfully long preface de suite tout ensemble is hurt to find that her memory is become so treacherous as to have permitted her to be so guilty of tautology at the distance of little more than six months to have twice quoted some favorite lines of mr addison this however may be pardoned for they are beautiful and she repeats the hymn of which they form a part every day but repeating her own remarks or comments she laments as she does her seeming ingratitude when mentioning the amiable hospitality of scotland she perceives she has omitted to mention the very highly polite attentions received by dr berkeleys family from the very elegant sister of the worthy lord newark resident at st andrews when dr berkeleys family went to reside there although last yet not least etc  a lady the other day said to the editor that our nobility wanted a little humbling that to be sure they had carried the matter much too far in france but a little humbling would do them service for both worlds the editor begged that the scottish in general excepting some few might be spared and as they took the advice of our blessed master and amiably humbled themselves that they and some few english might be exempted from the said humbling  the editor has not the honor to be known at present to many noblesse  the world forgetting by the world forgot but she is apt to think that modern nobility are addicted to set more value on a coronet than those to whom it has descended by hereditary succession through several generations  mrs berkeley some years ago had the honor to correspond with some english nobles of both sexes now no more very many of their letters are preserved  as polite as if she had been noble  several years ago the editor took leave to write to a modern peeress requesting a very small favor for a young lady very very much mrs berkeleys superior not to say by birth the peeresss the answer was returned on an halfsheet of common paper sealed with a wafer pricked with a pin expressing astonishment that the editor could suppose she could do what she requested  use her interest to procure a vacant twenty pounds per annum for a poor lady who must have had the pas of the peeress until her lord was a few years ago created a peer what made it still stranger to the poor simple editor was that when the peeress and herself were both girls the peeresss lovely mother felt at least expressed herself she had the grace of humility obliged by the editors mothers attentions to her and her little girl now the little peeress this occured not long after the editors return to england and she supposed that some great revolution in politeness had taken place during her absence and that poor untitled gentry must approach nobility as swift makes the subjects of japan approach their emperor and lick the dust as they crawl toward him  the editors ideas concerning a revolution in manners were however soon corrected by her having the honor to receive letters a legarde de son cher fills from her amiable friend lord loughborouh an instance of his lordships amiability related to her by another old friend the agreeable mr berridge the hospitable master of john a gaunts castle emboldened her at the distance of near a quarter of a century to write to his lordship to introduce that dear young man telling his lordship that naturalists assure us that the most timid animals become courageous where their young are concerned that she felt the truth of the assertion his lordships and good lady loughboroughs attentions are carefully registered in her grateful memory his lordships answer was most polite and friendly their amiable graces of marlborough and the late excellent lady effingham who have chanced to honor the editor with letters have written on whole sheets of gilt paper most condescendingly subscribed and sealed  as to a gentlewoman  not to be mantuamaker indeed the editor used to write more respectfully to the famous mrs monday her old playfellow niece of john breedon esquire of bearcourt berks when she wanted a new negligee  the poor lady for whom the editor supplicated the peeresss interest for only a poor vacant twenty pounds per annum has the honor at least her grandfather had and upwards for very many centuries the honor to have two crowned heads put on mourning at their decease as whilst there was a king in france was always done by that king when the head of the courtney family died which the editor is very sure no crowned head ever did for her ancestors nor as she verily believes for those of captain  father of the peeress the poor young lady showed her high birth by submitting with the editor really thinks unexampled fortitude and true unaffected dignity to the distresses to which an imprudent match in very early youth had unavoidably subjected herself her elegant husband and lovely little girl although mrs berkeley failed to obtain relief from the courtly courteous peeress the amiable dr berkeleys pocket failed not to alleviate their deep distress for which the young gentleman blessed him when dying his sensible grateful relict and lovely daughter continue to bless his sweet memory dr berkeley is receiving his reward the peeress still enjoys her new coronet  mr monck berkeley a great herald from ten years old was consulted at twentytwo by a noble amiable peer a great herald a friend of the peeresss lord elect about supporters to be added when the arms of  were to be tipped with a coronet mentioning the selection mr monck berkeley first made would too plainly mark out the peeress who it is hoped although she is now turned threescore may live to grow older  and wiser the editor never wishes her pocket catonine tails to wound any but the vicious and the ungrateful and only to make the insolent tingle a little the editor has some letters which she preserves from ancient noblesse male and female for their internal as well as their external merit the assumed motto of the excellent countess of l round her ladyships cipherseal is always carefully preserved holiness is happiness oh that this were the motto of millions noble and nonnoble  the two following letters of the late georgemonck berkeley esquire were written at different periods the first when he was just about to return from his last vist to scotland in the end of the autumn of      not then alas thinking it was his last visit for he frequently used to say if god spares my life to settle i shall every now and then once in three or four years in summer vacation make a visit to scotland for a few weeks although an enthusiastic admirer of johnson in his writings all on the side of virtue his integrity etc he used to say he behaved like a savage in scotland where every respectful attention was shown to him by every one mr berkeley constantly styled dr johnson the noble learned bear his own abhorrence of what is called rudeness even when persons are ever so much inflamed by resentment he contracted very early in life from his mother who added to shakspeares speak daggers but use none let those daggers for your own sake be gilded never use coarse language nor make a coarse simile the second was written at dover a very few months before his lamented death  an address to the clerical and lay members of the episcopal communion in scotland reverend sirs and gentlemen presuming that by this time you are all sufficiently informed with respect to the steps that have been taken by your bishops to procure a repeal of the penal laws and that you are also acquainted with the total failure of their undertakings i shall only trespass on your attention whilst i suggest the propriety of a second application to parliament and propose to your consideration a plan of proceedure of which the expediency will i doubt not be sufficiently apparent to require little or no assistance from argument  the plan for which i wish to procure your sanction is as follows that each of the two orders i have now the honor to address should elect a representative to superintend on its behalf the next application to parliament for a repeal of those laws which it is no longer the interest of any man to enforce not suffering more than four persons excepting the family of the clergyman to assemble at one time to attend the reading of the english liturgy under a severe penalty indeed the editor has heard a reverend old divine say that he has read it so repeatedly over to only four that frequently by evening he has scarce been able to speak to be heard it was not a sabbath of rest to him poor man this is something like persecution the noble charitable lord who framed the bill wittily said he had got a bill passed that would starve one half of the scotch and d n the other perhaps it did not occur to his lordship that an english peer bred a presbyterian as his lordship was could invent any thing too severe for scottish episcopalians to the honor of the editors presbyterian neighbors at st andrews she never saw the episcopalians incommoded although they assembled in much larger numbers at mr lindseys chapel the spirit had quite subsided and lord  had been gone some years before to join  either the starved or the d d scots   to direct the attention of the inferior clergy to the preservation of their own rights as connected with that church to which their services are devoted would have appeared to me wholly unnecessary had i not witnessed their supineness on the late occasion  that the bishops undertook their embassy without the concurrence of the clergy and laiety over whom they preside that they constituted themselves sole and absolute governors of the church in scotland that they concerted measures for the relief of that church without the advice or approbation of the inferior clergy who with themselves were equally interested in the success of these measures and that they have plainly evinced their utter incapacity to execute their own plans are facts i need not call to your recollection but as a man much interested in the welfare of that religious society in which he hopes to die i think it a duty incumbent on me to suggest to you the necessity of preventing a second encroachment on your privileges and of attempting in concurrence with our prelates by a proper and respectful application to parliament to procure for that church of which you are at once members and guardians the protection of government whose authority it acknowledges and whose lenity it has long experienced  do not gentlemen however suppose that to lessen the respect due to the episcopal character or to circumscribe the authority of the bishops by improper limits is the object proposed by the present address such is by no means the case but when any authority however venerable presumes to invade the rights of others it is the duty of those whose liberties are endangered to defend that blessing for which an equivalent has never yet been discovered  let me therefore reverend sirs and gentlemen entreat you without delay to elect each of you a representative who may attend such bishops as may be disposed to go upon a second embassy to london for if you reject this measure errors similar to those which have already disappointed your hopes may again frustrate any exertions that may be made in your favor and you may for ever lose that relief which the present government so readily affords to all its suffering subjects this advice will i fear lose much weight as coming from the pen of an anonymous writer and i should certainly subscribe my name were i vain enough to suppose it could in the least influence those to whom it is addressed  i have the honor to remain reverend sirs and gentlemen your sincere wellwisher a laymember of the episcopal church in scotland   after the above address was published in edinburgh and dispersed through scotland mr berkeley sent up a printed copy to his mother desiring her to show it to his father and learn his sentiments of it and after he left scotland it was immediately known who was the writer  mr berkeley was early convinced of the divine right of episcopacy his mother lest she might die had engraven in his mind that one text which nothing can whittle away spoken by god incarnate himself  whosesoever sins ye remit they are remitted whosesoever sins ye retain they are retained lo i am with you always even unto the end of the world a bishops being a vautrien a socinian etc etc does not affect the office of a bishop as our blessed lord plainly showed by consecrating the traitor judas he who read every heart certainly knew his and no doubt chose one a devil have i not chosen you twelve and one of you is a devil see the holy gospel as recorded by st john chapter vi ver  0  as he styles judas iscariot on purpose to show us that it is the office not the man the editor has often made persons stare by asserting that she had as lief been baptized or received the sacred elements from the hands of judas iscariot as from st peter or the beloved disciple we may wish bishops priests deacons and ourselves more piety less worldlymindedness and more to adorn the doctrine of god our savior  my dear parents as reiterated relapses leave me no hopes of a speedy recovery if of any at all and as i long to embrace those who are most dear to me i propose whilst i have strength left to accomplish the journey to set out for cheltenham this day sennight weak as i am the journey will take me a whole week it took him more than a fortnight he was two or three times supposed to be dead in the coach by his incomparable aunt and the two affectionate worthy female attendants named in the editors preface what a journey for three perhaps as tenderhearted persons as can be any where found to accomplish on this day fortnight i hope to receive your blessing at cheltenham and possibly when so near i may see dr chestern who may hit on something to palliate sufferings that are almost intolerable but that god who has supported will support me through it all with kindest love to dolly  ie mrs dorothy monck  i remain your unalterably dutiful devoted son and servant georgemonck berkeley   a very vexatious suit commenced against the editor as sole executrix to dr berkeley to which she did not prove till the middle of may although he died on the  th of january and from a quarter she little expected and could hardly be persuaded to believe it by the very reverend bringer of the intelligence who repeatedly assured her in the presence of her sister that the whole affair was to be carried on in the most amicable way  the commencer of this suit and the editor have frequently had very warm amicable disputes concerning the lawfulness of going to law with your brother your neighbor or any one the commencer of the suit against the editor constantly declaring that she thought it so very wicked that she would sooner give up every shilling she possessed the editor constantly saying that seeing it no where forbidden in any part of her oldfashioned book and seeing st paul in one of his epistles blaming his converts for carrying their litigations before heathen tribunals heathen judges and recommending them to select some wise christian to decide in matters of law she should if attacked certainly defend her right to which the commencer of the suit used uniformly to reply oh fie      you cannot be a christian here follows a proof how little we know ourselves how little we can judge how we shall act until called upon to act the editor was called upon to relinquish the very reverend the  of  her lawyer the worthy agent employed by the commencer of the suit a near kinsman both of his employer and dr berkeley all know that mrs berkeley instantly declared she was ready to do it and fearing lest death might overtake her before the forms could be completed she instantly added a codicil to her will bequeathing the sum in dispute it was in the editors will made soon after dr berkeleys death bequeathed to two nearer relations of dr berkeleys as the editor ever esteemed highwaymen honest persons when compared with childless widows who rob their husbands family of what his generosity has bestowed on them to alleviate in some little measure the loss of an amiable companion and a reduced income the editor has very little more than her own original fortune her misfortune now is that as a widow the largest part of her income is in ireland alas for her  as an unmarried woman it was chiefly in that delightfully punctual repository for widows and maidens the bank of england  it could not be witnessed until past ten at night as is well known to her excellent sister her servants and a worthy neighbor called in to witness it who came not home until that late hour the  of  who brought her the intelligence said she must oppose it the editor ignorant in many things besides law matters enquired why being ready to do every thing that was wished it must be pleaded was the answer the editor then obeyed made a horrid hot journey from oxford to london on the   th of august and has in this amicable way been taking journeys feeing counsel swearing  nothing but truth god the searcher of all hearts well knows and the obliging patient mr bush partner with mr jenner her proctors he writing over six or seven times what she was to swear mrs berkeley so often assuring them that she would not swear to any thing that she was not of her own knowledge certain was true she fears an oath at least as much as a subtle quaker surely our senators will not enable those artful creatures to take away the life of men  by their solemn affirmation  god in mercy avert it  at different times ever since until now june  0      it is now november    the editor correcting this sheet  her excellent sister just returned from london called thither to give evidence that eliza widow of the reverend george berkeley prebendary of canterbury etc could not secret a few lines of an unsealed unwitnessed undated unfinished unsigned will found in a corner of a lockedup closet in an house which she never was in in her whole life nor has she been in the county of sussex since the year      when she was at tunbridge to be accused of wilfully wickedly fraudulently concealing the words of the citation an only begun will many months before the death of the testator is too much for a poor frail old mortal to bear without vindicating herself the editor was told at doctors commons that the aspersing her thus was matter of form she assured an old gentleman there that were he to take it into his head to call her an harlot fashionable as it now is she would make him suffer soundly for his pains   the editor has heard from some real friends that she is much blamed for the opposition she has by the commencers friend the  of  been told she must make but she feared to share the fate of an amiable relation who neglecting to obey a summons from a law court on a suit instituted against her by her worthy son for neglect of paying a small annuity left by his father to his aunt he enjoying then a paternal estate of two thousand pounds per annum and knowing he must inherit that of his uncle at least six thousand pounds per annum more suffered his unfortunate mother to be dragged to winchester jail mr monck berkeley on hearing it said i will never speak to him again whilst i breathe  what a contrast between this rich  squire and richard rainsford the editor has not seen this amiable gentleman since he was a lovely lively youth at eton at a montem before her marriage he then describing matters concerning it to his mother and the editor the word to march was given how he got down stairs the editor knows not but in an instant he was in the statueyard in his proper place he was an exceedingly clever youth and was surely a most amiablehearted man probably is such if still living and must have joy of his own children  esquire whose father lived many years ago in windsor forest whose mothers beauty the editor admired at five years old who some years ago on his mothers jointure suffering some considerable diminution went immediately to her receiver and amiably charged him not to let his mother know it but pay her as usual that he would constantly make up the difference and never tell her lest she might think he could not afford it as he was married the squire was married and fame gave his lady the credit of this pious deed to a most amiable parent who had suffered very much for him and his really worthy sisters from her tyrant savage husband he the editors relation and whom she used to tune a little for his bearish conduct as a husband when she was only eighteen years old staying in the house on a visit to his lovely suffering lady mrs berkeley cannot now read over his eldest sister mrs s letter giving her an account of the dreadful situation in which she and her accomplished partner who flew day and night to her found her without wetting it with a tear  some persons were apt to disbelieve the above astonishing conduct of this gentleman see brookes excellent etymology of the words gentleman and nobleman in his fool of quality to be sure a mans being of a very ancient family does not always make him a gentle man or a noble man ie of gentle manners of noble manners pardon this misnomer to his lady for he was a very good son until after his marriage on his becoming of age he was very desirous to have made over his paternal estate to his sisters and their heirs to take place on his coming into possession of his uncles estate after the death of lady  to which his worthy mother objected saying no tom no wife or child of yours thank god he has no child so the race it is to be hoped will be extinct in his own sweet little person shall ever have it in their power to say that your mother and sisters fleeced you when you were a boy your father has left your sisters very ample fortunes and they shall not have a shilling of your estate this as was observed happened previous to his marriage with the daughter of sir    some years ago the editor was applied to by the lawyers of her worthy relation to give information when where and by whom his father and mother were married it being necessary to prove it before he could become seized of his grandfathers vast estate in        after repeated applications to dr berkeley to make the editor tell and her sons assuring her that if she did not tell them they would summon her into westminster hall she wrote a letter that scared yet diverted her beloved husband and son when she showed it to them before she sealed it in which she pathetically laments having never heard or read in history or romance of but two monsters at whose suit those who bore them were imprisoned that one of them should be her kinsman the other the tender the soft the delicate the compassionate stern the seducer of eliza and the distractor of her husband the support of eight fine young children as some worthy wise man related in the gentlemans magazine at that time  the letter given us by mr walpole signed anne dorset pembroke and montgomerie is perfect milk and water compared with the editors she preserves the copy a rare thing with her to make or take one in an elegant box for the amazement of an old friend or two who admire the spirit of the editor who trusts that she attends to the advice of her blessed master be ye angry and sin not does not god say who will rise up with me against the wicked and who will take my part against the evildoers the editor ever has and hopes she ever shall when she thinks it necessary not in her own cause but her friends or her neighbors  many arguments were used by dr berkeley and her son to blunt the sentences of this letter but all in vain and mr monck berkeley said well sir if my mother will not write another this will prevent her being called up to give evidence in person as it will prove that she knows that mr  was married to the daughter of bishop  which is all that is necessary  the editor naturally rather a coward was once very near being murdered at least knocked down a tremendous thing to befall a poor little female one morning in winter the editor never wastes the summer mornings in walking returning from her morning walk at canterbury passing through the cloisters there issued from the dark chapel called st mary in criptis violent blows  on a nearer approach dreadful groans on turning to look into it the following words were heard because i am old and feeble you take this time to abuse me when all the men are gone off to dinner  yes you old dog i will do for you i promise you the editor much nimbler than at present flew in and there saw a sturdy young villain giving such blows as she never saw before and hopes never to see again to a poor old silverhaired man she called out you wretch leave off how dare you beat the poor old man in this shocking manner he instantly replied i will beat him to death what business is it of yours i will teach you to meddle and clenching his fist advanced saying who are you i will teach you   who am i nobody but my husband is vice dean and i will go home and send him to trounce you for beating this poor old man you vile wretch i promise you  the editor never felt pleasure before from dr berkeleys local dignities on this occasion it made her happy the monste turned as pale as death flew by her and was quite out of sight in an instant she took the poor old man home to her house and desired her careful compassionate servants to see to him and give him some wine etc to comfort him  the editor feels it incumbent on her to declare that from the age of about seventeen when she began to consider seriously that time is a point eternity a neverending circle that she resolved to endeavor to discharge the relative duties of life as she felt she should wish at the aweful hour of death as a daughter a sister a friend a mistress a neighbor a wife and a mother  as a daughter the extremely tender attachment she felt for her mother from childhood added to gratitude for a very liberal expensive education rendered the studying to obey and delight her a pleasant task  as a sister mrs berkeley owned much for the tenderest love and never had when a girl the least idea of acting in character of eldest sister which she ever reprobated  the idea of brothers and sisters being angry at an imprudent match is to her wonderful they may be grieved had the editors sister who early in life resolved never to marry any man as she told a friend some little time ago chosen to unite hereself with a chimneysweeper the editor would have kept up friendship with her sister and civility with the quondam sweep the editor conceives that the authority of parents is not meant by god to extend to children of twentyfive thirty or forty years old  as a friend the editor is certain she was faithful and secret she constantly labored to be agreeable and she trusts she was obliging and complying it is a little remarkable that almost quite entire strangers to the editor have requested to deposite important secrets to her keeping she never could conceive the reason she indeed has been told by more than one physiognomist that the lines of honesty are strongly marked in her countenance she never wished to know a secret lest as she used jokingly to say she should reveal it in her sleep she was well assured she should not when awake  as a mistress which she became very early in life she endeavored uniformly to treat every even the meanest servant in her house so as were she and they to exchange situations the next day she would wish them to treat her which once occasioned a very faucy very wicked vile housekeepers saying to her you may be loved for aught i know and i believe you are by your servants but i promise you you will never be obeyed nor well served whilst you consider them so much a most accomplished neighbor of dr berkeley once said either mrs berkeley has the best servants in the kingdom or she is the best mistress for when all the rest of us are complaining of our servants you never hear her utter any thing like a complaint this gentleman and his lovely lady are a most excellent master and mistress themselves the editor has in general been happy in worthy servants she has in the course of thirtysix years been visited by two devils incarnate in the capacity of housekeepers one the ugliest female dear lady p used to say that ever nature formed one eyebrow of one color light the other dark her eyes ditto forehead all covered with fears not influted at newgate although she is a thief but by falling into her mothers an honest washerwoman embers she was a harlot to every man gentle or simple whom her cunning deceitful tongue could draw in still unmarried the other exceedingly handsome harlot to no man but cursed with a very black heart indeed married to an exceedingly worthy man may god in mercy grant them both  repentance unto life the editor when her friends are complaining of the worthlessness of their servants asks them these short questions  do you teach them their duty to their heavenly master  do you call them daily to family prayers and force them to hear gods word read every day did masters and mistresses of families consider that they must if negligent of the souls of their servants be infallibly accused by them for such negligence at the bar of god surely  as lovers of their ownselves they would instruct their servants in their duty to god and man  want of time will not be admitted at that righteous bar on that tremendous day  a few years ago a groom of a very old acquaintance of the editor was sentenced to death for a highway robbery his master being at the assizes the poor wretch turned to him and cried out oh lord sir if i had minded what your honor said to me when i lived with you i had never come to this his worthy remarkably tenderhearted master replied alas tom but you would not attend to me so i was forced to turn you off this gentleman keeps his servants like the editor as long as they are keepable let negligent masters and mistresses who read the poor grooms testimony of his masters atrention to his soul draw their own inference  the editor has the pleasure of knowing that in several instances her  labors with her servants have not been in vain in the lord and earthly lords have reaped the benefit as mrs wiggins many years the editors excellent conscientious cook now wife of mr wiggins baker in dyot street st giless a good neighborhood lately told the editor that his grace of york sent twice a week all last winter to her shop for bread they send none out to any one and that lord lonsdale whilst in town sends two horses and serants three times a week for their bread finding that it is composed only of the best wheat flour yeast and salt and is better at the weeks end than the generality of bakers bread at two days the editor used frequently to say without the gift of prophecy to this very worthy woman whenever you set up for yourself you must prosper you are so conscientiously careful for those you serve it would be well if servants considered who it is that says  if ye have not been faithful in that which is another mans who shall give you that which is your own    but the editor ever kept in mind the words of holy job if i despised the cause of my man servant or my maid servant etc  did not he that made me make them etc  as a neighbor mrs berkeley rejoiced always to render any little kind services in the power of so unimportant a person in the scale of beings as herself to do she had always a sort of giving spirit dr berkeleys very large garden at cookham excellently planted and cultivated enabled the editor to oblige her neighbors high and low sometimes her dairy or her larder were a convenience to her neighbors had she had a park fish ponds or a pidgeonhouse she could have done more  an high authority says to whom little is given of them shall be little required had the editor been placed in a high station with a large fortune to account for at the great day of account which she most heartily thanks the mercy of god she has not she must have labored more a young man of very large fortune was one day abused by a large circle for spending it very ridiculously one said one way others another in which he ought to spend it at length after every one had said their say mr monck berkeley looking very seriously said poor young man i pity him i have always from a boy prayed earnestly to god that he would never bestow more money upon me than he would give me sense and grace enough to spend as i ought to do on which his mother wickedly exclaimed oh my dear child so then you have i find been praying for poverty all your life to which he replied my dear mother be that as it may i always have done it and i always shall continue to do it  when a young single woman she always declared that if the great disposer of riches would suffer her to choose as a single woman maid or widow she would prefer a fortune of eight hundred pounds per annum to one of eight thousand for which her excellent sister and an old acquaintance of hers used to laugh her to scorn saying  she is a poor little unambitious soul give us the eight thousand pounds per annum and let her enjoy her paltry eight hundred pounds neither of the three have that annual income one has the really pretty word honorable prefixed to her mrs   somewhat of the same spirit was visible in an housemaid of old lady draper of sunninghill park grandmother of the late amiable pious t baber esquire old sir thomas and lady draper were neighbors and intimate friends of the editors grandfather the very worthy john finch esquire of fienes court in whose clothes king charles escaped with lady jane lane they met often and lady draper not a modern fine lady but one of solomons looking well to the ways of her household see proverbs chapter xxxi ver     finding sometimes occasion for a little objurgation one of her honest old housemaids used to say aye well my lady may threaten what she will but thank god she can never make me queen of england that is my comfort perhaps this honest woman had lived at court and seen good quiet mild queen mary milling the old dutchmans chocolate on her knees until her face perspired so as to need wiping this the editor can assert is a fact it having been repeatedly told to her by her mother to whom it was related by mrs lee daughter of mr lee page of the backstairs this lady was the queens goddaughter was perpetually with her used to read the bible to her some hours every day every one remembers  henrietta of bourbon come and draw off my boots set a beggar on horseback and he will ride to the d l it is to be feared one is almost tempted to say hoped such lowbred tyrants will ride or fly to him  as a wife when a young woman she always resolved if she ever did marry she would labor to be what her excellent mother was universally said to be  the best wife in the world the editor has often said if she had been married to belphegor vide the devil upon two sticks  she would have tried to have made him a good wife that the poor devil might at least have served out his time on earth  as a mother if god vouchsafed to entrust her with the great blessing of children which she humbly hoped he would to be indefatigable in attending to their souls their minds their manners their persons and their fortunes it pleased the divine goodness to prosper her labors in every instance but the last certainly in her estimation the least she applied to one considerable gentleman whom she flattered herself gratitude for what he had twentyfive years before deemed great favors would have induced to have introduced her son to mr pit who could had he been introduced and she doubts not would have effectually served him and himself at the same time but she found verified put not your trust in any child of man psalm cxliv ver    this gentleman exceedingly intimate with the premier from early youth wrote the editor for dr berkeley said he could not write to him a very polite letter of declination  in it speaking of his gratitude for dr berkeleys favors but she did put her trust in him who has never yel failed her and to whom she daily offers praise for having provided in his own best way for her beloved son who used often to say what is to become of me if my health does not permit me to go to the bar to which his mother constantly replied never fear trust gods word yet never saw i the righteous forsaken nor his seed begging their bread psalm xxxvii ver     i have not the smallest doubt if it pleases god to spare your life that the descendant in fact as your father mother and aunt are out of the question the only descendant of bishop berkeley and mr cherry will ever be suffered to want either the convenieces or the comforts of life necessary in the station of life in which providence has been pleased to place you you know how often i have repeated to you the speech of the late admiral haddock to his children on his deathbed and how much oftener one of my favorite texts a small thing that the righteous has is better than great riches of the ungodly ibid ver      so fearful was the editor left her children when they grew up should be tempted to marry some girl whose thirty fifty or an hundred thousand pounds had been obtained by gambling contracting willmaking and various other honorable methods of obtaining a vast fortune ever hoping money so gained might never be brought by marriage into her family  so strongly and so early did she inculcate this and some other important matters on the minds of her children that one little angel who took its happy flight before it had lived eight years and a half one day said mamma i have been thinking that if you do not live till i am old enough to marry i shall never marry at all  mrs berkeley  why not my dear  little boy  why i am resolved you shall choose my wife for me then i am sure she will be a good one the editor cannot possibly although from the mouth of a poor child of seven years old add the compliment made by the sweet little creature to his mother   the editor ever a friend to that holy institution ordained by god to complete mans felicity even before he fell replied oh my dear if you pray to god he will direct you to a good wife  the little boy shook his little head and said no no if you die i will not have a wife that will be the safest way for me i am sure  the repetition of this curious dialogue at dinner the children not present being gone off to school afforded great diversion  many persons will probably laugh at the editor for frequently talking to her children as if they were grown up she followed in that instance the plan pursued by her wise mother who never expecting to live to see her daughters grow up gave them various rules of conduct that could she have ensured her life she might rather have told them at fifteen than at eleven one the editor as she thinks it very wise will here set down  if ever you marry and are not blessed with good health always keep it to yourselves unless you are too seriously ill to keep about nothing wears out a mans love like hearing a woman always mewling and languishing and crying oh my head aches sadly my stomach is disordered i am nervous today etc etc  the editor had her daughter lived would have added never weary your husband with the faults of the servants or any family matters of which the lady if wise should bear the burden always taking care to make home as pleasant as possible to her husband that children at a very tender age attend seriously to what their parents say particularly if they love their parents may be proved by looking into dodwells the editor cannot here omit heaving a sigh over the amiable daughterinlaw of this learned man one of the three celebrated beauties at the public act at oxford in      before the editors birth the lovely lady of archdeacon dodwell whom a very gracious providence sent through a very deep snow on foot one of her horses being lame to the editors mothers on the afternoon on which her angelic spirit took its happy flight to the realms of bliss almost in an instant good god what were the sufferings of the editor and her sister on that dreadful night how much sorer but for that lovely friend who never quitted them until some time after the funeral sweet spirit thou art receiving thy reward for that painful labor of love to the daughters of thy kind thy beloved revered friend this lovely lady left several sons and three excellent daughters two happy wives the third a most amiable mourning widow the eldest wife of  ridding esquire of southampton the second wife of the reverend  holland minister of the duke of somersets parish in wiltshire the editor often when residing at magdalen lodge called on to wonder at the excellent character of his grace then at christ church constantly replied that she could not wonder as mr holland was there on the strictest friendship the third the lovely mourning relict of the uncommonly amiable reverend j southcombe of devonshire in the possession of one of these worthy ladies whom the editor has not seen for some years is probably a very curious little toy to which perhaps the editor may in some measure owe what her friends and acquaintance used to style her very elegnt correct taste in dress it is certain she has turned many young ladies into beauties by directing them to dress as became their face and person it is wonderful all girls of sense do not attend to it without entirely departing from that absolute monarch fashion but to return to the toy which she the editor conceives to be now if not always an unique for at no toyshop since she went to town at eighteen could she ever pick up one it is a silver case somewhat larger somewhat thicker than a crown piece on one lid is elegantly painted a beautiful young man and woman only decently covered the case contains about ten or twelve different fine dresses painted on isinglass which laid on the young couple sometimes exhibited them in one dress sometimes in another the editor well remembers in one they appear as a chimneysweeper and his wife but the astonishing alteration that dress produces on the human features cannot be conceived by those who have not seen this little perhaps two hundred years old curiosity for the editor never met with any person who had seen such a thing as this excepting those who have seen the one here described life by brokesby at the age of five and mr newtons life in his letters at the age of six  the editor could now she believes write down verbatim her excellent fathers description of the infernal regions to her one sunday evening when she was not quite seven pears old it is she well knows the beginning the fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom as love is the fulfilling of the law etc bishop tailor says think what it will be for your soul when it quits the body to be dragged by devils etc and the pious dr flavel says if you could hear what a shriek your poor soul will give etc of what is now her sole delight the love of christ for rescuing her from misery so finely painted by her pious parent  admiral haddock when near his death thus addressed his family my dear children considering the situation i am in and the advantages i have had i do not leave you as large fortunes as you might according to the world reasonably expect but what i do leave you i promise you my dear children will prosper will wear well for i have the comfort of knowing that it is not watered with the tears of one seamans widow or orphan wise happy admiral two or three very remarkable instances might be adduced from his family to show that the second commandment is not yet repealed the promise of showing mercy etc as well as  visiting to the third and fourth generation the editor grieves to hear about two years ago that one of the granddaughters of the excellent admiral had taken for a second husband that tyrant  late major in the  regiment of horse to whom the spirited old fishwoman at canterbury administered a good handful of scotch snuff when the amiable major was endeavoring to make his escape from the riding escorted by the then mayor and alderman smith to avoid being rolled in the kennel properly prepared for him by the editors worthy old neighbors on account of his amiable conduct to the poor soldiers he has now no soldiers under his command but he has alas a poor illfated lady the account of his treatment of the said poor lady and the only servant he allowed her with a poor infant brat of his own about eight months old by a family of the editors acquaintance who passed some weeks at a wateringplace with them thrilled the editor and mrs frinsham with horror they united in honoring the conduct of miss  a young lady about seventeen whom compassion to her poor mother keeps with her often for many weeks together may god reward her with as kind an husband as her own father was  etc  the late lord  got a clause inserted in the militia act some years ago as dr berkeley and several kentish gentlemen told the editor on purpose to enable a very highly respected friend of the editor captain haddock the good admirals second son to qualify him to hold some commission in one division of the kentish militia  his attention to the men and their profiting none can forget who frequented canterbury cathedral about twenty years ago when they were quartered in that city  the editor cannot here forbear relating a curious anecdote of this excellent gentleman very many years ago when we were at war with spain and some considerable town was taken the churches were despoiled of their fine pictures four or six very large exquisitely fine ones were purchased by a captain of a man of war lying near the city and at his return to england presented to admiral haddock who had a good collection at wrothamplace the admirals seat they remained in the drawing room many long years the admiration of all whose eye can be delighted by fine paintings  a few years ago on the death of the very worthy  haddock esquire the good admirals eldest son the estate house etc devolving to the editors pious friend he wrote over to the church in spain whence the fine pictures had been pillaged when the town was sacked desiring to be informed by what method he might restore them to the temple whence they had been torn the righteous offer was gratefully accepted and mr haddock has to his real unaffected piety the delight of thinking that instead of robbing god he has restored what even his ancestors did not wrest from the temple of god oh that all who have robbed god in tithes it is wished that there was a new edition of sir henry spelmans history of sacrilege which the editor studied hard at sixteen years old and so inculcated its doctrine on her son that nothing would have induced him to have any thing to do with them would make restitution our poor clergy of the church of england would not then be so straightened even those with what are called good livings of three or four hundred pounds per annum as they now are what is three hundred pounds per annum after taxes etc are paid to keep and dress decently a gentleman his wife five children to be educated and three servants if in this life only they the clergy have hope in christ they are of all men most miserable says st paul  on the editors congratulating her friend on his worthiness his happiness on so doing he replied my dear madam i only wonder that my father and brother left it for me to do but i dare say it never occurred to them that it was practicable or i am sure they would not have failed to do it what makes mr haddocks merit double is that he loves fine pictures of sacred history as well as the editor and is an excellent judge of painting and had a small collection before he became possessed of wrothamplace when he resided at canterbury where dr berkeley and the editor became acquainted with him his worthy lady and family  it has been already mentioned that mr berkeley used to say that the editor laid all the faults aukwardness etc that any man committed on his mother excepting what related to him as a scholar bad greek or latin the editor has through life asserted and maintained against some of her friends that there are certain elegances to be learned in the house of a father in a certain rank of society before the age of fifteen which if not learned before that age are never attained certainly the dining room the drawing room conversation of persons of good education must necessarily be very different from the tabletalk of good honest people in the parlour behind the shop in an alley in cheapside or in cities where the grammar school is supported by the dean and prebendaries as at canterbury york gloucester etc  the editors canterbury chairmans son is she hears a very worthy divine the son of mr bhs footman is a very learned divine and dr berkeley told the editor a very few years ago that the very learned mr naylor upper master of the kingsschool at canterbury told him as did some other gentlemen that the best scholar in the school was the son of dr berkeleys butcher stephen couchman then eighteen fit for the university but his mother would not suffer his very rich father to send him thither but made him stay at home knock down oxen and carry out meat the editor saw him with a basket on his shoulder during her last visit to canterbury this youth will be tempted to curse instead of bless his  mother the sons of such sometimes very worthy persons if sent to st pauls or merchanttailorsschool may be at least as good often better latin and greek scholars than the sons of noblemen or gentlemen but they cannot have listened the three holyday months of the twelve to refined elegant cultivated persons manner of expressing their ideas and sentiments it is not possible that the wife of a butcher or baker etc should attend to the manner in which her son pronounces the vowels the few vowels introduced into our english language the melting them all down as the editor frequently remarks to her friends may make a very good hodgepodge but she prefers the component parts separate the editor well remembers that when the worthy mr blacowe was for his zealous services at oxford preferred by the ministers of george the second to a canonry of windsor sure it had been wiser to have exalted and hidden him in some less elegant place a very learned refined cultivated friend of the editors said the man reads like a bargeman to which the editor replied he reads like a lowborn man for he has been taught only two of the five vowels  what do you mean  why he melts the e the o and the u all into one so has only a with which in reading he constantly couples w and except when used for ego always metamorphoses i into u he gurdeth himself etc and the  gurdle of his lines for  loins he makuth the cloweds the u he turns into ew trewly god is loving unto israel  well to be sure replied the gentleman he does just what you say the late agreeable h b b esquire when dining with mr blacowes nextdoor neighbor used to say cr is blacowe at home if he is i must mind and not take a glass too much for fear i should say something and have an informawgion against me  the editors father having taken incessant pains with his girls they lost him alas when the eldest was just eleven years old the editor bestowed the same attention on her children which undoubtedly adds wonderfully to the beauty both of speaking and reading and she found a most incomparable coadjutor in the exquisitely elegant dr beauvoir who as mr john hey above named frequently told the editor was wonderfully strict in making the boys at the kings school mark their vowels in speaking english so very sharply admiring much how accurately dr berkeleys children pronounced them dr beauvoir was really a fine gentleman as well as a very great and elegant scholar of the former the editor was a judge her amiable partner of the latter his father and mother both as the editor has frequently been told exquisitely elegant persons of ancient families dr beauvoir was an exceedingly grateful man to the family of his kind generous patron dean lynch and also to the editor for the little attentions bestowed on his daughter mrs hammond such as sometimes crowding her an eighth into her coach from a country as well as a city rout dr berkeley used goodhumouredly to say for he was ever ready to oblige as well as serve all  my coach is the canterbury hack yet on mrs berkeleys last melancholy visit there she found that some of those with whom she had frequently crowded her coach and been reproached by mrs  and miss  for so doing could not find an uncrowded place for her supposing it good for an infirm tender halfblind aged matron to walk about that ancient city in the dirt and rain  the editor thinks that she cannot bid adieu to canterbury without making mention of the conduct of some of old and new friends there of the lovely studied attentions of the thoroughly amiable mrs piercy  of the new sweet mrs weston and to dr luxmore from whom mrs berkeley an entire stranger on the strength of the character given of him by her dear son presumed to ask a favor for a friend which he most politely most amiably granted  to the little auditor for noble gratitude to the widow of the gentleman to whose indefatigable zeal he obtained that lucrative situation when little more than a  boy for ordering the thirteen rings for his patron instead of being guinea rings to be moidore ie twentyseven shilling rings on mrs berkeley enquiring if those of any former prebendary or dean had been so costly he replied no but that the widow of a worthy apothecary lately deceased had ordered such for her cousins to which mrs berkeley replied that as dr berkeley was not an apothecary nor the prebendaries her cousins guinea ones might have done he said he had also ordered one for himself ulysses exclaims gods how the sons degenerate from the sires mrs berkeley really believes the father of this little man to be one of the most generous of men of what is his own he presented to his brother six thousand pounds mrs berkeley cannot avoid contrasting this provident little bachelor with his near neighbor and brother lawyer mrs berkeley having some law business to transact applied to mr cummyn the editor earnestly wishes that she could send mr cummyn over to ireland that she may not be obliged to send herself into an english cottage  for in a castle or in a cavern she must pay the butcher and baker every monday morning the editor always did from fifteen years old close the account of her clothes as well as of her house on the last day of the old year the clothes account many years of late excepting two doleful years of mourning did not amount to more than ten pounds this year to little more than four heelpiecing shoes mending clogs and a little black ribband tape and thread all regularly entered including one pound one for a permit to hide with powder her poor old frizzling locks which she has done but twice since may alas why will not mr pit pity poor aged widows and aged maidens it is shameful to make poor old creatures pay a guinea  to prevent their frighting the crows  brother of captain cummyn who accompanied admiral byron to patagonia who executed the business speedily and well on mrs berkeleys calling one morning to desire her bill he observed that it was really so trifling that it was not worth while to charge any thing on mrs berkeleys remonstrating with him he very politely amiably replied that it had been discharged before it had been contracted by mrs berkeleys attention to his wife and daughter they were alas trifling mrs berkeley was of too little importance in the world to benefit any one much however finding that although she could not get money out of the auditors hands eleven pounds until she had proved dr berkeleys will she could not possibly get any into the hands of the worthy generous mr cummyn she found amongst her things a little offering which he was so obliging as to accept as a souvenir of an old neighbor  on dr berkeley then in scotland announcing dr beauvoirs marriage with miss sharp he said to his son berkeley you do not seem much astonihed at it on which mr monck berkeley replied why no my dear sir i am not astonished at all for if a lady wished for an agreeable companion i do declare i do not know where she could possibly have found a more agreeable man than my old master and i am very glad he has got the lady that he may not toil on as he used to do with us idle dogs  mr berkeley revered those who in his youth labored to force him to learn mention is made in the memoires de le duc de saint simon of one of the princes of the blood who never would forgive his preceptors not having compelled him to study in his youth he was certainly a man of strong understanding if not of learning  the editor feels that had not her parents bestowed the best education on her that money could procure she never could have loved them living or respected their memory if she did not profit by it the fault was her own mr monck berkeley was quite of his mothers mind a rather diverting anecdote showing mr monck berkeleys ideas concerning education when a boy is here subjoined  the very grateful agreeable mr taswell rector of aylsham in norfolk wrote to dr berkeley saying that he meant to wait on him for two or three days in his way to town and he hoped mrs berkeley would permit him to bring his little girl who was going to town to visit an aunt the day before their arrival mr monck berkeley said to his father i suppose as soon as ever breakfast is over and mamma has been to the larder and ordered dinner she will take miss taswell up stairs get the french and italian grammars and the maps and teach her all her lessons over and examine her thoroughly dr berkeley was wonderfully diverted with his sons idea not then thirteen years old as mrs berkeley always told her children that as soon as ever they entered their teens the words papa and mamma were to be laid aside for my father and mother when speaking of their parents  sir and madam as usual when speaking to them and exclaimed you monkey do you think because your mamma worries herself every day of her life to teach you that she will plague herself to teach other children no no nothing but her violent love of you could make her slave as she does your mothers delight is in learning not in teaching i wish to god you had your mothers rage for knowledge it would be a happy thing for you  mrs berkeley certainly had that rage from her very early youth and it continued with her until she lost her idol it is not yet quite extinct the flame is out but the embers still glow a little  a wonderfully wellinformed respected friend the lady of the late governor  being in the editors room many years ago mentioned something in astronomy that was new to the editor she sprang out upon the staircase and called out to mrs then miss frinsham  sister sister come hither this minute and mrs  will make you as wise as solomon mrs frinsham dressing for dinner said i am without my clothes   never mind your clothes but come directly the worthy lady laughed so violently that it recovered mrs berkeley from her extacy of joy on gaining some addition to her delightful if not useful knowledge it has often been the subject of mirth to the three friends mrs berkeley also dressing disengaged herself like lightning from under the hands of her maid  but to return to the uncommonly sensible amiable very highly accomplished miss taswell she needed no instruction from mr berkeleys mother her own excellent father thoroughly sensible of the blessing of a good education has spared no pains no cost to bestow it on his daughters the young lady above named her father a few months ago when he visited the editor told her he was going to lose happy the young gentleman who gains her the editor knows him not but if he is not a happy husband she is firmly persuaded that the fault must be entirely in himself  the editor has known and admired the merits of miss taswell since she was seven years old at that very early period by the wise care of her mother she was absolutely better qualified to conduct a moderate sized family than most of the  misses of seventeen are now  the editor often wishes to be told what it is that modern young ladies are taught but nobody that she meets with can tell her except it is a little music whether they have ear or no ear matters not and to speak a sort of gibberish something in short that is not english for english very few of them can speak fewer write the editor now sees no beautiful worked gowns or aprons all is cobblestitched which the dairymaid could perform as well as miss the editor is sometimes asked how she would have young ladies educated her reply is as the lady of sir richardcarr glyn was one of her amusements when about twelve years old was putting poor little girls to school to learn to work walking out of a summer evening to see how they had worked calling on the sick poor in their cottages relieving their necessities reporting their situation to her worthy parents dr and mrs berkeley dining one day at barston with the very sensible worthy mr and mrs harvey parents of the late  of the present brave and to the editor obliging admiral harvey he favoring her with the perusal in ms of his tremendous voyage with the late lord mulgrave the editor met the lovely little lass going on one of these pleasant walks mrs berkeley used to tell her son many years after that if he had a good long rentroll to produce she would have advised him to go and make his bow to the excellent miss plumtre the editor heard from her son that the daughters of an amiable duke and duchess are educated  selon mon gout and she hears from some of her friends that the lady greys daughters of lord stamford are excellently educated as of her own knowledge is miss ormsbey niece of her amiable friend mrs owen niece to the late lord godolphin about a week ago the editor received a letter from a very ancient very worthy baronet whom she has known since he was eleven years old requesting her to recommend a good wife to him the editor laying down the letter exclaimed i fear sir   has lost his wits in the wise days of the wise king we read that they were rather scarce what a request to make to a poor forlorn oldfashioned creature quite retired from life the world forgetting by the world forgot the editor has been several times asked what can have induced her to quit the gay neighborhood of windsor and bury herself alive in the little dull town of chertsey her constant reply that she may not be called upon to bury dead the last near if not the last dear relative that the wisdom of providence has spared to soothe her woes and smooth her passage through the ugly vale of years to the tomb mrs berkeley assures her enquiring friends that it is impossible the air ever should be stagnant with mr fox within one mile on one side and sir joseph mawbey on the other the editor has not yet seen either of these sensible men probably they do not visit aged matrons that her spirit cannot stagnate with so very judicious an evangelical a preacher as the reverend mr white curate of chertsey nor is it possible the little wits that affliction illness and a premature old age have left her should stagnate whilst she is frequently favored with the visits of her and dr berkeleys wonderfully witty friend the learned reverend e w whitaker of thorpehouse this gentleman has as much wit as his celebrated father the sergeant and he has what alas his learned witty father had not all the country is rejoicing that mr whitaker has taken out his dedimus he has already diverted the editor and her sister with one or two justice adventures add to this the acquisition of lady and miss young mother and sister of sir william young she therefore flatters herself that she shall not just yet become an absolute vegetable   the editor admires the wisdom of colonel  who a few five or six years ago carried his daughters to york for the winter some one said i see sir you have brought the young ladies that they may have a little pleasure  no indeed i have brought them that they may get a little profit that they may spend their mornings at mrs  name forgotten a famous pastrycook etc in order that they may know how to make good wives if ever they marry and by understanding the management of a family try to keep their husbands out of a jail if their mother pleases she may take them to some diversions in an evening sometimes the colonel is a wise man probably his daughters will not  hang on hand  the editor does so loath the present horridly ugly bold indecent it is so prostituted in these equallizing days as is quite diverting during the editors residence at magdalenelodge she went one evening to the house of a gardener to speak about some fruit his wife a laundress she saw a very tall girl  arrayed in purple and fine linen a fine muslin dress and a most sumptuous lilac bandau  odiously tied behind instead of elegantly on the left side large bows and the ends hanging down quite to the ground struck with so much finery sweeping along on the floor of a very small redbricked kitchen mrs frinsham asked who is that the good laundress replied her father is porter of  college poor young lady she has lost her mamma and she is very fond of coming to visit my daughters how are young ladies fallen dress of the young females she cannot will not prostitute the pretty elegant words young ladies to bestow them upon beings resembling swifts yahoos  god almighty when speaking in the holy scriptures of any thing remarkably lovely condescends to compare it to a beautiful virgin certainly the most lovely being created in this lower world  not a modern english young woman  virgins they will probably remain even were war to cease and the fire not to consume our young men our maidens would not however given to be taken in marriage psalm lxxviii ver      the editor one day at the oaks hearing three young men on a visit to her son two of high birth the other has attained much in his profession of arms talking of the charms of the  belles the editor said what signifies talking and sighing over them you had better marry and settle down quietly one replied why my dear madam one cannot afford to marry the young ladies are become so horridly expensive he has ventured on a country baronets daughter very prudently educated by a wise worthy mother and the editor pronounces her ladyship a very happy woman if it is not her own fault for   unites with the gentleness of the dove the prudence of the serpent and he has a noble estate she trusts that he does not suffer her ladyship to dress like a yahoo  whoever remembers twickenham forty years ago if they had not the felicity of visiting mrs isham eldest daughter of sir justinian isham must have envied those who did visit her this agreeable worthy lady is introduced here on account of a repartee of hers to her father when it is probable young ladies dressed so as to make conquests of worthy sensible men alas for sweet mrs isham and a most amiable young gentleman she did but by the perverseness of a father on one side and the covetousness of an uncle on the other it was decreed they were not to be united the gentleman died of a broken heart very soon the lady survived about forty years resolved never to marry the lovelorn tale too long to be inserted here is never related by the editor without filling her eyes with tears after which she amuses herself and her auditors by execrating the father and uncle  after the death of lady isham ald sir jus as he was always styled thought very unwisely he would abridge the young ladies of their annual visit to london they gave several broad hints at length the abovenamed lady said dear sir i hope you will let us go to town this spring  sir jus  to town girls what should you go to town for no no you are very happy here in the country  young lady  but we want to buy some new clothes sir  sir jus   new clothes indeed why the scripture tells you that the kings daughter was allglorious within  mrs isham  yes sir but it also tells us that her clothing was of wrought gold and we wish to resemble her outwardly as well as inwardly  the wit of the young lady prevailed one cannot say over the wisdom of the father to do justice to sir justinian finding that by his parsimony he had doomed his lovely daughter to perpetual celibacy he bequeathed her a much larger fortune than he gave to any of his other younger children but to be sure one must say that had botany bay been discovered he deserved to have been exiled thither and the sensible amiable mr rs rich old uncle ought to have been hanged outright without benefit of clergy for forcing a rich fool into the arms of his nephew alas the actors of and in this tragedy are all now retired behind the scene  it always provokes the editor to hear a stupid father or mother telling poor girls that they are happier at their elbow than at the raceball no let young people have a reasonable share of innocent amusement why should man be more rigid than god who says by his prophet jeremiah thou shall again go forth in the dances of them that make merry it cannot therefore be sin  the editor never suffered mr monck berkeley to call her mamma after he entered his teens telling him it was like a lamb but when speaking of her always my mother of course from the time he could articulate madam when speaking to her  the editor holds in detestation the idea of children of whatever age calling their parents mr or mrs when speaking to them insomuch that sometimes when the editor after mr monck berkeley was grown up has been inattentive to what her son was saying to her after he had called madam two or three times he would say well madam if you will not listen to me i protest i will call you mrs berkeley it has always had the desired effect procuring an answer and i protest if you do i will knock you down  the last ridotto before the editor married at about eight in the evening thus late by her own request the famous mr  hairdresser attended her to try to make her wonderfully curling hair like an africans keep straight as was the fashion then for a few hours observing the poor man ready to faint she asked if she should order the servant to bring him a glass of wine on its arrival the editor asked if he would have a bit of toast he replied she was very good and if it would not be too much trouble to mr joseph a very worthy greyheaded servant of mrs frinsham and the editor before her marriage he should be very glad for that he had not tasted bit or sup since eight in the morning  had been flying over the town to ladies the editor pitying him he said he was used to it all the winter in a greater or less degree  that he seldom got hom to dinner till six oclock a ton hour now  that he often begged mrs  his wife not to wait for him  this so struck the editor that the next day she conjured dr then mr berkeley that if ever she became his wife which she did on the easter tuesday following he would never call her mrs berkeley but his wife when he spoke of her and by her christian name when he spoke to her wishing to be some how as we berkshire folks say distinguished from her hairdressers lady who a few years after by the death of a rich old miller his uncle kept a chariot and saved mrs  the trouble of waiting dinner for him he then ceased to wait on the ladies he was an excellent hairdresser  the editor hopes he made a good esquire  postscript the editor takes this opportunity of publishing her heartfelt gratitude to several excellent friends who have most generously most kindly most amiably assisted her in various ways since her being left forlorn and desolate to struggle to wade though much intricate unpleasant some quite unexpected business  her gratitude to her old excellent friend sir richard hill  to dr berkeleys old friend the dean of hereford  to the thoroughly amiable hearted dr lynch prebendary of canterbury  and to the very grateful reverend charles sawkins student of christ church have been already noticed  the editor wants an abler pen than her own to express what she feels for the exceedingly great kindness of that unwearied friend commissioner hey of the customs with whose exquisite wit the editors spirit has not been regaled for many years until an opportunity presented itself of showing what the editor has long known that brilliant as that gentlemans wit is his worth exceeds it as numbers benefited by it can testify the amiability of that gentlemans heart was ever admired by dr berkeley what does he now feel toward him and every kind worthy friend of his perplexed widow  the excellent generous mr wilberforce the editor although very highly obliged to his goodness has never yet seen  to the very obliging polite mr edwards bookseller in pall mall the editor is much indebted for very judicious kind advice given in a matter of which the editor had not a competent knowledge and of which mr edwards was an excellent judge  the editor is likewise much indebted to the very worthy printer of mr monck berkeleys poems and to his compositors for the patience they have shown in deciphering the crowded interlined generally illwritten sheets of this preface in which are few errors of the press although many of the pen  the editor when writing a common letter in haste sometimes leaves out three words of a sentence occasioned by a vile trick contracted in early youth of softly saying her sentence as she is writing and dull as her wits now are they reverse the old proverb of not letting ones tongue run before ones wit for the editor wishes that her pen could only keep pacc with her wits slow as they now are it would save her friends the few who are still visited by her letters the editor means here to adopt rather to adapt a scottish fashion the people of north britain have many clever some elegant ones of the latter is the always going dressed in a black gown or coat the first visit after the family visited have lost a near relation the editor has constantly practiced it since her return from scotland just before the editor set out for scotland she was driven by her dear son several miles in the phaeton to make one of these distressing visits at the house of a  not very distant relation where they met half the  fine folk of berks they were fine in a double sense as they were persons of fashion all clad in red blue green etc ladies and gentlemen lady  was very elegantly very gaily dressed mr berkeley and his mother of course in mourning and the mourning of both was internal as well as external on driving out of the court yard the editor as if she had taken a peep at scotland said to her son my dear berkeley it has really sickened me to see so many gaudy colors in this house of mourning one of the former is an article in the edinburgh newspapers after the death inserted it is hoped his or her relations will accept this notification of his or her death the editor having been obliged on account of the tender health of her last near and exceedingly dear relative her excellent sister to quit the clear fine sharp air of datchet terrace for the mild soft air of surrey has taken a house at chertsey where she expects to be quite beggared by postage one penny for every newspaper well what is that why thirteen shillings per annum addition for the saint jamess chronicle one penny with every scrawl she puts into the post and one penny with every letter that she gets by the post frank or no frank the names of her two kind pocket mps as she always styles her two excellent old friends sir richard hill and sir robert laurie avail no more than were they instead of two most excellent senators the two heroes of an old ballad sung to the editor by her mothers maids when she was a girl which begins robert and richard were two pretty men and they lay abed till the clock it struck ten etc   the editor unless her new neighbor mr fox or somebody can get a post to chertsey must if god spares her life once a quarter insert in the saint jamess chronicle  this is to certify those whom it may concern that mrs george berkeley is still living at chertsey surrey she has this day december         received eight letters besides the postage she pays a penny each to the civil old man who brought them from stains that is eightpence and as every one must be answered eightpence more to carry them to stains so that she is now fully resolved seriously to tell all her friends that she cannot afford to receive or answer their kind letters although they should be franked as to those of her foes she will not suffer her servants to take in a letter in an unknown hand the franking bill and paper tax will soon reduce females to a state of barbarism again as the editor conceives the editor is resolved to advise all her female acquaintance to give up letterwriting even her few young friends to wait and give viva voce the account of their conquests cruelty etc etc accounts of lovers old and new to their friend dr berkeley always said if the minister once gets the house of commons to give up franking it is over with them like sampson they become weak like other men since sending this to press the editor is told by her servant that the letters when carried to the civil humble postman the letters are all deposited in a very large heap on a neat clean white dresser whence one may as easily take as lay a letter  but the editor has no bank bills to send off  who always came like the rollboy etc with one knock until the editor advised him to feel his own consequence and give two smart raps as other postmen every where do and as he now does the worthy man said he hoped people would not think it presuming in him good humble man perhaps he may sometimes be charged with a letter  from the countess of puddledock vide faery tale or some such great personage to some chertsey trader  or perhaps a sheet to the editor  who if on a saintsday can hardly get time before three oclock when she must eat her dinner and the post sets off for stains at five oclock so letterwriting is here handsomely taken leave of by the editor and for the st jamess chronicle she will order them to lie till some neighbor goes to town who will bring them postage free  sit down and read a batch together as she has heard is done in the east indies for which she has often pitied the poor rich nabobesses they may now pity her it must hurt the revenue the abridging girls of writing what reams of paper as lady br used to say did the editor and her ladyships lovely niece waste in writing to each other her ladyship had no great talents for letterwriting and here the editor abjures it and advises all her acquaintance and friends to do it except some friend will take charge of a letter and then as is frequently the case forget to deliver it since writing the above the editor finds that the clever way of getting to and sending letters from chertsey is with a yard of ribbon or small piece of cloth etc for what with the opposition coaches and wagon the carriages that pass and repass from london to chertsey are going nearly the editor believes quite half a score times every day sundays not excepted which makes it exceedingly convenient indeed and very reasonable blessings on opposition may all the inhabitants of chertsey and its environs say bishop berkeley used to say it is over with england when there is no opposition but it should be kept under    a vast deal of trouble  and herself also if she has leisure to run them over the lamenting and correcting her nonsense  the prophet exclaims are there none amongst all the sons that she has brought up to take her by the hand to guide her the editor replies no not one  there are four irish gentlemen every one men of large fortune and appointments whose only home for very many years residence at eton and harrow school for the three months holydays of every year was the house of their relation dr berkeley  to the etonian a gentleman of many thousand pounds a year for ages in the family his sweetly amiable father constantly took care to make dr berkeleys irish debtors pay with tolerable punctuality if they did not by the generosity of his excellent kind relation mr monck of grange gormond father of the marchioness of waterford it was pretty much the same to dr berkeley mr monck saying to his amiable brother whether dr berkeleys people pay or not remit his money regularly on my account they will pay some time or other such favors can never be obliterated from a grateful mind the three others had no such claim nor any claim  and on their arrival at harrow school in the year      their uncle said they were to remain seven years the year round holydays and all as schoolboys the editor felt for them and besought dr berkeley to let them come to him he replied i will not have you tormented with all the brats of my irish relations turning yourself into a boarding dame mrs berkeley conjured dr berkeley to send the coach to fetch them for three or four days that she might see what sort of geniuses they were and if they were well behaved a little mutton etc would not be much expense in a family of thirteen or fourteen persons accordingly she prevailed  as women generally do with wise men if their aim is worthy and they set rightly about it soon after dr berkeleys marriage a younger brother of dr joshua berkeley now dean of tuam whose only english home during his stay at westminster school and long after at christ church oxon was dr berkeleys house came with his worthy eldest brother and his youngest to visit dr berkeley at bray the youth for whom dr berkeley had procured a studentship of christ church fell ill of the smallpox and dr berkeleys mother then at his house thought it better that the editor who had never had the smallpox should leave the house rather than master william berkeley although mr falwasser the apothecary assured her there was not the least danger attended the removing the youth it very nearly cost the editor her life she lost her infant and the taking a readyfurnished house to reside in for three months scouring spoiling beds curtains etc lest the editor should get the smallpox that in her family direful disease cost dr berkeley an hundred pounds he sensibly felt the only return he met with from his uncle or either of his learned sons   mrs berkeley is sorry to be obliged to say that neither of these gentlemen who used to weep the late amiable mr henchman of all souls coming in one day saw charles  esquire with his arms round mrs berkeleys neck sobbing and the tears flowing plentifully from the editors eyes exclaimed what is the matter is not this very extraordinary to which dr berkeley replied no it is always the case when they leave us they love my wise i believe better than their mother i am sure she is an excellent mother to them and the coach has been at the gate this half hour to carry them to harrow this gentleman paid attention to mr monck berkeley when in ireland and on mrs berkeleys writing to him a few years ago requesting him to make enquiry in dublin concerning a young gentleman son of a canterbury neighbor just then married to an irish lady of good family and as the event has proved merit he obligingly complied  and in one of his letters politely said he had not forgotten favors received at dr berkeleys the editors friend mrs d says that ireland is  the land where all things are forgotten this lady has or had one vautrien friend an english woman who marrying greatly in ireland as most english women do gave herself high airs and forgot her english friends she took care that the late excellent mrs gl should not forget her for she drew upon her regularly for an annuity that generous woman had settled upon her when a poor english beauty bitterly when leaving her to return to school ever wrote to dr berkeley on the loss of his excellent son or to the editor since to offer to assist her in her irish affairs  mrs berkeley feels herself indebted to the goodness of charlesberkeley kippax esquire greatnephew of bishop berkeley whom the editor never saw until about three years before the death of dr berkeley and whom she with all her rhetoric could not persuade dr berkeley to invite to his house at holyday times he saying you shall not be devoured by my relations kippax has uncles in england to this gentleman she has since her loss of dr berkeley been obliged for some assistance in her irish affairs and she has endeavored to show her gratitude otherwise than by mere words  the editor before she finally closes this postscript wishes to repeat to her few remaining friends in distant parts for alas numbers have within a short space gone to those distant shores whence they cannot return until time shall be no more her change of abode since the writing and printing the dedication mr monck berkeley early in life made to himself a solemn promise that he would never write a dedication during his life lest as he used to say the devil should tempt him to flatter with his pen knowing he would not with his tongue  that  although she cannot now boast of keeping as she used to do when resident at the oaks the best and cheapest inn at canterbury where she had often the pleasure of returning the amiable attentions paid to her son in town by persons to whom neither his father or mother had the honor to be known and as they sometimes found the pleasure of being acquainted with  she resides at present at chertsey where when she receives any money from ireland to pay the butcher and baker every monday morning she will be happy to see any real friend and poor desolate females whether widows or maidens who are too poor to be courted too old to be flattered  they need not dread being crowded with company an amiable friend of mr monck berkeleys youth frequently does the editor the honor to say that he should esteem it an honor if she would spend some weeks at his seat with himself and his lovely lady the editor wickedly it is wickedly as she is persuaded he is sincere laughs and says  invite on press tommy you are very safe i assure you for i shall never visit you if the editors life should be spared until next summer and she can prevail on her sister to accompany her she means to go for one week as were it not so distant she would be happy to accept the thoroughly polite invitation of mr monck berkeleys highly respected old eton st andrews friend the very amiable very grateful for slight favors received at st andrews mr hume son of the late lord bishop of sarum nephew to lord kinnoul mr berkeley always spoke in high terms of mr humes worth when an etonian the editor rejoices to hear that he is so happily married long may he enjoy his felicity on earth late exchange it for higher felicity  the editor to her corresponding friends the editor having publicly declared war with one of her favorite amusements from ten years old at present her only remaining one letterwriting rather letter scribbling unluckily for her for her friends she too early in life lighted on that passage in one of dean swifts letters that he never leaned on his elbow when writing a letter to study or think what he was to write but set down just what came into his head or occurred at the moment the editor then thought it very clever so it might perhaps for such a brilliant genius as dean swift but not for miss frinsham at fifteen however the habit was unluckily contracted and every one who has ever read only once dr johnsons delightful vision of theodore must remember the astonishingly beautiful description of habits perhaps good ones in early life are almost as easily contracted as bad ones at least so a learned beathen philosopher tells us but he knew not the doctrine of original sin although all thinking impartial beings must feel it in themselves  mrs berkeley here takes leave to recommend to those friends to whom she may not yet have recommended them as she knows she has to many to purchase and read every day two little books  bogatsky when recommending that excellent little volume the york edition is correct to her old neighbor mr bristow of canterbury to fell he assured her that bogatsky was all the fashion that vast numbers of ladies not gentlemen bought it mrs frinsham uses wittily to say the reason that men do not kneel at church or attend to their souls out of church is because god has made them lords of the creation  the second book is the hymns not psalms of the seraphic dr isaac watts and read one hymn every morning the day of bogatsky and the hymn of watts may both be dispatched in less than seven minutes mrs berkeley supposes that in near thirty years she has scarce missed thirty times invigorating her faith and love to christ by dr watts and her blood boils with indignation at the caution she lately saw in the saint jamess chronicle against a socinian edition of those divine hymns it appears to her impossible that they can be garbled by those wretches where every fourth or fifth line does so exalt the savior of sinners surely none have exceeded few equalled that divine man in incessantly in his writings holding up to view the coequal coeternal godhead of the son and spirit as dr isaac watts his sweet spirit has been long worshipping   why is not that emblem over every altar in every country church as the editor has seen it in some few little obscure village churches particularly in that of west peckham in west kent surrounded with a beautiful nimbus children babes of sense would then ask what it was  there has long been a train laid by the socinian and arian friends of satan to undermine good dr watts there was a hint in a set of bampton lectures several years ago that latterly that pious man was not quite so strenuous etc as formerly the fact is for many years his fine faculties too much used failed and villains got in and asked him ensnaring questions which he forgot before he answered it had been happy had he done as poor pious very weak bishop latimer did when examined by the pious charitable papists of bloody mary i am become old and foolish i will not answer a word to any question you ask me go and read what i printed when i was in vigor and if you dont like it burn me for that and so they very kindly did shortening his then dull journey to glory  as this sheet is not written for the public at large but entirely for mrs george berkeleys correspondents ie her kindly curious friends who want to know what sort of place she has thrust herself into she here sine postage thus writes her dear friend mrs duncombe has many a long year ago celebrated the beauties of the environs the exterior of chertsey if she will be pleased to insert her account in the gentlemans magazine she will oblige her numerous friends and delight many readers of that very sensible work for the interior the editor has already described the excellent preacher and in all times hitherto church has the precedence of state the editor will follow  the good old way the building has but one aile so it will not probably fly away and she hopes the democrates will not pluck its one aile and level it with the ground for mrs b had rather hobble to it on the little on mrs berkeley asking mr whitaker how it came to pass when almost every little town in england was well paved that this had escaped being  in the fashion he replied bless me my dear madam did you never hear how it came to be so paved mrs berkeley foolishly expecting to hear by romans or saxons or danes earnestly said oh no do pray tell me why the tradition is that the devil paved it himself that people might not go to church mrs berkeleys father used to say that it must certainly have been the devil who built the church at great marlow quite at the extremity indeed out of that very long town close to the thames an odd circumstance occurred one sunday almost forty years ago mrs berkeley on a visit there of course at church a barge stranded just as the worthy dr cloberry was devoutly reading the third commandment a perplexed bargeman without the sacred walls uttered the following words distinctly heard by all the congregation gd dn your hands why doant you pull that rope the inhabitants of marlow then had one most excellent custom it were to be wished that it were practiced in other places during divine service at no fixed regular time the churchwardens attended by other proper persons take up their white wands walk out of church and walk through the town inspect the alehouses and mrs berkeley conceives the marlow publicans do not resemble one at cookham who used to shut up his front door and receive a vast deal of good company through his garden at his back door but his landlord was one of the worthy cookham brewers risen from being humbly thankful for a horn of fine ale when working hard at dr berkeleys at bray as a cooper  to making  ale at cookham and together with a dissenting baker during the sequestration after dr berkeley resigned the living of cookham although he rented the house of his successor showed their love of power in a very extraordinary manner indeed the brewer sending repeated orders that dr berkeleys cows should not be in the churchyard the cattle have no other way to get at the thames to drink and the baker bringing his linen up a ladder over a wall repeatedly to dry them on the premises which he said were become his not in the dryingground appropriated for that purpose but tying his ropes to the two finest mulberrytrees in berkshire with which mrs berkeley regaled all her neighbors far and near rich and poor and would as soon have suffered her maids to have dried her linen on them as to have washed it in her dresden china but beggars set on horseback generally ride briskly whether abraham and levi considered themselves great folk as descendants of the father of the faithful or as cookham parish officers mrs berkeley knows not but conceives the latter mrs berkeley telling the late very sensible worthy mr stone carpenter of cookham and churchwarden that he had never sent his clothes to dry or sent for fruit or made the vicarage garden a public walk as mr withers the curate appointed by the parish did he shook his head saying good madam that paper from the archdeacons court was only matter of form there was no need for us to take care of any premises that dr berkeley was in possession of dr berkeley and this worthy man between them had taken care of his soul he collected the offering at the altar on sunday looking good man as if really dead and expired in peace the next tuesday on being advised on sunday not to go to church because he was dying he replied i know it and therefore i will go his health had been long in a very declining state he was a very thoroughly honest just man as i well know he having done all dr berkeleys work for many years and i of course always overlooked and paid his very reasonable remarkably just bills round pebbles than walk smoothly over its foundation as she did the last time she was in france over a cathedral where she had some few years before worshipped god in her own way whilst a noble organ was playing the service during the celebrating not loffice de sauveur in which she could well join to tell you that we have no organ at chertsey would be to tell an untruth as mrs berkeley hears by report that the presbyterians have so far given up the ideas of their ancestors as to suffer the  devils whistle to be played constantly in their meeting houses in many places adopting it is to be feared the popish doctrine of doing and hearing evil that good may come drawing thereby many from the church of england worship however to console us in the parish church for the want of an organ we have a most extraordinary clerk who no doubt conceive that his prayers are as prevalent as those of elijah the prophet on my arrival here mrs frinsham told me that we had a very extraordinary clerk indeed but that she was told she would in time get used to his mode of praying she expressed her wonder that it did not perplex the officiating clergymen she would not tell me what it was saying i should hear for myself arriving here on the saturday evening i of course attended divine service twice on sunday as also on weekdays and the following sunday having been taught from early youth always to follow never precede the clerk in the confession psalms and responses i was exceedingly puzzled indeed when i came to the litany i rubbed my eyes wiped my glasses but all in vain to find out what the poor honest clerk said as the words we and for are so very different in their sound and thanks be to god my ears are as quick as my poor eyes are dull  very remarkably quick always that it was not till several times after giving the utmost attention that i discovered that this good man probably conceiving that his prayers as clerk being louder than the rest of the congregation are better heard in heaven he very kindly in the litany instead of saying  we beseech thee to hear us good lord says for i beseech thee to hear us good lord most of the great churches in town have what is called a clerk in orders i believe they seldom officiate themselves but generally by deputy but if they do although in priests orders i fancy they do not supplicate for the congregation as this zealous clerk does there are several other curious varieties but this may suffice to show how happy we are in a clerk pews are here exceedingly scarce and the good lady who rented this house before i took it when she quitted the town bequeathed her nonright in the pew in which she sat to a little valiant seaofficer not now in employ he perhaps considering himself as at sea crowded himself and three cousins in with mrs frinsham and myself the pew is small for four persons blustered so violently and swore in church and at length prevailed by his eloquence or his oaths on the respectable vestry after all the gentlemen were retired to write me a very curious letter indeed it is carefully preserved by mrs frinsham amongst her odd curiosities forbidding me to sit in the seat any more they having given it to captain bluster and his uncle the coaldealer who are much too genteel ever to go to church in an afternoon or on weekdays i was beginning to fear we must attend divine service as used to do the excellent mrs york of pirton my mothers aunt who for some years before her death being a cripple by the gout was constantly lifted in and out of her coach to take the air or make a visit but could not drive into the church she was therefore regularly carried to church twice every sunday and every saints day wednesdays and fridays in her sedanchair placed in the aile and the poles drawn out not to incommode persons passing to their pews but having at present no sedanchair it occurred to me that unless the amiable prelate of this diocese was wonderfully altered for the worse in a few years he would be happy to assist an old friend i accordingly wrote to him stating our hard case his lordship honored me with a very polite answer enclosing one to the churchwardens of chertsey recommending it to them to provide me with a pew which they immediately did near the little captains where we hear him talk but not now swear and curse  so much fore cclesiastical matters only remarking that the title bestowed on the curate of chertsey as mr white told us is the journeyman parson i have often heard my mother and archdeacon dodwells mother say that the clerk of shottesbrook a master shoemaker used to roar out in the psalm i am a journeyman as all my fathers were and mr cherrys comment was frith always struts when he hollows it out feeling his own superiority over david who he conceives never attained to being a master workman we never hear an oath or see or hear a drunken person man or woman in the street  mr whitaker told mrs frinsham and mrs berkeley that the reformation in the manners of the lower class of people in this place within these last eight years since mr white was curate of the place is quite astonishing to all the neighborhood the higher and middling ranks of people in most places are too wise and too genteel to be anxious about the salvation of their immortal souls  perhaps a few weeks spent at dover by the great boys and girls and some of their parents might suggest to them that it would be better to walk next the kennel and leave the wall to elder persons as the very worthy mrs neal of the teawarehouse at dover taught her wonderfully civil clever little girl of eight years old who showing slipped behind to give me the wall at every turning  enquiring the way once of a sensiblelooking little charityschool girl she said i will wait upon you madam and show it you she received as she merited my kind thanks we set out  she turned back to the little girls that she had quitted slipped off her pattens saying pray take care of them i shall walk quicker without them and not hinder the lady it was impossible for the lady who ever delighted to pay attention to real humble merit in humble station and try to benefit the possessors to avoid rewarding her little conductress and enquiring who she was she did not reply as washerwomens etc children in these equalizing days generally do i am mrs draggletails daughter she replied my name is susan ellendor madam my mother is a widow and keeps a public house i think the flying horse this being the last time i was at dover i have not learned but hope that the sensible civil little susan is now a worthy servant in the family of some gentleman who has a worthy lady who takes a little care of the souls of her servants as i trust will all the friends to whom i address this farewell epistle  adieu my good friends may we ere long meet in a country where neither mr pit nor mr pond nor any mr can tax poor letter scribblers  eliza berkeley  the editors apology for the errors of herself and the devil ie the printers devil the learned acute dr young says  flaw in the best  the many flaw all over to which party the editor belongs has been by this time pronounced by many perhaps as in most other cases where sentence is pronounced without seeing the whole of the evidence the judgment may be wrong she conceives as in most other things fortune station etc etc she is in the middle way that she appears sometimes to have written superlative nonsense is most certain for which she is not famous but this sentence is absolute nonsense says a reader  no one can make head or tail of it agreed good reader yet the editor did not write it nonsense but her once good hand now when writing in haste degenerated into a very small scrawl must have often puzzled even the poor devil or the compositor a witty clerk of an uncle of hers a very eminent barrister used to say my master writes three hands one that i cannot read one that he cannot read himself and one that the devil cannot read  the editor from an ugly trick contracted in very early youth always speaks in a very low voice what she is writing and although her pen moves very quick yet the little redrag the unruly member moves still quicker by which means she frequently leaves out three or four words in a sentence which she is obliged to interline she never whilst writing tittles the third vowel crosses her t or makes any stop but at the beginning of a new paragraph all this is left to be done after the letter etc is finished and like most other things postponed is frequently not done at all which to those unacquainted with her horridly heedless manner of writing makes her letters very valuable etruscan mss  the editor thinks she may now proceed without being guilty of injustice to accuse the devil whenever the editor has had occasion to use the word perpetually the devil knows or perhaps does not know why the word as lately in an article in the gentlemans magazine see the tale of woe in the magazine for august       is constantly printed personally which makes it in some instances very extraordinary nonsense indeed  in some places the note is introduced into the text and the poor text cast down into the note as it is at the bottom of p cccc where the last three lines are superfluous but were intended to have accompanied the little anecdote of poor unhappy lady vane in p ccccvii  mentioning a very beautiful little painting of cheltenham church taken from the well by miss hamilton one of the elegant thoroughly amiable daughters of lord archibald hamilton during the editors melancholy sejour at cheltenham during the last direful illness of her son and the tremendously alarming illness of dear dr berkeley at cheltenham these angelichearted young ladies insisted on regularly escorting the editor from the spa to her own door every morning as she regularly drank the water and would do it every year for two months in autumn if she could afford the journey the editor has above mentioned her objection to taking a footman to attend her in a morning she has for some years been receiving severe reprimands from her dear trio father son and sister for daring to walk except in her garden alone lest she should half more than half blind run her simple head against a horses tail as she once did the poor editor used to plead that she never was so watched in youth by her mother why submit to it in her old age by her son yet so it kindly was still kindly is to be followed by her very worthy careful servant in london she has no objection but to see a female followed by a footman at chertsey would make it supposed an oatlands lady was in town  at the request of the editor and which hangs constantly within ken of her shortsightedeye to soothe her wounded heart of a size answering to the frontispiece designed by her dear son and engraved for his beautiful elegy on the death of miss m the poor devil has turned the word beautiful into a handsome drawing which raises the idea of vulgarity in her mind  perhaps as a berkeshire woman having in early youth heard the lower people of that beautiful county ridiculed for frequently saying a handsomebodied man or woman as you shall see sir  the editor fears that most of the errors of the press must go uncorrected as although thanks to the mercy of god she has still eyesight sufficient to scrawl by daylight and read a sensible clever book by candlelight she cannot six her eye by any light to count lines and find out in which the error lies without injuring her eyes very much the casting up her now very small weekly book of accounts strains her eyes more than reading or writing five hours de suite when she has not occasion to fix them  the editor has been from very early youth by her nearest her dearest surviving friend told that she is of a temper too sanguine  that she never ceases to hope in despite of disappointment repeated and rerepeated the editor has ever found it pleasanter than to go quietly into the castle of giant despair vide pilgrims progress the delight of her very early childhood  the new edition of which with the excellent notes by the very pious and surely very liberalminded mr burder dissenting minister at coventry improves and gladens her declining years if the editor was rich she would dispense as many of an incomparable little work of his entitled the good old way as the zealous democrats did of tom paines rights of man as it is although that incomparable little tract is sold as low as one penny she half beggars herself in distributing them having generally some in her pocket for rich and poor who will accept them as also sir richard hills german catechism with two exquisitely fine very short family prayers the marrow of good bishop halls in his jacobs ladder the morning with the lords prayer etc being offered in less than five minutes the evening one in less than four  a little portion of time for the busiest person to let his servants bestow on him who bestows twentyfour hours in which to work play eat drink sleep the soul needs food at least as much as the body does his present for your neighbor his nature and grace mr ss way to be happy in a miserable world christmasbox for the heart all sold by matthews no    strand to say nothing of the societys books at messrs rivingtons st pauls churchyard the friendly call to the holy communion by the late excellent peter dobree esquire it is pity that the name of that devout christian is not now printed in the title page it would save the editor much trouble in writing it there  reading that wonderful little volume she is ready to retract having so often joined that witty monarch charles the second saying that presbyteranism was not the religion of a gentleman in mr burder it appears the religion of a most liberalminded man  but to return to that cheering temper of the mind hope the editor has really so very often hoped that every page of very many would be the last of her  long preface that she is almost led to despair gratitude for amiable attention she knows not how to avoid celebrating as perhaps few persons feel more sensibly more gratefully amiable unmerited attentions paid to herself and those she tenderly loved  the editor wonders at herself that in mentioning the great amiability of the noblesse of scotland she could have omitted to notice the very pleasing politeness of lord glasgow to mr monck berkeley during his sejour at st andrews  as the family were sitting at tea en famille in mrs berkeleys dressing room the door opened and the servant mr wrightson announced mr bower to mr berkeley mr berkeley sprang up saying my dear good fellow i am very glad to see you with all my heart what can have brought you hither  mr bower  i came sir to pay my duty to my father  mr berkeley  who is your father  mr bower  he tells me sir that he has the honor to be known to dr berkeley and to you sir  mr berkeley  what not patrick bower  mr bower  the same sir i should not have taken the liberty to have waited on you sir but that my lord glasgow hearing that you were at the university here charged me to wait upon you with his best compliments and to tell you that he hopes you will visit him next vacation at   the editor must add here that mr bower the bookseller of st andrews was a very worthy man and as she used frequently to say as civil as an english tradesman a very rare thing in scotland where the traders are in general the most uncourtly she believes of any under the canopy of heaven the dutch the late mrs donalon of chelsea an old friend once a flame of bishop berkeleys being in holland and going into a shop to purchase some holland it not being just what she wanted she went out of the shop walking along the streets she received a most violent blow on her back which but for a good pair of stays must have injured her turning round she saw the mistress of the shop looking like a fury who said  this is to teach you not to give people the trouble to undo their goods and then not buy them adding some opprobrious dutch name the editor often wonders at the patient civility of london traders with her tiresome idle countrywomen who are morning shopstrollers she always herself requests traders not to show her their newfashioned wares as she whether she wants them or not knows that she cannot therefore will not afford to buy them always excepted the french and flemings are in general rude the english are certainly the civilest the most patient of men every one has heard the wager laid to try if it were possible to wear out the patience of mr mann the great woollendraper mr kaye the dean of guild of st andrews answering to our mayors in england who had visited england was a most liberal obliging and even polite trader mr monck berkeley always made it a point with his english friends to deal with mr kaye the great woollen and linen draper at st andrews as a proof of his elegance whenever the editor bought a chequed apron for any poor old scotch woman value half a crown or three shillings mr kaye would constantly on her laying the money on the counter present her with some white sewingsilk in a paper saying madam be pleased to take your discount oh wife scottish traders to give it i will not trouble you with halfpence ie bawbees  brother to the ambassador at florence some years ago the editor one day in the shop of an old huckster at st andrews she is sorry to say that he was an episcopal of the name of noarey a young gentleman of very remarkable gentle sweet manners as before remarked the young lord of logie almon entered the shop seeing the old wretch engaged in serving either the editor or her sister he politely forbore to ask for the article he wanted the old wretch thus addressed him his hat cocked like a kevenhuller bolt upright in a parallel line with his surly shoulders well young man why do you stand there what is that you wants why doant you tell instead of standing there the editor instantly replied i dont know what logie almon wants as his politeness to the ladies in your shop prevents his telling whilst you are serving them but i can tell you what you want and if this young gentleman and you were at eton what you would get as you richly deserve  your fierce hat thrown into the fire and your saucy self well rolled in the kennel the old hottentot growled and mrs frinsham and the young lord laughed very much  the editor whilst in scotland used frequently to afford great diversion to dear dr berkeley her sister and son the latter used to divert their friends in england with his mothers labors and troubles about spinning and weaving tablecloths napkins etc saying  my mother really turned herself into a very gewd scotch weef counting her spinning when come home measuring marking for bleaching just as if she had been booarn a scot  mrs berkeley going one day to purchase some fine dutch flax the man was wonderfully surly and saucy mrs frinsham said you are the rudest being i ever saw in my life were i the lady i would go without flax till the resurrection sooner than purchase it of such a wretch as you are he replied his hat cocked and his arms akimbo why now there is nothing in the world that i likes so much as affronting a woman i always did and if she is a laady the editor one day purchasing something in the shop of two brothers at st andrews of the name of millar david the eldest an absolute savage tom the younger a very civilized man mrs berkeley ever from a child delighting to say obliging things when it could be done as it very often may without any flattery said tom you are as civil as an english trader you would do in england the editor believes he had desired her not to trouble herself to put her parcel into her pocket for that he would send it to her house an elderly woman in the shop waiting to be served exclaimed  good leard i never saw any thing like lady berkeley in my life dr berkeley by the lower people of st andrews was from his short cassock which in both kingdoms he in undress constantly wore esteemed a bishop and mrs berkeley by that rank in st andrews who had never heard the address of vile queen bess to bishops wife constantly styled lady berkeley in her own country when thanked by a starving poor creature for an apron or gown she ever disclaimed the title of ladyship adding if people have no sense she will put some into them the editor who had not before observed the gewd weef replied my good friend it has been frequently said in england that if persons had but one spark of understanding mrs berkeley would strike it out for them but it was reserved for scotland to compliment her endeavors to do what god alone can do bestow understanding the fact was this woman a dealer in tea and other little smuggled matters had a very uncommonly strong understanding which mrs berkeley on learning her name sound that she had instructed her to use to be sure the best tools are useless to the cleverest artist unacquainted with the mode of using them  i likes it ten times the better mrs frinsham said you are a brute then and walked out into the street saying my dear sister come away mrs berkeley however stayed and purchased her flax as it was the best in the city he had a lad about fourteen the civilest gentle creature one could see his name forgotten he lived in north street and was a true disciple of the brutal john knox  the editor does not recollect the name of lord glasgows very beautiful seat kelburn she believes or rowallan  although lord balgonie lent her a charming elegy in ms written by mr bower mr bower was private tutor at eton to lord glasgow the wise lady his mother took a house at slough to be near her son the editor conjured dr berkeley when his son went to eton at least very soon after to leave canterbury and go and reside at cookham that both parents might in their different departments superintend the education of their then only child but alas she could not prevail on seeing the monument in the great wood of  of the late lord glasgow his noble pupils excellent father as it should seem by the character given  mr bower the bookseller presented the editor with his sons elegy on the death of sweet lady helen boil aged fourteen the beautiful little red print of that lovely creature mrs berkeley has put into a frame and it now hangs in her dressing room but in frequent removals she has lost the pleasing elegy or perhaps has lent it and it has never been returned a too common case with the editor  mr bower on taking leave again repeated his lordship charged me to say how happy you would make him if you would visit   mr berkeley replied his lordship does me much honor i certainly will not be in that part of scotland without doing myself the honor to pay my respects to his lordship  when mr bower was gone mrs berkeley said to her son why berkeley i did not know that lord glasgow and you were such great friends at eton i never heard of his lordship as one of your con an eton phrase   mr berkeley  nor was he my dear madam  mrs berkeley  why mr bower pressed you so repeatedly from lord glasgow as he said to go to visit his lordship as was wonderful to me  mr berkeley  why my dear mother my lord and i were always very good friends soon after he came to eton it fell to my lot to give his lordship a sound drubbing and i believe his lordship felt himself obliged to me for it and we were ever after very good although not particularly intimate friends i believe his lordships good sense led him to feel himself obliged to me for the said drubbing and bower is the only scotch tutor i ever remember to have been loved or respected in my time at eton they were in general strange animals good god what a wretch the poor fitzroys had for a tutor he had nearly killed one of them but that the boys forced into the house and interposed  mr berkeley was intimate with one of the mr fitzroys the editor does not recollect which of the gentlemen poor amiable mr bower not long after this was unfortunately drowned bathing in the sea at scarborough  the election of the sixteen peers coming on during mr monck berkeleys residence at st andrews dr berkeley kindly permitted him to go to edinburgh going one day into holyrood house a scotch peer the editor thinks but is not absolutely certain that it was the present earl of morton who she has frequently heard her son say was a very amiable man she is very certain that it was not the son of her old friend in early youth the very sensible worthy countess of l  educated at eton met him and instantly exclaimed berkeley what can have brought you hither  mr berkeley  i hope to see your lordship elected one of the sixteen  lord morton  aye my good friend that remains to be proved  i doubt not  mr b  i hope yes my lord will one vote be of any service to your lordship  lord m  to be sure it will  mr b  well then i promise your lordship i can help you to one  lord m  you help me to one my dear berkeley how is that possible  mr b  stay till you see my lord whether i am a man of my word  away flew mr berkeley with his wonted alacrity to serve a friend or a strange or even a foe if he thought them worthy and returned escorting his tenderly beloved his sincerely respected friend the late amiable lord loudon whose delight in mr berkeleys sweet society considering the disparity of their years was wonderful  some of mr berkeleys friends in edinburgh used laughingly to tell him that although he might never be a peer himself his son if he had one might for that certainly if he like the great earl of cork would wait ten years he must infallibly marry lady flora campbell the present countess of loudon  the sweet countess of loudon then about five years old would nestle and crowd on being asked what she wanted she used to reply why to sit on mr berkeleys knee if he can take me up or else to stand by him her ladyship was not singular all children quite strangers constantly made up to mr berkeley his father and his grandmother mrs frinsham and little ones in arms the editor has frequently seen struggle and even cry to go to dr berkeley and to her mother but one child in the world ever paid the editor that compliment excepting her own babes mrs berkeley does not love little children she should esteem her nature more if she did she pities the poor little pewling disagreeable animals a kitten can divert one but the untaught offspring of the lord of the creation cannot so much for the dignity of fallen human nature  an odd accident happened not long after mr monck berkeleys return to england the very amiable mr gipps mp for canterbury ever ready to oblige and serve his friends permitted mr monck berkeley to have his letters from his scottish friends addressed under cover to him  one day when the editor was dressing for dinner she heard a visitingrap with the utmost sangfroide very certain that mr wrightson would not let any one into her apartment in the morning presently open flew the dressing room door and in flew mrs gipps out of breath saying i beg your pardon for forcing my way in to you but i hear that mr berkeley with whom is my business is gone to dinner in the country so i must entreat you to make my apology to him when i went up to dress i saw a letter lie on my table the seal upwards never minding that it was a coronet i scratched it open the folding of it hid the words my dear friend and edinburgh and the date i began and read about half way down the first side when i came to these words i am most happy that i have it in my power to gratify myself by immediately complying with your request and i can with truth say that were all my chaplainships now vacant my dear friend mr berkeley  here added my very sensible very obliging neighbor i stood aghast turned the letter and saw on the back to georgemonck berkeley esquire i was ready to faint at what mr berkeley must think of me the editor here answered for her son that the only sensation it would occasion to him would be that it had caused a moments distress to mrs gipps who proceeded to assure mrs berkeley that she had not read a tittle after she came to the name berkeley of which mrs berkeley was fully convinced whilst mrs gipps was accusing herself of being a great fool which no one else could ever do she being blessed with an exceeding strong understanding which descends to her two fine little boys blessed the editor believes with the best motherinlaw in the three kingdoms mrs berkeley prevailed on her good neighbor to stay and pin on her gown which having begun to undress was literally only fastened by one pin such was her haste to exculpate herself from what very few would have suspected her of it afforded a pleasant laugh at the next canterbury rout  the distressing letter was locked up unredde until mr monck berkeleys return at night when he proceeded to read  after were all my chaplainships now vacant  my dear friend mr berkeley should fill them every one as he pleased there followed some polite obliging encomiums on mr monck berkeleys worth wisdom and good judgment the very elegant young gentleman mentioned in the note on the poem on singleton abbey the very worthy and reverend h r was just then gone into orders and wishing for that elegant ornament to the clerical habit a scarf and not choosing to wear it as many sprigs boys of twentytwo and a half are generally by the editor styled sprigs she has no dislike to any other sprigs tout au contraire she is persuaded that she should not have remembered so accurately as she now does the face figure and dress of her aunt mrs cherry who died many months before the editor attained her fourth year but that one day in the garden at mr frinshams the editor not daring to touch them herself requested her aunt to gather her a le if from one of the orange trees mrs cherry amiably took out her knife cut off a good large sprig with an orange as large as a small wallnut and several blossoms on it then took a caukingpin out of her pincushion and pinned it on her frock on the left side the editor still feels the pleasure her poor little simple heart felt no elegant finery since has so delighted it as when the orangespring was placed near it it is surely wise to gratify children who must unavoidably be so often if wisely educated contradicted in any little innocent gratification the editor recollects with pleasure the extacy of joy she once occasioned her beloved son to experience during what she always calls the rabbiting age with boys happily girls have it not but there is a time when all the boys she has ever known are rabbitwild wild with nursing and rearing rabbits for the cats to eat as so nursed their flesh is too strong for a beggar to eat mr monck berkeley flew into the room saying oh my dear madam if you will not give or lend me three shillings i shall break my heart here is a man has brought me the finest buckrabbit that ever was seen but he will not let me have it under a crown and i have but two shillings in the world  what can i do  his mother thought a crown a vast sum to be paid for a rabbit the poor childs eyes filled with tears he said  then i must give it up i shall never have such another offer as long as i live the purse was taken the money given and the fine rabbit carried in triumph to the seraglio after some weeks he died and wonderful to relate the creature in its fur weighed nine pounds and a half  the editor laments that she has not now even a single myrtle or a geranium to nurse when she is disposed to idle a little by way of relaxation when her eyes are enflamed with reading and writing she has often expressed her astonishment to her beloved partner and others that so wise so super excellent in almost every thing as surely is the church of england should admit foxhunting etc etc boys into the ministry at that early age when they read in the sacred scriptures that the savior of the world god incarnate entered not on his ministry until thirty years of age nor his precursor john baptist until he was nearly twentyeight to make a poor shatterbrained idle boy swear that he will devote himself wholly to the winning of souls etc that he will be instant in season and out of season etc of divinity do unauthorized either by nobleman or those noble bodies the two universities mr berkeley had with his wonted amiability without mentioning it to his friend mr h r written to his noble friend lord loudon requesting his lordship to appoint him one of his chaplains which he instantly did mr berkeley always after the melancholy death of lord loudon wore a locket of his hair a melancholy picture set in gold pendant from his neck by a strong black ribbon under his outward waistcoat until within a very few days of his own happy exit when too weak to sit up except on a sopha  mr monck berkeley one day on his arrival at cookham from oxford sitting after dinner dr berkeley asked what company he had in the machine to maidenhead he replied very sensible agreeable company  dr b  probably some gentlemen of your own acquaintance  mr b  no not one but i had a very pleasant drive  at length after a short silence mr berkeley said well if ever i marry and should have a daughter i think i will have her baptized eliza lawrence  dr b  eliza lawrence what do you mean child are you going to sleep after your long journey  mr b  no my dear sir no but i cannot help supposing that there must be some spell in the thirteen letters which compose those two names united you know my mother and we all admire miss eliza lawrence of canterbury by some accident ritchie forgot to take my place and so i was obliged to come in the worcester machine in which i met a miss eliza lawrence daughter of a worcestershire or shropshire the editor forgets which clergyman i really think one of the cleverest most sensible women i ever met with in my life i began talking like a fool as young folks often do she took me in hand and showed me what a fool i was i never was better trimmed even by my mother therefore i think there must me something powerful in those names and if i had a girl i should like that she should be blessed with a fine strong understanding i assure you my dear sir  the editor having at length finished her too long preface it only remained for her to determine whether it should be preor affixed to her sons poems she much wished it might be the latter just at the time when she was to have determined the matter it pleased the allwise disposer of all events in his wisdom to recall to himself one of the sweetest spirits ever breathed into the nostrils see the second chapter of genesis verse   in this alone does the editor humbly conceive that man differs from the more much more than the halfreasoning elephant the astonishingly wise wellreasoning newfoundland dog mr monck berkeley had one who understood and acted as wisely as any philosopher could have done as several servants of dr berkeleys now living well know particularly in two very remarkably striking occurrences lord monboddo has proved in his second volume of ancient metaphysics that dogs can remember can reason can reflect but that they have not consciousness ie they have a soul as well as man sometimes a wiser soul but they have not a spark breathed into man the breath of jehovah let us make man etc see genesis chap ii verse   whoever gives themselves the trouble to read that verse in the hebrew will more plainly see that no human being can enjoy perfect happiness until reunited to jehovah of any descendant of fallen adam  mrs frinsham the only the excellent the generous the incomparable sister of the editor whose character may be drawn in very few words by comparing her with two great men of the last century she had as much reserve that reserve wore off near twenty years ago and wit when going from home to make a visit of a few weeks to relations or friends on making her courtsey to her mother and sister she used to say to her mother your most obedient madam to her sister adieu my dear miss frinsham i hope you will both be very happy whilst i am gone but i am sure you will never laugh till i come home again it was very true she had a neverfailing fund of wonderfully agreeable humor amongst her intimate friends mrs frinsham and her sister made it a point after they quitted school never to leave their excellent mother one night alone as butler as much worth piety and politeness as boil a short sketch of the character of mrs frinsham appeared in the obituary of the gentlemans magazine for january      drawn by the elegant pen of here is and the editors beloved respected accomplished friend mrs duncombe of canterbury of whom frequent grateful mention has been made before in this preface for this last favor the editor feels herself most sensibly obliged gratified and consoled  her exceedingly naturally tender delicate frame stricken by the late intense cold which fixed on her lungs after about a fortnight of extreme external suffering yet not uttering one impatient word or breathing one impatient groan resigned her sweet spirit into the hands of that god who she happily felt had lived had died to redeem it from neverending misery utterly renouncing all merits of her own and as has been better expressed by the very pious divine who attended her sick  dying bed and preached her funeral sermon not preached to celebrate the uncommon virtues of the dear departed saint but to benefit the survivors  the grand and greatgrandchildren of the tenants of her eminently pious ancestors and the descendants of the domestics some few years ago there were fix or seven worthy persons who kept their own carriages whose fathers grandfathers or grandmothers had been servants some menial servants to mr cherry at shottesbrook house enabled to do so by gods blessing on their own honesty and worth which they still attributed to the great care taken by mr cherry his excellentlypious mother and his lady to the souls of their domestics many of them the children and grandchildren of faithful old servants some years ago at a wateringplace a gentleman asked the editor who an elderly man was that he saw walking sometimes with dr berkeley and herself adding sure madam he has known all your family for generations  what exceeding fine horses he has to his elegant carriage yet he does not seem to be a man of much fashion to which the editor replied that he was a very old acquaintance of here is a man of worth it was not necessary for her to add that his father had taken very good care of mr cherrys fine horse at shottesbrook although it was the case of her excellently less celebrated pious parents the editor rejoices to hear that the place of her nativity is at present blessed with an evangelical as well as very learned preacher although a young gentleman a very old fashioned pastor taking the advice of poor old saint paul be instant in season etc epistle to timothy as an honest tenant of hers who left her house this morning tells her saying i believe madam that there is scarce a day when the gentleman is not in two or three houses instructing the poor people and relieving them where it is wanted when he marries the editor hopes his lady will be as indeed every lady whether wife to a doctor or a squire should be mother nurse to the surrounding poor they will one day find it to have been not only a pleasant but a profitable amusement at shottesbrooke this sermon preached by the rev mr white curate of chertsey will be soon published this excellent judicious evangelical preacher has printed two or three sermons on different occasions but never published them the editor asking why he had not mr white modestly replied that as he was only a curate he thought no one would attend to them to be sure he bears in mind that a saint in crape is twice a saint in lawn but let us hope that there are some few saints not clad in lawn who yet in due time may be  clothed in white robes with palms if not croziers in their hands etc  utterly refusing to hear her  almsdeeds and good works of which to use the language of saint luke in the acts of the holy apostles  she was full very full indeed even mentioned to her exclaiming oh name them not i have not had it in my power to do aught for my savior he has done all for me she breathed out her last gentle breath in praise to god her savior the last words that she uttered to be distinctly heard were oh my saviorgod into thy hands do i commend my spirit it is supposed that she finished the text for she lived about ten minutes and continued speaking with her last breath which by the gesture of her exquisitely elegant hands mrs frinsham was so elegantly limbed that the very witty very polite agreeable mrs mce of canterbury once said my dear miss frinsham if nature had formed me as she has you i would certainly wear small clothes and never put on a glove mrs frinsham danced a minuet so very finely that if on a public day at mrs more than thirty years ago it afforded heartfelt pleasure to the editor to have it in her power to render a very capital service to the most sensible accomplished youngest son of that lovely amiable judicious educator of young ladies then in india it has been often asserted that no young lady brought up by mrs sheeles and the pious sensible mrs gambier ever lost their character excepting a wretched little girl who long before she attained the age of fourteen was one christmas holydays after she had been about a year in queens square sold by her vile guardian to a vile shire squire whose mother illusing the poor very weak girl contemporary with the editor she ran away from him the poor creature as many others have done experienced the truth of the wise spanish proverb bien et casada que tien ni sugero ni canada mrs sheeles sadly lamented to mrs berkeley about thirty years ago that she suffered herself to be persuaded by lady  to take her daughters no two earls daughters in england have exceeded these two  ladies in a variety of  matches mrs sheeles was a most accomplished woman of very good family granddaughter of the excellent sir john smith cousingerman to the late  lord montford it always rejoices mrs berkeley to hear of the happiness and prosperity of her grandchildren sheeless twenty different sets of company came mrs then miss anne frinsham was certain to exhibit to every different company her ear for music was so exquisitely accurate that the editor has frequently in her youth and a very little before her lamented death heard her say that when at school always in mischief like and perpetually with her dearly beloved friend the wonderfully sensible highly cultivated accomplished mrs a langley of the manorhouse york she has repeatedly tried to dance out of time but never could do it more than two steps the third was not in her power it used to be said by the governesses teachers etc the eldest miss frinsham looks as if she would fly over the moon the youngest as if butter would not melt in her mouth yet miss frinsham is never in mischief miss anne never out of it it was innocent mischief although it subjected the two miss annes frequently to have recourse to their common prayer book to learn a psalm sometimes to their bible to learn a chapter by heart esteemed a pretty weighty although not a disgraceful punishment like the foolscap or the redtongue schools well conducted are excellent places for children of both sexes surely mrs frinsham used through life to laugh and tell dr and mr monck berkeley when the editor used to say that as a girl she found no pleasure in their escampades to the parlour door at night etc aye she was a poor pusillanimous stupid little puss she would never get up after she was in bed never slip out of the schoolroom she never saw the kitchen at mrs sheeless in her life she was a sad poor coward indeed  and the appearance of her eyes seemed to be praising rather than supplicating that saviorgod whom she had labored so faithfully to serve for very many years  although her outward sufferings were very heavy all was bright within no selfreproach for broken sabbaths for neglect of public worship on week days one grand cause of the decay of christian piety in this nation which the editor doomed alas to attend dying beds has twice witnessed to her great distress not blessed be god either her mother son or husband her sole anxiety was on account of her poor now alas thoroughly forlorn desolate treblywidowed sister left to struggle alone with variety of perplexing businesses without one near dear relative to counsel and to soothe her yet blessed be the mercy of an allgracious god she was enabled to say to her almost idolizing sister dearest of friends i am not alone for god is with me will be with me i have been constantly as you know praying to him from the age of seventeen  cast me not away in the time of age when my strength fails when i am greyheaded and he has graciously promised all his real children  i will never leave thee nor forsake thee and i may adapt the language of holy david and instead of saying when my father and my mother forsake me the lord takes me up but when it pleases his wisdom to chastize his poor sinful child by taking from her her idolized son her tenderly beloved husband her darling sister he will take her up and conduct her safely she wishes she might presume to say shortly to the realms of bliss there to rejoin those lovely spirits her dear happy trio to part no more the lovely saint was exceedingly consoled to find that the giver of every good gift had in the midst of such anguish of soul vouchsafed such a measure of his best gift faith mrs frinsham entreated her sister to remember what mrs berkeley always admired in brookes fool of quality that grief has not a more deadly foe than business that she alas had much to which she entreated her to apply herself instead of mourning over her loss we all in turn feel that it is easier to preach than to practice and the editor feels the force of our blessed masters words work whilst you have the day for the night comes wherein no man can work the editor has labored to work a little in the day the time of youth of vigor for the night is come rather early upon her when she finds by melancholy experience that she can do but very little  may that little all redound to the glory of god her savior amen lord jesus say amen  the editor has several stone weight of papers to inspect of bishop berkeleys  his journal when in italy etc etc of mr cherrys of archbishop seckers miss talbots mr monck berkeleys and dear dr berkeley wished her at her leisure to overlook and select from his numerous sermons enough to make a dozen volumes one volume to be published about six sermons dr berkeley got transcribed during his last illness to be printed which together with his four sermons printed during his life will nearly make the volume  the editor feels some consolation in knowing that from very early youth one of her chief studies and greatest delights was laboring to oblige please and render happy her ever from infancy tenderly beloved sister and that the sisters never through life had a quarrel with each other since the age when if there arose any dispute whose doll was best dressed their wise mother used to call out oh if there is any quarrel i am coming to make a third which always instantly ended the dispute  the editor is perpetually since her last lamentable loss involuntarily recurring to those beautiful lines of the eloquent dr young in his first night death great proprietor of all                                  amid such mighty plunder why exhaust thy partial quiver on a mark so mean why thy peculiar rancour wrecked on me insatiate archer could not one suffice thy shaft flew thrice and thrice my peace was slain   but then the editor banishes those halfmurmuring lines of the finest of poets by repeating the devout prose of dean hickess reformed devotions the preparatory office for death used by the editor from her youth up on the thursday instead of the office for that day with which she now concludes this frightfully long preface   yet at the last great day we shall easily discern a perfect concord in the harshest note when out adored redeemer shall come in the clouds and summon all mankind to appear before him  to which the editor ever has trusts she ever shall most sincerely subscribe  eliza berkeley chertsey january    fatal month      poems rumora or the maid of raasa raasa by thy rocky shore

exclude all gentlemen that they must have a receiver of their rents etc and that he insisted on having that office a very elegant amiable young gentleman educating for the church and of which he is

we chase with anxious steps the maybugs flight or else with pigmy hand the mead despoil and cowslips chaplet weave with curious toil even then the hapless breast that genius lights with double rapture hails these first delights to fancys sway he yields his guileless heart unawed by fashion and unspoild by art to him who fancys magic influence knows with brighter glow appears the blushing rose by

to the shrine of truth perchance loved isis by thy gentle stream the wahdering youth pursues his wayward theme and as thy waves in slow succession glide to mix with oceans undistinguished tide with fond expectance waits the eventful hour that yields departure from thy muchloved bower with hopes of fame his hapless bosom glows nor more content thy peaceful empire knows now glittering visions in his sleep appear the splendid premium and the patron peer by hope deluded and ambition led the willing muse he vows for life to wed with her he seeks that splendid sink of vice where peers instead of poets have their price the drama now his constant thoughts engage with eager eye he rifles shakspeares page and hopes like murphy to adorn the stage but though like him he matchless powers possess though phoebus self the fond attempt should bless yet ere his numbers meet the public eye a thousand deaths the hapless bard must die condemned to torture by good larpents pen who cuts by patent and

respected by mr monk berkeley who in a letter introducing mr p to his father dr b says pope has given his true character in few words the noblest work of god mr p painted a picture of his friend which was by mr b presented to his mother it is by some of the best judges of painting supposed to be the finest portrait ever produced by any pencil ancient or modern it preserves that wonderful depth of thought and that exquisite benevolence which so strongly animated the countenance of mr m b the letter to mrs b which accompanied the picture proves that mr peters wields his pen almost as ably as he

both mean to get good husbands the ranelagh misses generally fail the seanymphs seldom for men of sense and worth rarely choose a wife that cannot spend an evening at home who according to dr young

of his fathers to give a better he did it in six hours so completely was he master of the french language it occurred to him to add what the justly celebrated mr dunster termed this exquisitely beautiful song  song sung by a chorus of peasants to the hon mrs hobart grief and misery hence away this is ninas wedding day all her sorrows now are past may her joys for ever last joy attend this happy pair he is brave as she is fair guarded by the god of love may they ever constant prove lucy or the banks of avon written at the age of seventeen and never meant by mr b for the public eye these lines are printed from the first foul copy preserved by his mother without mr bs knowledge mr b perpetually burned numbers of beautiful productions of his early youth mr b came one morning into his mothers dressing room saying he had just met with a little poem that he thought she would like to hear if at leisure he took his seat and read as far as to the five last lines then ceased and asked how she liked it mrs b replied like it my dear child why the man was a great villain and the poor girl a great fool who wrote it mr b replied it is not quite finished he then read the five last lines when mrs b not guessing her son to be the writer exclaimed the moral is delightful and makes it all beautiful tell me if you know who wrote it he replied an eton boy adding in his sweetly musical voice i am happy that you like it my dear madam it is in verse what you have been inculcating on me from my childhood in prose  mr b at a very early age wrote a wonderfully beautiful panegyric on the late earl of chatham nothing could ever prevail on mr b to flatter any one but he ever spoke and wrote obliging truths most elegantly  where gentle avon winds its silver stream a mossgrown cottage rears its humble head there lucy first the vernal air inhald and spent beneath its roof her infant years like avons stream those years flowed gently on nor heaved a murmuring sigh for pomp or wrath her parents toil to ease was all her care their cott with three small fields was all their store this little all by labor not by fraud obtained by bounteous heaven was kindly blessed and ever did

he wooed the nymph and twice two moons on avons banks he spent ere the sad maid by hapless love betrayed yielded her virgin honor to his arms ye vestals stern who often a virtue boast that springs unbidden in your frigid breasts scorning weak love be still severely chaste yet spare oh spare poor lucys injured shade for once resemble heaven and pardon her if ever you for heavens pardon hope for crimes you have though not from love they spring and had young edward sought your cold embrace then you like lucy might have loved and fallen sad lucy once possessed her arms he left to pluck fresh roses in a distant clime and twice two years on transatlantic shores edward false edward spent ere he returned to visit injured lucys native land she like the plaintive bird her love bewailed and ever sighing strayed on avons banks like avons stream her tears flowed ceaseless down for three long years her fate she sorely mourned the fourth no longer able to endure the pangs of hope delayed and blasted fame in avons stream the ruined lucy plunged avonian nymphs the lovelorn fair received and deeply mourned a sisters hapless fate and now vile edward came to avons banks his guilty steps he bent and sought his fair who now on avons banks had ceased to stray but ere poor lucys wellknown cott he reached he met the sexton grim who jeering said go to thy lucy neath yon yewtrees shade in bridal honors decked she waits thee there guided by the pale moon trembling he went but ah no lucy there sad edward found naught but the stone that told her tale of woe full long entranced in grief he speechless stood then sheathed his glittering poignard in his breast and sunk expiring on his lucys grave from this said tale one moral may we learn that virtues paths alone are paths of peace and that the man who these pure paths shall quit for pleasures gilded halls and roseate bowers through lifes long course will never true bliss attain the rape of the wig written in the year      it is necessary to prefix this short account to the following jeu desprit of mr b then about eighteen some of the students used to say that if newbourn would wear a better wig his lectures would make a deeper impression on them and talked of burning the vile caxon one day the young gentleman since known at bath by the name of count e an early friend of mr bs at eton school visiting an english gentleman who boarded at mr cooks snatched it off the peg in the trance ie the hall where it hung when he got into the street he told his friend that he had got it and was taking it home to burn it mr b who ever from a youth hated mischievous mischief much as he ever loved innocent mischief replied oh no do not burn it  what can i do then why let your servant or mine who will do it  better dress it nicely fill it with powder and pomatum and give it a new ribband it was a tail wig this was agreed on some of the gentlemen suggested that in the box in which it was returned an apology for the theft ought to be made and mr b being ever a ready penman was told he must write the card he took up his pen with his usual alertness and wrote the following lines it was some weeks before the author was known in the university  immortal pope the ravished lock has sung but since his classic lyre is now unstrung be mine the task the ravished wig to sing while thus my untried lyre i string accept o newbourn this very worthy gentlemans estate is called newbourn the young gentlemen among themselves used to call him lord of newbourn he was sincerely beloved and respected by mr b and all the english students most of those of large fortune and of fashion boarded at his house and a most pleasant abode they found it  nor this wig disdain pray who this wig from dressing could refrain twas friendship only did the theft inspire to make this wig what students must admire now art with nature gladly will combine to make thy spouse esteem thee quite divine professor cook was a very excellent husband mrs cook most sincerely attached to him used to wish him to pay a little more attention to his dress of which he was remarkably negligent he was most conscientiously attentive to his pupils this worthy gentleman would never dine at general s because his public day was the lords day may he be imitated by many in both kingdoms who certainly show the almightys wisdom in prefixing the word remember to the fourth commandment the excellent lady warwick the beloved sister of that divine writer the honorable robert boil says in her sweet meditations the keeping holy the lords day is the hedge of religion what would she have said had she lived in these days to see stagecoaches wagons cricketplaying etc etc  the late penyston powney esquire mp for berks father of colonel p during his life never suffered any wagons to pass through the town of maidenhead he once set a man in the stocks who defied his authority  this wig may now a constellation blaze whilst wondering herschel shall

knowledge or consent that it is the first offense of the kind cannot be pleaded in excuse the former offense was pardoned the work was of a very different kind an excellent little tract for the children of the sunday schools near his own estate there being no title page the writer of this introduction prefixed one written by henry grimston esquire of whom it may with strictest truth be asserted that he is of manners gentle of affections mild in wit a man simplicity a child   to attempt an elaborate character of mr grimston would be too weighty a task it may be learned from every distressed man woman or child in his own neighborhood suffice it to say that the editor esteems it a real happiness to have lived in the strictest friendship with mr grimston for the last fifteen years often for many months together under the same roof and never observed or even heard that he had the shadow of any vice but firmly believes that he is blessed with every virtue he was the chosen the beloved the respected the bosom friend of the amiable hearted georgemonck berkeley esquire his unwearied attentions to mr berkeley during the two last years of his painful journey through this vale of misery to the realms of bliss prove the soundness of mr berkeleys judgment when at the age of about twenty he said to his mother i have i thank god many friends that i love and some that i respect but the man i fix on for my fast friend through life is grimston mr grimston is the grandson and in some sort the eleve of as his lovely mother died to give him orphand in his birth as speaks the eloquent dr young in the night thoughts the excellently wise and thoroughly pious lady le guard mother of the late sir digby le guard  an epistle to mrs lennard dear madam i take the liberty of transmitting to you a copy of verses which i found under the table in the corner of our room they were almost illegibly written on a dirty scrap of paper my dog teazer a beautiful highland tarrier given by mr monck berkeley to henry grimston esquire  to whom you were so kind was laying by them when they were found and from the subject matter i am led to suppose they must have been addressed from him to you i have therefore copied them out fair in order to render them legible and hope you will excuse the lines as the canine race are not much given to poetry i beg my compliments to my friend lennard and your little ones and remain your obedient humble servant  henry grimston berkeleys best regards attend you and mr lennard t barret lennard esquire an old and affectionate friend of mr grimston and mr monck berkeley with his very lovely lady went from essex to visit their dying friend during their visit mr grimstons dog was so kindly treated as is every creature rational and irrational by mrs lennard as to induce the dog to follow mr lennards carriage a long way mr berkeley said the dog showed the superiority of his sense above english dogs mr berkeley revered mrs lennards loveliness of disposition and rejoiced that providence had blessed his dear old friend with such a lovely partner long may they enjoy their felicity  and the olive branches     it may perhaps seem odd indeed that i a simple quadrupede should thus presume with pen and ink to tell you what i truly think but gratitude inspires my lay and truth shall dictate all i say nor need i fear to incur displeasure who felt your kindness without measure it is with gratitude i own the frequent gift of many a bone the plates of beef so nicely dressed the mutton fat the chickens breast then since such kindness i have received if teazers word may be believed i ll never whilst i have power to eat forget the hand which gave me meat with anguish think upon the day when you from hastings drove away why would that cruelhearted boy my hopes of happiness destroy why in his arms my legs restrain that longed to follow over the plain but now alas i am left to grieve since without thee i am doomed to live i range about in vain to find a lady who is half so kind often as i pass that lonely door which now seems shut to open no more where by thy bounty i was fed and thy fair hand often strokd my head i sigh to think the change i find since i by thee am left behind for now alas hard fate is mine on fishes bones i am doomed to dine or else with mutton beef or veal i am forced to make a scanty meal since then it is you such pleasure give with you fair dame i wish to live yet i have no right to expect on me alone you ll exert your charity since birds and beasts of every kind in you a sweet protectress find in summer autumn winter spring to you the canry bird shall sing the robin too in winters frost shall visit you his generous host the poultry tribe around your door shall all receive your bounteous store the constant turtledove shall coo in notes of gratitude to you and every living thing shall see a kind protecting friend in thee a morning hymn written and printed by the late excellent bishop horn it is here inserted to enhance the value of the volume of his beloved young friend who never saw it  april        preserved and pasted in a book by his sensible pious and highly respected friend mrs cox when dr berkeleys sermon preached at the consecration of his beloved friend bishop horn was by his earnest request published after his death mrs george berkeley sent a copy to mrs cox  that lady wrote her a most sensible elegant letter of thanks in which was this beautiful sentence they were lovely and pleasant in their lives and in their lamented deaths were not long divided  of oxford who very obligingly permitted mrs george berkeley to copy it and get it printed to paste up in shops kitchens servants halls etc for the benefit of a very worthy poor blind old man aged ninety i hark the shrill herald of the morn begins the sons of men to warn and bids them all arise to celebrate his great renown who sends the light refulgent down to bless our longing eyes ii at this the fainting shadows die the powers of darkness swiftly fly before the morning star pale trembling murder dares not stay and fiends abashed at sight of day back to their den repair iii it is this

that drew repentant tears from peter led by worldly fears his master to disown warned by the monitor of day he cast the works of night away and sought the abjured sun v whenever the bird of dawning crows he tells us how st peter rose and marked us out the road that each disciple might begin awake like him from sleep and sin to think betimes on god vi smote by the eye that looks on all let us obedient to the call arise to weep and pray till as on sin and death we muse faith like an angel tells the news  to lord is risen today an hymn by sir henry wootton composed in a night of extreme sickness it is very possible that this glorious hymn of this eminently pious great man may be in print the editor stumbled upon it some months ago looking over some papers written in the beautiful hand of her beloved partner on the back of a letter of a beloved cousingerman of his the thoroughly amiable t m esquire of dublin thus inscribed the last letter i ever received from my dear t m probably the last he ever wrote this gentleman beloved respected by all who knew him was seized on board the yacht with a violent fever landed insensible in dubling and died in two days the editor has never ceased to lament him she has double cause to do it now  o thou great power in whom i move for whom i live to whom i die behold me through thy beams of love whilst on this couch of tears i lie o cleanse my sordid soul within by thy christs blood the bath of sin no hallowed oils no grains i need no rags of saints no purging fire one rosy drop from jesus side was worlds of seas to quench thine ire o precious ransom which once paid that  consummatum est was said and said by him that said no more but sealed it with his sacred breath thou then that have dispungd my score and dying wast the death of death be to me now on thee i call my life my strength my joy my all as this hymn was written before the father of mischief had introduced the word methodist ie a title indiscriminately now conferred on all those who endeavor to live their short inch of time  as believing they must pass the neverending circle of eternity either in heaven or in hell  that word which dr let dean of peterborough preaching at court about seventy years ago said a place which i will not name in so polite a congregation it is possible that the elegant dean and some of his polite congregation might now be able if we saw them to give us some account of that place may she who writes and all those who read this never see it but content themselves with our blessed saviors tremendous description of it where their worm dies not and the fire is not quenched repeated to be sure only three times within three minutes de suite  an elegy on the death of master georgerobert berkeley second son of the rev dr berkeley prebendary of canterbury who died april         aged eight years four months and four days after only one weeks illness of a dreadful putrid fever then raging in canterbury as did one of his beloved schoolfellows that lovely child master tatton only son of the reverend dr tatton prebendary of canterbury and grandson of the charitable bountiful dean lynch no art could prevent this sweet child from calling three or four times in the day to know how his friend did master robert berkeley sickened on one saturday and died the next master tatton was going to take a ride it being holyday when got as far as burghgate the dismal sound of the great bell assailed his ear he dropped his bridle and said to the servant attending him ah my dear robert is dead and my ride is spoiled he turned his horse went home fickened that very evening and died the next saturday these little creatures were lovely and pleasant in their lives and in their deaths were not divided the elegant application of this text is borrowed from a most charming letter of the highly cultivated mrs cox of st giles oxford to mrs george berkeley thanking her for dr berkeleys longsmothered sermon preached at lambeth palace at the consecration of his beloved old friend the angelic bishop horn see p     dr berkeley did not long survive his beloved friend they have now met to part no more  oh just beheld and lost admired and mourned pope o may i ever like the saints above adore my maker with seraphic love reading one day to his mother the subject led him to enquire what was the difference between a cherub and a seraph he was told that it was supposed by divines that seraphs loved god most but that cherubs knew more of god and of his adorable nature he paused near a minute and appeared to be in deep thought then looking on his mother he said mamma mamma pray listen to me i do desire to be a seraph that i may love god a great deal rather than be a cherub and have a vast deal of knowledge this was remarkable as he had a very uncommon thirst for knowledge the above choice was made just a month before his death when in good health in high gay spirits being just come in from playing with some of his schoolfellows  i ask not earthly treasures to obtain be poverty my lot if christs my gain when he was but seven years old reading that part of the gospel where our blessed savior says how hardly shall they that are rich enter into the kingdom of heaven he started dropped the bible on the table and said what can no rich people go to heaven being desired to proceed and see what would follow he read it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven he added then i am sure it is impossible on being told that christ says how hard it is for those who trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of heaven and that riches are apt to draw off the heart from god although that is not always the case he laid down his book considered some time in silence then addressed his mother as before mamma mamma pray listen to me and said i do desire to be poor and to go to christ rather than to be very rich and live without him he naturally loved money exceedingly and never parted with it willingly but to the poor he would frequently borrow of the servants to relieve them if his allowance was all spent his father and aunt used to amuse themselves with borrowing six pence of him and then pretending they could not pay it that they might witness his extreme anxiety not to lose it he would say why mamma tells me that no honest people ever borrow money without paying it again as soon as possible and that it is very wicked to run in debt he would then repair to his mother lament his hard fate and ask if he could not make them pay him what a contrast to his generous brother yet both were delightfully amiable children in their different ways it is supposed that bishop berkeley was naturally a lover of money an irish nobleman an intimate friend of the bishops often mentioned to the editor that on his urging bishop berkeley to accept the primacy offered to him by lord chesterfield the bishop replied no my dear lord i very early in life got the love of money here lifting up his leg and setting it down with such force that it shook his library and every thing in it and here by the grace of god i will always keep it this was uttered in the most energetic tone of voice a younger brother of dr berkeleys who died at about seventeen had the same spirit as his little nephew the bishop early gave his sons a large allowance for clothes etc a collection was making for a distressed baronet the bishop called on his sons to contribute dr berkeley flew to his room and brought down twenty guineas the bishop said willy where is yours  william  presently my lord  bp b  willy i wait for your money  william  yes my lord immediately  he went off slowly to his room and brought down fifteen guineas saying there it is but added smiling it is really my hearts blood but i know it is right to give to the poor    thus spoke the loveliest child he was universally allowed to be very remarkably handsome he had fine large eyes with an uncommon mixture of sense and sweetness and very long dark eyelashes beautifully dark and finely arched he had fine nutbrown hair which curled on his forehead and round his face and hung in fine ringlets below the bottom of his back his complexion a fine distinct red and white  that ever the sound of the last trump shall summon from the ground heaven heard and yielding to the warm request received with open arms the longing guest but ah how much that dread compliance cost say ye who mourn a son a brother lost he loved his only brother four years older than himself so violently as is hardly to be described he has been often overheard by the servants of the family when alone with his brother to say brother i will not live a moment after you die whenever you will if you go to fight against the french i will go too if you are shot i will be shot the very next minute his brother until near seventeen was languishing to go into the army as most idle geniuses are the wisdom of his father kept him out rejecting the kind offer of a cornetcy in the oxford blues made to him by his amiable friend the late lord conyngham who having obtained it for a near relation of his lady the youth altered his mind  when dear lord conyngham offered it to dr berkeley whose brave uncle major burton had married an aunt of dr berkeleys this connection and the very near neighborhood of this amiable family added much to mr berkeleys and his parents pleasure from his childhood until dr berkeley quitted cookham to attend his son to the university of st andrews when he was not six years old his brother was exceedingly ill and refusing to take a medicine this lovely child came to him and in an agony of soul not to be described urged him to take it saying if you will not i must die this had the desired effect  nor think though anguish should the voice restrain ye cannot tell your agonizing pain more than the pomp and majesty of song or words that move in solemn state along more than the deeptond melancholy knell the bigswoln eye and heaving bosom tell what though from care and sorrow far away he shines for ever in the realms of day still sigh we must  but sigh alas in vain no sighs no tears no wishes can regain can tears or sighs recall the fleeting breath or move the bosom of relentless death what force of words what pathos can prevail where beauty innocence and robert fail he was always called by his second name  lamented robert thou whose spotless breast no sin polluted no remorse oppressed blessed with the art affection to engage he had been always told that god saw all that passed in his heart and he was so fully convinced of the truth of it that he never could be prevailed on to say any thing he did not really think and yet he had a sweet engaging manner of saying obliging things  fond without flattery arch above thy age manly in voice and look of heart sincere he was remarkably manly in his gait his air and in his voice which was very deep but not at all a coarse bass  stranger alike to every vice and fear often as returning this loved school i see once blessed with joy and liveliness and thee still from my bosom steal unbidden sighs and thoughts of former happiness arise what generous pity in thy bosom glowed thy every action every gesture showed what strong emotions filled thy tender breast to see a babe by sad disease oppressed eager to pity though you durst not greet you flew to kiss the wretched infants feet this alludes to a little incident which happened when he was only two years and a quarter old a poor woman of the parish brought a wretched little child to his fathers house to apply for relief the poor creature was covered over with a loathsome humor he sitting in his nurses arms heard the mother tell its deplorable case he turned to his nurse and said pray let me go and kiss it to make it well she fearing her darling might suffer by his philanthrophy said  no you must not lest you should get any harm he submitted sat some minutes then sprang from her arms ran across the room and kissed each of the childs shoes saying there i have kissed its shoes i hope that will make it well and can do me no harm nurse when he was three years and a quarter old his nurse had a violent illness his grief was very great some months afterward she relating to a friend how ill she had been he was at the other part of the nursery much taken up as it was supposed with play he left his playthings ran to her and with tears in his eyes said pray my dear nurse do not talk any more about your illness i cannot bear to think what i felt then ye who ere lost an angel pity me says the eloquent young pity the relatives of this lovely child  though from the gloomy mansions of the grave thee nor thy virtue nor thy form he was very tall and graceful being measured a short time before his lamented death he was exactly five feet one inch soon after his fathers going to reside at canterbury the fame of his beauty was so dinned in the ears of an old lady of the name of knowler who never went out of her house that she desired a lady of her acquaintance to request mrs berkeley to let master robert visit her the lady took him thither the next afternoon which he spent with the good old lady  she desired her friend to thank mrs berkeley and tell her with her compliments that although being near an hundred years old she had of course seen many children she had never during her long life of her own descendants or others ever seen so completely beautiful or sensible a child  that with the queen of sheba the half had not been told her  could save can we forget the beauties of thy face the seat of dignity and manly grace what power of song those auburn locks can tell which down thy back in graceful ringlets fell what though a total dimness has overspread the noblest eyes that ever graced a head still on their former luster dwells the mind where lively sense and sweetness shone combined no farther powers fond nature could unite to raise our admiration and delight oh had she stopped content with the display nor raised their value by their shortened stay but faith performed what nature could not do still other virtues faith held forth to view faith every anxious thought and wish suppressed and warmed with firm belief his youthful breast even when some truth to question he inclined reflection brought this moral to his mind man was not made to question but adore he stopped submissive stopped nor added more he would when reading the holy scripture often ask questions not to be answered  lest a too great inquisitiveness might lead to skepticism he was told to keep always in his mind that fine line of dr young man was not made to question but adore this was near a year before his death about six weeks before that dreadful event some doubts arising in his mind of a very deep nature he was told that those were questions that could not properly be known till mortality was swallowed up of life he replied to be sure man was not made to question but adore and proceeded in reading his chapter  at that black hour the cause of every sigh when death remorseless conqueror drew nigh his soul while here his tortured body lay aspiring said lord teach my heart to pray during his last illness of only seven days he was one night much troubled lest he should not go to god and cried out to the servant the very sensible worthy mrs mary farrant wife of mr farrant butcher and grazier at townmalling kent who idolized him and never complained of him to his mother but once during his whole life  when it was most highly necessary to do it mrs farrant a neighbors daughter lived from her early youth many years in dr berkeleys family she is one of the best tempered of women her little charge when very young one night took it into his head that he would sing two or three lines of a little song upon every step as he ascended the staircase mrs berkeley happening to pass stood still to listen and overheard the amiable servant say come sir come you must go up quicker or i must call my mistress to which he replied no no my dear molly i know very well you will not do that on which mrs berkeley presenting herself the little man skipped off to his room in an instant and his mother said molly how many fibs you do tell that child for you know that you never told a tale of him in your life nor would if he was to torment you from morning till night  no to be sure madam i should not for at last by threatening him with you i get him to do what he should do mrs berkeley till within these very few years made an annual grateful offering to a worthy woman who lived with her mother when she was six years old for not telling of her when she climbed the trees like a boy who always waited upon him molly teach me to pray she replied with tears my angel god will teach you to pray he said with great earnestness lord teach my heart to pray he had always been told that the prayer which reaches to god must come from the heart and with the heart this lovely creature often did pray he always used bishop kenns prayers and hymns in the winchester scholar whenever mrs berkeley was alone her children always offered their prayers and repeated or sang their hymns with her one evening as he was repeating the following verse in bishop kenns evening hymn but though sleep over my frailty reigns let it not hold me long in chains and now and then let loose my heart till it an hallelujah dart  his mother desired him to omit it saying although it might suit the exalted piety of bishop kenn it was in him little robert mocking god as she did not believe he had devotion sufficient to wish to wake in the middle of the night to praise god he stood about a minute silent pensive then replied why mamma i do desire to awake to praise god in the night so if you please to give me leave i will say it as i always do when i say it to molly phipps the very worthy woman above named who doated on him and he on her his mother rejoiced that her child excelled her in piety she always omitting it herself he was perhaps the most ingenious and accomplished little creature any where to be seen as his brother was resolved not to learn to read so he seemed resolved to learn without being taught he would conjure his mother not to tell him and clap his little hand over her mouth lest she should begin or rather go on speaking but as he termed it let him guess it out himself how words were to be spelt or pronounced at the age of four and an half he red as well as he could have done at fourteen he could find out in the calendar the lessons for the day for sundays and holydays whilst he remained in petticoats on week days he sat with his mother in the seats appropriate to the prebendaries ladies the amiable worthy lady of the late dr caryl both of whom doated on him used to say it is like the idea one has of praying in heaven to hear this little cherubring this great choir when he chaunts i really believe he understands better what he is about than half the grownup people that come hither accident discovered to his mother the strength of his memory her own was once pretty good she having often heard her mother say that she learned the alphabet at once showing that the next day she knew every letter but robert much excelled his mother mrs berkeley being a pretty good bible scholar used to work with her needle as she never put out any work of any sort or kind whilst her children were reading the scriptures in history geography etc that would not do one day observing little robert going on perfectly right and finding his eyes fixed at the other end of the room she enquired what he was at looking off his book he replied why mamma you know when one has read any thing in the book once one can read it without the book afterward and a little while ago i read this chapter in the book in the servants hall bible so now i can read it without the book to you today a boy having cut off some of his fine curling ringlets which hung below the bottom of his back he was very angry and said he would never forgive him  his mother assured him he would go to hell if he did not  he then replied then i will forgive him but i will never forget it  yes you must or god will not love you  well then if god will have me forget it he must make me do it for i never did forget any thing i ever heard or saw in my whole life when a little child not being allowed scissors for fear of his beautiful eyes he with his fingers pinched out in paper birds beasts ships flowers etc so accurately as was astonishing he drew very finely his second lesson a cows head is preserved as a prodigy of genius he danced delightfully and could go through all the military exercise of the infantry dr berkeley always paid a sergeant for attending his sons he spoke french as fluently as he did english he as well as his brother repeated by heart and acted delightfully he chaunted and sang finely his beloved schoolfellows were lovely little tatton the present sensible worthy samuel sawbridge esquire of ollantigh and the learned dr herbert pack son of the celebrated dr pack of canterbury the saturday on which he sickened in the evening he flew up at twelve oclock to conjure his mother to give him permission to invite my dear sam to dinner today it was alas the last dinner he ever ate he sickened about eight in the evening here follows a proof of this gentlemans honesty in very early youth some of the upper school boys had a shameful trick of robbing the very worthy mrs longley in the churchyard of a dozen oranges when they purchased half a dozen it was necessary to have one little boy as an assistant to this honorable action samuel sawbridge was enticed to which he sensibly nobly replied what take mrs longleys oranges without paying for them miss tucker teaches me my catechism and that says thou shall not steal and she tells me that taking any thing from any body without paying for it is stealing so i will not go with you this gentleman not then quite seven years old all canterbury rang with this tale mrs berkeley asked her little robert if he thought he should have been as honest as his dear friend samuel to which he made the following reply god knows  god knows my dear mamma if i had been tempted what i might have done thank god thank god they did not ask me and he shuddered as he energetically uttered the reply this lovely creature was to be sure wonderfully ambitious he repeatedly until told it was a wicked idea asked his mother mamma if i was to read greek and latin all day and all night and study violently hard could i come to be a king i should like to be a king such a thought never entered the head of his dear brother nor perhaps of any other child  for me who mindful of my absent friend have paid this mournful tribute to his end it still appeared some solace some relief to tell how great his merits and my grief thus the poor bird who mourns her plundered nest with plaintive notes by fond concern oppressed sounds through the wood sequestered from the throng and vents her grief in melody and song charles sawkins one of the senior monitors of the kings school canterbury now a most learned worthy student of christ church oxon  kings school canterbury june      several things of mr berkeleys writing having been noticed some quite ready for publication at the time of his decease the editor feels it a sort of duty to mention a work not ready for the press not even written but constantly talked of by mr berkeley from the early age of fifteen  a work in defense of the christian religion as taught in the purest church on earth the superexcellent church of england dr berkeley used now and then to say well berkeley when are we to see your defense of the christian religion  mr m berkeley  why my dear sir not yet although i never shall be quite happy until i have done it  dr b  why not then do it directly  mr b  i will tell you my dear sir i am resolved not to do it until i have if god spares my life established at least have endeavored to establish such a character in my own profession the law as shall induce men of sense to read it with the attention that i hope it will merit  mr monck berkeley although he failed alas to keep the resolution formed when about eight years old coming into his mothers dressing room and seeing what her witty sister used to call her vesper book and when both young women used to threaten to tie round her neck and her bed around her waist because the editor in general wished to retire to rest at eleven that is dean hickess reformed devotions lying on her table took it up and twirling it over stumbled on the hymn in the office for sunday vespers reading the lines  how cross art thou ie the world mentioned two verses before to that design for which we had our birth us who are made in heaven to shine thou bowst down to the earth nay to thy hell for thither sink all that to thee submit thou strewst some flowers on the brink to drown us in the pit mr berkeley then just turned of eight years old as mentioned above exclaimed no no i promise you i will not stoop to pick them up they shall not drown me with their fine flowers one must be a fool indeed to do that    ever felt the necessity of religion for all who hope to be happy here and hereafter a strong proof of which he gave the last time of his being at bath he and his excellent unwearied friend mr grimston lodged and boarded at mr garrets  a bon mot of mr whitakers cannot here be omitted dr berkeley etc going one day to visit dr berkeleys relation the very worthy colonel butler at thorpe on their arrival they found he had died three days before mr whitaker rode up to the carriage and enquiring how mr monck berkeley did and where he was hearing that he was at bath said i am going thither in two days where shall i find him  mrs berkeley  at mr garrets  mr whitaker  pshaw how could i be such a blockhead to ask  a poet is always in a garret  several gentlemen boarded who could not lodge at mr garrets amongst these was the at bath wellknown captain lawley  soon after the arrival of mr grimston and mr berkeley this wretched captain began to instruct the two young men in the pleasing doctrine of there being no god etc etc that the idea of hell and its prince was all a bugaboo to keep silly women in a little order many arguments did these two young christian men use with this wretched old atheist but all alas in vain one day he was missed from dinner the second he appeared not on an enquiry being sent to his lodgings word was brought that he was very ill mr grimston and mr berkeley went to call on him and found him as his apothecary said very dangerously ill indeed with little hope of recovery both were exceedingly shocked at his situation mr grimston earnestly requested mr berkeley to talk to him concerning his soul  mr berkeley  alas no my dear friend he now wants an abler counselor than i am  mr grimston  what can we do for him  mr b  we will go and request the favor of that gentleman the editor has forgotten the gentlemans name but thinks that it was mr jackson rector of st james church  whose preaching we both so much admire to go him to talk to him and pray with him  they immediately went to mr jackson who said to them gentlemen out of respect to you as you seem so earnestly to wish it i will go but am consident i shall make no more impression on him than on this marble hearth on which i stand for he is the most determined atheist the greatest ridiculer of every thing sacred that is any where to be found  the young gentlemen however continued very desirous and the worthy divine complied so each party  delivered their own soul but lamentable thought the wretched captain lawley resolved to die as he had lived and meet bugaboo unhouseld unanneald unanointed  one day when the two gentlemen were visiting him during his illness he fixed his eyes earnestly in silence on mr berkeley and at length said mr berkeley i should be very glad of a pair of your old shoes sir mr berkeley rather distressed said smiling my old shoes captain lawley i believe my servant would object to that but if a pair of my new ones will do as well i am sure there are a pair or two if you please very much at your service he looked thoughtful and replied i think i should like your shoes mr grimston conceived that he meant it as is sometimes said i would not be in his shoes or his coat when any one is in a scrape  on opening the captains will at his death it appeared that he had during his very few days illness made a will in favor of a gentleman who a few days before it had caused the gentleman and the editor thinks some ladies of character who boarded at mr garrets by their servants to prevent captain lawley from fighting this gentleman by contriving to prevent their meeting one evening he had by this wonderful will ruined two very near relations the editor thinks nieces whom he had obliged to give up keeping a very good school for young ladies by allowing them handsomely and promising to leave them his fortune  mr monck berkeley was so convinced that the captains intellects were deranged from the beginning of his illness that being about to leave bath he left his address in writing with some proper person saying if the will was contested by the relations he was ready to give his evidence whenever called upon  on the publication of the captains will the very worthy sir robert lawley baronet his cousingerman said it should be contested entirely at his expense on behalf of his worthy kinswomen and that himself would not come in for a shilling of the fortune  some months before mr monck berkeleys death he received a letter from doctors commons requesting to know when it would be convenient to him to receive some gentlemen thence to take his depositions concerning captain lawley he appointed an early day and several gentlemen arrived one morning from woods at maidenhead bridge at dr berkeleys at cookham stayed near two hours with mr monck berkeley received his deposition and the editor hopes some very thick good vannilla chocolate sandwiches white wine and water etc which she ordered to be sent in to them  mr berkeley requested if he lived until it was decided that he might be informed whether the will were established or not about a fortnight before his lamented death he received a letter from a gentleman of the commons telling him that the court had rejected the will of captain lawley  it were much to be wished that the ecclesiastical court could sometimes act as a court of equity they would they should surely had they been applied to have set aside the will of a wretched old fanatic of hull who after having kept his dutiful amiable only son near nine years with an eminent clergyman of the church of england who takes private pupils sent him down to scotland to the university of st andrews as he wrote to dr forest one of the professors that he might learn to preach the everlasting gospel as a presbyterian minister in england mr rogers was accordingly to his great distress entered of the divinity college the wonderful amiability of his nature and the sweetness of his manners rendered him universally beloved by persons of all ranks his zeal to succor and save and his generosity when saved to poor shipwrecked persons on the coast of st andrews used to occasion mr monck berkeleys saying well now rogers is happy he is posting off to a wreck with three or four bottles and blankets innumerable he has ordered beds to be ready for all the poor creatures that are escaped  mr rogers attended divine service regularly at dr berkeleys every sunday several letters arrived from the father asking when his son would be fit to preach in the meeting house that he had built ready for him this diverted his friends but as the frogs in the fable say although it is sport to you it is death to us poor mr rogers extremely distressed applied as hundreds of others did to dr berkeley for advice and direction who told him that perhaps if his wish was to become a divine of the church of england he had better apply to his father who as his grand desire seemed to be to hear his son preach and as he was very rich might buy the next presentation of a living with an aged incumbent on it the case was properly stated to the old man who soon returned for answer that having met with some baptists who had agreed to give him a very high rent for his meeting house he had let it to them left the presbyterians and become a baptist himself and his son might be of the church of england if he pleased  dr berkeley with his wonted goodness applied to his old tutor the present archbishop of york stating the case to his grace and requesting him to ordain mr rogers on the testimonial of several of the respectable professors at st andrews with regard to his life and conversation  the editor supposes that the testimonial of the learned dean hill professors hunter baron cook etc of mr rogerss learning life and conversation and dr berkeleys own knowledge of his holding no doctrine contrary to the church of england as by law established induced his grace to ordain the very worthy young man without a testimonial from oxford cambridge or dublin perhaps the editor in this last sentence may be writing like a fool as she has not for many years heard a testimonial for orders read if she has so done she is sorry for it the old man was so delighted that he set off in his postchaise and four for york to see his son ordained in that magnificent cathedral he was quite transported and had some thoughts of becoming a member of the church of england however that idea was transient and on his amiable sons going to settle at or near hull this old numpscull insisted on his preaching at the baptist meeting which mr rogers utterly refusing to do he cast him off married a young baptist and entirely disinherited him and this thoroughly amiable man is now as the editor hears from her beloved excellent friend henry grimston esquire a distressed curate at or near beverley in yorkshire the old wretch allowed him very handsomely during his residence at the university of st andrews or his bounties to the poor could not have been so extensive as all then resident there knew them to be but even then the beast showed his nature  his only daughter as mr rogers was his only son was married to captain lee the first officer as it was then said who ever sailed from england in a copperbottomed vessel  this gentleman was either dead or the ship and crew supposed to be lost or carried into slavery the editor thinks the latter to have been the case and no entreaties could prevail on this vile old hodmadod to tell his poor son in what part of the kingdom his sister with the editor thinks four young children resided  the editor one day asking her son what could induce the wretch if he was in his senses to be such a brute he replied in his most sweetly plaintive voice when feeling the woes of other alas my dear mother he is in his senses but he wants the sense of feeling which he knows his son has in an eminent degree and he is afraid that rogers should assist his i sadly fear distressed sister as it is so long since her husband has been heard of and rogers knows her father will not relieve her because the week before she was with his consent to be married to captain lee he bade her turn him off and marry a young plump presbyterian parson that he brought to her but she preferred captain lee and her cunning father took that opportunity to pocket the fortune he had promised to give to captain lee with her  it is surely a defect in our laws although excellent in general that a vilely covetous or horridly capricious father or mother can at their own pleasure either beggar or damn perhaps both in one their own illfated offspring  parents should have all power during youth none at all after children come to years of discretion and if they are wise or just if they have it let them renounce it as the editor always solemnly protested to dr berkeley that she would do he using to say when his children were young that he would leave them dependant on her for bread that they might be dutiful mrs berkeley assured him that much within a month after his decease she would put it out of her power to rob the children of a dead father that she would by gods blessing make them dutiful although they had an independance of ten thousand a year  the editor was exceedingly delighted the first time she heard it and has diverted many persons since with the account given of herself by the late sensible agreeable lady gray of den hill kent mother of the late sir james gray many years his majestys ambassador to the court of spain  the editor has an old trick like her late excellent relation sir martin wright of thinking aloud it is in her quite involuntary as she conceives it must have been in him when sitting on the judgment seat he would say loud enough to be heard by the barristers some of whom she has heard relate it to her mother well put mr hume campbell that will do and again oh lamentable lamentable mr  that will never do never do at all so the editor the first visit she made at den hill on entering the room where hung a magnificent wholelength portrait of the then king of spain of whom mr clarke gives so curious an account as also of the lamentations of his amiable queen when the sentence of death was pronounced to her not by french devils but by her wise pious confessor the editors eyes being better then than now she caught dr berkeley entering just behind her by the arm exclaiming oh  look do look at that man he must be the uniting link in the chain between man and brute between man and devil this was quite involuntary had she known it had been the monster monarch who to try a new fowlingpiece took aim and killed a poor masons labourer ascending a ladder in view the prejugee might have had share in her sentence to be sure according to the editors idea it is the most extraordinary countenance she ever saw  the witty worthy lady gray who became a widow before she was thirty and continued such until ninety when the oil all exhausted the lamp went gently out used to say i dont know how it is that young widows marry so fast i could not contrive to do it to be sure very soon after sir jamess death i had a multitude of lovers from lords and commons i heard of nothing but my beauty and wit however as soon as i had a little dried my eyes for the death of poor sir james i sent for a lawyer and settled the money about an hundred thousand pounds that he had left entirely in my power on his poor little orphans and whether it was that i grew ugly and foolish at nine and twenty or what else i know not but so it was i never heard a word more of my wit or beauty nor ever had a lover afterward her witty ladyship had admirers if not lovers to the last of her long life on earth  a poor old doting rich divine in the neighborhood of cloyne a widower with several children was going to marry a girl it reached the ears of bishop berkeley who immediately visited him and introducing the subject the old gentleman said that he should not have thought of it but that the young lady was so exceedingly in love with him how much weaker is second childhood  sans eyes sans teeth etc etc than the first the bishop said if that was the case the lady would at any rate marry him he assented and the bishop prevailed on him to settle his fortune on his children after his own death which so entirely cured the young ladys violent passion for him that he was suffered to go to his grave under the care of his worthy children the best guardians for aged persons when god vouchsafes to spare them  dr berkeley used sometimes to ask mrs berkeley what could induce her to marry who could well enough manage all her own business etc her uniform reply was that she might enjoy and improve by the conversation of a man of many men of superior understanding whilst she had sense enough left to enjoy it and to have some sensible worthy children to love and govern her if she should which she never wished always dreaded yet never dared to pray against attain to old age  the editor used frequently to conjure her dear son if she should attain to old age to govern her as carefully as she had governed him in his childhood  the editor is just returned from her parish church where it being december    saint thomass day she heard the proper lesson proverbs xxiii one of her guiding chapters and where every reward promised to a watchful parent is recorded she humbly praised the mercy of god he had vouchsafed to permit her to experience in its fullest extent  but the editor did not wish her son to govern her exactly in the same mode in which she had governed him not looking up upon him for two days one of mr monck berkeleys punishments from about seven to ten years old sitting on the same chair without moving for an hour  once alas for full three hours by the carelessness of his mother one day before teatime he was ordered to sit on a particular one of mr monck berkeleys punishments from three to eight years old in one room at his fathers ten chairs stood in one row his mother used generally to point to the one at the upper end mr berkeley from three years and an half would regularly go to the lowest not out of humility but to use a coined word of the editor wilfullity then to the next to which his eversteady mother said  not that thus he constantly strove for victory nine times and after standing some time at the tenth wriggled himself upon it chair in the library his mother called into the drawing room to make tea left him before tea was quite over dr berkeley said it is a heavenly evening we will cross the water and walk to cliefden be quick my dear get your hat the editor never when young made any one wait for her especially her mother and her lord and master as she used en badinant to style dr berkeley called her maid got her hat etc and skipped away thoughtless of her sweet little prisoner until she had crossed the thames when she wished to have returned but dr berkeley said oh he will get off when he finds you gone out the editor expressed her fear that he would not but she proceeded on her walk on her return she was met at the ferry by mr monck berkeleys everkind friend john lest she should make any call in the village saying will you be pleased madam to go home that master berkeley may go to bed then nine oclock he just seven years old for none of us can prevail upon him to stir off the chair where he says you ordered him to sit and not stir till you came to him we promised him you would not be angry but nothing would do and there he sits  the editor left dr berkeley and ran home the shortest way she could find through all the high dewbesprinkled grass to her obedient little man  when mr berkeley was about thirteen he one day said to his mother i wish you would be so good as to write upon a sheet of paper these words georgemonck berkeley is a very dutiful son  mrs berkeley  no indeed my dear i will not write any such thing  mr b  i wish you would  mrs b  no i cannot for i dont think it  mr b  i am sorry you do not  mrs b  so am i but you know how wilful you are  mr b  well but i always obey you at last  mrs b  yes but that is not being duty  full  mr b  well but i am obedient then  mrs b  yes you certainly do obey me  mr b  well then you will be so good as to write on this sheet of paper georgemonck berkeley is an obedient son  mrs b  yes if it will oblige you  mr b  oh yes it will indeed  the words were immediately written the sweet lads eyes sparkled with joy when he read them he carefully folded them up and walked away to his own room at dinner the curious dialogue was related to dear dr berkeley and the editor never heard or thought of it more until examining the small trunk containing many of his precious deposits delivered into her hands by the faithful mrs leycester mr berkeleys bedmaker at magdalen hall mentioned before in this preface this testimonial of her dear sons obedience signed as requested with her name lay carefully folded  the editor from a youth had always told mr berkeley that he was the eldest son in the gospel son go work today in my vineyard etc  yet afterward he repented and went mr berkeley used frequently to quote it on his mother  once when she requested him much to visit in town a very old friend of hers well known in the ton world but who did not happen to hit mr berkeleys fancy and he begged to be excused visiting the gentleman mrs berkeley replied well my dear then let it alone he said my dear mother i have a very large acquaintance in town and i cannot spend all my time in visiting that will not fit me for the bar  the morning that he was leaving the oaks he crept to his mothers bedside saying my dear madam i will wait on    mrs b  well my dear do not if it is disagreeable to you  mr b  yes i must i ought to have said i would do it on your first mentioning it to me but i could not you know you have always told me that i am the eldest son the gospel i cannot help it i wish i could  mrs b  indeed my dear child i am much happier that you are the eldest rather than the younger son mentioned by our blessed master  the editors request to her dear son to govern her in return for her having so well governed him recals to mind what he one day said at st andrews  soon after his return from a visit in the country to his beloved friend the universally beloved respected amiable sir john ramsay advocate in edinburgh whose early death at twentyeight mr berkeley never ceased to lament when speaking of that excellent young gentleman mr berkeley said i am certainly a very lucky fellow for let me go where i will i always find a mother at cookham when my mother was not in company if i said or did any awkward ridiculous thing my dear mrs ms always set me torights or well tuned me for it  and here in scotland lady ramsay takes me in hand his great good sense like that of his dear friend mr grimston made him add i am sure i am much obliged to them  mr grimston one day speaking of the son of a yorkshire baronet said he has had great advantages by being in the militia because mrs masters the editor thinks was the name of the colonels lady has taken to him and tutored him just as mrs berkeley does me and etc etc  mr monck berkeley used to tell his father that he heard some of his mothers friends say that in her youth she had a wonderful knack of making the young men know their distance and respect her and he was sure he was too polite to say now that she is old but now that she is not young she has a blessed knack of tuning the young men that visit here to which his mother used to reply well sir and do not you often tell your father that  and  and  love your mother almost as well as you do  mr b  oh yes my dear madam all the fellows of good sense like you wonderfully  it is very salutary for young men to meet with oldladyadvisers as it is surely happy for young women if they are wise enough to profit by it to have a wise male adviser who has lived in the world who knows life as it is wiretermed a wise wife or father or a worthy some yearsolder brother can tell a young lady many things that will render her pleasing or displeasing to the young men that a mother cannot and let young ladies deny it ever so strongly they all wish to be if not admired at least not displeasing in the opinion young men of sense a diverting dialogue might here be related which passed almost thirty years ago between the late excellent lord lyttelton the well known very sensible miss charlotte b and the editor on this subject when he exclaimed on the public walk at  how i do honor mrs berkeleys honesty adding  i know also that all the ladies in england love elegancies but i know but two that are honest enough to avow it mrs montagu and mrs berkeley the thoroughly elegant mrs montagu has ever had it in her power to gratify that innocent taste mrs berkeley only in taking care that dear dr berkeleys visitors got comfortable sort of dinners and clean nice sleeping rooms etc all that persons of moderate fortune who are blessed with children to educate and provide for can justly aim at for elegancies when butcher baker etc are unpaid become sinful vanities  but to return to the incomparable lady ramsay as the late lord kinnoul styled her ladyship when speaking of her to the editor who had not the honor to be known to her ladyship his lordship one day said i wish you did know her i do not think there is a cleverer woman upon the face of the whole earth mr monck berkeley one day said when i was at  the name of sir johns seat is not recollected by the editor he being a baronet of course was not called by it as all gentlemen of fortune sine title are in scotland  we had been out shooting all the morning and after tea lady ramsay and her elegant young ladies being drawn round the table to work sir john and mr berkeley on the sofa the former said softly come let us lie heads and points and rest ourselves a little lady ramsay soon perceiving their situation said mr berkeley i have not the honor her ladyship was as very sensible persons of rank generally are very condescending to speak thus to know mrs berkeley but from what i have heard from many of her friends i do not think that she would quite approve of your present situation when there are ladies in the room sir john are not you ashamed of yourself to lay your length on the sofa when your mother and sisters are in the room mr berkeley said i think i never felt more ashamed in my whole life i sprang upon my feet in an instant begged her ladyship ten thousand pardons thanked her a thousand times for her goodness and i assured her that my mother would have well tuned me had she seen me guilty of such horrid inattention to ladies or to gentlemen my superiors or elders  the editor when mr berkeley was little more than a youth one day after dining out reproached him for not peeling as well as cracking the walnuts for the young lady by whom he sat at dinner adding that when she was a young woman and sat near gentlemen they always peeled them for her mr berkeley then but very young replied oh my dear mother thank fate the girls in these days have found the use of their fingers i always crack them for them and i think they may very well peel them for themselves  mr berkeley felt very sincerely for his highly respected friend lady ramsay the loss of two so amiable sons in the very prime of life he felt indeed for all in distress whether of mind body or estate a strong proof of which the editor cannot forbear reciting here during his residence in the university at st andrews dr berkeley dining in the country soon after dinner mr berkeley walked out and returning immediately flew into the eating room and exclaimed best of mothers how can you sit reading here as if nothing had happened the editor sprang up saying good god child has your father been overturned  mr berkeley   no i hope not but a poor unhappy mans foot is just now torn off above his ancle by the mill  mrs b  well my dear child could i know that by inspiration  mr b  no but pray do something for him they have sent for flint dr flint the very learned experienced almost always successful professor of physic in the university at st andrews and melville mr melville a most excellent surgeon  and they are both out of town  mrs b  well if he is bleeding violently i can send john with some manchester styptic this incomparable medicine when genuine not here called by its right name which is hatfields styptic once saved mr monck berkeleys life when a child when nearly all the blood in his veins was exhausted and nothing could staunch the bleeding the moment this was applied it ceased but that was genuine prepared by and procured from the honest wife of the manchester baker to whom a famous french surgeon in gratitude for her goodness in nursing him through a very long illness communicated the secret for years it was sold only in manchester happy for the public had it continued as well as some other famous patent medicines in honest hands the editor means if god spares her life to give in the gentlemans magazine some account of the almost miraculous cures wrought by this astonishingly fine medicine as many medical gentlemen high in their profession have declared it to be when they have by their eloquence prevailed on the editor to let them taste it  she not exhibiting to the faculty left they should maliciously laugh as she tells them and call her  lady bountiful alas she cannot now get it from mr hatfield the bakers daughter at manchester there is a poor wretched thing called hatfields styptic sold by the man who obliged happily for the public messrs hoopers to take into their own hands again the preparing their father dr hoopers excellent pills these pills genuine cured a respectable old servant of the editors of seven large wounds in one leg not that all patent medicines prepared by the proprietors if they happen to be covetous are genuine as the editors poor weakened stomach lamentably feels and pretty certainly will feel as long as she continues an inhabitant of this sublunary world she hopes and believes that her private admonition has on his own account wrought reformation on the medicine if not on preparer respect for the very worthy vender keeps the name of the said adulterated medicine from being published as she verily believes it is since her visit in  properly prepared  if not from principle yet from policy   mr b  no it does not bleed a drop but send john with a bottle of wine and some money to comfort the poor creature for gods sake i have given him something but do you send him more  mr melville soon arrived the poor man did well and perhaps is now living blessing with many others in st andrews mr monck berkeleys lovely charity the poor man was warned not five minutes before by a woman of the mill to be aware of the rope that tore off his foot but warning alas does not always avail the neglecting it must add weight to calamity  the loss of this poor mans foot recalls to the editors mind the preservation of the leg of a relation of hers s cherry esquire a cousingerman of mr cherry who served in all queen annes wars under the great duke of marlborough when besieging  the editor forgets what place one day eight or ten officers sat down to dinner in a sawpit they agreed to make a table by every man laying his right leg across the pit instead of dropping both into it on beginning their dinner they wanted salt or mustard one said go you another go you to the sutlers at length captain cherry jumped up saying i will go at his return he found that every officer had lost a leg a chain ball had been fired from the battery and had quite taken off the leg of some and so shattered those of the others that the surgeon was obliged to amputate them poor men they all lived and went halting to the house appointed for all living on one leg as the editor has frequently heard her unmaimed relation say at fourscore he had not lost one of as fine a set of teeth as ever were seen as white as at twenty years old  his eyesight almost equally good the editor has often heard him and colonel  a relation of her mother relate a very curious transaction that happened between the duke of marlborough and his aiddecamp lord cadogan father of the late duchess of richmond that does honor to both noblemen  the editor regrets always did regret that she is of a terribly longlived family on both sides it is however some pleasure to her to think that her father and mother both died much younger than she now is but alas those two excellent christians were quite ripe for glory before they went to enjoy it she never could quite subscribe to that beautiful simile in dean hickess reformed devotions in one of the psalms of the prpa ratory office for death used every thursday by the editor since her age of seventeen no matter how late the fruit be gathered if it still go on in growing better no matter how soon it fall from the tree if not blown down before it be ripe   to the latter verse she heartily subscribes although to the former verse not quite it is only thy will be it done in me on me and by me that alone reconciles her to the unpleasantnesses of old age  verses by the pious mr norris of bemerton altered by the equallypious betterinformed mrs catharine talbot of lambeth palace several gentlemen one day at lambeth palace some divines amongst them were admiring these verses of the pious learned mr norris miss talbot ever cheerful ever delighting to look forward with joy to that world where she through faith well knew that happiness was to be found which she too well knew was not to be found here said i never could bear that poem of norriss several with one voice exclaimed who could have written a finer on that subject she laughing replied any one some one said i wish you would then well go get me the book and a pen and i will at least if not make a better mend that which she immediately certainly did as above this is copied from the altered one in the handwriting of that loveliest of women that entirely beloved friend who gave it to the editor the next day by whom it has been carefully preserved for more than thirty years she miss talbot saying i cannot bear to hear persons who i really think believe in the all sufficiency of christ admire such stuff as death could not a more sad retinue find sickness and pain before  darkness behind poets sometimes take strange flights good mr norris in one of his poems shocked the editor when she was a very young woman hardly a woman  saying in his poem on the death of some young norfolk lady that heaven wanted the presence of her i think mrs margaret pastarns spirit to make it a place of complete happiness she flew to her mother to enquire if it was not blasphemy were mrs frinsham still on earth the editor would not trouble her concerning those lines she thinking of them just as she did at fifteen she blesses god that no such flights are to be found in mr monck berkeleys poems the editor cannot omit mentioning here two short conversations held with her son at the distance of almost ten years when a very young man he showed to his mother some charming verses that he had written to a friend on the death of a very near and dear relation his mother said you seem to offer all your consolation from heathen philosophers he replied best of mothers what could i do would you have had me offered it from the bible to a man that you know does not believe that blessed book the second near ten years after  mrs berkeley said my dear i dare say although i am no judge that the lines are very fine but there is not a tittle said of the only thing that could console you were the almighty to deprive you of your poor mother  that she was gone to christ mr berkeley looked sweetly sad and replied oh best of mothers but i could not offer that consolation concerning one who i have alas too good reason to fear did not believe in christ  surely such can never go to him i have said all that my conscience would suffer me to say to soothe a little the anguish of their spirits on the loss of an agreeable mother christ says except ye believe that i am ye shall die in your sins what a threat to socinians and to the arians lord monboddo in his ancient metaphysics says the arian heresy was the subtlest that ever infected the christian church many years ago a gentleman on a visit at dr berkeleys at cookham said that in his way through london on the preceding sunday resting on the sabbathday he had heard the following sentence uttered from the pulpit by a very learned divine preaching on the above cited words of our adored redeemer if ye believe not that i am etc if jesus christ be not god perfectly equal with the father i had rather trust to the blood of a dog for my salvation than to that of christ who if not absolutely equal with the father is an impostor some one said that is very strong language dr berkeley replied but it is certainly right or true the editor forgets which word he used whatever arian can be happy enough to lay eyes on the wonderful work of the late very deeply learned reverend meredith jones many years chaplain to the present venerable lord bishop of chichester must be convinced the editor has one which she lends out for one week only if not returned she threatens the borrower with an action of trover  it must be done my soul but though a strange it is sure a most delightful change when thou must leave this tenement of clay and through the fields of either wing thy way when time shall be eternity and thou shall live where dwell thy pious friends where dwells thy savior now amazing thought that we should ever dread to think of death or view the dead not now wrapped up in clouds but faith to thee a land of light and certainty death could not a more blessed retinue find patience and faith before and glorious hope behind when lifes close knot by gods supreme decree disease shall cut or age set free the christian firm amid the awful strife stands calm though trembling on the verge of life and from distracting doubts serenely free him whom in time he loved trusts for eternity so when the spacious globe was covered over and highest mountains were no more safe in the ark the righteous noah stood till borne triumphant over the boundless flood he reached the haven where he wished to be and hailed a fair new world from sin and sorrow free finis
