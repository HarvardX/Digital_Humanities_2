of moses are in part very properly abolished being indeed only instituted for local occasions and adapted to the temper of the times but there are others which with little or no alteration are and deserve to be of eternal force in the two verses directly preceding this passage there is a very excellent distinction made in point of punishments and offenses he that kills a man shall surely be put to death and he that kills a beast shall surely make it good thus the human person is rendered sacred and the animal which is private property is made secure to the proprietor methinks the following verse may be considered as one of the great and original foundations of social preservation breach for breach eye for eye tooth for tooth it is at this very day the true recriminating principle not indeed quite literally but eventually and who can call the rectitude of it in question in reading these ancient records however we find several crimes penable which are now though highly attrocious scarce within the letter of the law the blasphemer and sabbathbreaker for instance was stoned and now the price of an oath is at worst but a shilling and the other matter for the most part is no object of attention there are many minute articles in the code of moses still in being amongst us thus an hired horse dying upon its journey is to this day as it was formerly being an hired thing it came for his hire the matter and custom of gleaning was certainly first derived from the following command  when thou cuttest down thine harvest in the field and have forgot a sheaf in the field thou shall not go again to fetch it it shall be for the stranger for the fatherless and for the widow that the lord thy god may bless thee in all the work of thy hands the term of an apprentiship seems to originate from the following institute if thou buy an hebrew servant six years he shall serve and at the end of the seventh he shall go out free and if a man fell his daughter for a maidservant she shall not go out as the men servants do there is i think no doubt but this is the foundation of the rule of allotting the harder labor of the fields to the male and the easier cares of the house to the female these are indeed curious and small but surely no man will think them uninteresting remarks now i am upon the subject of the statutes of moses i cannot neglect mention of various humane and social institutions some of which are very improperly abrogated  if thou meet thine enemys ox or ass going astray thou shall surely bring it back to him again if thou see the ass of him that hates thee lying under his burden thou shall surely help him it is much to be feared the enemies of the present day will scarce forbear smiling at this injunction so far from obeying it  thou shall not countenance a poor man in his cause in one sense this is most rigidly observed in all the courts of justice  and if thou sell ought of thy neighbor or buy ought of thy neighbor ye shall not oppress one another the modern maxim of striking a bargain is perhaps something different from this  and if thy brother be waxen poor and fallen in decay with thee then thou shall relieve him so that he may live with thee it is really painful to comment and draw parallels betwixt ancient and modern times when we are compelled to censure the latter in so many cases  let us therefore close the subject  essay xxii story of balaam and his ass passage  and the lord opened the mouth of the ass and she said unto balaam what have i done unto thee that thou have smitten me these three times in whatever light this matter is viewed whether as an operation of the deity which we have no right to dispute since the same power which can command water from the rock can as easily inspire the animal with argument or whether we consider it in the light merely of a moral fable it is wonderfully beautiful and pathetic i shall endeavor to illustrate it both scripturally and historically  now balaam was riding upon his ass and his two servants were with him in the very setting out of the journey it was a thing displeasing to the deity and the first hints of his displeasure were very remarkably displayed and the ass saw the angel of the lord standing in the way and his sword drawn in his hand upon this the poor creature very naturally astonished at such a spectable turned aside out of the way and went into the field and balaam smote the ass to turn her into the way in opposition however to blows the animal awhile went on till the same angelic appearance standing in a path of the vineyards made her fly in terror toward the wall against which she unfortunately crushed the foot of her master and for this second offense he smote her again but still the celestial visitant resolved as it were to obstruct or at least to delay the journey stood at last in so narrow a place that there was no possibility of passing either to the right hand or to the left and when the ass found herself thus beset and thus thwarted in all her endeavors  what could she do she had respect to the commands of her lord but she was unable to obey them possibly too she was more than affrighted  she might be awed by the figure before her  she therefore fell down and balaam considering this third trespass as a still greater aggravation of obstinacy smote the ass with his staff then it was that the power who knew the innocence of the poor thing took pity upon her sufferings and to put at once an end to the hard usage her mouth was opened that she might plead her own cause with the man and enter into a pathetic remonstrance with him upon the subject of his barbarity and she said unto balaam what have i done unto thee that thou have smitten me these three times but balaam was now too violently angry to attend even to miracles and without regarding the circumstance as being preternatural he replied to it merely as an ordinary question by wishing in the vehemence of his heart a sword was in his hand that he might kill the offender upon the spot and now succeeds an answer which might melt the hardest heart and soften the compassionate into tears am not i thine ass upon which thou have ridden ever since i was thine unto this day was i ever wont to do so unto thee imagination here unavoidably extends the commentary how balaam can thou thus ill entreat thy servant have i at any time save now resisted thy designs and have not thy slightest wishes been to me in the nature of injunctions thrice have thou lifted up thine arm in anger against me and thrice have i borne the anguish without complaining ah ungentle master  could thou not conceive that some peculiar occasion prevented my obedience if happily nothing struck thine eye as an obstacle surely thou might have relied upon one whose fidelity both by day and by night thou have so often experienced am i not the old slave of your pleasure contented with whatever food it is convenient for you to allot me  nothing loath to perform the labors to which i was born and to earn the herb of the field before i ate it to this expostulation which one would think might have force enough to restrain the iron hand of inhumanity itself balaam replied by confessing that her arguments were true was i ever wont to do so unto thee nay answered balaam  soon after this dialogue the angel convinced balaam of his fault and he then bowed his face to the earth  struck probably with a sense of double impropriety  why have thou smitten thine ass  if a man was to be fairly asked this question in the courts of moral equity those courts where conscience sits as judge how would he be able to answer it there is no need to run this fine narrative into the perplexities of subtle and latent meaning it is sufficiently admirable as an address to the human heart and indeed the scriptures are not more earnest and persuasive in the cause of compassion than in the cause of salvation there is scarce a chapter in which pity that sweet emanation of heaven is not enjoined and that the reader might not be fatigued with sameness of sentiment or tired with likeness of language the style of the subject is varied almost a thousand times sometimes the lovely quality of mercy is recommended to us as in the present instance by a tender and attracting narrative  sometimes by a beautiful allegory or parable and very often by a concise moral sentence expressed in a way so irresistibly striking that we are led to the practice of the virtue not only by a veneration for its intrinsic charms but by the additional graces which it receives from composition  even the sorest curses in the scriptures are for the most part against cruelty and to recommend kindness and in the beginning of the   d chapter of deuteronomy i e from verse the first to verse the seventh there are sentiments of the most humane and affectionate tendency that ever were read conceived inspired or practiced let every man who has a heart peruse them  i will not add  attentively  because to peruse them negligently where any degree of feeling is bestowed is utterly impossible  what must have been the sensations of balaam when he understood from the lip of a divinity that unless the ass had turned in the very manner he did the master would have been slain and the servant preserved alive how extreme should be the caution and how palpable the error before punishment is inflicted for such is the infirmity of man he may thrice smite his preserver for those very actions which ultimately produce the most desirable and eminent blessings and when once such a mistake happens and the indignity is given where is the man possessed of sufficient effrontery to meet the eye of his benefactor every stroke we have given returns invigorated upon ourselves and we feel the blows shamefully burning upon our cheeks  essay xxiii death of moses passage  and the lord said unto moses get thee up into this mount abarim and see the land which i have given unto the children of israel  and when thou have seen it thou also shall be gathered unto thy people  how few are there at this day in the world whom such a command would not terrify it is plainly ascertaining the most aweful moment of mortality yet the excellent person to whom it was spoken appears to have received it without the least alarming emotion and that not because he was insensible but because he had talked with his maker as with a friend and because he was assured being informed of his own death indeed he was anxious to fill up the vacancy which he should leave properly and therefore for the sake of posterity petitioned for a successor in these times such intelligence even though it were communicated in a dream would disorder all the felicity of the day and the very best of us would dread the advances of the night lest the horrid images should again appear but if as in this place the tidings were conveyed by the voice of god himself although the event was not to happen for fifty years the whole scheme of life however delightfully our imaginations had before colored it however bright our expectation or splendid our circumstances would be instantly destroyed the radiance of the morning enwrapt suddenly amidst the gloom of midnight gives us but a faint simile to express the astonishment and the anguish that would upon such an occasion seize the soul instead of attending to our secular affairs we should be incapable either of business or pleasure even interest would want its usual stimulus the veriest niggard would forget his unvisited hoard and at last when the blow was just descending with a fearful voice and trembling hand he would appoint a successor or what is full as probable his apprehensions would predominate over all ideas of natural justice or else the strange suggestions of at least a possibility that destiny might delay to discharge its promise would induce him to die amidst the deceits of hope and leave his unsecured property to the rapacity of law and the contest of various claimants moses however is represented as going on immediately after this in the great affairs which were allotted to him undisturbed by the common terrors of ordinary men we still find him transmitting the laws of life and eternity from god to man he continued as before to settle with the same sagacity the moral civil and religious system he was the amanuensis of providence and after he had done all the appointed service to society he died at the age of one hundred and twenty years in the fullest possession of every faculty for his eye was not dim nor his natural force abated and yet as there has not arisen another like unto moses whom god knew face to face and as the life of man is since considerably shortened insomuch that all the scriptural similes of its brevity are in a moral sense unable to give us the precise idea the concealment of the last hour is a particular indulgence to us prescience would distress the most virtuous mind and in every light we can possibly view this matter ignorance is bliss and foreknowledge would to all intents and purposes be agony  essay xxiv story of caleb and othniel passage  and caleb said he that smites kirjathsepher and takes it to him will i give achsah my daughter to wife in the short but very pleasing narratives of caleb and othniel bravery and piety are powfully recommended and rewarded calebs story is related by himself in the   th chapter of joshua from whence we easily see into his character enamoured of glory himself he naturally loved it in others and being called to battle in a righteous cause he proposed by way of encouragement to the youthful heroes of his day the most precious prize in his possession  even achsah his daughter this proposal fired the bosom and animated the exertions of the youth othniel who took it and received the beautiful reward with this fair present it should seem he led a life of honor and virtue ever warmly devoted to his god and his country for after the death of joshua when the children of israel again relapsed into disobedience and ingratitude and the almighty sold them to the king of mesopotamia as a punishment othniel was the person who upon their repentance was ordained to deliver them from the chains of captivity and such was the wisdom of this heros mind that after he had rescued them from slavery by the valor of his arm he kept the land in the composure of peace forty years all that time the place had rest nor do we hear of any farther flagrant instances of trespass or violation till after his death upon which that disobedient people once more began to revolt and degenerate  the union of magnamity and moral goodness well deserve the highest treasures of reward and it were to be wished that the courage of othniel was constantly enriched by the principles of othniel war in itself is certainly only a more legal butchery than private murder but when the sword is drawn in a cause like this where integrity was blended with intrepidity every bosom is officious to share the honors and every hand ready to bestow the laurel the fatherinlaw of othniel was himself not insensible however to the deserts of victory and we find him asserting his claim before joshua like a soldier how beautifully has be contrived to rehearse his own successes without vainglory or ostentation and he speaks of the services he has done and is still able to do the state without incurring from delicacy itself the character of a boaster forty years old was i says he when moses the servant of the lord sent me from kadeshbarnea to espy out the land and i brought him word again as it was in mine heart and moses swear on that day saying surely the land whereon thy feet have trodden shall be thine inheritance and thy childrens for ever because thou have wholly followed the lord thy god and now behold the lord has kept me alive as he said these forty and five years even since the lord spoke this word unto moses while the children of israel wandered in the wilderness and now lo i am this day fourscore and five years old and yet i am as strong this day as i was in the day that moses sent me as my strength was then even so is my strength now for war both to go out and to come in now therefore give me this mountain etc if so be the lord be with me then i shall be able to drive them out  his plea was irresistible the whole speech was sustained by a manly firmness and a disdain of all that nauseous incense which is too frequently lavished by the servile petitioner in consequence of this oration joshua blessed him and willingly gave that which was requested his own conquests thus paid he was resolved to do justice to congenial merit and as an instance of his love of glory and an example to others he gave his child to him who should most deserve her othniel had no sooner obtained her than the noble parent settled upon their issue a fresh inheritance of fields and springs here it is not easy to glance at a deficiency of modern times  a deficiency long deplored and still remaining to be so where is the adequate meed for the present race of conquerors are the deliverers of our country for ever to be neglected  to starve after the toils of war upon the stipend of divided pay and to see the hand of power lifting up over their venerable heads the beardless babies of the troop to the very top round of the ladder of preferment while they are condemned to languish at the view and even in the season of the silver hair stand uncovered in the presence of their puerile superiors  o britain where is thy gratitude o ye distributers of honor whither is fled the spirit of recompense  essay xxv story of naomi and ruth passage  and ruth said entreat me not to leave thee or to return from following after thee for whither thou go i will go and where thou lodgest i will lodge thy people shall be my people and thy god my god there never was any thing more happily conceived or more sweetly told than the book of ruth it seems chiefly designed to exhibit to us a lively and highcolored picture of the force of female friendship on the one hand and the weakness of resolution when opposed by custom on the other the general circumstances of the story being uncommonly fine will speak best for themselves and afford proper comments in the progress of reciting them  when the famine raged with much severity in her native land naomi and her husband elimelech and their two sons went to sojourn in the country of moab but elimelech died and naomi the widow was left with her children soon after this those children took them wives of the women of moab the name of the one was orpah and the other ruth it came to pass that the young men their husbands died also both of them and now the poor widow was bereaved of her sons and her husband unable therefore to bear any longer a place in which every scene presented some image of lost endearment or revived some distracting idea of conjugal or maternal tenderness she resolved to seek solace from her sorrow by change of residence so she arose with her daughtersinlaw orpah and ruth that she might return from the country of moab it presently occured to the poor woman as she was journeying on her way that if she was herself unhappy it was no testimony of her affection to involve her sons wives in equal calamities and judging the reception she would be likely to meet in the land of judah entering it desolate unfriended and unadorned she paused a moment and thus pathetically addressed the young widows go my children each of you return to your mothers house the lord deal kindly with you as you have dealt with the dead and with me the lord grant that ye may find rest each of you in the house of your dear deceased husband  having uttered this short prayer for their happiness she kissed them and prepared to depart alone how true to nature was their reply they did not pour forth unmeaning compliments of condolance  they did not interchange any idle civilities of sorrow for their anguish was too sincere for ceremony  neither did they enter into the parade of promising future interviews  for they spoke not at all the extreme of grief has at the first surprise little to do with language  at the most it bursts into short exclamations as if it would show the impossibility of proceeding for our alleviation therefore in these cases that power who to every wound has provided something wherewith to heal it gave the comfort of tears so that the fullness of the sad heart is in part discharged by that kindly effusion which providence has intended as a fountain to relieve the excesses of nature either in the surplus of misery or transport they lift up their voice and wept  a folio could not so well display their condition  after some time passed in this kind of significant silence they said unto her surely we will return with thee unto thy people here again genuine grief discovers itself one tender sentence and one only expresses their designs and wishes to attend her in such cases conciseness is nature and circumlocution mere art and affectation the pathetic as well as the grand says the most elegant translator of longinus is displayed as strongly by silence or a bare word as in a number of periods i will venture to say much more strongly by a sentence than a volume in many cases and in some as in the present instance total silence is more expressive and characteristic than the most feeling or forcible sentence there is a kind of mournful eloquence in a dumb grief which shames all clamorous sorrow or as a bard who better understood the operations of the human heart more poetically has it my grief lies all within and those external manners of laments are merely shadows to the unseen grief that swells with silence in the tortured soul there lies the substance when words are too weak says the critic or colors too faint to present a pathos as the poet will be silent so the painter will hide what he cannot show  mr smith has offered a very fine example of this wherein the skill of timanthes the painter is shown in marking the gradations of sorrow in a groupe of characters till he had exhausted the passions and silence became necessary to the last figure in the distresful climax but nothing can furnish a finer illustration than orpah and ruth  lord kames however in his chapter upon the language of passion after having observed that immoderate grief is mute because complaining is struggling for consolation has illustrated that remark by so apt a story from the  d book of herodotus that i am sure the reader will not be displeased with me for setting it down amongst the notes for his service  cambyses when he conquered egypt took psammenitus the king prisoner and for trying his constancy ordered his daughter to be dressed in the habit of a slave and to be employed in bringing water from the river his son also was led to execution with a halter about his neck the egyptians vented their sorrow in tears and lamentations psammenitus only with a downcast eye remained silent afterward meeting one of his companions a man advanced in years who being plundered of all was begging alms he wept bitterly calling him by his name cambyses struck with wonder demanded an answer to the following question psammenitus thy master cambyses is desirous to know why after thou had seen thy daughter so ignominiously treated and thy son led to execution without exclaiming or weeping thou should be so highly concerned for a poor man no way related to thee psammenitus returned the following answer son of cyrus the calamities of my family are too great to leave me the power of weeping but the misfortunes of a companion reduced in his old age to want of bread is a fit subject for lamentation    perceiving the design of the daughters the widowwoman naomi again began to dissuade them and to press their speedy return she painted the various disasters they would be liable to in her company  told them she had no more sons to give them for husbands  nor even a hut however uncheary and forlorn to accommodate them with in her own country  and furthermore that she had not wherewithal to repose her own head upon if after the fatigues of travel she should happily arrive safe and now she once more pressed the women in a farewell embrace whilst she closed her arguments with another blessing more melting even than the first nay  my daughters  weep not i entreat you it grieveth me more for your sakes than my own that the hand of the lord has gone out against me this was the touchstone she had now fairly discovered all the horrors of her situation and showed herself a woman without accommodation  a traveller without hope of rest at the end of her journey and a widow without one to take her by the hand and say unto her welcome unfortunate  welcome again to thine own country the picture was too darkly shaded for orpah the dread of poverty and all its sable catalogue of terrors struck her at once she shed the tribute of a few more tears  sacrificed a few more sighs and went her way not so the affectionate ruth how excellently marked and that by a single word is the conduct of each orpah kissed her motherinlaw but ruth clave unto her the sentence though thus compressed is emphatically copious in point of meaning but indeed the multum in parvo should be one characteristic of the sacred writings orpah kissed her motherinlaw i e she gave her a farewell embrace wept a womans sorrow and left her mother to wander over the world but ruth clave unto her struck to the heart at the prospect of seeing her friend and parent no more and still calling to mind the thousand endearments which had formerly made precious her society and even feeling some additional sympathy from being involved in a calamity which arose from the mischances of one house and one family she endured not the idea of her departure so far otherwise indeed that she clave unto her ie clung round her neck  kissed her with an ardour as if she designed to leave the seal of her very soul impressed on her lips for ever in vain did the nobleminded naomi exhibit to her the various miseries which were at hand and against which there was no comfortable provision  in vain did she point to the example the politic and prudent example of orpah her sister  in scorn of such conduct and to close at once all future dissuasions she thus deelared to the eternal honor of her sex the glowing resolutions of her soul entreat me not to leave thee or to return from following after thee for whither thou go i will go and where thou lodgest i will lodge thy people shall be my people and thy god my god the whole beauty and force of this passage is not seen at once it is a very fine climax and there is amazing elegance in the gradations the full sense implied seems to branch out in this manner she begins with desiring naomi to urge the subject of separation no longer since she has completely made up her mind upon it this is the first and slightest part in the next place she unfolds her first design to follow her fortunes in whatever part of the habitable globe she thinks proper to pursue them but not thinking this sufficiently expressive of her affection she resolves to take up her abode in the same house with her  to lodge under the same roof however poor and to share the same bed however inelegant  after this she resolves to know no other people than such as are equally the common friends of both  to enter into no attachments but those which are united by the same tender ties to her dear naomi and to form no connections whatever that can in the least derogate from the love she bore her but she is not contented with having delivered these assurances for she goes on declaring that her very religion shall be the religion of her friend  that one faith and one hope shall animate their devotion and that the god of one shall be the god of the other even this does not satisfy her for she next determines not only to go with her the pilgrimage of life but attend her beyond the gate of death  to die with her naomi should it be her naomis lot to fall first and to be buried at last in the same grave and this she confirmed by an immediate oath of the utmost importance and sanctity amongst the daughters of judah the lord god do so to me and more also if ought but death  she might have said  if death itself part thee and me  when naomi saw that she was steadfastly minded to go she left off persuading her so they went until they came to bethlehem and when they arrived it came to pass that all the city were moved about them and they said is this naomi here are fresh morals and fresh elegancies opened upon us the disconsolate naomi had no sooner set her foot upon her own land than all those little passions which lie lurking in the bosoms of the illiberal and the inhospitable were instantly awakened curiosity surveyed the tatters which she had not the soul to repair  ill nature was we may be sure officious enough to throw in her bitter sarcasm pride was ready with her insulting offer of pity  avarice lamented his incapacity to answer the good wishes of his heart and in short every arrogant every paltry propensity was in arms against our defenseless travelers but as naomi originally lived in some degree of comfort and credit in her own country and was now reduced she of course more particularly was the mark of their obloquy and conversation  upon entering the city therefore the mob flocked about her to indulge the vulgar and villainous joy of adding a fresh load to the heart which was already groaning under its burden for it is but too generally the horrid maxim to assist where assistance is unnecessary and to deny such assistance where it may be the means of continuing life or of promoting happiness and they said one to another  measuring no doubt the poor wretch from top to toe and noteing with cruel criticism every unfortunate particular  is this naomi god of heaven as much as to say  is this the woman  the wife of elimelech who lived in such plenty  this poor ragged wretch  this shadow of herself  is this naomi mercy upon us  who would have thought it having exhausted all the unfeeling and hardened remarks customary on such occasions all their compassion and all their cruelty ended exactly in the old way  in leaving her the loss of some sighs and tears  poorer than they found her she soon found that to rely upon the kindness of old friends was but a precarious mercy for it is not bearing too hard i fear upon human nature to suppose that her very nextdoor neighbor the very companion of all her girlish sports would give with an ill grace if she gave at all that pillow or that bread of which after so wearysome a journey she certainly stood much in need illused by the world therefore she began to lose the hope of such resources  the benevolence of distant relations in whose memory she might be able to revive the images of tenderness was likewise a fond idea that was born and buried almost in the same instant nothing of comfort seemed to remain in reserve till the excellent ruth the faithful partner of her sufferings suggested an expedient and she said unto her friend i perceive oh my dear naomi that our conveniences must depend upon ourselves and that we must owe our daily bread to our daily labor as it is now the beginning of the harvest behold the opportunity of exerting ourselves is at hand thou indeed art too much afflicted to toil but for my part  much and tenderly as i sympathize with thee i am in the prime of my youth and able to gather something from the field let me now therefore go and glean ears of corn after him in whose sight i may find grace  now it was so that naomi had a kinsman of her husbands a mighty man of wealth of the family of elimelech and his name was boaz and it happened as ruth was gleaning after the reapers she was situate on a part of the field belonging to boaz this circumstance occasioned a turn of fortune perfectly dramatic for boaz coming to take a view of his reapers perceiving the stranger said unto the servant who was set over the reapers whose damsel is this the servants answer is penned with the most natural simplicity it is the moabitish damsel that came back with naomi out of the country of moab and she said i pray you let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves so she came and has continued amongst us even from the morning until now that she tarried a little in the house something there was either in this account or in the appearance of the object which won much upon the favor of the landlord for it is surely a softer voice even than the voice of hospitality that speaks in the sequel hear thou not my daughter go not i charge you to glean in any other field neither go from hence but abide here fast by my maidens i have given particular injunctions to the young men that they shall not touch thee and when thou art athirst go to the vessels and drink of that which the young men have drawn here began the first fruits of her fidelity and the partiality of boaz made a very rapid progress for in his second address he was more benevolent than in the first he invited her to consider herself as one of his own people to eat of the bread to dip her welcome morsel in the vinegar at meal times and to sit cheerfully beside the reapers nay more with his own hand  surely the heart extended it  he reached her parched corn and she did eat and was sufficed and left now it was that boaz began to discover more evidently that the spring of this generous current lay very near the heart when she was risen up to glean after her repast he commanded the young men to show her all possible marks of courtesy and distinction his strict orders were not to suffer her to gather the scanty pittance ear by ear after the cautious rake had gone over the ground but to let her glean unquestioned even amongst the sheaves nay more they were to let some handfulls fall on purpose for her and leave them for her particular gleaning and indeed such was the successful consequence of these indulgences that after she had beat out what she had been permitted to glean in one single day it was about an ephah of barley this the kind creature carried with all the expedition of affection to her friend and when naomi saw it  when the soul of the sorrowful widow sang for joy then ruth related to her the whole history of her good fortune and concluding that the name of the hospitable owner of the land was boaz this intelligence revived her spirits like a cordial and she exclaims with the most animated transport the man is near akin to us my beloved ruth  one of our next kinsmen often and with equal success she went after this into the field and continued there to earn a very comfortable living for herself and her friend even to the close of the harvest in the mean time the passion of boaz had made a very pathetic progress and the result of it was that he became the honorable lover of our fair gleaner and renewed his acquaintance with his relation naomi to whom he made we are told various presents boaz and ruth were soon united and as a convincing instance of the harmony in which the family lived together we find highly to the gratification of every elegant heart that when ruth presented to boaz a child  her firstborn  naomi  after all the perils of her past life  reenjoyed the sweets of privacy and peace for she took the babe and laid it in her bosom and became nurse unto it and i must not forget to add that this very child whose name was obed was the grandfather of the famous david to whose pen the psalms are attributed which both as pieces of scripture and of writing are totally unrivalled in point of energy and sublimity by any composition that has yet been or that probably ever will be produced in human language  undoubtedly our english virgil the author of the seasons took from this story the hint of his episode of palemon and lavinia but beautiful as that episode may be i by no means think he has improved the present subject indeed it is not easy to improve any of the sacred narratives nor was mr thomson a poet of simplicity he has however followed the original pretty closely especially in the principal incidents yet palemon is a poor copy of boaz and lavinia is less captivating than ruth  but i shall quote mr thomsons poetical paraphrase  for it is little more  that the reader may compare it with the original  the lovely young lavinia once had friends and fortune smiled deceitful on her birth for in her helpless years deprived of all of every stay save innocence and heaven she with her widowed mother feeble old and poor lived in a cottage far retired among the windings of a woody vale by solitude and deep surrounding shades but more by bashful modesty concealed together thus they shunned the cruel scorn which virtue sunk to poverty would meet from

the dew wets its leaves unstained and pure as is the lily or the mountain snow the modest virtues mingled in her eyes still on the ground dejected darting all their humid beams into the blooming flowers or when the mournful tale her mother told of what her faithless fortune promised once thrilled in her thought they like the dewy star of evening shone in tears a native grace sat fairproportiond on her polished limbs veiled in a simple robe their best attire beyond the pomp of dress for loveliness needs not the foreign aid of ornament but is when unadorned adorned the most thoughtless of beauty she was beautys self recluse amid the closeembowering woods as in the hollow breast of appenine beneath the shelter of encircling hills a myrtle rises far from human eye and breathes its balmy fragrance over the wild so flourished blooming and unseen by all the sweet lavinia till at length compelled by strong necessitys supreme command with smiling patience in her looks she went to glean palemons fields the pride of swains palemon was the generous and the rich who led the rural life in all its joy and elegance such as arcadian song transmits from ancient uncorrupted times when tyrant custom had not shackled man but free to follow nature was the mode he then his fancy with autumnal scenes amusing chanced beside his reapertrain to walk when poor lavinia drew his eye unconscious of her power and turning quick with unaffected blushes from his gaze he saw her charming but he saw not half the charms her downcast modesty concealed that very moment love and chaste desire sprung in his bosom to himself unknown for still the world prevailed and its dread laugh which scarce the firm philosopher can scorn should his heart own a gleaner in the field and thus in secret to his soul he sighed what pity that so delicate a form by beauty kindled where enlivening sense and more than vulgar goodness seem to dwell should be devoted to the rude embrace of some indecent clown she looks methinks of old acastos line and to my mind recalls that patron of my happy life from whom my liberal fortune took its rise now to the dust gone down his houses lands and once

live whom yet my fruitless search could never find romantic wish would this the daughter were when strict enquiring from herself he found she was the fame the daughter of his friend of bountiful acasto who can speak the mingled passions that surpised his heart and through his nerves in shivering transport ran then blazed his smothered flame avowed and bold and as he viewed her ardent over and

let no mans heart fail because of him thy servant will go and fight with this philistine it is very remarkable that all those personages of sacred memory whose transactions are recorded in the biographical parts of the bible have distinguished themselves for personal bravery in the most early periods of life thus moses yet a child smote the egyptian in defense of his brother and in the case before us the youth david who was even before this time so enchanting a musician as to vanquish an evil spirit by the melody of his harp commences an illustrious and warlike character all at once by subduing the man of whom whole armies were afraid in single combat this history is likewise fruitful of very fine things and favorable to the remark of a commentator there is a skill observable in the conduct of the sacred narratives rarely if ever seen in other writings and it shall he the business of this illustration to show that the chain of real circumstances relating to the duel betwixt david and goliath is from the beginning to the end from the first syllable to the last a match for any composition whatever  setting aside the matter of scripture  even in point of what the dramatists call fable and i am thus particularly earnest to display in this work the literary excellence of the holy bible because i have reason to apprehend it is too frequently laid by under a notion of its being a dull dry and unentertaining system whereas the fact is quite otherwise it contains all that can be wished by the truest intellectual taste it enters more sagaciously and more deeply into human nature it developes character delineates manner charms the imagination and warms the heart more effectually than any other book extant and if once a man would take it into his hand without that strange prejudicing idea of its flatness and be willing to be pleased i am morally certain he would find all his favorite authors dwindle in the comparison and conclude that he was not only reading the most religious but the most entertaining book in the world  it is my present design therefore to display the story now under consideration as a performance written with the greatest art and managed with the most masterly judgment this will best be done by selecting from the whole matter particular passages and making a few comments thereupon  the very exordium of the story presents us with an image that prepares us for something extraordinary  saul and the men of israel were gathered together and pitched by the valley of elah and set the battle in array against the philistines and the philistines stood on a mountain on the one side and israel stood on a mountain on the other and there was a valley between them fancy herself could not have imagined any thing more picturesque nor could any martial skill have made a more aweful arrangement the next circumstance is as interesting as unexpected and there went out a champion out of the camp of the philistines named goliath of gath the description of this man is every way suited to alarm and i will be bold to say far transcends in equipment the heroes of homer himself i submit it to all the poetical enthusiasts his height was six cubits and a span he had an helment of brass upon his head and was armed with a coat of mail and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekles of brass i must here interrupt the narrative to observe with what skill we are told of the strength of goliath it is not mentioned in the ordinary way by a recital of his former achievements but it is implied by the prodigious burden he was able to bear upon his back for besides that the head of his spear weighed six hundred shekles of iron the weight of his coat was five thousand shekles of brass but to go on  and he had greaves of brass upon his legs and a target of brass between his shoulders and the staff of his spear was like a weavers beam and his spears head weighed six hundred shekles of iron and one bearing a shield went before him the terror and consternation with which this gigantic appearance must strike the spectators is much easier conceived than it can be described all must have been suspense and silent agitation  the israelites must look at the man of gath with dismay and the philistines must have viewed their warrior as the tremendous tower of their strength his address to the armies of the adverse party could only serve to heighten their apprehensions for he defied the whole force of israel and thirsted for war as if it were an appetite in him give me a man said he give me a man that we may fight together what a sanguinary sentence it smacks of blood and of dispatch it shows at once an eagerness to destroy and to seize a second victim even saul was daunted at the challenge and in all the tribes of embattled israel amongst which were the brothers of david there could not be found a man to accept it the unrivalled philistine in all the arrogance of superiority and triumph repeated the challenge morning and evening for forty days  about this time young david was dispatched by his father jesse to carry provisions to his brethren in the camp for this office he was called up from the pastoral employment of tendence on the flocks these he left to the care of another keeper and went as he had been commanded and he came to the trench as the armies of the host were going forth to the fight and were shouting for the battle for israel and the philistines had put the battle in array army against army  the stripling could not have arrived in a more critical time nor at any more likely to awake in him the sparks of glory especially as his brethren were all engaged in the cause he had scarce finished the first salutations with his brethren before another matter fell out wonderfully well calculated to kindle the flame of honor for while he was conversing with his brethren there came up the philistine of gath again and with additional insolence announced his defiance the israelites were sore afraid and ingloriously fled davids brethren then related to him the former menaces of goliath and the promises of reward which the king offered to any man who should kill him  that the house of the conquerors father was to be free and the victor himself to have great riches and the hand of the kings daughter how finely is the nature of envy and warlike ambition touched in the conduct of davids brother when the lad first showed the dawnings of his spirit and this is carried still higher when saul himself expresses afterward the jealousy of his heart at his being called only the slayer of thousands while to davids arm the women ascribed victory over tens of thousands but of this in its place some strokes of emulation there were in davids discourse which soon reached the ear of the general and which procured him an immediate interview courage is no respecter of persons the young man is represented as speaking to saul with even more intrepidity than he spoke to his brethren in the first part of his conversation he addresses him upon the subject with all the ardour of a glowing and independent spirit he said let no mans heart fail him because of this goliath thy servant will go and fight with the philistine modest but glorious thy servant will at least go and fight with this presumptuous boaster it was natural for saul to treat this offer at first as a sally of juvenile spirit laudable enough but nothing effectual and his reply to it must have been delivered smilingly thou child thou art not able to go against this philistine to fight with him for thou art but a youth though a brave one and he a man of war from his youth  from his very infancy trained to the knowledge and exercise of arms the modesty brevity and conciseness with which our young hero asserts his pretensions to success from this engagement is inconceivably pretty and attracting  thy servant kept his fathers sheep and there came a lion and a bear and took a lamb out of the flock  and i went out after him and smote him and delivered the lamb out of his mouth and when he arose again i caught him by his beard and smote him and flew him  thy servant slew both the lion and the bear and this uncircumcised philistine shall be one of them seeing he has defied the armies of the living god  the lord that delivered me out of the paw of the lion and out of the paw of the bear he will deliver me also out of the hand of this philistine this gallant and modest address attended as it is with every prepossessing circumstance bears some resemblance to the story of young norval in the tragedy of douglas when he displays his heroic spirit and is first admitted into the presence of lord and lady randolph perhaps the author really had the bravery of the conqueror of goliak in his eye which is the more likely as an intitimate acquaintance with the scriptures and no doubt a veneration for them was in the way of mr humes professional studies at any rate the speech will read extremely well after that of the stripling david whether it be intended or accidental the resemblance is striking  my name is norval on the grampian hills my father feeds his flocks a frugal swain whose constant cares were to increase his store and keep his only son myself at home for i had heard of battles and i longed to follow to the field some warlike lord and heaven soon granted what my sire denied this moon which rose last night round as my shield had not yet filled her horns when by her light a band of fierce barbarians from the hills rushed like a torrent down upon the vale sweeping our flocks and herds the shepherds fled for safety and for succor i alone with bended bow and quiver full of arrows hovered about the enemy and marked the road he took then hasted to my friends whom with a troop of fifty chosen men i met advancing the pursuit i led till we oertook the spoilencumberd foe we fought and conquered ere a sword was drawn an arrow from my bow had pierced their chief who wore that day the arms which now i wear retiring home in triumph i disdained the shepherds slothful life and having heard that our good king hard summoned his bold peers to lead their warriors to the carron side i left my fathers house and took with me a chosen servant to conduct my steps  yon trembling coward who forsook his master journeying with this intent i past these towers and heavendirected came this day to do the happy deed that gilds my humble name    saul was so charmed with his bravery and herioc sentiments that he began already to hope something from his efforts insomuch that he said go my lad and the lord go with thee but the preparatory ceremony which succeeded this commission is most beautiful indeed delighted with his generous ambition saul with his own hand and acoutrements equipped david for the battle he put an helmet of brass upon his head and defended his body with a coat of mail then girding his sword upon his armor he assayed to go  but  touched by some secret inspiration  he again divested himself of the armor and putting only five smooth stones out of the brook he took his staff his scrip and his sling and thus like a shepherd drew near to the philistine there is great imagery in the following verses  and the philistine came on and the man that bare the shield went before him and when the philistine looked about and saw david he disdained him disdained is perhaps the only word in this language that could have been used properly on this occasion there was so palpable a difference between the combatants and the superiority and strength evidently lay so much on the side of goliath that he disdained to fight with him very naturally thinking him no object of his spear for david had every personal advantage being a lad of a ruddy and fair countenance  it never entered into the imagination of the philistine that the battle was not always to the strong nor the race to the swift the ideas of a more powerful providence were swallowed up in the vanity of his own vigor and yet that vanity was somewhat piqued when he beheld our daring youth meet him only with a stick and a string am i a dog that thou come to me with staves this soon exasperated him and he cursed david by his own gods whoever examines the scriptures will find the nicest preservation of character each delicately descriminated and so admirably contrasted that nothing which marks one is given heterogenously to another this has also been considered among the first excellencies of composition its beauty is manifested in shakespeare much but in the bible more an instance of this is before us we never once lose sight of the savage audacity of goliath from his first menace to his death  he speaks but little but every word seems to fall from the lip of a giant when david persists in his resolution to fight he said come to me and i will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air and to the beasts of the field the dependence of david was upon his god and in such confidence he returned the threat of goliath with additional fury this day will the lord deliver thee into my hand and i will smite thee and take thine head from thee that all the earth may know there is a god in israel and all this assembly shall know that the lord saves not with the sword and spear for the battle is the lords and he will give you into our hands they engaged and the prophesy of the young warrior was fulfilled the power of the divine assistance which can make all human strength more feeble than the sinews of the newborn babe is nobly illustrated in the death of goliath which notwithstanding all appearances was effected by a stone ejected by a very boy from a sling but the account itself is well worth reciting  and it came to pass when the philistine arose and came and drew nigh to meet david that david hasted and ran toward the army to meet the philistine and david put his hand in his bag and took thence a stone and slang it and smote the philistine in his forehead that the stone sunk into his forehead and he fell upon his face unto the earth  then he ran and stood upon the philistine and took the sword of goliath and drew it out of the sheath and slew him and cut off his head therewith and when the philistines saw their champion was dead they fled  by such means was the victory completed and thus fell that terror to the israelitish bands goliath of gath  having gone through the most important parts of this interesting duel we have leisure for a few supplemental reflections in the way of literary criticism this goliath of gath reminds one of homers ajax and indeed the process of the engagement between the giant and david is in many particulars like the ceremony of the single combat of telamon and hector the above description of goliahs person and warlike preparations are more military and formidable than the hero of homer let the foregoing character of the giant of gath be compared with what follows now ajax braced his dazzling armor on sheathed in bright steel the giant warrior shone he moves to combat with majestic pace so stalks in arms the grizly god of thrace thus marched the chief tremendous as a god grimly he smiled earth trembled as he strode his massey javelin quivering in his hand he stood the bulwark of the grecian band through every argive heart new transport ran all troy stood trembling at the mighty man even hector paused and with new doubt oppressed felt his great heart suspended in his breast scarce any part of this description nor of its original will bear bringing near that of the giant warrior of the scripture his moving with majestic pace to combat is less terrific than goliahs triumphant march in the full view of the astonished philistines there seems also less propriety in hectors pause of fear than in the inapprehensive and intrepid conduct of david who though not practiced like hector from right to left the dextrous lance to wield and bear thick battle on his sounding shield was nevertheless uniformly brave and heroic to the very heart without ever finding that heroism suspended even at the presence of goliath all troy might indeed be supposed to tremble at the mighty son of telamon in the same manner as saul and the tribes of embattled israel trembled before the arrogant philistine but for hectors heart to fail him though but for a moment was surely such a falling off from the idea we wish to entertain of that celebrated hero that one is almost angry with homer for doing our favorite so palpable an injury in the tenderest and brightest part of his character it may be urged indeed that david had confidence in his god and that his bravery emanated from inspiration an argument very similar may be brought in favor of the trojan hero who as we are to believe certainly trusted as much in the virtue of his cause and the goodness of his god as the other nor did the poet ever suffer him to go to the battle till those deities were first supplicated witness the address offered up on the very occasion of the contest with ajax  oh father of mankind superior lord on lofty idas holy hill adored who in the highest heaven has fixed thy throne supreme of gods unbounded and alone grant thou etc the shield of ajax is however more particularly described than the shield of goliath stern telamon behind his ample shield as from a brazen tower oerlookd the field huge was its orb with seven thick folds overcast of tough bullhides of solid brass the last but the circumstantial account of the giants spear the weight of its head his greaves of brass and his target his coat of mail and his massey helmet are all such evidences of his astonishing strength and apparently invincible vigor that without any parade or superfluity of words they give us the exact image of the savage who called out in an exclamation worthy of him give me a man give me a man that we may fight together  but if indeed we expect in any performance to find a character delineated with parallel force  if we wish to read any description like goliath of gath we must search for it in the writings of one whose inspiration was chiefly drawn from the sources of sacred composition milton drank at the fountainhead and his poetry flowed  from siloas brook fast by the oracle of god   the sublimity with which he has drawn satan when  front to front he stood in terrible array is such a piece of poetry and exhibits such an assemblage of grand images as nothing but a genius altogether illimitable could possibly furnish long quotations however not coming within the design or compass of this work i shall only present such lines as show the prince of darkness not very unlike  in point of warlike preparation and personal appearance  to the giant who was subdued by the youth david and with these verses we will close the essay   before the cloudy van on the rough edge of battle ever it joined satan with vast and haughty strides advanced came towering armed in adamant and gold  then on the heads of foes main promontories flung which in the air came shadowing long time in evil scale the battle hung  like a god he seemed stood he or moved in stature motion arms now waved his fiery sword and in the air made horrid circles a broad sun his shield while expectation stood in horror essay xxvi story of elijah and the widow of zarephath passage  and she said as the lord thy god lives i have not a cake but a handful of meal in a barrel and a little oil in a cruse this passage is pregnant with pleasing illustrations being taken from a story inferior to few if any in sacred composition for it not only abounds with most agreeable incidents but furnishes a striking and conspicuous moral the virtue of gratitude is very emphatically illustrated on the one hand and the duty of hospitality on the other nor has it escaped indeed the remark of several writers but the scriptures as i have before had occasion to observe are treasuries affording inexhausted novelty to their admirers  the persons particularly concerned in this sacred drama are elijah the prophet and a poor widowwoman who lived by very hard and constant labor so hard indeed that she was obliged to pick her faggot to light her fire before she could bake the bread which that labor had gleaned at the time of her first meeting with elijah she was more than usually straightened for her whole stock consisted of a handful of meal and a little oil and she was then stooping in search of a few sticks to dress this scanty modicum to preserve from death herself and her son yet this was the critical period  even while she was thus affectionately employed  this was the moment marked out by providence to try the strength of her sympathy it was alas no time to bestow while her bounty was thus circumscribed nor was it a fit season to show the natural courtesy of her temper when she was exerting her last efforts in relief of her child and wanted in the sorest degree the ordinary accommodations of life herself under this pressure of her circumstances it is worth while to see how she conducted herself when elijah the prophet who figures so splendidly in sacred history foretold that a divine punishment should alight upon ahab a man who is represented as wicked and illdisposed above all that were before him then to escape that resentment which his prophecy had kindled against him in the breast of ahab he hid himself by the brook cherith where the ravens were commanded to cater for his support while the brook supplied him with drink the resource of the stream however soon failing he again sought shelter elsewhere and removed to zarephath where he no sooner arrived than he beheld this widowwoman engaged as before described in gathering sticks and he immediately called to her and requested her to fetch him a little water in a vessel this was not unreasonable but did not he render it somewhat so when he again called her back as she was hastening to oblige him to desire she would bring a morsel of bread likewise in her hand a morsel of bread and a little water was to be sure asking the favor in as decent language as could be but in this poor womans particular situation it must have had a very important sound there is a most beautiful display of her charitable heart in her answer  as the lord thy god lives i have not a cake but a handful of meal in a barrel and a little oil in a cruse and behold i am gathering two sticks that i may go in and dress it for me and my son that we may eat it and die as if she had said you see my stock stranger  it is my very last meal  i am picking two sticks that i may lay my poor meal across and then  as all further resources fail  my child and i will die in the arms of one another then it was that elijah bid her not fear for that the barrel of meal should not waste nor the cruse of oil fail unto the day that the lord sends rain upon the face of the earth and this he assured her was the sentiment of god himself now had this woman been inclined to save her meal and oil to herself  had she been swayed or indeed ought influenced by that powerful selflove which has so general an ascendency in the human breast or had she even yielded to the force of those prudent maxims which teach that charity begins at home and that selfpreservation is natures first law how easily might she have evaded this request nay what a swarm of right sound apologies presented themselves for a fair denial to the reasons already urged she might had she been a woman of the world have added many others such as the expecting condition in which she left her halffamished child  her own extreme hunger and the piety of preserving herself and her little one as long as she could possibly find the smallest means of subsistence that to die while yet a meal remained would be a kind of suicide and to give a morsel from any part of her own family when a morsel was all that was left for the support of two would be a prodigality for which she ought to suffer the poverty that must inevitably result from it as to its being as he said the command of the almighty she might reasonably offer a doubt as to the truth of that particular is there not  she might reply  is there not something of inconsistency good stranger in this part of your story that we should assist one another is i know a social and a religious duty but this must be where plenty or at least competence presents us with the delightful power  it is not indeed surprising that i being the first person you have seen should be the first addressed on this occasion because i know hunger catches at the slightest and nearest possibilities but excuse me if i think the matter of the promised miracles not a little problematical would god have directed your application to a poor defenseless widowwoman who has a fatherless child to toil for and is now laboring in the last exigency  would he have said  let her divide her all with you would he who knows human nature so intimately and who never expects us to injure ourselves on any score whatever  would he have me listen to that which sounds so like the trick of a needy traveller and shall i credulously give my staff from my hand in expectation of another dropping down from heaven  no  friend  i understand something of this world and though i admire to do good i must not expose myself to ridicule  for if i was to comply with your request tell me honestly would thou not laugh at my weakness farewell then and be assured i lament my inability as much as thou lamentest thy necessity  having thus shown what a very cautious woman might have said let us now see what was really the sentiment of the occasion there is no other answer recorded than that she did according to the desire of elijah she did not even stay to expatiate upon her own generosity  nor tell him that if his prophecy should be unfulfilled she must only starve so much the sooner for her good nature but she relied so implicity on his sincerity and obeyed so willingly the inspired impulse of benevolence that she hasted to make a little cake for elijah first and then attended to the wants of her little one and herself but this courtesy and confidence was preternaturally rewarded for she and he and her house eat many days and the barrel of meal wasted not nor did the cruse of oil fail  elijah now became a lodger in the widows house and was considered as a part of her family till a suspicious circumstance fell out which gave her at first but too much reason to alter her opinion of him soon after this friendship was formed between them the son of the hostess fell sick and his sickness was of so sore a nature that it presently terminated in his death the unhappy mother attributed it to some secret exertion of cruel power in elijah for as he could divine one miracle in her favor so she apprehended he might be able to effect another to her prejudice however certain it is she entertained ideas exceedingly to his discredit and indeed esteemed the thing so very ungrateful a return for her fair conduct and demeanor that we find her reproaching him with all the severity of an illintreated friend and all the distraction of an injured parent what have i do with thee  thou man of god art thou come unto me to call my sin to my remembrance and to slay my son this appears to have been spoken with the utmost bitterness of irony as if she had said  thou man who pretendedst to have been directed hither by the express orders of god  thou messenger from the lord of heaven  what have i done unto thee that thou should thus requite me  do thou do this to warn me how i share again my last meal with a stranger true it is that thou have in one instance been found faithful true that thou have prolonged the lives which seemed to be drawing sooner to a period but what of that  have thou taken this opportunity to render the mourning of the widow thus additionally sore by first conveying to her the joyful tidings of plenty only to make the afterstroke the more intolerable by slaying her dear and only darling even him whom the famine has spared inhuman shame upon thee for this  shall the widows curse pursue thee for ever for this  but i cannot speak behold the innocent victim of your barbarity  behold  my child is breathless before you  alas my son  my son how have thou been sacrificed to the insidiousness of a stranger it was highly in character to reprove him in this manner and it is equally natural that the good man should feel the reproof with all imaginable severity many circumstances concurred to make him truly wretched even under such an imputation for he doubtless considered her in the tenderest degree as his best benefactor  as one who had manifested the sensibility and duty of her heart in the very crisis both of his fate and her own and lastly as a widow whose life was wrapped up in the life of her son nor could he indeed fairly blame her suspicions since the time the place and the suddeness of the lads death gave in some sort a color of probability to them her misery too had its source so near the soul that he could not attempt either to check or to chide it advice would have been rejected and pity impertinent he troubled her with neither but taking the baby corpse out of the mothers bosom where though it was dead she was still caressing and still cradling it he carried it up to his own apartment and laid him gently upon his own bed  and now being at liberty to address the god who had so often and so miraculously befriended and indulged and honored him he broke out into the most earnest supplication oh lord my god my god have thou brought evil upon the widow with whom i sojourn by slaying her son i pray thee that the childs soul may come into him again the prayer was heard in the mean time in what a situation must he have left the afflicted parent it was however one of those sorrows which are compensated by a reverse of joy the transition was almost instantaneous for when the babe began to revive he brought it down out of the chamber into the house and delivered it into the desiring arms of its weeping mother were words ever calculated to express such a stroke of transport it must have been a bliss which trod hard upon the very heels of agony parents may perhaps paint it to themselves they may see through the mirror of a sympathetic fancy the poor widow receiving her child from the healing hand of the prophet  a child fresh blooming in the beauties of a second birth  they may imagine they behold the joyful woman as it were in a frenzy of felicity kneeling first to the invisible restorer then to elijah and last bathing the cheek of the child with tears of tenderness unutterable the prophet indeed said little for language was unnecessary the thing spoke for itself the lovely eye was again gently opened on the light the dimple resumed its residence and all its little sensibilities were fully restored see cried elijah  thy son lives he submitted the truth of the assertion without any tedious explanation of the means by which the recovery had been effected to the pleasing evidence of her own senses he had now fully rewarded her former kindness and evinced his gratitude for the division of her last meal by raising the treasure of her soul even from the dead i shall say no more on this charming story but just observe that every gentle heart will have its own commentary and pursue the hints i have given till they have long indulged themselves in the elegant reflection which so masterly and interesting a scene excites  essay xxvii character of solomon passage  and judah and israel dwelt safely every man under his vine and under his fig tree from dan even to beersheba all the days of solomon there is perhaps as much moral sense and literary beauty comprised in this passage as ever was conveyed to the human understanding by the hand of tradition what a paradisaical picture does it give us of the reign of solomon majesty and mildness power and pleasure seem to have been the grand supporters of his throne and we read the history of his times with a mixture of joy and admiration  the very first instance of his wisdom gave to mankind the most delightful earnest of what might be expected from him i speak of his judgment betwixt the two harlots how finely did he distinguish the simplicity of natural sorrow from the whineing complaint of adventitious woe he saw the real parent in her fears her wishes and her tears and he detected the imposture by every action the beginning of the reign exhibits this illustrious heir of the noble david in all the glory of sublunary greatness for he had dominion over all the region on this side the river from tiphshah even to azzah over all the kings on this side the river and in the midst of so extensive an authority he maintained peace on all sides around him every man dwelt safely under his vine and under his fig tree from one end of his realms to the other from dan even to beersheba  what a prospect was here for the people what a joyful promise for the public heart but with what energy  i had almost said  enchantment  is the disposition of this prince characterized in the subsequent verse  and god gave solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much and largeness of heart even as the sand that is on the seashore  he had it seems not only the greatest wealth but the nicest judgment and the noblest inclination to distribute that wealth to make it conducive to general felicity he equalled his father in his poetical capacity and even surpassed him as a moralist his songs are marked by an enthusiasm a tenderness and a pathos in which all the treasures of the warmest gayest and sublimest imagination appear to have been exhausted image and metaphor were equally at his command and a genius so etherial is sometimes discovered in these sallies of his pen that his conception takes a flight too lofty for the eye to reach him but however amazing the powers of his fancy they were at least equalled by the graver abilities of his judgment he by no means figured less as a moral writer for his proverbs are a collection of concise maxims which stand altogether unrivalled and are the foundation of all those short multitudinous remarks which have been issued from the press since his time but those of solomon will indeed be ever separated from all others such knowledge of life such various beauty in the expression  such astonishing terseness in the style  such poignancy in the satire  such purity in the phrase and such solidity in the sense entitled their author to the immortality which he claims and which he possesses  there seems to have been a epoch in his genius his compositions present us with a climax from the poet he rises to the moralist and from the moralist he soars to the divine the book of ecclesiastes is one of the finest systems or bodies of divinity every sentence is sound and orthodox his observations are accurate and devotional and the whole book well becomes the preacher and the pulpit in a word solomon was the greatest and most general literary character that ever wrote as a prince he was amiable beloved and popular and it is impossible to give a more pleasing assurance of it than the pacific and tranquil idea suggested by the text every man dwelt in safety under his own vine and fig tree even all the days of solomon it is somewhat painful to view him in a religious light ah solomon thou wisest of the wise  how could thou at any time forget the power who had dealt by thee in so liberal a manner eminent alike in intellect and in magnificence how could thou so stain thy annals as to turn aside from the author of all thy greatness how could thou so disgrace  so prostitute the splendor of that temple which thou had reared and dedicated to the true god to the dreams and weaknesses of idolatry what alas could the visionary goddess of the zidonians do for thee what could molech or ashtoreth that deserved thy devotion or sacrifices could they inspire thee with intelligence above all others and store thy mind with all the ornaments of taste and science and elegance and joy  one apology however not a little mitigating presents itself he did not yield to this infatuation till he was in the decline of life  possibly when his faculties were somewhat impaired  and when the ill advice of those who were about him especially his eoncubines teazed him into error the power of a bad woman who has any hold upon the heart is unlimited and will generally render pliable to its purposes not only the finest head but the finest heart and it must be also remembered that the strength of the tender passions is always in proportion to the strength of the genius so that soloman might be led as it were captive in the bonds of love and sacrifice to chemosh not because he venerated that imaginary deity but to avoid the persecution of the female party which was formed against his religious integrity at all events let us not be too rigid to degrade so great a character it is well known that the wisest men are the most frequently seduced into the weakest trespasses with all his sagacity solomon was a human creature great sensibility is liable to great mistake where we cannot defend his conduct let us avoid it and where we are struck with the splendor of his capacity let it inspire us with a modest imitation  essay xxviii concluding strictures on scriptural sublimity and beauty passage  we was honored in the midst of the people in his coming out of the sanctuary the elegant mr burke treatise on the sublime and beautiful  with his usual ingenuity observes that magnificence is a source of the sublime after commenting upon which he proceeds to illustrate his precepts by suitable examples amongst which is that of the above passage and those others succeeding it which belong to the description it was with great propriety he fixed upon this noble panegyric on the high priest simon the son of onias as a specimen of scriptural sublimity in the richness of imagery and allusion but i cannot agree with him in thinking that sublimity arises from a profusion of those images in which the mind is so dazzled as to make it impossible to attend to that exact coherence and agreement of the allusions which we should require on every other occasion with due deference to mr burke i will venture to say that most of the allusions are exact and coherent the proof is before us read the whole description  how was he honored in the midst of the people in his coming out of the sanctuary he was as the morning star in the midst of a cloud and as the moon at the full as the sun shining upon the temple of the most high and as the rainbow gives light in the bright clouds and as the flower of roses in the spring of the year as lilies by the rivers of waters and as the frankincensetree in summer as fire and incense in the censer and as a vessel of gold set with precious stones as a fair olive tree budding forth fruit and as a cypress which grows up to the clouds  when he put on the robe of honor and was clothed with the perfection of glory when he went up to the holy altar he made the garment of holiness honorable he himself stood by the hearth of the altar compassed with his brethren round about as a young cedar in libanus and as palm trees compassed they him about so were all the sons of aaron in their glory and the oblations of the lord in their hands etc  it was the intention of the son of sirach in these sentences to set forth his object with all the advantages of language poetry and oratory were equally solicited to animate and to adorn the portrait of the priest in consequence of which he is attended from the sanctuary to the altar by all the images and instruments of the sublime and beautiful behold him thus surrounded  examine the whole scene as it passes before your eye and you will pronounce it uniformly admirable he is described as coming out of the sanctuary amidst the acclamations of the people the word honored is a most dignified addition to the greatness of his character  let us for a moment leave out this single word and see how the idea diminishes he was in the midst of the people in his coming out of the sanctuary how poor restore to the sentence its full compliment and the design of the writer as well as the excellence of the object is complete he was honored in the very midst of the people the next allusion carries him higher still he was as the morning star in the midst of a cloud no sooner was he out of the sanctuary than his noble and majestic figure was distinguishable from the rest of the multitude as the morning star in the midst of a cloud the allusion to the cloud has also the advantage of a double propriety being in a metaphorical sense aptly designed to represent the thickness and dusky appearance of the admiring multitude some of the succeeding allusions were admitted to give the high priest the qualities of amiableness as well as grandeur he was as the flower of roses in the spring of the year as lilies by the rivers of waters and as the frankincensetree in summer all these are expressive rather of loveliness than magnificence and are connected rather with the beautiful than with the sublime yet mark how they are heightened and what superior attractions they possess by certain delicate strokes not to be seen in the ordinary sketches of common poets these would have thought it sufficient to have compared him to roses lilies and the frankincensetree not so the son of sirach he painted the son of onias with more exquisite coloring  he drew him with a more masterly pencil the roses to which he was compared were the roses of the spring a season of the year when those flowers are more particularly sweet and captivating  the lilies which in a fugurative sense resembled him were those which derived more elegance from their situation by the rivers of waters and whatever perfumes belong to the frankincensetree our poet presented it to us in the pride of summer when its beauties would naturally be in blossom besides this there appears a coherence in these allusions which may escape us at first they seem to aim at the display of the moral character of the high priest a good name says the scripture smells sweet how proper therefore is simon compared to the fragrance of roses and other odoriferous shrubs lilies have ever been emblematic of innocence and purity the agreement of the allusion is therefore exact here also thus might i proceed to observe the moral as well as descriptive propriety of comparing him with the rest but it is wholly unnecessary the abrupt and animated transition from one image to another in this description are so many noble instances of the sublime and beautiful what a divine glow and what incomparable dignity is offered to us in the following passage where the figures are changed and the allusions altered in a moment when he put on the robe of honor and was clothed with the perfection of glory when he went up to the holy altar he made the garment of holiness honorable  had longinus been now to revise his golden treatise he would assuredly have inserted this passage amongst his examples of the genuine sublime because it boasts of every property which agreeable to his own definition belongs thereto  that says he is grand and lofty which the more we consider the greater ideas we conceive of it whose force we cannot possibly withstand which immediately finks deep and makes such impressions on the mind as cannot easily be worn out or effaced never were these precepts better illustrated than by the description of simon the son of onias the more we consider him the greater is our conception of his grandeur his virtue and the veneration which attends it from the time that he issues from the sanctuary amidst the honors of the people to his standing by the altar compassed by his brethren he rises upon us with a force and a superiority which cannot possibly be withstood and which makes upon the mind an indelible impression in vain shall we look amongst other poets and orators for a rival description so excellent throughout  mr burke all furnished all in arms all plumed like ostriches that with the wind baited like eagles having lately bathed as full of spirits as the month of may as gorgeous as the sun in midsummer wanton as youthful goats wild as young bulls i saw young harry with his beaver on rise from the ground like feathered mercury and vaulted with such ease into his seat as if an angel dropped from the clouds to turn and wind a fiery pagasus  indeed has brought one from an author shakespeare the most likely to furnish it but although some of the allusion may be equal others are very much inferior and taken upon the whole cannot bear the brightness of the comparison  i have already observed that the descriptions of ossian breathe sometimes a sublimity truly scriptural and i have already in a former essay given an instance  but as was before noted when parallel passages are produced by way of comparison from the scriptures the pictures of the author of fingal are only in shadow and must ever stand in the back ground of criticism the following allusions would be very capital if the imagination of the reader had not been previously charmed by those which have been the subject of our present essay  far before the rest the son of ossian comes bright in the smiles of youth fair as the first beams of the sun his long hair waves on his back his dark brow is half hid beneath his helmet the sword hangs loose on the heros side and his spear glitters as he moves i fled from his terrible eye this is interesting warm and warlike but i again refer every reader of taste to the text the sacred penmen surpass all writers generally speaking in point of figure sentiment allusion narration and every other property of perfect composition distributed up and down the old and new testament there a thousand passages more than i have now leisure to contemplate which utterly annihilate any thing that can be brought from the stores of ancient or modern learning  i conclude these little sketches which are only intended as an introduction to more with the selection of a few passages from different parts of those most admirable volumes  o lord my god thou art very great thou art clothed with honor and majesty who coverest thyself with light as with a garment who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain who lays the beams of his chambers in the waters who makes the clouds his chariot who walks upon the wings of the wind thou coveredst it with the deep as with a garment the waters stood above the mountains  at thy rebuke they fled at the voice of thy thunder they hasted away  what inexpressible sublimity in every one of these thoughts and with how much accuracy the diction is adapted to display them what ideas can exceed those of the deitys covering himself in a mantle of light mounting his cloudy chariot and walking on the wings of the wind  the ascending series is in this passage very judiciously preserved the whole sentiment is a glorious gradation from great to greater and from that to the last positive degree of the climax i beg the reader to mark the rise of the expressions as he repeats them there is also a particular beauty here in the sudden transition from one person to another  who walks upon the wings of the wind and then instantly altering the address to  thou coveredst it with a deep as with a garment  but a second example courts our admiration and that of so high and exalted a nature that a reader of true taste and a real sense of religion will hardly bear to engage his time in looking at minor or modern authors while some probably who have been prejudiced against the bible will be surprised to find such admirable and unequalled writing in a book which they have been taught to consider as a dull uninteresting code of maxims proverbs and ordinary sentiments  whither shall i go from thy spirit or whither shall i flee from thy presence if i ascend up into heaven thou art there if i make my bed in hell behold thou art there if i take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea even there shall thy hand lead me and thy right hand shall hold me if i say surely the darkness shall cover me even the night shall be light about me yea the darkness hides not from thee but the night shines as the day the darkness and the light are both alike to thee in short this and various other portions of the sacred books as infinitely exceed homer as homer surpasses blackmore there is a verse or two used in the burial of the dead than which there never was a sublimer more serious or more suitable ceremony ossian has also touched the same subject but the sacred writer has ten times the simplicity and is abundantly more correct in the metaphors besides that the allusions are truer to nature and familiar life  a thousand years in thy fight o lord are but as yesterday seeing that is past as a watch in the night as soon as thou scatterest them they are even as a sleep and fade away suddenly like the grass in the morning it is green and grows up but in the evening it is cut down dried up and withered  were we to run the parallel between this passage and that quoted from ossian the inferiority of the latter would perhaps not be very agreeable to the admirers of that picturesque bard to speak impartially it is scarcely giving any profane writers however popular fair play in comparing them with those sublime beautiful and pathetic compositions which are the objects of the present volumes on the other hand those compositions themselves have so seldom fair play shown to them while many flimsy frivolous or bombastic performances run away with the huzza of the multitude that having had the lash of justice in hand it was but right to use it a little especially as it formed an important part of my subject to vindicate the scriptures from negligence and to hold them up as the patterns of purity perspicuity and all the sources of the true sublime  these sources branch out according to longinus into the following divisions  i the first and most excellent of these is a boldness and grandeur in the thoughts  ii the second is called the pathetic or the power of raising the passions to a violent and even enthusiastic degree and these two being genuine constituents of the sublime are the gifts of nature whereas the other sorts depend in some measure upon art  iii the third consists in a skilful application of figures which are twofold of sentiment and language  iv the fourth is a noble and graceful manner of expression which is not only to choose out significant and elegant words but also to adorn and embellish the style by the assistance of tropes  v the fifth source of the sublime which completes all the preceding is the structure or composition of all the periods in all possible dignity and grandeur  it has been my endeavor in this work to try certain passages in the sacred writings by the test of longinuss principles i shall account myself singularly fortunate if such endeavors have in any degree done a service to compositions which are so able to support the trial but whose beauties and sublimities though thickly scattered through almost every page are so shamefully neglected or misunderstood merely it is feared because they are of a devotional as well as of a poetical nature  the end
