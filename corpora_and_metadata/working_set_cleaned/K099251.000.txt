the judge hannah bananah cousin to louisa quacou quashy and caesar slaves scene an island in the west indies  the new cosmetic or the triumph of beauty act i scene a planters estate on the island near a mill and a piece of canes enter whitmore and lovemore whitmore so my dear charles you are at length after a passage of five weeks three days and odd hours arrived in our little sunburned island   lovemore nothing i will assure you whitmore would have brought me on this side the atlantic but my unconquerable passion for the adorable louisa winstone   whitmore miss winstone sir has been long the belle of this island and has been the occasion i already hear of much envy among the ladies and as much passion among the gentlemen but could you obtain nothing more desirable at home that you must needs neglect an albion flower for a poor drooping antigua blossom   lovemore dont dishonor my louisa by any odious comparison before she left england she carried the rose in her cheeks the rainbow in her forehead lightning in her eyes with grace innocence and elegance in her whole frame   whitmore hush hush man dont be over extravagant i grant miss winstone might have possessed all you say upon her first arrival here but you do not know how soon every thing fades in this climate for my own part i cannot say much for her complexion   lovemore her complexion sir i grant you may be a little tanned but i am sure her features ever must remain beautiful my dear whitmore i am impatient to see her conduct me therefore to her fathers wherever it is   whitmore it is just by but i am so engaged with plantation business that i am afraid i shall hardly be able to spare a minute from the toils of the crop however sir not to baulk so passionate a lover i will mount you on the best steed i have and follow you like a true squire on the best mule or jack ass on the whole estate but pray sir would you not choose a draught of punch after your hot ride from town it is the custom here always to have the bowl in readiness here caesar caesar   caesar coming massah   whitmore but pray sir what impression do you receive from the scenes about you in this part of the world   lovemore why truly i am at a loss to explain them but they are upon the whole very strange as i journeyed through the different estates i heard as i thought nothing but the cracking and bouncing of fire works but was very soon convinced that the noise proceeded from the smacks of the whips and the correction which is daily and hourly inflicted on the slaves   whitmore indeed sir i am sorry to say it but we are obliged to put the whip to a slave as we do a match to powder in order to get it to act at all caesar i say caesar   caesar coming massah coming yawning   lovemore how slow the fellow is yawning   whitmore every thing sir is slow in this climate the horses are slow the cattle slow mules slow in short a general sloth hangs upon every thing caesar caesar caesar bawling hastily  cesar yawns rubs his eyes and produces the bowl of punch what sir were you asleep stupor hangs as naturally upon the dog as mist upon the mountains my service to you sir drinks and hands it to lovemore   lovemore pleasant liquor in troth drinks again   whitmore aye dont drink too much of it though for it may play the devil with you till you are better used to the climate here mr caesar take it away and saddle the young english horse for this gentleman and my managers mule for me do you hear   caesar yes massah me bring um up directly   whitmore if possible do so but i am afraid you will require another nap first exit caesar   lovemore i should conceive it sir a very laborious and painful employment to have the inspection of a gang of slaves have there been no efforts made to raise them above their brutal state and to inspire them with the sentiments of man   whitmore yes sir there was one man mad enough to make the attempt but it was very speedily found that as the slaves of his own estate improved in intellectual discernment their corporeal faculties relaxed so that the other gentlemen of the island by woeful experience very soon dropped their liberal sentiments and hung the dead weight of ignorance again about them   lovemore ignorance undoubtedly is the true cause of slavery   whitmore that is a truth sir which we find verified every day but pray as you are so passionate an admirer of miss winstone why did you not prevent her voyage to this part of the world   lovemore why i was then sir but a minor and though miss winstone favored my addresses her father thought jack rattoon a better match for her so brought her over to marry him against her consent   whitmore very true sir i recollect the whole affair she became on her arrival the adoration of the men in general and very soon grew out of humor with jack whose face she compared to a large foursop and whose head she declared was as soft as a rotten quaver   lovemore pray sir what are the distinguishing good qualities of the ladies of this part of the world   whitmore fidelity to their husbands and tenderness to their children   lovemore the inhabitants too are in general remarked for their hospitality to strangers as well as their candor and openness to each other   whitmore they are so sir but these take their rise from the social principle of mans nature and which the want of society creates but here i see caesar has already prepared and saddled our cattle therefore like a true knight errant equip yourself at all points to meet your beauteous dulcinia   lovemore that i am already what more would you have   whitmore i will play this romantic youth a trick aside aloud why sir though it may surprise you it is a custom here whenever any gentleman pays his first visit to the lady he loves to go armed and defended with all the weapons and implements of chivalry   lovemore certainly you jest   whitmore no in faith it is an old custom derived from the spaniards to whom you know these islands first belonged   lovemore impossible   whitmore nay but it is actually so and unless you permit me to arm you like a knight errant you will not see miss winstone today   lovemore why my dear mr whitmore you will make a fool of me   whitmore a fool of you indeed i will put minervas own helmet on your head and you shall then see if you dont look as wise as a judge here caesar fetch my old helmet with the shield and sword   caesar yes massah   lovemore aside certainly this man does not mean to expose me what he says is very true this island belonged to spain and it is probable that a tincture of chivalry might have been derived from that source besides he is a west indian and tells the truth   whitmore first sir let me gird on the sword there there it is now put the shield thus and now last of all caesar fetch me the spear   caesar there massah presenting the spear   lovemore upon my word mr whitmore if i had known this was necessary i would have brought a complete suit of armor with me from england   whitmore that would not have done so well perhaps now sir look at yourself in the first glass you come to and see if you are not as warlike as jack the giantkiller   lovemore i am obliged to you though for making me so   whitmore you have nothing to do sir but to push your spear against the first rival you meet on the road   lovemore rivals sir i hope to god i shall not meet any   whitmore you will certainly meet a great many only consider the beauty and accomplishments of the lady she is always surrounded by rivals sir pray by what name do you choose to be announced to her   lovemore by my own to be sure james jeremiah lovemore esquire   whitmore pugh pugh the name of lovemore will be a disgrace to knighthood call yourself the knight of the dreadful phiz   lovemore aye any thing let us be off as fast as we can   whitmore but harkee mr knight can you ride well for if you cannot the horse will certainly throw you as you must expect he will start at the sight of a man in armor   lovemore where then is the use of armor if it exposes a man to new dangers and as for my riding sir i am by no means secure in my saddle   whitmore why then there will be an end to your knight hood if you once come to the ground but come sir our cattle are braying and i long for some new achievement   lovemore aye i wish i dont break my neck   exeunt ambo scene ii an apartment in the house of mr winstone enter louisa and hannah louisa it is very true as you say hannah what is the faith and the truth of artful men do you think i can have the assurance to hope that mr lovemore will renew his addresses especially when he sees me turned as brown as a gipsey   hannah indeed cousin winstone you deserve to be tanned as a punishment for the coquettish airs you practiced upon all the men at your first arrival aye cousin who was then so cruel as yourself   louisa it is cruel miss hannah in you to accuse me of being a coquet but girls like you who were never handsome or fair take a pleasure in seeing every one reduced to their own standard   hannah you may talk as you please miss winstone when but last week you know mr cogwil a rich manager of this island made love to me in your presence what did you do then   louisa what did i do then   hannah aye how did you look then in truth you looked miss i can tell you like a windmill stripped of its fs and not a breeze of wind to turn it round   louisa it is better madam to be without a breeze of wind than to require such cattle as mr cogwil to set one in motion   hannah i dont care for your repartees you dont recollect i suppose how you used to dance with one drop your fan for another propose some foolish errand for a third and in short ogle the red coats so much that they no doubt contributed with the rays of the sun to toast you into your present crisp and brown complexion   louisa pray cousin when were your family the family of the bananahs accounted wits that you should at this day begin to play it off upon me   hannah you need not i can tell you be so severe for though i was never at queensquare boarding school as you have been i have received as good an education as you and that though i was never off the island   louisa pray let us have done scolding and wait mr lovemores arrival here who is to be introduced to us by his acquaintance mr whitmore he may notwithstanding my charms are fled find others more durable in my mind these perhaps will be enough and bring him to my feet without the assistance of any others   hannah i wish you may find it so miss winstone but i believe he will be the first man who ever fell at the feet of a plain woman   louisa nay my dear coz did you not tell me mr cogwil fell at yours   hannah no miss he did not fall at my feet   louisa though you were so handsome   hannah nay miss if you persist in teazing i will actually complain of it to your papa for it is not to be borne   enter old winstone winstone my dear girls take care of yourselves for a man has been just seen on the borders of the estate clad in a complete suit of armor he has frightened the slaves from their work startled the mule that carried one of my overseers and been the means of putting out the fellows shoulder   hannah good gracious sir   winstone good gracious indeed it is to my thinking a most ungracious piece of business all together for gods sake take care of yourselves   louisa what can he want sir   winstone to take you both off i suppose   louisa oh i will not go with him will you cousin hannah   hannah not i go with a man in armor no no a man in nankeen or russia drab for

guard at the door for there is a great gigantic fellow coming to destroy us all   quacou and quashy lud a mercy massah exeunt ambo   louisa sir the negroes will be afraid and run away you had better arm yourself and take their place   winstone what you slut expose your old father at his years to have a spear in his guts oh what a jade   enter the negroes armed winstone now stand fast and as soon as you see a great white man covered all over with steel plates and platters present your bayonets thus   louisa sir they will not have courage   winstone they will i tell you they have both attended me to the field when i commanded the red regiment and served a campaign or two under me   hannah oh then cousin heaven defend us from the commander and his company   louisa so say i i wish we could hide somewhere if it was even with the cold meat in the larder   quacou massah quashy afraid of his right hand if he raise it against a white man   winstone one word for quashy and a hundred for yourself i see you black rascals you are frightened never mind his right hand but run your bayonets through the white mans heart see see he is coming now do your duty   enter lovemore with his spear presented the negroes present their bayonets sneak to the other end of the stage throw them down and run off winstone oh the diabolical poltroons   lovemore i see sir you dread my hostile and warlike appearance   winstone i do in faith dread sir most dreadfully   lovemore i perceive your fears but pray dismiss them i come here in quest of an angelic fair one and am astonished to find myself opposed by a couple of black rivals   winstone indeed good sir i do not understand you nor can i conceive your intention in frightening one of the islanders and two harmless young ladies in his house   lovemore what a stupid old fellow to be bred in the bowels of chivalry and not know a man in the dress of a knight   louisa are not you frightened cousin hannah   hannah oh i am like a sensitive

then i must own aloud perhaps sir you are not acquainted that i am the first man in this country   lovemore yes sir you are as great here as gulliver was amongst the lilluputians because they are all less than yourself but come over to old england the nursery of every thing good and great and you will there mr winstone be as small as the same gulliver was at broddignag   winstone i never was so talked to in my life if a slave had said that i would have stabbed him i will go this minute order the shell to be blown and you sir to be hooted off the estate as a most dangerous incendiary   exit

whitmore i hope it will for you have taken a vast deal of needless trouble ycu did not find the red and white roses in her cheeks as you expected   lovemore no they were blasted all to nothing and the poor girl herself looked like    whitmore like what   lovemore i will not tell you   whitmore how could you be so credulous as to arm yourself at all points but here comes captain greville and mr wyndham   enter greville and wyndham whitmore gentlemen your servant you are come i suppose to take a slice of the old judges turtle and a bottle or two of his claret   greville we are indeed i hope you will bear us company   whitmore that we cannot do for we are presently to be hooted off the estate but pray give me leave to introduce you both to mr lovemore a friend of mine just arrived from england mr lovemore mr wyndham and captain greville they are both knights of valor and renown and bred in the very bosom of chivalry   wyndham in conscience captain he is at his jokes again   greville he must in faith for i was born in ireland and you wyndham we all know very well was laid by your mother in a piula pear bush for the first week after her delivery in this island for it was there you first learnt to daub your cheeks with a new kind of rouge   lovemore pray gentlemen are there any remains of chivalry in this island   wyndham chivalry what is that   lovemore it is usual when a man makes love here the first time to make a fool of himself   greville god bless me i thought you knew it was a custom all over the world   lovemore is it a practice here i say for a man to clap a helmet on his head a shield on his arm and to bear a spear in his right hand when he goes to his mistress   greville no to be sure ha ha ha you must be a spaniard by the question   lovemore not at all sir but this man must be the spaniard for making such a fool of me and who do you think sir it was to see but a girl as brown as a berry   greville ha ha ha   whitmore nay sir that sir was your own fault for had i not seen your romantic inclination i shouldnt have duped you as i have done   wyndham pray was miss winstone the lady   whitmore oh yes sir she was the lady and he has just paid his vows at her feet swore constancy on her hand and is just going to get a vessel to transport her to salamancha   greville transport her to negroeland you mean i i loved the girl once when she was white but never thought of her after she became a mulatto   wyndham in faith she lost a number of lovers in a little time and myself among the number   greville yes she may go and whistle now for her beauty there is one good thing it has broke her of her coquetry she is in as bad a condition as a peacock stripped of his plumes   whitmore it is very true and the greater the pity for this poor gentleman has come quite across the atlantic to see her   greville in faith sir it was bad policy   lovemore indeed sir it was but i hope you are both men of too much honor to publish it about   wyndham oh sir you may depend upon our secrecy   greville harkee pinguin we will not lose a joke from a squeamish regard to honor we will tell it where ever we go   wyndham and harkee we must not lose the story of the armor   whitmore no tell it all for if you dont i will for you he has thrown the poor girl into tears and the helmet at my head   lovemore come mr whitmore let us be off   greville no stay sir you will find the old fellows table more agreeable than his daughter stay sir till the evening by which time you will be certain to have forgot the deluding joys of venus in a goblet or two of foaming liquor for my part i consider his house as an ordinary for the military gentlemen and old winstone merely as their landlord   wyndham i see things getting ready for dinner let us retire to the ladies captain where harkee we shall hear the whole jest out and laugh at the lover till our very sides ach   lovemore i must request you gentlemen not to listen to the misrepresentation of mr winstone whose anger is excited from the imagined slight to his daughter   greville aside you may depend upon us sir indeed that we will expose you to all the island before the sun sets   exeunt greville and wyndham whitmore hark hark i hear the shell so let us be off   shell blows lovemore to hell if you please   whitmore we are half way there for we are in the torridzone already exeunt ambo   scene iii enter louisa and hannah hannah surely you will not persist in your regard for a man who has openly insulted you before your face   louisa indeed hannah be it as it will i cannot help loving him he must have loved me sincerely or do you think he would have come across the water i thought that he perfectly looked sublime in his armor   hannah it was a pretty instance of his sublimity to insult my poor uncle as he did indeed i think him a very silly fellow cousin   louisa you are a harsh judge i would give the world to be able once more to bring him to me though the attempt i am afraid will be as fruitless as that of washing the blackamore white   hannah i could put you in a way now cousin if i chose it to make a blackamore white   louisa indeed   hannah aye indeed   louisa pray teach it me   hannah teach it you i thank you then for the confession cousin louisa   louisa the confession what confession   hannah that you are a blackamore bowing and laughing   louisa this is monstrous ill manners what can you mean by this savage behavior   hannah to make you humble cousin   greville enters and listens greville aside the ladies seem at high words i will see if i can discover what they are at   hannah do not be angry cousin louisa and i will actually put you in a way to recover your lost beauty   louisa by what means pray   hannah first tell me what return you will make me   louisa why first to endeavor to make you as beautiful as myself and next to turn all the lovers that are tiresome to me over to you where they may vow swear and protest as long as you choose   hannah what maam you would skim the cream of their affections and give me the sour milk if that is your resolution you may hunt the secret out as you can   louisa the secret how should a girl who has spent all her days in this part of the world have any receipt for beauty i am certain hannah had you ever known this secret you would have availed yourself of it long ago but i am afraid that sweet face of yours most strongly contradicts what your tongue would pretend to discover   hannah no reflections maam upon my face for i am now determined you shall never benefit by it and shall at last die an old maid for your unkindness and incredulity   louisa and you cousin hannah like a million of old maids before you carry the secret with you to the grave   hannah fie cousin winstone is this your english education   greville these ladies are certainly by their fondness for secrets female free masons and i long to hear the secret   louisa an english education hannah has taught me to subdue all prejudice and foolish credulity and an english boardingschool has early initiated me into every art of adorning the person i am also convinced this secret of yours had it been good for any thing would have been made use of by  in pall mall or sangwine in the strand amongst their other tinctures and washes   hannah be as faithless maam as you please but as you doubt my secret you may endeavor to guess it and if you have courage to make the trial improve and benefit on this hint   louisa may i never gain my complexion again if i have not found it out but it is a cruel cruel remedy   hannah pride you know miss feels no pain had i been as vain as you i might have tried it long ago   louisa but show me my dear hannah how the operation is performed and i will run the risk of the smart i have heard it glanced at but never accomplished   hannah oh it is very possible very possible   louisa and will it make me as rosy and as lillylike as ever   hannah it is better than all the washes in the world   louisa oh then i shall not mind a little pain come along cousin hannah let us prepare it for i will certainly try it before i sleep   hannah aside conceited vain girl she has no idea of half the torture she must undergo but i will endeavor to lay it on properly and burn her to some purpose   louisa methinks i see the men already paying me a thousand new compliments you look charmingly to day cries one you bloom like a new rose cries another you are like a perfect venus rising out of the sea says a third   hannah while you cousin winstone will be like a new tried piece of gold finer for going through the fire   louisa oh yes quite at changed creature you shall see then cousin how i will treat the men in their turn   hannah aye i dare say you will give yourself as many airs as ever aside but there is one comfort you will be well burnt for it here is the receipt cousin reads it bury some cashoo nuts nine days under ground take them up and extract the oil which mix with a little old rum and lay it on the face with a feather and the ninth day after the skin will come off in a mask   louisa oh come along come along hannah   hannah yes cousin you shall be burnt to some purpose   exeunt ambo scene iv enter captain greville greville egad i have heard the secret and have a good mind to try it myself but it is very painful and i unfortunately could never bear pain in my life i cut my finger once and the doctor only put a little turlington to it and the smart i recollect brought tears into my eyes if i should try it now to improve my pretty face and it should pain me i should certainly caper about roar aloud and so blaze the secret all over the island ho ho i will call one of the black fellows try it on him first and if he endures it i may then venture to try it upon myself apropos here one of them comes here mr quacou have you a parcel of cashoo seeds near at hand   quacou yes massah i have some for the desert after dinner   greville will you go then and beat the oil out of them and when you have extracted it bring it to me in a phial   quacou what you want it for massah   greville to skin my face to be sure to make me quite fair take the sun burn off and make the women admire me   quacou does it make a negroe man white massah   greville it does more for it makes him so lovely that the very white women will be glad to adopt him as a husband but i will tell you it is kept a profound secret from all the blacks least they should become as white as ourselves and so no longer continue in subjection to us   quacou oh massah massah massah   greville there is a secret for you set them about skinning their faces and in a little time they will shake off the yoke and fetters of servitude   quacou oh massah me go get the oil directly exit   greville immediately how easily i have duped the fellow for the value of a black dog i will put him in pickle at once and if possible make him more like the devil than ever he loves his liberty however though old winstone is in general a kind master and feeds his housenegroes as well as himself however if this feminine piece of business should get to the ears of the women what will they say let them say what they will i do not care so they do but admire me faith the experiment will do well if as it gives the black fellow the opportunity of shaking off his chains it should enable me to lead fresh captives in mine  but here he comes already   quacou massah  haste massah here is the oil   greville you cannot make too much haste then to gain your liberty sit down then and make haste to redeem your freedom   quacou he will burn massah   greville quite the contrary  oil is a sovereign remedy against all inflammations sit down i say quacou sits down now while i rub it over your face you must shut your eyes or you will suppose you see the devil about you  now for it  here it goes  you will find it cool your face amazingly a little upon your nose to take the new rum and spirits of wine out there now  how do you find yourself here the negroe man may wink with his eyes and distort his face as much as he chooses   quacou aside he burn too much aloud ha ha ha massah try it yourself he quite cool sit down massah and let me cool you   greville a very little of it then sits down while the negro man puts it on his face   quacou now massah how you like it yourself   greville capering about like it you black rascal why you have peppered and salted my face   quacou ha ha ha how you like it massah he no quite cool   greville how can you bear it you dog   quacou how can a negroe feel pain we never feel when you beat us   greville zounds the very devil is pulling my nose off and my skin burns like an infidels in the inquisition help help help murder hell and the devil   stamping enter winstone mr wyndham and doctor winstone which way is he   greville there that is he that black rascal is the devil and is burning me up the negroe runs off   wyndham how is this   doctor i see the gentleman is insane he sees what does not exist his disorder lies deep   wyndham you mistake sir for it is merely on the surface   greville aye sir all over my face nose and eyes sneezing   winstone oh doctor a poultice immediately   wyndham a blister of blueflies would be better   greville oh i am damned for ever sneezing   winstone what the devil have you been about you puzzle the doctor himself   greville i am in torture in agony   doctor i am glad of it so much the better the greater will be the cure  take the patient to bed   wyndham fling a pail of cistern water over him   doctor fire must expel fire so hold a shaving dish of coals to his face   wyndham put him on the gridiron at once for i see what he has been about   greville oh my face my face my dear face   exeunt omnes end of the first act act ii scene i a loud laugh heard behind an apartment in the house of mr whitmore enter lovemore and whitmore lovemore ridicule you see pursues me from one end of the island to the other surely all the people who arrive at this period must think the island inhabited by owls   whitmore true there is such a hooting i do not wonder at it for my own part i cannot help laughing as often as it comes across me   lovemore why i have been long enough in the island to have furnished a new subject for diversion   whitmore very true but it is a rule here never to lose a good joke ha ha ha   lovemore ha ha ha mimicking him that is because there is such a scarcity of bon mots i attempted you saw to laugh at myself but all my laughter made them ha ha ha as loud again as before   whitmore true true to a proverb i pity you indeed   lovemore damn your pity if you presume to pity me  if you presume to pity me   whitmore what will you then be laughed at in preference   lovemore zounds no but you are welcome to beat out my brains   whitmore there is no fun in that if i do that you will make us no more jokes   lovemore aside so i see i am a buffoon to the whole island aloud what sir am i a pickled herring a merry andrew a jack pudding sir   whitmore oh yes sir you are a walking repository of fun for the whole island a nostrum against the spleen better than bark for the fever or the ague indeed a punch himself could not have pleased us better   lovemore i see sir the cause of all this affected risibility the imagined slight put upon a west indian female has turned all the heads here both young and old into the soft texture of the calabash and their hearts into the rattling nature of a tropical sand box   whitmore no sir they laugh from their souls i believe i do from mine i must confess even the council and assembly laughed at you   lovemore the council and assembly are fools let them laugh on   whitmore they have sent over too a most diverting anecdote of it to the parliament in england now if you say they are fools we will indict you for magnatum scandalum   lovemore a pretty instance of their wisdom faith this is more like the government of lilliputians now than ever i cannot see a woman without a mask all ashamed to show their faces   whitmore quite the reverse the shame lies upon you the mask is only a hint to you to hide yours they indeed put it to theirs as we put the forefinger on the nose to a child thus when it does amiss ah ah   lovemore aye i know i was pointed at but i shall leave you to yourselves i am beset on all sides one questions me concerning the ladys beauty another admires my taste and a third exclaims in wonder at my gallantry and in short i am a don quixote sancha pancha and every thing they think that is mad and ridiculous exeunt ambo   scene ii an apartment in the house of mr winstone enter miss winstone totally changed from the effects of the cushoo nut and miss bananah louisa now cousin hannah what will the impudent adventurer say now   hannah say why he will not know you to be the same person   louisa oh i am so lovely now he would perfectly pine out his soul at my feet   hannah but you would not let him would you   louisa not let him i am determined he shall die yes he shall die for it i will assure you hannah   hannah that is the height of cruelty cousin but take care for he is this very moment in sight with mr whitmore they neither of them will know you i dare say   louisa let him come for i can now meet him with confidence alas he little knows how much my vanity has cost me   hannah nor any one else indeed you perfectly danced a rigadoon for the first hour after the oil was laid on   louisa i actually felt as if my face was the prey of scorpions and centipedes or of musquitos   hannah yes and how you began to abuse the man lord lord i thought you would have died under the operation   louisa but now it is over how charmingly i feel who would not undergo a little pain to redeem lost beauty or to give delight to the man we love   hannah you had love and love enough for you may recollect you said you thought the very god of love himself was running his sharp pointed arrows into your face which indeed he could not have done had he not blinded you before   louisa indeed it was the most comical and at the same time the most painful sensation i ever felt   hannah you were one moment laughing the next crying then stamping and then sneezing that upon my word i began to tremble for you myself   louisa verses and sonnets now hannah you shall see will fly from all quarters one bard will praise my eye brows another my complexion and all together join in chorus on the subject of my skill fortitude and resolution   hannah why may you not be satyrised and lampooned instead of being praised and commended why not nicknamed and laughed at for your folly and in short put in the class of those animals who actually cast their skins off   louisa why if i am classed in that rank i will send the skin of my face to england there to be deposited in the britishmuseum and preserved amongst the other curiosities of the place   hannah it would have been a greater curiosity cousin winstone to have seen you in pickle yourself as well as the curious graft of the cushoo upon the body of the pine ha hal ha   louisa how different we look now hannah you look just as i did when the oil began to poison my face you seem under the operation now and not i my stars what a contrast ha ha ha   hannah by the sun and moon miss your vanity is enough to turn your head presume to show me any more airs or make any more odious comparisons and i will very shortly render your face as yellow as i now have made it fair   louisa you understand the art hannah and have practiced it too i believe in rendering your face all colors   hannah good gracious me   louisa you are a witch hannah   hannah a witch cousin winstone   louisa yes a witch for making yourself so brown and me so fair   hannah i will tell my uncle winstone you call me a witch   louisa and i will tell him you poisoned my face till my head and every feature grew as large as a bloated toad not only that but as he is judge of this island he shall bring you under the cognizance of that law made against witchcraft which will most certainly condemn you to be burnt   hannah and you cousin winstone as the witches subject every thing belonging to her you know should be consigned to the flames   louisa in truth hannah i think it would be to the interest of us both to keep the secret as long as possible however i must make haste to show myself and the astonishing transformation that has been wrought in me so come along   exeunt ambo scene ii an apartment in the house of mr whitmore enter whitmore and lovemore whitmore patience patience mr lovemore   lovemore this is not a country to learn patience in i am something like orpheus who was fool enough to go to hell to fetch back his wife eurydice   whitmore aye euridice euridice he cried as you did miss winstone   lovemore in one word mr whitmore i begin to detest this little damned spot more than ever   whitmore you would not even now raffle for the lady i suppose   lovemore no by heaven i see i must take consolation with a black wench at last   whitmore poor fellow i pity thee   lovemore damn it you are always pitying me though the very first to expose me   whitmore i sincerely pity thee to think thou should have come all this way in quest of an angel of light yet be obliged to take up with one who has so much affinity to the devil   lovemore there it is now i suppose you will tell all the island   whitmore to be sure to be sure man i wouldnt lose a joke for the world ha ha ha   lovemore jokes one would think were as scarce as drops of rain and that the inhabitants stood with their mouths open to catch and swallow them down but what sir has become of miss winstone all this while she has been now ill near a fortnight i think   whitmore yes your cold armor struck such a damp to her soul that she has been laid up with the ague ever since   lovemore mum for that i will embark immediately your vermin in this part of the world are very fond of fresh english flesh my legs are now blistered with the knats my toes devoured by chiggers a centipes stung my nose the other night and while i was at dinner a few days since just as i was about to taste a bit of the most delicious part of the turtle behold to the admiration of the company a large cock roach flew pop into my mouth   whitmore it must have been what we call a drummer in this part of the world   lovemore i dont know what it was but it was the most nauseous morsel i ever tasted in my life   whitmore you spit it up i suppose   lovemore oh no it followed the turtle down my throat   whitmore poor fellow i pity thee   lovemore damn it you are always pitying me   whitmore because thou art always deserving it i will then if you please accompany you to the water side and pity you there for the last time   lovemore i wish i was well out at sea with all my heart i have already been drank into a fever when i meant most to drink healths and am indeed so apprehensive of a famine that i wish to get back again as fast as i can   whitmore do not be afraid of that i have an antidote against it   lovemore pray tell me what it is   whitmore it is daily practiced by our negroes and it is this  to bind the belly hard   lovemore to bind the belly why is it not a very savage custom   whitmore to bind it externally i mean with a handkerchief or band thus showing him   lovemore but how does it compensate for the loss of food it appears to me worse than the russian bread made of sawdust   whitmore why you see the sensation of pain arising from hunger is produced by the action of the two coats of the stomach acting upon each other now the bandage confining the stomach and preventing this action of course takes away the pain this therefore is one argument among many others to prove that digestion is performed by the action of the mastication of the stomach and not by putrefaction as some physicians erroneously supposed   lovemore this indeed is natural and obvious enough but it certainly cannot support a man as you would have me believe i should be devilishly loath to be served in that manner   whitmore it answers so well sir that a negroe deprived of his usual food and at the very moment without an ounce to support nature will continue at his work for many hours   lovemore it is a rare custom indeed i will publish it at my return to england as a precious preservative to all hungry poets extravagant rakes and proud beggars but sir as you are about this couldnt you teach your slaves to chew their cud at once they are the only beasts of burden that do not i believe   whitmore that would be bad policy it would be to open a second stomach when we could not answer the cravings of the first   lovemore oh i recollect the reason now of your putting the mouthpiece upon them but in case that should not answer and they should by chance slip any thing down the throat egad you would let it choke them by confining the stomach   whitmore that is a reason founded in your own ingenuity   lovemore oh mr whitmore slavery is a damned thing i was near flinging an overseer the other day into a cauldron of hot liquor for flogging a slave beyond his deserts here comes captain wyndham bringing laughter and ridicule along with him i dare say   enter wyndham wyndham gentlemen your humble servant what mr lovemore musing again upon that dear fair one the adorable miss winstone   whitmore wyndham thouseest things sacred and profane conspire against the poor fellow women ugly and handsome insult him to his face spinsters and decayed matrons ridicule and laugh at him behind his back   wyndham give thyself no further trouble lovemore and as for miss winstone if she pretends to laugh at you believe me it is on the wrong side of her face for she is now like a bird that had moulted its feathers away   lovemore i am rejoiced to my soul to hear it any other woman at the point of death would have asked me pardon for the fruitless trouble she had given me   wyndham it is quite the reverse with her for she did nothing but abuse you i am told and that you in fact run as much in her head as she did once in your heart   lovemore as she has cast her feathers as you say i am in hopes she will cast her bill likewise and leave off speaking   wyndham i have just had a commission from old winstone to bring you and our friend whitmore to his estate to see a most precious piece of waxwork this he reckons a great curiosity and wishes you to view it before you return to england   lovemore waxwork why the sun is sufficient to melt it in this climate   whitmore so i should think and i wonder i never heard of it before old winstone is the last man whom i should suppose a connoisseur and so enlightened in natural history that i am certain he would not know the shell of a turtle from that of a crab if it was not that he generally had one or the other every day at his table   wyndham but come let us proceed without delay i am in hopes of seeing his beautiful daughter and knowing whether her face is grown any browner than it was indeed i am not sorry for it for the sun which tanned her complexion has turned the best spirits of her disposition to vinegar exeunt omnes   scene iv an apartment in the house of mr winstone in which are placed different figures in waxwork a pedestal standing among the figures intended for miss winstone enter old winstone his daughter and some friends winstone now now my dear we will revenge ourselves on this mad unmannerly englishman now he shall see what he shall see by the shades of our forefathers and of those of breslaw and jonas nothing will ever equal ha ha ha   louisa it will do charmingly if i can but keep from laughing oh i long to make fools of the men ha ha ha   winstone that you shall do immediately only keep to the pedestal and as soon as he comes be as composed as death   louisa i at this moment hear their feet they are coming greedily on captain wyndham swaggering and rattling his sword mr whitmore cracking his jokes and poor deceived mr lovemore led like an ass in an halter there now i am as still as the sun upon a dial leans upon the pedestal   enter captain wyndham lovemore and whitmore winstone gentlemen your humble servant mr lovemore notwithstanding our late misunderstanding i have invited you here to see these precious figures in waxwork so that return when you will to to england you will be able to tell them old winstone did not spend all his time in digging cane holes or erecting windmills or whirligigs on his estate   wyndham oh sir quite the reverse i have been just telling him you were one of the greatest philosophers of the age and these figures convince me of it for they are very fine very fine indeed   whitmore they are very fine very fine indeed   lovemore but the statue of that lady represented as leaning upon the pedestal is the most like the dear creature your daughter who won my heart in england   wyndham upon my soul she is very handsome   looking at her with his glass lovemore i observe sir however that there is a degree of strength in the lines of the face and though the figure represents a person asleep it is like one under the painful pressure and influence of the nightmare   winstone just so sir my poor daughter could never sleep without it blooded continually but indeed it was of little service for her poor dear mother fell a victim to it herself   whitmore aye poor soul you should tell mr lovemore sir that the staggers and the nightmare are the prevailing complaints of this island   lovemore that i can well believe as i have been staggered at every thing i have heard since my arrival oh this divine creature sir she takes up all my attention   whitmore so it seems but pray who does this black figure represent   winstone that sir represents the identical figure of a slave who having absconded and hid himself was at length discovered brought home and severely flogged but happening to die under the lash was unfortunately for his expeditions to the woods somewhat too prematurely sent to the shades   lovemore your anger then sir did not pursue him after death   winstone o god sir no he haunted my conscience for ever after he appeared at night by my bed side and in short troubled me so much that in order to appease the fellows ghost i erected this to his honor   whitmore he was a revengeful fellow though a damned good cooper and came from guinea i knew him well   winstone now the ghost of another country slave would not have troubled me but have lain quiet enough   lovemore heaven i see has revenged the old mans severity and for a slave killed has returned him a daughter burned for a black lost a mulatto gained   wyndham it was well sir that as you cut short the thread of his mortality you raised this bust to his fame and renown   winstone there was nothing for it but that the group of other figures you see are pieces done from fancy white black and yellow but that which takes up mr lovemores attention is the principal one   lovemore would you be so obliging as to permit me to touch this wax for upon my soul the artificial vermillion of the lips looks so much like real balmy benign true blood that i am almost tempted to kiss them if i gaze longer like the statuarist of old i shall forget myself and fall in love with a piece of wax i will i must thou sweetest piece of artificial nature ha   starting back as he goes to touch it miss winstone oversets the pedestal and falls back into the attitude of a fencer with her fan in her right hand mr lovemore after expressing much surprise clasps his hands in rapture the other gentlemen seem much surprised and make a pause old winstone resting his chin upon a cudgel whitmore why damme captain old winstone deals with the devil   wyndham yes you know his conscience was haunted before   whitmore he is now like a persian worshipping the sun   winstone gentlemen what is the matter   whitmore how can you ask when you surprise us so is the lady really miss winstone or a piece of organized wax work   winstone go to her and see   whitmore not i faith   wyndham nor i for i have not faith how these women love mischief she wished to surprise me i suppose because i was a soldier  winstone his daughter and the company burst into a fit of laughter to lovemore well sir how do you feel now   lovemore oh sir i cannot tell you i begin to suspect the wax figures to be all impostors   whitmore and so do i we must take care what we say and keep close together   lovemore i am afraid old winstone means to wreck his revenge upon me and that the other figures are all bullies   louisa ha ha ha you three sneaking cowardly fellows hold up your heads and look upon me you captain wyndham what do you mean by profaning this place after making the unfortunate miss winstone the subject of your scandalous conversation and ridicule do you come here with that brown face and false heroic air of yours to endeavor once more to subdue the creature you despised   whitmore it is her sure enough   winstone well said my dear upbraid them to the purpose   louisa you too mr whitmore what do you do here sir do you think with that ugly face any woman will ever adopt you even as her gallant are not you enough to frighten the god of love blunt his arrows and be the very sport of all genuine passion   winstone charming girl how delightfully severe she is   lovemore aside now comes my turn   louisa you last though not least mr lovemore   lovemore aye so i said though last not least in love i hope madam   louisa last in love and first in hate sir   lovemore do not upbraid me madam for if i had any idea you could have been so metamorphosed i vow and protest i would have taken more pains to have deserved your love   louisa contemptible as the evasion is i believe it and the worst that shall befall you is to be most heartily laughed at   lovemore that i have been already madam could not you change the punishment to running the gauntlet regard me madam as a poor silly fellow who came a great way on a wild goose chase who knew no better one of the fools of nature and the slave of your sex   louisa therefore the best subject for its scorn   winstone well done my dear how charmingly she retaliates why mr lovemore my daughter is severe upon you   lovemore yes sir if you set her on   winstone in truth sir i do and had she not made amends for your ill manners by shooting you plump through the heart just now i was determined to have run you through the body   whitmore that sir you may do yet and i will be your second poor lovemore how i pity thee   lovemore damn your pity you are always pitying me   wyndham for my part i expect to see all the other figures start into life they are all black white and yellow the natural children of old winstone how pray madam was the miracle wrought in your countenance   whitmore tell us madam that we may make ourselves as lovely as you could wish   louisa lovely ha ha ha   winstone my daughters method of regaining her complexion is kept a profound secret but you and captain wyndham may regain yours by the assistance of steel filings brown sand scalding hot water and a scowering brush   wyndham why that will take the skin off   whitmore the old gentleman will not tell us wyndham for i see he means to monopolize the patent to himself   lovemore yes he is afraid of my carrying it to england before him but it is of no consequence as it has wrought so agreeable a change in this charming lady   louisa well said sir in england you compared me to alabaster just now you thought me a piece of waxwork but it is the way of all mankind whatever they imagine us at first they find us mere downright flesh and blood   wyndham whispers whitmore harkee have you a mind to try old winstones receipt   whitmore what scower my face be laughed at as lovemore has been oh no not for all the world   wyndham shall we stay then till the patent comes out   whitmore oh by all means i would not scald my face for all the women in the grand signiors seraglio   wyndham shall we kneel down then and ask miss winstones pardon for laughing at her besides she is really so wonderfully mended that my knees bend under me without hardly knowing the cause   whitmore with all my heart but we must do it genteely so here goes they both kneel   louisa oh this is rare ha ha ha   whitmore we do it because we know you love rarities   louisa i wish hannah was here with all my heart but she keeps out of the way because my triumph would make her heart ach   winstone here is victory complete  a victory too over these  come my girl let me embrace you   lovemore why the father himself is in love with her   wyndham i wish i knew what the had done to herself to make us all such fools   lovemore it has succeeded most rarely miss winstone accidentally drops her fan they all strive to pick it up but lovemore succeeds who politely hands it to her i madam am the happy man   louisa but a most unfortunate knight errant   winstone they are all at loggerheads now to serve her i have absolutely a great mind to skin my face and marry the first beautiful young woman i meet for the success has been wonderful   wyndham i was sorry to hear of your indisposition madam but am now happy to find your beauty was all that while improving   louisa yes sir i am happy to find that my indisposition has so much improved your manners   wyndham oh madam it has improved us all   they all speak lovemore miss winstone was just as long in the attempt as    louisa as what sir   whitmore as a grub would be turning into a butterfly or the soldier crab changing his shell   louisa odious odious   winstone a devil of a comparison   wyndham ha ha ha   lovemore one would imagine sir by your unpoetical comparison of the grub you were imported here from grubstreet but sweet madam be under no uneasiness for i will protect you from all such vermin   whitmore you will want my armor again for that   lovemore to miss winstone oh madam how shall i hide my confusion or how express the sentiments of my returning passion for you can you forgive me my past folly and once more receive a faithful sincere penitent in a word madam do i owe the wonderful transmigration to your affection for me   louisa affection for you ha ha ha are you such a simpleton to think so you mr lovemore are the last of men who share any part of my affections angrily   whitmore affections indeed ha ha only hear him wyndham he has the impudence to talk of affection touches him on the elbow harkee sir   lovemore leaning his ear what do you say   whitmore i pity you most sincerely upon my soul   lovemore damn damn your pity sir stamping his feet   wyndham aside to whitmore how wonderfully foolish he looks upon my soul he is biting his nails his eyes wink as if he was going to cry   whitmore i do not wonder at it a man never looks so foolish never so much like a hangdog as when a pretty woman refuses his suit   wyndham aye my dear sir i know it by experience it is to a redcoat worse than a battleax bayonets or scalping knives   lovemore the whole island you know madam has rung with my unfortunate my incurable passion   louisa and the whole island sir are determined to make you ring with theirs for they hold the virtue and the happiness of their families in this part of the world in such high esteem that they would not suffer either to be trampled up by any mortal upon earth though more than briton born   whitmore puts his hands akimbo no that we will not suffer either to be trampled upon will we wyndham   wyndham no upon my word   lovemore so it appears by the jokes they have cracked upon me   winstone the jokes are only a prelude sir to something more serious as gentle currents of air spread small fires into extensive conflagrations   lovemore you do not mean to burn me sir the women could not strike with their eyes so they are determined to put me into an actual furnace at last   winstone why dont you make the insulted lady some apology   lovemore apology i might tell her indeed that i am sorry sorry very sorry sorry and so on   whitmore taking him off you are sorry and sorry and very sorry that is like a great booby of a schoolboy who cannot be otherwise after a severe beating   lovemore vile reptile protect yourself making a lounge at him with his sword in consequence of which whitmore by endeavoring to hide behind one of the figures knocks it over and breaks it to pieces   winstone murder my image my image death mr whitmore what do you mean i wish you were laid at the bottom of the sea and your friend there packed off the island   whitmore taking off lovemore sir i protest i am sorry sorry and very sorry   winstone damn your compassion for it spares neither things animate or inanimate i will have a dozen of field negroes for this   whitmore they shall be lazy ones then and as incapable of servitude as your image   lovemore i say mr winstone   winstone damn your remonstrances sir see what you have done   lovemore to miss winstone oh madam whatever my past conduct has been accept my repentant vows your changed features are sufficient to warm the heart of an hermit and these added to miss winstones now durable good qualities will ever enslave the heart of her poor unhappy unfortunate lovemore   kneeling louisa aside lie still my heart and teach me to repay his scorn   winstone my poor image   wyndham will not you raise him up madam   louisa not i sir it is too much trouble in this part of the world we require assistance and take care to let others shift for themselves   lovemore still kneeling will you permit me to return madam without one kind one tender look she turns from him with contempt lovemore rises i see there is nothing to be done why this then finally fixes my resolution of going back to england what a figure i shall make when i land at dover or deal   whitmore aye just like a stripped smuggler for all the world   lovemore i boasted to some brother collegians that i was going to colchis in quest of the golden fleece compared myself to jason and the lady to medea but i will verily go back to my old musty college take a degree forget the ladies entirely and console myself the remainder of my days with black strap and philosophy   whitmore the joke though will attend you all the way it will not lose sight of you depend upon it   louisa what mr lovemore excites your vanity on the present occasion may more probably be attributed to my own is it not the pleasure of our sex to lead yours in chains and do not we wish for beauty more to make us generally admired than to drag one dull stupid helpmate along all ones life   whitmore certainly madam you see lovemore miss winstone is a public spirited lady she did not put herself to pain only for you but that wyndham and myself also might be among the number of her admirers   louisa to mr winstone the gentlemen however are not yet sufficiently informed on this subject of transmigration if you please sir introduce the effeminate mr greville for he poor man has met with such an accident ha ha ha   lovemore he has been scowering his face i dare say   winstone aye till he has made it shine again   wyndham and whitmore both laugh and ask to see him louisa do sir fetch him to the gentlemen   exit winstone and enters with mr greville who has his face blotched by the effects of the cushoo winstone i had difficult work to bring him he was very stubborn   greville i know sir you brought me here to be laughed at and i deserve it   wyndham what have thou been doing with that sweet pretty face of thine   louisa ha ha harlequin touched it with his wand and turned it to the stripes of his jacket   wyndham it is like a carrion crow hung upon a barn door and bleached with the beams of the sun   lovemore or like the last remaining dregs in the crucible of some old chemist   winstone in short gentlemen the devil put his fingers on his face and scratched it to this fashion now you shall see the devil himself   exit winstone lovemore fie fie mr greville how can you help it   greville it is a misfortune gentlemen and it is cruel to laugh at me  the scrubbing brush and steel filings have taken all the skin off his face   enter winstone with quacou in the same unfortunate condition whitmore here is the devil indeed   wyndham he looks as if he had run into the woods of america and all the monkeys and baboons there had scratched him into a leprosy   lovemore as for mr greville i cannot help regretting that a person of your taste and refinement should have been born in this climate as in the land from whence i came instead of a cushoonut a man by the assistance of a little brown paint mixed with a portion of vermillion would have made himself every thing charming and fashionable   greville what a pity what a pity it is i did not know it before   whitmore taking off lovemore mr lovemore greville is sorry sorry very sorry sorry and so on it is impossible he should ever make his fortune now in the way of wedlock unless the widow of some fellow who showed wild beasts should think fit to marry him expose him as one of the polecat kind for money and take his face by way of dower or pin money   wyndham to miss winstone what has your cousin hannah too madam been scowering has she been improving her beauty   louisa oh yes poor girl she has been trying but all to very little purpose the sun burn and yellow jaundice together has sunk so very deep into her face that nothing under the surgeons knife could ever possibly eradicate them thence   whitmore what a desperate case   lovemore you have a new subject for pity then whitmore   whitmore but not so good as the old no you are the best subject for pity i ever saw under the sun   wyndham he wants to change the fools cap and bell from his own head to that of the poor ladys that is not like a true knight errant i must say   whitmore aye that is cowardly and pitiful to a degree   louisa but mr lovemore what if i should lose my complexion again   lovemore why then you must repeat the experiment again   whitmore yes and have another suit of armor and another squire like myself to help him out   winstone mr lovemore my resentment is past my knowledge of your family fortune and connections teach me to pardon the follies of an understanding crowded with romance in mere compliment to a heart regulated by the greatest philanthropy and benevolence my daughter is yours i give her to you   whitmore with your estate sir in see simple i presume   winstone hold your tongue sir what right have you to presume   lovemore now whitmore here is an end to your pity   whitmore an increase you mean i pity thee more than ever mr greville with his blotched face the black fellow with his miss winstone who was some time ago on the rack are not so much to be pitied come along wyndham he is no longer fit for us he is going to be married   wyndham oh i pity him then from my very soul harkee aside if he has not his face skinned depend upon it he will have it scratched before the year is at an end   winstone to quacou get you gone and tell the driver to lay you on nine and thirty lashes   quacou lud a mercy massah exit quacou   lovemore i am doomed to more torture and ridicule madam than either of these men have you madam forgot the hours of mutual endearments spent between us in england is there no hope or has this inhospitable climate blasted all remembrance all tender recollection of my former attachment   louisa aside pride thou just and noble support of my sexs dignity leave me not at last but still assist and bear me through this hour of trial   winstone forgive him my dear and let him see that though we are in this part of the world subject to sudden and violent fits of anger yet we are as incapable of bearing malice as we are of bearing wrongs   whitmore now now she is going to make a speech hush   louisa sir there was a time i must own when my heart gloried in the affections of mr lovemore and though i was by the commands of my father torn from his vows to a country where i were often and constantly made me yet out of compassion for him i refused both my hand and heart to those that requested them such were once my sentiments toward you but now insulted rejected what shall i say to your importunities   whitmore that he must cross the seas twice every year for half a dozen years to come before you will even let him kiss your hand   winstone nay then without further delay i will give it him gives his daughters hand to lovemore who kneels and kisses it   lovemore this is more than i deserve my heart overflows with gratitude   louisa know then mr lovemore since my father has even given me to your love that i was endued with fortitude enough to stand against all the shocks of ridicule and derision which were thrown out at my lost beauty yet the tender recollection of my first attachment revived all the latent sparks of passion in my breast and has been the occasion of the surprising change you see   lovemore transporting change no more miss winstone but my own
