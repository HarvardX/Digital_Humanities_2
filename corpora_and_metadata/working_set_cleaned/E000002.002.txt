have not yet taken notice of that ramble into all the corners of this great city in order to seduce such unfortunate females as fall into their walks these abandoned profligates raise up issue in every quarter of the town and very often for a valuable consideration father it upon the churchwarden by this means there are several married men who have a little family in most of the parishes of london and westminster and several batchelors who are undone by a charge of children  when a man once gives himself this liberty of preying at large and living upon the common he finds so much game in a populous city that it is surprising to consider the numbers which he sometimes propagates we see many a young fellow who is scarce of age that could lay his claim to the jus trium liberorum or the privileges which were granted by the roman laws to all such as were fathers of three children nay i have heard a rake who   was not quite five and twenty declare himself the father of a seventh son and very prudently determine to breed him up a physician in short the town is full of these young patriarchs not to mention several batterd beaus who like heedless spendthrifts that squander away their estates before they are masters of them have raised up their whole stock of children before marriage  i must not here omit the particular whim of an impudent libertine that had a little smattering of heraldry and observing how the genealogies of great families were often drawn up in the shape of trees had taken a fancy to dispose of his own illegitimate issue in a figure of the same kind    nec longum tempus et ingens   exiit ad coelum ramis felicibus arbos   miraturque novas frondes et non sua poma    virg     the trunk of the tree was markd with his own name will maple out of

infant in it with a space left for a second the parent from whom it sprung being near her time when the author took this ingenious device into his head the two other great boughs were very plentifully loaden with fruit of the same kind besides which there were many ornamental branches that did not bear in short a more flourishing tree never came out of the heralds office  what makes this generation of vermin so very prolifick is the indefatigable diligence with which they apply themselves to their business a man does not undergo more watchings and fatigues in a campaign than in the course of a vicious amour as it is said of some men that they make their business their pleasure these sons of darkness may be said to make their pleasure their business they might conquer their corrupt inclinations with half the pains they are at in gratifying them  nor is the invention of these men less to be admired than their industry or vigilance there is a fragment of apollodorus the comick poet who was contemporary with menander which is full of humour as follows thou mayest shut up thy doors says he with bars and bolts it will be impossible for the blacksmith to make them so fast but a cat and a whoremaster will find a way through them in a word there is no head so full of stratagems as that of a libidinous man  were i to propose a punishment for this infamous race of propagators it should be to send them after the second or third offence into our american colonies in order to people those parts of her majestys dominions where there is a want of inhabitants and in the phrase of diogenes to plant men some countries punish this crime with death but i think such a banishment would be sufficient and might turn this generative faculty to the advantage of the publick  in the mean time till these gentlemen may be thus disposed of i would earnestly exhort them to take care of those unfortunate creatures whom they have brought into the world by these indirect methods and to give their spurious children such an education as may render them more virtuous than their parents this is the best atonement they can make for their own crimes and indeed the only method that is left them to repair their past miscarriages  i would likewise desire them to consider whether they are not bound in common humanity as well as by all the obligations of religion and nature to make some provision for those whom they have not only given life to but entaild upon them tho very unreasonably a degree of shame and disgrace   and here i cannot but take notice of those depraved notions which prevail among us and which must have taken rise from our natural inclination to favour a vice to which we are so very prone namely that bastardy and cuckoldom should be lookd upon as reproaches and that the ignominy   which is only due to lewdness and falsehood should fall in so unreasonable a manner upon the persons who are   innocent  i have been insensibly drawn into this discourse by the following letter which is drawn up with such a spirit of sincerity that i question not but the writer of it has represented his case in a true and genuine light    sir    i am one of those people who by the general opinion of the world are   counted both infamous and unhappy    my father is a very eminent man in this kingdom and one who bears   considerable offices in it i am his son but my misfortune is that i   dare not call him father nor he without shame own me as his issue i   being illegitimate and therefore deprived of that endearing   tenderness and unparalleld satisfaction which a good man finds in the   love and conversation of a parent neither have i the opportunities to   render him the duties of a son he having always carried himself at so   vast a distance and with such superiority towards me that by long   use i have contracted a timorousness when before him which hinders me   from declaring my own necessities and giving him to understand the   inconveniencies i undergo    it is my misfortune to have been neither bred a scholar a soldier   nor to any kind of business which renders me entirely uncapable of   making provision for my self without his assistance and this creates   a continual uneasiness in my mind fearing i shall in time want bread   my father if i may so call him giving me but very faint assurances   of doing any thing for me    i have hitherto lived somewhat like a gentleman and it would be very   hard for me to labour for my living i am in continual anxiety for my   future fortune and under a great unhappiness in losing the sweet   conversation and friendly advice of my parents so that i cannot look   upon my self otherwise than as a monster strangely sprung up in   nature which every one is ashamed to own    i am thought to be a man of some natural parts and by the continual   reading what you have offered the world become an admirer thereof   which has drawn me to make this confession at the same time hoping   if any thing herein shall touch you with a sense of pity you would   then allow me the favour of your opinion thereupon as also what part   i being unlawfully born may claim of the mans affection who begot   me and how far in your opinion i am to be thought his son or he   acknowledged as my father your sentiments and advice herein will be a   great consolation and satisfaction to   sir   your admirer and

happiness to nothing but infatuation i can   see you ogle all the young fellows who look at you and observe your   eye wander after new conquests every moment you are in a publick   place and yet there is such a beauty in all your looks and gestures   that i cannot but admire you in the very act of endeavouring to gain   the hearts of others my condition is the same with that of the lover   in

behaviour will appear to me as amiable when an husband as it does now   to me a lover things are so far advanced that we must proceed and i   hope you will lay it to heart that it will be becoming in

fail me and it is the   ardent love i have for you that carries me beyond my strength and   enables me to tell you the most painful thing in the prospect of   death is that i must part with you but let it be a comfort to you   that i have no guilt hangs upon me no unrepented folly that retards   me but i pass away my last hours in reflection upon the happiness we   have lived in together and in sorrow that it is so soon to have an   end this is a frailty which i hope is so far from criminal that   methinks there is a kind of piety in being so unwilling to be   separated from a state which is the institution of heaven and in   which we have lived according to its laws as we know no more of the   next life but that it will be an happy one to the good and miserable   to the wicked why may we not please ourselves at least to alleviate   the difficulty of resigning this being in imagining that we shall   have a sense of what passes below and may possibly be employed in   guiding the steps

that i publish the following letter which brings to light some secrets of this nature     mr spectator    there are none of your speculations which i read over with greater   delight than those which are designed for the improvement of our sex   you have endeavoured to correct our unreasonable fears and   superstitions in your seventh and twelfth papers our fancy for   equipage in your fifteenth

in your eightyninth the   salamander in your hundred and ninetyeighth you have likewise taken   to pieces our dress and represented to us the extravagancies we are   often guilty of in that particular you have fallen upon our patches   in your fiftieth and eightyfirst our commodes in your   ninetyeighth our fans in your hundred and second our riding habits   in your hundred and fourth our hooppetticoats in your hundred and   twentyseventh besides a great many little blemishes which you have   touched upon in your several other papers and in those many letters   that are scattered up and down your works at the same time we must   own that the compliments you pay our sex are innumerable and that   those very faults which you represent in us are neither black in   themselves nor as you own universal among us but sir it is plain   that these your discourses are calculated for none but the fashionable   part of womankind and for the use of those who are rather indiscreet   than vicious but sir there is a sort of prostitutes in the lower   part of our sex who are a scandal to us and very well deserve to   fall under your censure i know it would debase your paper too much to   enter into the behaviour of these female libertines but as your   remarks on some part of it would be a doing of justice to several   women of virtue and honour whose reputations suffer by it i hope you   will not think it improper to give the publick some accounts of this   nature you must know sir i am provoked to write you this letter by   the behaviour of an infamous woman who having passed her youth in a   most shameless state of prostitution is now one of those who gain   their livelihood by seducing others that are younger than themselves   and by establishing a criminal commerce between the two sexes among   several of her artifices to get money she frequently perswades a vain   young fellow that such a woman of quality or such a celebrated   toast entertains a secret passion for him and wants nothing but an   opportunity of revealing it nay she has gone so far as to write   letters in the name of a woman of figure to borrow money of one of   these foolish roderigos   which she has afterwards appropriated   to her own use in the mean time the person who has lent the money   has thought a lady under obligations to him who scarce knew his name   and wondered at her ingratitude when he has been with her that she   has not owned the favour though at the same time he was too much a   man of honour to put her in mind of it    when this abandoned baggage meets with a man who has vanity enough to   give credit to relations of this nature she turns him to very good   account by repeating praises that were never uttered and delivering   messages that were never sent as the house of this shameless creature   is frequented by several foreigners i have heard of another artifice   out of which she often raises money the foreigner sighs after some   british beauty whom he only knows by fame upon which she promises   if he can be secret to procure him a meeting the stranger ravished   at his good fortune gives her a present and in a little time is   introduced to some imaginary title for you must know that this   cunning purveyor has her representatives upon this occasion of some   of the finest ladies in the kingdom by this means as i am informed   it is usual enough to meet with a german count in foreign countries   that shall make his boasts of favours he has received from women of   the highest ranks and the most unblemished characters now sir what   safety is there for a womans reputation when a lady may be thus   prostituted as it were by proxy and be reputed an unchaste woman as   the hero in the ninth book of drydens virgil is looked upon as a   coward because the phantom which appeared in his likeness ran away   from turnus you may depend upon what i relate to you to be matter   of fact and the practice of more than one of these female pandars if   you print this letter i may give you some further accounts of this   vicious race of women   your humble servant   belvidera   i shall add two other letters on different subjects to fill up my paper     mr spectator    i am a country clergyman and hope you will lend me your assistance   in ridiculing some little indecencies which cannot so properly be   exposed from the pulpit    a widow lady who straggled this summer from london into my parish   for the benefit of the air as she says appears every sunday at   church with many fashionable extravagancies to the great astonishment   of my congregation    but what gives us the most offence is her theatrical manner of   singing the psalms she introduces above fifty italian airs into the   hundredth psalm and whilst we begin all people in the old solemn   tune of our forefathers she in a quite different key runs divisions   on the vowels and adorns them with the graces of nicolini if she   meets with eke or aye which are frequent in the metre of hopkins   and sternhold  we are certain to hear her quavering them half a   minute after us to some sprightly airs of the opera    i am very far from being an enemy to church musick but fear this   abuse of it may make my parish ridiculous who already look on the   singing psalms as an entertainment and no part of their devotion   besides i am apprehensive that the infection may spread for squire   squeekum who by his voice seems if i may use the expression to be   cut out for an italian singer was last sunday practising the same   airs    i know the ladys principles and that she will plead the toleration   which as she fancies allows her nonconformity in this particular   but i beg you to acquaint her that singing the psalms in a different   tune from the rest of the congregation is a sort of schism not   tolerated by that act    i am sir your very humble servant r s      mr spectator    in your paper upon temperance you prescribe to us a rule of

end abundantly recompense such losses as the modest seem to suffer in the ordinary occurrences of life the curious tell us a determination in our favour or to our disadvantage is made upon our first appearance even before they know any thing of our characters but from the intimations men gather from our aspect a man they say wears the picture of his mind in his countenance and one mans eyes are spectacles to his who looks at him to read his heart but tho that way of raising an opinion of those we behold in publick is very fallacious certain it is that those who by their words and actions take as much upon themselves as they can but barely demand in the strict scrutiny of their deserts will find their account lessen every day a modest man preserves his character as a frugal man does his fortune if either of them live to the height of either one will find losses the other errors which he has not stock by him to make up it were therefore a just rule to keep your desires your words and actions within the regard you observe your friends have for you and never if it were in a mans power to take as much as he possibly might either in preferment or reputation my walks have lately been among the mercantile part of the world and one gets phrases naturally from those with whom one converses i say then he that in his air his treatment of others or an habitual arrogance to himself gives himself credit for the least article of more wit wisdom goodness or valour than he can possibly produce if he is called upon will find the world break in upon him and consider him as one who has cheated them of all the esteem they had before allowed him this brings a commission of bankruptcy upon him and he that might have gone on to his lifes end in a prosperous way by aiming at more than he should is no longer proprietor of what he really had before but his pretensions fare as all things do which are torn instead of being divided  there is no one living would deny cinna the applause of an agreeable and facetious wit or could possibly pretend that there is not something inimitably unforced and diverting in his manner of delivering all his sentiments in conversation if he were able to conceal the strong desire of applause which he betrays in every syllable he utters but they who converse with him see that all the civilities they could do to him or the kind things they could say to him would fall short of what he expects and therefore instead of shewing him the esteem they have for his merit their reflections turn only upon that they observe he has of it himself  if you go among the women and behold gloriana trip into a room with that theatrical ostentation of her charms mirtilla with that soft regularity in her motion chloe with such an indifferent familiarity corinna with such a fond approach and roxana with such a demand of respect in the great gravity of her entrance you find all the sex who understand themselves and act naturally wait only for their absence to tell you that all these ladies would impose themselves upon you and each of them carry in their behaviour a consciousness of so much more than they should pretend to that they lose what would otherwise be given them  i remember the last time i saw macbeth i was wonderfully taken with the skill of the poet in making the murderer form fears to himself from the moderation of the prince whose life he was going to take away he says of the king he bore his faculties so meekly and justly inferred from thence that all divine and human power would join to avenge his death who had made such an abstinent use of dominion all that is in a mans power to do to advance his own pomp and glory and forbears is so much laid up against the day of distress and pity will always be his portion in adversity who acted with gentleness in prosperity  the great officer who foregoes the advantages he might take to himself and renounces all prudential regards to his own person in danger has so far the merit of a volunteer and all his honours and glories are unenvied for sharing the common fate with the same frankness as they do who have no such endearing circumstances to part with but if there were no such considerations as the good effect which selfdenial has upon the sense of other men towards us it is of all qualities the most desirable for the agreeable disposition in which it places our own minds i cannot tell what better to say of it than that it is the very contrary of ambition and that modesty allays all those passions and inquietudes to which that vice exposes us he that is moderate in his wishes from reason and choice and not resigned from sourness distaste or disappointment doubles all the pleasures of his life the air the season a sunshiny   day or a fair prospect are instances of happiness and that which he enjoys in common with all the world by his exemption from the enchantments by which all the world are bewitched are to him uncommon benefits and new acquisitions health is not eaten up with care nor pleasure interrupted by envy it is not to him of any consequence what this man is famed for or for what the other is preferred he knows there is in such a place an uninterrupted walk he can meet in such a company an agreeable conversation he has no emulation he is no mans rival but every mans wellwisher can look at a prosperous man with a pleasure in reflecting that he hopes he is as happy as himself and has his mind and his fortune as far as prudence will allow open to the unhappy and to the stranger  lucceius has learning wit humour eloquence but no ambitious prospects to pursue with these advantages therefore to the ordinary world he is perhaps thought to want spirit but known among his friends to have a mind of the most consummate greatness he wants no mans admiration is in no need of pomp his cloaths please him if they are fashionable and warm his companions are agreeable if they are civil and wellnatured there is with him no occasion for superfluity at meals for jollity in company in a word for any thing extraordinary to administer delight to him want of prejudice and command of appetite are the companions which make his journey of life so easy that he in all places meets with more wit more good cheer and more good humour than is necessary to make him enjoy himself with pleasure and satisfaction    footnote   sunshine and in the

shew what were the notions of the most refined heathens on this subject as they are represented in platos dialogue upon prayer entitled alcibiades the second which doubtless gave occasion to juvenals tenth satire and to the second satire of persius as the last of these authors has almost transcribed the preceding dialogue entitled alcibiades the first in his fourth satire  the speakers in this dialogue upon prayer are socrates and alcibiades and the substance of it when drawn together out of the intricacies and digressions as follows  socrates meeting his pupil alcibiades as he was going to his devotions and observing his eyes to be fixed upon the earth with great seriousness and attention tells him that he had reason to be thoughtful on that occasion since it was possible for a man to bring down evils upon himself by his own prayers and that those things which the gods send him in answer to his petitions might turn to his destruction this says he may not only happen when a man prays for what he knows is mischievous in its own nature as oedipus implored the gods to sow dissension between his sons but when he prays for what he believes would be for his good and against what he believes would be to his detriment this the philosopher shews must necessarily happen among us since most men are blinded with ignorance prejudice or passion which hinder them from seeing such things as are really beneficial to them for an instance he asks alcibiades whether he would not be thoroughly pleased and satisfied if that god to whom he was going to address himself should promise to make him the sovereign of the whole earth alcibiades answers that he should doubtless look upon such a promise as the greatest favour that he could bestow upon him socrates then asks him if after receiving   this great favour he would be contented to lose his life or if he would receive it though he was sure he should make an ill use of it to both which questions alcibiades answers in the negative socrates then shews him from the examples of others how these might very probably be the effects of such a blessing he then adds that other reputed pieces of goodfortune as that of having a son or procuring the highest post in a government are subject to the like fatal consequences which nevertheless says he men ardently desire and would not fail to pray for if they thought their prayers might be effectual for the obtaining of them having established this great point that all the most apparent blessings in this life are obnoxious to such dreadful consequences and that no man knows what in its events would prove to him a blessing or a curse he teaches alcibiades after what manner he ought to pray  in the first place he recommends to him as the model of his devotions a short prayer which a greek poet composed for the use of his friends in the following words o jupiter give us those things which are good for us whether they are such things as we pray for or such things as we do not pray for and remove from us those things which are hurtful though they are such things as we pray for  in the second place that his disciple may ask such things as are expedient for him he shews him that it is absolutely necessary to apply himself to the study of true wisdom and to the knowledge of that which is his chief good and the most suitable to the excellency of his nature  in the third and last place he informs him that the best method he could make use of to draw down blessings upon himself and to render his prayers acceptable would be to live in a constant practice of his duty towards the gods and towards men under this head he very much recommends a form of prayer the lacedemonians made use of in which they petition the gods to give them all good things so long as they were virtuous under this head likewise he gives a very remarkable account of an oracle to the following purpose  when the athenians in the war with the lacedemonians received many defeats both by sea and land they sent a message to the oracle of jupiter ammon to ask the reason why they who erected so many temples to the gods and adorned them with such costly offerings why they who had instituted so many festivals and accompanied them with such pomps and ceremonies in short why they who had slain so many hecatombs at their altars should be less successful than the lacedemonians who fell so short of them in all these particulars to this says he the oracle made the following reply i am better pleased with the prayer of the lacedemonians than with all the oblations of the greeks as this prayer implied and encouraged virtue in those who made it the philosopher proceeds to shew how the most vicious man might be devout so far as victims could make him but that his offerings were regarded by the gods as bribes and his petitions as blasphemies he likewise quotes on this occasion two verses out of homer   in which the poet says that the scent of the trojan sacrifices was carried up to heaven by the winds but that it was not acceptable to the gods who were displeased with priam and all his people  the conclusion of this dialogue is very remarkable socrates having deterred alcibiades from the prayers and sacrifice which he was going to offer by setting forth the abovementioned difficulties of performing that duty as he ought adds these words we must therefore wait till such time as we may learn how we ought to behave ourselves towards the gods and towards men but when will that time come says alcibiades and who is it that will instruct us for i would fain see this man whoever he is it is one says socrates who takes care of you but as homer tells us   that minerva removed the mist from diomedes his eyes that he might plainly discover both gods and men so the darkness that hangs upon your mind must be removed before you are able to discern what is good and what is evil let him remove from my mind says alcibiades the darkness and what else he pleases i am determined to refuse nothing he shall order me whoever he is so that i may become the better man by it the remaining part of this dialogue is very obscure there is something in it that would make us think socrates hinted at himself when he spoke of this divine teacher who was to come into the world did not he own that he himself was in this respect as much at a loss and in as great distress as the rest of mankind  some learned men look upon this conclusion as a prediction of our saviour or at least that socrates like the highpriest   prophesied unknowingly and pointed at that divine teacher who was to come into the world some ages after him however that may be we find that this great philosopher saw by the light of reason that it was suitable to the goodness of the divine nature to send a person into the world who should instruct mankind in the duties of religion and in particular teach them how to pray  whoever reads this abstract of platos discourse on prayer will i believe naturally make this reflection that the great founder of our religion as well by his own example as in the form of prayer which he taught his disciples did not only keep up to those rules which the light of nature had suggested to this great philosopher but instructed his disciples in the whole extent of this duty as well as of all others he directed them to the proper object of adoration and taught them according to the third rule abovementioned to apply themselves to him in their closets without show or ostentation and to worship him in spirit and in truth as the lacedemonians in their form of prayer implored the gods in general to give them all good things so long as they were virtuous we ask in particular that our offences may be forgiven as we forgive those of others if we look into the second rule which socrates has prescribed namely that we should apply ourselves to the knowledge of such things as are best for us this too is explaind at large in the doctrines of the gospel where we are taught in several instances to regard those things as curses which appear as blessings in the eye of the world and on the contrary to esteem those things as blessings which to the generality of mankind appear as curses thus in the form which is prescribed to us we only pray for that happiness which is our chief good and the great end of our existence when we petition the supreme being for the coming of his kingdom being solicitous for no other temporal blessings but our daily sustenance on the other side we pray against nothing but sin and against evil in general leaving it with omniscience to determine what is really such if we look into the first of socrates his rules of prayer in which he recommends the abovementioned form of the ancient poet we find that form not only comprehended but very much improved in the petition wherein we pray to the supreme being that his will may be done which is of the same force with that form which our saviour used when he prayed against the most painful and most ignominious of deaths nevertheless not my will but thine be done this comprehensive petition is the most humble as well as the most prudent that can be offered up from the creature to his creator as it supposes the supreme being wills nothing but what is for our good and that he knows better than ourselves what is so  l    footnote   having received

spectacles a lady in particular observes that there is such a levity in the minds of her own sex that they seldom attend any thing but impertinences it is indeed prodigious to observe how little notice is taken of the most exalted parts of the best tragedies in shakespear nay it is not only visible that sensuality has devoured all greatness of soul but the underpassion as i may so call it of a noble spirit pity seems to be a stranger to the generality of an audience the minds of men are indeed very differently disposed and the reliefs from care and attention are of one sort in a great spirit and of another in an ordinary one the man of a great heart and a serious complexion is more pleased with instances of generosity and pity than the light and ludicrous spirit can possibly be with the highest strains of mirth and laughter it is therefore a melancholy prospect when we see a numerous assembly lost to all serious entertainments and such incidents as should move one sort of concern excite in them a quite contrary one in the tragedy of macbeth the other night   when the lady who is conscious of the crime of murdering the king seems utterly astonished at the news and makes an exclamation at it instead of the indignation which is natural to the occasion that expression is received with a loud laugh they were as merry when a criminal was stabbed it is certainly an occasion of rejoycing when the wicked are seized in their designs but i think it is not such a triumph as is exerted by laughter  you may generally observe that the appetites are sooner moved than the passions a sly expression which alludes to bawdry puts a whole row into a pleasing smirk when a good sentence that describes an inward sentiment of the soul is received with the greatest coldness and indifference a correspondent of mine upon this subject has divided the female part of the audience and accounts for their prepossession against this reasonable delight in the following manner the prude says he as she acts always in contradiction so she is gravely sullen at a comedy and extravagantly gay at a tragedy the coquette is so much taken up with throwing her eyes around the audience and considering the effect of them that she cannot be expected to observe the actors but as they are her rivals and take off the observation of the men from her self besides these species of women there are the examples or the first of the mode these are to be supposed too well acquainted with what the actor was going to say to be moved at it after these one might mention a certain flippant set of females who are mimicks and are wonderfully diverted with the conduct of all the people around them and are spectators only of the audience but what is of all the most to be lamented is the loss of a party whom it would be worth preserving in their right senses upon all occasions and these are those whom we may indifferently call the innocent or the unaffected you may sometimes see one of these sensibly touched with a wellwrought incident but then she is immediately so impertinently observed by the men and frowned at by some insensible superior of her own sex that she is ashamed and loses the enjoyment of the most laudable concern pity thus the whole audience is afraid of letting fall a tear and shun as a weakness the best and worthiest part of our sense       sidenote pray settle what

anaer laeízetai   esthlaes ámeinon oude rhígion kakaes    simonides    there are no authors i am more pleased with than those who shew human nature in a variety of views and describe the several ages of the world in their different manners a reader cannot be more rationally entertained than by comparing the virtues and vices of his own times with those which prevailed in the times of his forefathers and drawing a parallel in his mind between his own private character and that of other persons whether of his own age or of the ages that went before him the contemplation of mankind under these changeable colours is apt to shame us out of any particular vice or animate us to any particular virtue to make us pleased or displeased with our selves in the most proper points to clear our minds of prejudice and prepossession and rectify that narrowness of temper which inclines us to think amiss of those who differ from our selves  if we look into the manners of the most remote ages of the world we discover human nature in her simplicity and the more we come downwards towards our own times may observe her hiding herself in artifices and refinements polished insensibly out of her original plainness and at length entirely lost under form and ceremony and what we call good breeding read the accounts of men and women as they are given us by the most ancient writers both sacred and prophane and you would think you were reading the history of another species  among the writers of antiquity there are none who instruct us more openly in the manners of their respective times in which they lived than those who have employed themselves in satyr under what dress soever it may appear as there are no other authors whose province it is to enter so directly into the ways of men and set their miscarriages in so strong a light  simonides  a poet famous in his generation is i think author of the oldest satyr that is now extant and as some say of the first that was ever written this poet flourished about four hundred years after the siege of troy and shews by his way of writing the simplicity or rather coarseness of the age in which he lived i have taken notice in my hundred and sixty first speculation that the rule of observing what the french call the bienséance in an allusion has been found out of later years and that the ancients provided there was a likeness in their similitudes did not much trouble themselves about the decency of the comparison the satyr or iambicks of simonides with which i shall entertain my readers in the present paper are a remarkable instance of what i formerly advanced the subject of this satyr is woman he describes the sex in their several characters which he derives to them from a fanciful supposition raised upon the doctrine of præexistence he tells us that the gods formed the souls of women out of those seeds and principles which compose several kinds of animals and elements and that their good or bad dispositions arise in them according as such and such seeds and principles predominate in their constitutions i have translated the author very faithfully and if not word for word which our language would not bear at least so as to comprehend every one of his sentiments without adding any thing of my own i have already apologized for this authors want of delicacy and must further premise that the following satyr affects only some of the lower part of the sex and not those who have been refined by a polite education which was not so common in the age of this poet     in the beginning god made the souls of womankind out of different   materials and in a separate state from their bodies    the souls of one kind of women were formed out of those ingredients   which compose a swine a woman of this make is a slut in her house and   a glutton at her table she is uncleanly in her person a slattern in   her dress and her family is no better than a dunghill    a second sort of female soul was formed out of the same materials   that enter into the composition of a fox such an one is what we call   a notable discerning woman who has an insight into every thing   whether it be good or bad in this species of females there are some   virtuous and some vicious    a third kind of women were made up of canine particles these are   what we commonly call scolds who imitate the animals of which they   were taken that are always busy and barking that snarl at every one   who comes in their way and live in perpetual clamour    the fourth kind of women were made out of the earth these are your   sluggards who pass away their time in indolence and ignorance hover   over the fire a whole winter and apply themselves with alacrity to no   kind of business but eating    the fifth species of females were made out of the sea these are   women of variable uneven tempers sometimes all storm and tempest   sometimes all calm and sunshine the stranger who sees one of these in   her smiles and smoothness would cry her up for a miracle of good   humour but on a sudden her looks and her words are changed she is   nothing but fury and outrage noise and hurricane    the sixth species were made up of the ingredients which compose an   ass or a beast of burden these are naturally exceeding slothful   but upon the husbands exerting his authority will live upon hard   fare and do every thing to please him they are however far from   being averse to venereal pleasure and seldom refuse a male   companion    the cat furnished materials for a seventh species of women who are   of a melancholy froward unamiable nature and so repugnant to the   offers of love that they fly in the face of their husband when he   approaches them with conjugal endearments this species of women are   likewise subject to little thefts cheats and pilferings    the mare with a flowing mane which was never broke to any servile   toil and labour composed an eighth species of women these are they   who have little regard for their husbands who pass away their time in   dressing bathing and perfuming who throw their hair into the nicest   curls and trick it up with the fairest flowers and garlands a woman   of this species is a very pretty thing for a stranger to look upon   but very detrimental to the owner unless it be a king or prince who   takes a fancy to such a toy    the ninth species of females were taken out of the ape these are   such as are both ugly and illnatured who have nothing beautiful in   themselves and endeavour to detract from or ridicule every thing   which appears so in others    the tenth and last species of women were made out of the bee and   happy is the man who gets such an one for his wife she is altogether   faultless and unblameable her family flourishes and improves by her   good management she loves her husband and is beloved by him she   brings him a race of beautiful and virtuous children she   distinguishes her self among her sex she is surrounded with graces   she never sits among the loose tribe of women nor passes away her   time with them in wanton discourses she is full of virtue and   prudence and is the best wife that jupiter can bestow on man   i shall conclude these iambicks with the motto of this paper which is a fragment of the same author a man cannot possess any thing that is better than a good woman nor any thing that is worse than a bad one  as the poet has shewn a great penetration in this diversity of female characters he has avoided the fault which juvenal and monsieur boileau are guilty of the former in his sixth and the other in his last satyr where they have endeavoured to expose the sex in general without doing justice to the valuable part of it such levelling satyrs are of no use to the world and for this reason i have often wondered how the french author abovementioned who was a man of exquisite judgment and a lover of virtue could think human nature a proper subject for satyr in another of his celebrated pieces which is called the satyr upon man what vice or frailty can a discourse correct which censures the whole species alike and endeavours to shew by some superficial strokes of wit that brutes are the more excellent creatures of the two a satyr should expose nothing but what is corrigible and make a due discrimination between those who are and those who are not the proper objects of it  l

quæst      to the spectator    sir    i am fully persuaded that one of the best springs of generous and   worthy actions is the having generous and worthy thoughts of our   selves whoever has a mean opinion of the dignity of his nature will   act in no higher a rank than he has allotted himself in his own   estimation if he considers his being as circumscribed by the   uncertain term of a few years his designs will be contracted into the   same narrow span he imagines is to bound his existence how can he   exalt his thoughts to any thing great and noble who only believes   that after a short turn on the stage of this world he is to sink   into oblivion and to lose his consciousness for ever    for this reason i am of opinion that so useful and elevated a   contemplation as that of the souls immortality cannot be resumed   too often there is not a more improving exercise to the human mind   than to be frequently reviewing its own great privileges and   endowments nor a more effectual means to awaken in us an ambition   raised above low objects and little pursuits than to value our selves   as heirs of eternity    it is a very great satisfaction to consider the best and wisest of   mankind in all nations and ages asserting as with one voice this   their birthright and to find it ratifyd by an express revelation at   the same time if we turn our thoughts inward upon our selves we may   meet with a kind of secret sense concurring with the proofs of our own   immortality    you have in my opinion raised a good presumptive argument from the   increasing appetite the mind has to knowledge and to the extending   its own faculties which cannot be accomplished as the more   restrained perfection of lower creatures may in the limits of a short   life i think another probable conjecture may be raised from our   appetite to duration it self and from a reflection on our progress   through the several stages of it we are complaining as you observe   in a former speculation of the shortness of life and yet are   perpetually hurrying over the parts of it to arrive at certain little   settlements or imaginary points of rest which are dispersed up and   down in it    now let us consider what happens to us when we arrive at these   imaginary points of rest do we stop our motion and sit down   satisfied in the settlement we have gaind or are we not removing the   boundary and marking out new points of rest to which we press   forward with the like eagerness and which cease to be such as fast as   we attain them our case is like that of a traveller upon the alps   who should fancy that the top of the next hill must end his journey   because it terminates his prospect but he no sooner arrives as it   than he sees new ground and other hills beyond it and continues to   travel on as before      this is so plainly every mans condition in life that there is no   one who has observed any thing but may observe that as fast as his   time wears away his appetite to something future remains the use   therefore i would make of it is this that since nature as some love   to express it does nothing in vain or to speak properly since the   author of our being has planted no wandering passion in it no desire   which has not its object futurity is the proper object of the passion   so constantly exercisd about it and this restlessness in the   present this assigning our selves over to further stages of duration   this successive grasping at somewhat still to come appears to me   whatever it may to others as a kind of instinct or natural symptom   which the mind of man has of its own immortality    i take it at the same time for granted that the immortality of the   soul is sufficiently established by other arguments and if so this   appetite which otherwise would be very unaccountable and absurd   seems very reasonable and adds strength to the conclusion but i am   amazed when i consider there are creatures capable of thought who in   spite of every argument can form to themselves a sullen satisfaction   in thinking otherwise there is something so pitifully mean in the   inverted ambition of that man who can hope for annihilation and   please himself to think that his whole fabrick shall one day crumble   into dust and mix with the mass of inanimate beings that it equally   deserves our admiration and pity the mystery of such mens unbelief is   not hard to be penetrated and indeed amounts to nothing more than a   sordid hope that they shall not be immortal because they dare not be   so    this brings me back to my first observation and gives me occasion to   say further that as worthy actions spring from worthy thoughts so   worthy thoughts are likewise the consequence of worthy actions but   the wretch who has degraded himself below the character of   immortality is very willing to resign his pretensions to it and to   substitute in its room a dark negative happiness in the extinction of   his being    the admirable shakespear has given us a strong image of the   unsupported condition of such a person in his last minutes in the   second part of king henry the sixth where cardinal beaufort who   had been concerned in the murder of the good duke humphrey is   represented on his deathbed after some short confused speeches which   shew an imagination disturbed with guilt just as he is expiring king   henry standing by him full of compassion says      lord cardinal if thou thinkst on heavens bliss     hold up thy hand make signal of that hope     he dies and makes no sign    the despair which is here shewn without a word or action on the part   of the dying person is beyond what could be painted by the most   forcible expressions whatever    i shall not pursue this thought further but only add that as   annihilation is not to be had with a wish so it is the most abject   thing in the world to wish it what are honour fame wealth or power   when compared with the generous expectation of a being without end   and a happiness adequate to that being    i shall trouble you no further but with a certain gravity which   these thoughts have given me i reflect upon some things people say of   you as they will of men who distinguish themselves which i hope are   not true and wish you as good a man as you are an author    i am sir your most obedient humble servant t d    z    footnote

addison      fictis meminerit nos jocari fabulis    phæd    having lately translated the fragment of an old poet which describes womankind under several characters and supposes them to have drawn their different manners and dispositions from those animals and elements out of which he tells us they were compounded i had some thoughts of giving the sex their revenge by laying together in another paper the many vicious characters which prevail in the male world and shewing the different ingredients that go to the making up of such different humours and constitutions horace has a thought   which is something akin to this when in order to excuse himself to his mistress for an invective which he had written against her and to account for that unreasonable fury with which the heart of man is often transported he tells us that when prometheus made his man of clay in the kneading up of his heart he seasond it with some furious particles of the lion but upon turning this plan to and fro in my thoughts i observed so many unaccountable humours in man that i did not know out of what animals to fetch them male souls are diversifyd with so many characters that the world has not variety of materials sufficient to furnish out their different tempers and inclinations the creation with all its animals and elements would not be large enough to supply their several extravagancies  instead therefore of pursuing the thought of simonides i shall observe that as he has exposed the vicious part of women from the doctrine of præexistence some of the ancient philosophers have in a manner satirized the vicious part of the human species in general from a notion of the souls postexistence if i may so call it and that as simonides describes brutes entering into the composition of women others have represented human souls as entering into brutes this is commonly termed the doctrine of transmigration which supposes that human souls upon their leaving the body become the souls of such kinds of brutes as they most resemble in their manners or to give an account of it as mr dryden has described it in his translation of pythagoras his speech in the fifteenth book of ovid where that philosopher dissuades his hearers from eating flesh    thus all things are but alterd nothing dies   and here and there th unbodyd spirit flies   by time or force or sickness dispossessd   and lodges where it lights in bird or beast   or hunts without till ready limbs it find   and actuates those according to their kind   from tenement to tenement is tossd   the soul is still the same the figure

transmigrations as that the soul of orpheus who was musical melancholy and a womanhater entered into a swan the soul of ajax which was all wrath and fierceness into a lion the soul of agamemnon that was rapacious and imperial into an eagle and the soul of thersites who was a mimick and a buffoon into a monkey    mr congreve in a prologue to one of his comedies   has touchd upon this doctrine with

servants prythee child do not bluster he   had the impudence about an hour ago to tell me that he was a   seafaring man and must expect to divide his life between storm and   sunshine when i bestir myself with any spirit in my family it is   high sea in his house and when i sit still without doing any thing   his affairs forsooth are windbound when i ask him whether it   rains he makes answer it is no matter so that it be fair weather   within doors in short sir i cannot speak my mind freely to him but   i either swell or rage or do something that is not fit for a   civil woman to hear pray mr spectator since you are so sharp   upon other women let us know what materials your wife is made of if   you have one i suppose you would make us a parcel of poorspirited   tame insipid creatures but sir i would have you to know we have as   good passions in us as your self and that a woman was never designed   to be a milksop    martha tempest   l    footnote   odes i       footnote   in the

of the happiness sir   roger de coverley enjoys in having such a friend as you to expose in   proper colours the cruelty and perverseness of his mistress i have   very often wished you visited in our family and were acquainted with   my spouse she would afford you for some months at least matter enough   for one spectator a week since we are not so happy as to be of your   acquaintance give me leave to represent to you our present   circumstances as well as i can in writing you are to know then that i   am not of a very different constitution from nathaniel henroost   whom you have lately recorded in your speculations and have a wife   who makes a more tyrannical use of the knowledge of my easy temper   than that lady ever pretended to we had not been a month married   when she found in me a certain pain to give offence and an indolence   that made me bear little inconveniences rather than dispute about   them from this observation it soon came to that pass that if i   offered to go abroad she would get between me and the door kiss me   and say she could not part with me and then down again i sat in a   day or two after this first pleasant step towards confining me she   declared to me that i was all the world to her and she thought she   ought to be all the world to me if she said my dear loves me as   much as i love him he will never be tired of my company this   declaration was followed by my being denied to all my acquaintance   and it very soon came to that pass that to give an answer at the door   before my face the servants would ask her whether i was within or   not and she would answer no with great fondness and tell me i was a   good dear i will not enumerate more little circumstances to give you   a livelier sense of my condition but tell you in general that from   such steps as these at first i now live the life of a prisoner of   state my letters are opened and i have not the use of pen ink and   paper but in her presence i never go abroad except she sometimes   takes me with her in her coach to take the air if it may be called   so when we drive as we generally do with the glasses up i have   overheard my servants lament my condition but they dare not bring me   messages without her knowledge because they doubt my resolution to   stand by em in the midst of this insipid way of life an old   acquaintance of mine tom meggot who is a favourite with her and   allowed to visit me in her company because he sings prettily has   roused me to rebel and conveyed his intelligence to me in the   following manner my wife is a great pretender to musick and very   ignorant of it but far gone in the italian taste tom goes to   armstrong the famous fine writer of musick and desires him to put   this sentence of tully   in the scale of an italian air and   write it out for my spouse from him an ille mihi liber cui mulier   imperat cui leges imponit praescribit jubet vetat quod videtur   qui nihil imperanti negare nihil recusare audet poscit dandum est   vocat veniendum ejicit abeundum minitatur extimiscendum does he   live like a gentleman who is commanded by a woman he to whom she   gives law grants and denies what she pleases who can neither deny   her any thing she asks or refuse to do any thing she commands    to be short my wife was extremely pleased with it said the   italian was the only language for musick and admired how   wonderfully tender the sentiment was and how pretty the accent is of   that language with the rest that is said by rote on that occasion   mr meggot is sent for to sing this air which he performs with   mighty applause and my wife is in ecstasy on the occasion and glad   to find by my being so much pleased that i was at last come into the   notion of the italian for said she it grows upon one when one   once comes to know a little of the language and pray mr meggot   sing again those notes nihil imperanti negare nihil recusare you   may believe i was not a little delighted with my friend toms   expedient to alarm me and in obedience to his summons i give all this   story thus at large and i am resolved when this appears in the   spectator to declare for my self the manner of the insurrection i   contrive by your means which shall be no other than that tom   meggot who is at our teatable every morning shall read it to us   and if my dear can take the hint and say not one word but let this   be the beginning of a new life without farther explanation it is very   well for as soon as the spectator is read out i shall without   more ado call for the coach name the hour when i shall be at home   if i come at all if i do not they may go to dinner if my spouse   only swells and says nothing tom and i go out together and all is   well as i said before but if she begins to command or expostulate   you shall in my next to you receive a full account of her resistance   and submission for submit the dear thing must to    sir    your most

christianity if i may use that phrase to manage our actions to the best advantage and direct them in such a manner that every thing we do may turn to account at that great day when every thing we have done will be set before us  in order to give this consideration its full weight we may cast all our actions under the division of such as are in themselves either good evil or indifferent if we divide our intentions after the same manner and consider them with regard to our actions we may discover that great art and secret of religion which i have here mentioned  a good intention joined to a good action gives it its proper force and efficacy joined to an evil action extenuates its malignity and in some cases may take it wholly away and joined to an indifferent action turns it to a virtue and makes it meritorious as far as human actions can be so  in the next place to consider in the same manner the influence of an evil intention upon our actions an evil intention perverts the best of actions and makes them in reality what the fathers with a witty kind of zeal have termed the virtues of the heathen world so many shining sins it destroys the innocence of an indifferent action and gives an evil action all possible blackness and horror or in the emphatical language of sacred writ makes sin exceeding sinful    if in the last place we consider the nature of an indifferent intention we shall find that it destroys the merit of a good action abates but never takes away the malignity of an evil action and leaves an indifferent action in its natural state of indifference  it is therefore of unspeakable advantage to possess our minds with an habitual good intention and to aim all our thoughts words and actions at some laudable end whether it be the glory of our maker the good of mankind or the benefit of our own souls  this is a sort of thrift or goodhusbandry in moral life which does not throw away any single action but makes every one go as far as it can it multiplies the means of salvation increases the number of our virtues and diminishes that of our vices  there is something very devout though not solid in acostas answer to limborch   who objects to him the multiplicity of ceremonies in the jewish religion as washings dresses meats purgations and the like the reply which the jew makes upon this occasion is to the best of my remembrance as follows there are not duties enough says he in the essential parts of the law for a zealous and active obedience time place and person are requisite before you have an opportunity of putting a moral virtue into practice we have therefore says he enlarged the sphere of our duty and made many things which are in themselves indifferent a part of our religion that we may have more occasions of shewing our love to god and in all the circumstances of life be doing something to please him  monsieur st evremond has endeavoured to palliate the superstitions of the roman catholick religion with the same kind of apology where he pretends to consider the differing spirit of the papists and the calvinists as to the great points wherein they disagree he tells us that the former are actuated by love and the other by fear and that in their expressions of duty and devotion towards the supreme being the former seem particularly careful to do every thing which may possibly please him and the other to abstain from every thing which may possibly displease him    but notwithstanding this plausible reason with which both the jew and the roman catholick would excuse their respective superstitions it is certain there is something in them very pernicious to mankind and destructive to religion because the injunction of superfluous ceremonies makes such actions duties as were before indifferent and by that means renders religion more burdensome and difficult than it is in its own nature betrays many into sins of omission which they could not otherwise be guilty of and fixes the minds of the vulgar to the shadowy unessential points instead of the more weighty and more important matters of the law  this zealous and active obedience however takes place in the great point we are recommending for if instead of prescribing to our selves indifferent actions as duties we apply a good intention to all our most indifferent actions we make our very existence one continued act of obedience we turn our diversions and amusements to our eternal advantage and are pleasing him whom we are made to please in all the circumstances and occurrences of life  it is this excellent frame of mind this holy officiousness if i may be allowed to call it such which is recommended to us by the apostle in that uncommon precept wherein he directs us to propose to ourselves the glory of our creator in all our most indifferent actions whether we eat or drink or whatsoever we do    a person therefore who is possessed with such an habitual good intention as that which i have been here speaking of enters upon no single circumstance of life without considering it as wellpleasing to the great author of his being conformable to the dictates of reason suitable to human nature in general or to that particular station in which providence has placed him he lives in a perpetual sense of the divine presence regards himself as acting in the whole course of his existence under the observation and inspection of that being who is privy to all his motions and all his thoughts who knows all his downsitting and his uprising who is about his path and about his bed and spieth out all his ways   in a word he remembers that the eye of his judge is always upon him and in every action he reflects that he is doing what is commanded or allowed by him who will hereafter either reward or punish it this was the character of those holy men of old who in that beautiful phrase of scripture are said to have walked with god    when i employ myself upon a paper of morality i generally consider how i may recommend the particular virtue which i treat of by the precepts or examples of the ancient heathens by that means if possible to shame those who have greater advantages of knowing their duty and therefore greater obligations to perform it into a better course of life besides that many among us are unreasonably disposed to give a fairer hearing to a pagan philosopher than to a christian writer  i shall therefore produce an instance of this excellent frame of mind in a speech of socrates which is quoted by erasmus  this great philosopher on the day of his execution a little before the draught of poison was brought to him entertaining his friends with a discourse on the immortality of the soul has these words whether or no god will approve of my actions i know not but this i am sure of that i have at all times made it my endeavour to please him and i have a good hope that this my endeavour will be accepted by him we find in these words of that great man the habitual good intention which i would here inculcate and with which that divine philosopher always acted i shall only add that erasmus who was an unbigotted roman catholick was so much transported with this passage of socrates that he could scarce forbear looking upon him as a saint and desiring him to pray for him or as that ingenious and learned writer has expressed himself in a much more lively manner when i reflect on such a speech pronounced by such a person i can scarce forbear crying out sancte socrates ora pro nobis o holy socrates pray for us    l    footnote   rom vii      footnote   arnica collatio de veritate

thirtynine lashes recanted and lay across the threshold of the synagogue for all his brethren to walk over him afterwards he endeavoured to shoot his principal enemy but his pistol missed fire he had

of punctuality in the dealings of persons above them but there is a set of men who are much more the objects of compassion than even those and these are the dependants on great men whom they are pleased to take under their protection as such as are to share in their friendship and favour these indeed as well from the homage that is accepted from them as the hopes which are given to them are become a sort of creditors and these debts being debts of honour ought according to the accustomed maxim to be first discharged  when i speak of dependants i would not be understood to mean those who are worthless in themselves or who without any call will press into the company of their betters nor when i speak of patrons do i mean those who either have it not in their power or have no obligation to assist their friends but i speak of such leagues where there is power and obligation on the one part and merit and expectation on the other  the division of patron and client may i believe include a third of our nation the want of merit and real worth in the client will strike out about ninetynine in a hundred of these and the want of ability in patrons as many of that kind but however i must beg leave to say that he who will take up anothers time and fortune in his service though he has no prospect of rewarding his merit towards him is as unjust in his dealings as he who takes up goods of a tradesman without intention or ability to pay him of the few of the class which i think fit to consider there are not two in ten who succeed insomuch that i know a man of good sense who put his son to a blacksmith tho an offer was made him of his being received as a page to a man of quality  there are not more cripples come out of the wars than there are from those great services some through discontent lose their speech some their memories others their senses or their lives and i seldom see a man thoroughly discontented but i conclude he has had the favour of some great man i have known of such as have been for twenty years together within a month of a good employment but never arrived at the happiness of being possessed of any thing  there is nothing more ordinary than that a man who is got into a considerable station shall immediately alter his manner of treating all his friends and from that moment he is to deal with you as if he were your fate you are no longer to be consulted even in matters which concern your self but your patron is of a species above you and a free communication with you is not to be expected this perhaps may be your condition all the while he bears office and when that is at an end you are as intimate as ever you were and he will take it very ill if you keep the distance he prescribed you towards him in his grandeur one would think this should be a behaviour a man could fall into with the worst grace imaginable but they who know the world have seen it more than once i have often with secret pity heard the same man who has professed his abhorrence against all kind of passive behaviour lose minutes hours days and years in a fruitless attendance on one who had no inclination to befriend him it is very much to be regarded that the great have one particular privilege above the rest of the world of being slow in receiving impressions of kindness and quick in taking offence the elevation above the rest of mankind except in very great minds makes men so giddy that they do not see after the same manner they did before thus they despise their old friends and strive to extend their interests to new pretenders by this means it often happens that when you come to know how you lost such an employment you will find the man who got it never dreamed of it but forsooth he was to be surprized into it or perhaps sollicited to receive it upon such occasions as these a man may perhaps grow out of humour and if you are so all mankind will fall in with the patron and you are an humourist and untractable if you are capable of being sour at a disappointment but it is the same thing whether you do or do not resent ill usage you will be used after the same manner as some good mothers will be sure to whip their children till they cry and then whip them for crying  there are but two ways of doing any thing with great people and those are by making your self either considerable or agreeable the former is not to be attained but by finding a way to live without them or concealing that you want them the latter is only by falling into their taste and pleasures this is of all the employments in the world the most servile except it happens to be of your own natural humour for to be agreeable to another especially if he be above you is not to be possessed of such qualities and accomplishments as should render you agreeable in your self but such as make you agreeable in respect to him an imitation of his faults or a compliance if not subservience to his vices must be the measures of your conduct when it comes to that the unnatural state a man lives in when his patron pleases is ended and his guilt and complaisance are objected to him tho the man who rejects him for his vices was not only his partner but seducer thus the client like a young woman who has given up the innocence which made her charming has not only lost his time but also the virtue which could render him capable of resenting the injury which is done him  it would be endless to recount the tricks  of turning you off from themselves to persons who have less power to serve you the art of being sorry for such an unaccountable accident in your behaviour that such a one who perhaps has never heard of you opposes your advancement and if you have any thing more than ordinary in you you are flattered with a whisper that tis no wonder people are so slow in doing for a man of your talents and the like  after all this treatment i must still add the pleasantest insolence of all which i have once or twice seen to wit that when a silly rogue has thrown away one part in three of his life in unprofitable attendance it is taken wonderfully ill that he withdraws and is resolved to employ the rest for himself  when we consider these things and reflect upon so many honest natures which one who makes observation of what passes may have seen that have miscarried by such sort of applications it is too melancholy a scene to dwell upon therefore i shall take another opportunity to discourse of good patrons and distinguish such as have done their duty to those who have depended upon them and were not able to act without their favour worthy patrons are like platos guardian angels who are always doing good to their wards but negligent patrons are like epicuruss gods that lie lolling on the clouds and instead of blessings pour down storms and tempests on the heads of those that are offering incense to them      footnote    dulcis inexperta cultura potentis amici expertus metuit  hor   footnote   a son of one of the inferior gentry received as page by a nobleman wore his lords livery but had it of more costly materials than were used for the footmen and was the immediate attendant of his patron who was expected to give

ingenuas didicisse fideliter artes   emollit mores nec sinit esse feros    ov    i consider an human soul without education like marble in the quarry which shews none of its inherent beauties till the skill of the polisher fetches out the colours makes the surface shine and discovers every ornamental cloud spot and vein that runs through the body of it education after the same manner when it works upon a noble mind draws out to view every latent virtue and perfection which without such helps are never able to make their appearance  if my reader will give me leave to change the allusion so soon upon him i shall make use of the same instance to illustrate the force of education which aristotle has brought to explain his doctrine of substantial forms when he tells us that a statue lies hid in a block of marble and that the art of the statuary only clears away the superfluous matter and removes the rubbish the figure is in the stone the sculptor only finds it what sculpture is to a block of marble education is to a human soul the philosopher the saint or the hero the wise the good or the great man very often lie hid and concealed in a plebeian which a proper education might have disinterred and have brought to light i am therefore much delighted with reading the accounts of savage nations and with contemplating those virtues which are wild and uncultivated to see courage exerting it self in fierceness resolution in obstinacy wisdom in cunning patience in sullenness and despair  mens passions operate variously and appear in different kinds of actions according as they are more or less rectified and swayed by reason when one hears of negroes who upon the death of their masters or upon changing their service hang themselves upon the next tree as it frequently happens in our american plantations who can forbear admiring their fidelity though it expresses it self in so dreadful a manner what might not that savage greatness of soul which appears in these poor wretches on many occasions be raised to were it rightly cultivated and what colour of excuse can there be for the contempt with which we treat this part of our species that we should not put them upon the common foot of humanity that we should only set an insignificant fine upon the man who murders them nay that we should as much as in us lies cut them off from the prospects of happiness in another world as well as in this and deny them that which we look upon as the proper means for attaining it  since i am engaged on this subject i cannot forbear mentioning a story which i have lately heard and which is so well attested that i have no manner of reason to suspect the truth of it i may call it a kind of wild tragedy that passed about twelve years ago at st christophers one of our british leeward islands the negroes who were the persons concerned in it were all of them the slaves of a gentleman who is now in england  this gentleman among his negroes had a young woman who was lookd upon as a most extraordinary beauty by those of her own complexion he had at the same time two young fellows who were likewise negroes and slaves remarkable for the comeliness of their persons and for the friendship which they bore to one another it unfortunately happened that both of them fell in love with the female negro above mentioned who would have been very glad to have taken either of them for her husband provided they could agree between themselves which should be the man but they were both so passionately in love with her that neither of them could think of giving her up to his rival and at the same time were so true to one another that neither of them would think of gaining her without his friends consent the torments of these two lovers were the discourse of the family to which they belonged who could not forbear observing the strange complication of passions which perplexed the hearts of the poor negroes that often dropped expressions of the uneasiness they underwent and how impossible it was for either of them ever to be happy  after a long struggle between love and friendship truth and jealousy they one day took a walk together into a wood carrying their mistress along with them where after abundance of lamentations they stabbed her to the heart of which she immediately died a slave who was at his work not far from the place where this astonishing piece of cruelty was committed hearing the shrieks of the dying person ran to see what was the occasion of them he there discovered the woman lying dead upon the ground with the two negroes on each side of her kissing the dead corps weeping over it and beating their breasts in the utmost agonies of grief and despair he immediately ran to the english family with the news of what he had seen who upon coming to the place saw the woman dead and the two negroes expiring by her with wounds they had given themselves  we see in this amazing instance of barbarity what strange disorders are bred in the minds of those men whose passions are not regulated by virtue and disciplined by reason though the action which i have recited is in it self full of guilt and horror it proceeded from a temper of mind which might have produced very noble fruits had it been informed and guided by a suitable education  it is therefore an unspeakable blessing to be born in those parts of the world where wisdom and knowledge flourish tho it must be confest there are even in these parts several poor uninstructed persons who are but little above the inhabitants of those nations of which i have been here speaking as those who have had the advantages of a more liberal education rise above one another by several different degrees of perfection for to return to our statue in the block of marble we see it sometimes only begun to be chipped sometimes roughhewn and but just sketched into an human figure sometimes we see the man appearing distinctly in all his limbs and features sometimes we find the figure wrought up to a great elegancy but seldom meet with any to which the hand of a phidias or praxiteles could not give several nice touches and finishings  discourses of morality and reflections upon human nature are the best means we can make use of to improve our minds and gain a true knowledge of our selves and consequently to recover our souls out of the vice ignorance and prejudice which naturally cleave to them i have all along profest myself in this paper a promoter of these great ends and i flatter my self that i do from day to day contribute something to the polishing of mens minds at least my design is laudable whatever the execution may be i must confess i am not a little encouraged in it by many letters which i receive from unknown hands in approbation of my endeavours and must take this opportunity of returning my thanks to those who write them and excusing my self for not inserting several of them in my papers which i am sensible would be a very great ornament to them should i publish the praises which are so well penned they would do honour to the persons who write them but my publishing of them would i fear be a sufficient instance to the world that i did not deserve them

delight the darling and ornament of a man of honour useful and   esteemed by his friends and i no longer one that has buried some   merit in the world in compliance to a froward humour which has grown   upon an agreeable woman by his indulgence mr freeman ended this   with a tenderness in his aspect and a downcast eye which shewed he   was extremely moved at the anguish he saw her in for she sat swelling   with passion and her eyes firmly fixed on the fire when i fearing   he would lose all again took upon me to provoke her out of that   amiable sorrow she was in to fall upon me upon which i said very   seasonably for my friend that indeed mr freeman was become the   common talk of the town and that nothing was so much a jest as when   it was said in company mr freeman had promised to come to such a   place upon which the good lady turned her softness into downright   rage and threw the scalding teakettle upon your humble servant flew   into the middle of the room and cried out she was the unfortunatest   of all women others kept family dissatisfactions for hours of privacy   and retirement no apology was to be made to her no expedient to be   found no previous manner of breaking what was amiss in her but all   the world was to be acquainted with her errors without the least   admonition mr freeman was going to make a softning speech but i   interposed look you madam i have nothing to say to this matter but   you ought to consider you are now past a chicken this humour which   was well enough in a girl is insufferable in one of your motherly   character with that she lost all patience and flew directly at her   husbands periwig i got her in my arms and defended my friend he   making signs at the same time that it was too much i beckoning   nodding and frowning over her shoulder that he was lost if he did   not persist in this manner we flew round and round the room in a   moment till the lady i spoke of above and servants entered upon   which she fell on a couch as breathless i still kept up my friend   but he with a very silly air bid them bring the coach to the door   and we went off i forced to bid the coachman drive on we were no   sooner come to my lodgings but all his wifes relations came to   enquire after him and mrs freemans mother writ a note wherein   she thought never to have seen this day and so forth    in a word sir i am afraid we are upon a thing we have no talents   for and i can observe already my friend looks upon me rather as a   man that knows a weakness of him that he is ashamed of than one who   has rescud him from slavery mr spectator i am but a young fellow   and if mr freeman submits i shall be looked upon as an incendiary   and never get a wife as long as i breathe he has indeed sent word   home he shall lie at hampstead tonight but i believe fear of the   first onset after this rupture has too great a place in this   resolution mrs freeman has a very pretty sister suppose i   delivered him up and articled with the mother for her for bringing   him home if he has not courage to stand it you are a great casuist   is it such an ill thing to bring my self off as well as i can what   makes me doubt my man is that i find he thinks it reasonable to   expostulate at least with her and capt sentrey will tell you if you   let your orders be disputed you are no longer a commander i wish you   could advise me

correspondents the first of them is the description of a club whether real or imaginary i cannot determine but am apt to fancy that the writer of it whoever she is has formed a kind of nocturnal orgie out of her own fancy whether this be so or not her letter may conduce to the amendment of that kind of persons who are represented in it and whose characters are frequent enough in the world      mr spectator    in some of your first papers you were pleased to give the publick a   very diverting account of several clubs and nocturnal assemblies but   i am a member of a society which has wholly escaped your notice i   mean a club of sheromps we take each a hackneycoach and meet once   a week in a large upper chamber which we hire by the year for that   purpose our landlord and his family who are quiet people constantly   contriving to be abroad on our clubnight we are no sooner come   together than we throw off all that modesty and reservedness with   which our sex are obliged to disguise themselves in publick places i   am not able to express the pleasure we enjoy from ten at night till   four in the morning in being as rude as you men can be for your   lives as our play runs high the room is immediately filled with   broken fans torn petticoats lappets of headdresses flounces   furbelows garters and workingaprons i had forgot to tell you at   first that besides the coaches we come in our selves there is one   which stands always empty to carry off our dead men for so we call   all those fragments and tatters with which the room is strewed and   which we pack up together in bundles and put into the aforesaid coach   it is no small diversion for us to meet the next night at some   members chamber where every one is to pick out what belonged to her   from this confused bundle of silks stuffs laces and ribbons i have   hitherto given you an account of our diversion on ordinary   clubnights but must acquaint you farther that once a month we   demolish a prude that is we get some queer formal creature in   among us and unrig her in an instant our last months prude was so   armed and fortified in whalebone and buckram that we had much ado to   come at her but you would have died with laughing to have seen how   the sober awkward thing looked when she was forced out of her   intrenchments in short sir tis impossible to give you a true notion   of our sports unless you would come one night amongst us and tho it   be directly against the rules of our society to admit a male visitant   we repose so much confidence in your silence and taciturnity   that was agreed by the whole club at our last meeting to give you   entrance for one night as a spectator    i am your humble servant    kitty termagant    p s we shall demolish a prude next thursday  tho i thank kitty for her kind offer i do not at present find in my self any inclination to venture my person with her and her romping companions i should regard my self as a second clodius intruding on the mysterious rites of the bona dea and should apprehend being demolished as much as the prude  the following letter comes from a gentleman whose taste i find is much too delicate to endure the least advance towards romping i may perhaps hereafter improve upon the hint he has given me and make it the subject of a whole spectator in the mean time take it as it follows in his own words     mr spectator    it is my misfortune to be in love with a young creature who is daily   committing faults which though they give me the utmost uneasiness i   know not how to reprove her for or even acquaint her with she is   pretty dresses well is rich and goodhumourd but either wholly   neglects or has no notion of that which polite people have agreed to   distinguish by the name of delicacy after our return from a walk   the other day she threw her self into an elbowchair and professed   before a large company that she was all over in a sweat she told   me this afternoon that her stomach aked and was complaining   yesterday at dinner of something that stuck in her teeth i treated   her with a basket of fruit last summer which she eat so very   greedily as almost made me resolve never to see her more in short   sir i begin to tremble whenever i see her about to speak or move as   she does not want sense if she takes these hints i am happy if not   i am more than afraid that these things which shock me even in the   behaviour of a mistress will appear insupportable in that of a wife    i am sir yours c   my next letter comes from a correspondent whom i cannot but very much value upon the account which she gives of her self     mr spectator    i am happily arrived at a state of tranquillity which few people   envy i mean that of an old maid therefore being wholly unconcerned   in all that medley of follies which our sex is apt to contract from   their silly fondness of yours i read your railleries on us without   provocation i can say with hamlet     man delights not me     nor woman neither    therefore dear sir as you never spare your own sex do not be afraid   of reproving what is ridiculous in ours and you will oblige at least   one woman who is    your humble servant susannah frost      mr spectator    i am wife to a clergyman and cannot help thinking that in your tenth   or tithecharacter of womankind   you meant my self therefore i   have no

       steele      quid de quoque viro et cui dicas sæpe caveto    hor    i happened the other day as my way is to strole into a little coffeehouse beyond aldgate and as i sat there two or three very plain sensible men were talking of the spectator one said he had that morning drawn the great benefit ticket another wished he had but a third shaked his head and said it was pity that the writer of that paper was such a sort of man that it was no great matter whether he had it or no he is it seems said the good man the most extravagant creature in the world has run through vast sums and yet been in continual want a man for all he talks so well of oeconomy unfit for any of the offices of life by reason of his profuseness it would be an unhappy thing to be his wife his child or his friend and yet he talks as well of those duties of life as any one much reflection has brought me to so easy a contempt for every thing which is false that this heavy accusation gave me no manner of uneasiness but at the same time it threw me into deep thought upon the subject of fame in general and i could not but pity such as were so weak as to value what the common people say out of their own talkative temper to the advantage or diminution of those whom they mention without being moved either by malice or goodwill it will be too long to expatiate upon the sense all mankind have of fame and the inexpressible pleasure which there is in the approbation of worthy men to all who are capable of worthy actions but methinks one may divide the general word fame into three different species as it regards the different orders of mankind who have any thing to do with it fame therefore may be divided into glory which respects the hero reputation which is preserved by every gentleman and credit which must be supported by every tradesman these possessions in fame are dearer than life to these characters of men or rather are the life of those characters glory while the hero pursues great and noble enterprizes is impregnable and all the assailants of his renown do but shew their pain and impatience of its brightness without throwing the least shade upon it if the foundation of an high name be virtue and service all that is offered against it is but rumour which is too shortlivd to stand up in competition with glory which is everlasting  reputation which is the portion of every man who would live with the elegant and knowing part of mankind is as stable as glory if it be as well founded and the common cause of human society is thought concerned when we hear a man of good behaviour calumniated besides which according to a prevailing custom amongst us every man has his defence in his own arm and reproach is soon checked put out of countenance and overtaken by disgrace  the most unhappy of all men and the most exposed to the malignity or wantonness of the common voice is the trader credit is undone in whispers the tradesmans wound is received from one who is more private and more cruel than the ruffian with the lanthorn and dagger the manner of repeating a mans name as mr cash oh do you leave your money at his shop why do you know mr searoom he is indeed a general merchant i say i have seen from the iteration of a mans name hiding one thought of him and explaining what you hide by saying something to his advantage when you speak a merchant hurt in his credit and him who every day he lived literally added to the value of his native country undone by one who was only a burthen and a blemish to it since every body who knows the world is sensible of this great evil how careful ought a man to be in his language of a merchant it may possibly be in the power of a very shallow creature to lay the ruin of the best family in the most opulent city and the more so the more highly he deserves of his country that is to say the farther he places his wealth out of his hands to draw home that of another climate  in this case an ill word may change plenty into want and by a rash sentence a free and generous fortune may in a few days be reduced to beggary how little does a giddy prater imagine that an idle phrase to the disfavour of a merchant may be as pernicious in the consequence as the forgery of a deed to bar an inheritance would be to a gentleman land stands where it did before a gentleman was calumniated and the state of a great action is just as it was before calumny was offered to diminish it and there is time place and occasion expected to unravel all that is contrived against those characters but the trader who is ready only for probable demands upon him can have no armour against the inquisitive the malicious and the envious who are prepared to fill the cry to his dishonour fire and sword are slow engines of destruction in comparison of the babbler in the case of the merchant  for this reason i thought it an imitable piece of humanity of a gentleman of my acquaintance who had great variety of affairs and used to talk with warmth enough against gentlemen by whom he thought himself ill dealt with but he would never let any thing be urged against a merchant with whom he had any difference except in a court of justice he used to say that to speak ill of a merchant was to begin his suit with judgment and execution one cannot i think say more on this occasion than to repeat that the merit of the merchant is above that of all other subjects for while he is untouched in his credit his handwriting is a more portable coin for the service of his fellowcitizens and his word the gold of ophir to the country wherein he resides  t                                               no                    saturday nov  0                   addison      vix ea nostra voco    ov    there are but few men who are not ambitious of distinguishing themselves in the nation or country where they live and of growing considerable among those with whom they converse there is a kind of grandeur and respect which the meanest and most insignificant part of mankind endeavour to procure in the little circle of their friends and acquaintance the poorest mechanick nay the man who lives upon common alms gets him his set of admirers and delights in that superiority which he enjoys over those who are in some respects beneath him this ambition which is natural to the soul of man might methinks receive a very happy turn and if it were rightly directed contribute as much to a persons advantage as it generally does to his uneasiness and disquiet  i shall therefore put together some thoughts on this subject which i have not met with in other writers and shall set them down as they have occurred to me without being at the pains to connect or methodise them  all superiority and preeminence that one man can have over another may be reduced to the notion of quality which considered at large is either that of fortune body or mind the first is that which consists in birth title or riches and is the most foreign to our natures and what we can the least call our own of any of the three kinds of quality in relation to the body quality arises from health strength or beauty which are nearer to us and more a part of our selves than the former quality as it regards the mind has its rise from knowledge or virtue and is that which is more essential to us and more intimately united with us than either of the other two  the quality of fortune tho a man has less reason to value himself upon it than on that of the body or mind is however the kind of quality which makes the most shining figure in the eye of the world  as virtue is the most reasonable and genuine source of honour we generally find in titles an imitation of some particular merit that should recommend men to the high stations which they possess holiness is ascribed to the pope majesty to kings serenity or mildness of temper to princes excellence or perfection to ambassadors grace to archbishops honour to peers worship or venerable behaviour to magistrates and reverence which is of the same import as the former to the inferior clergy  in the founders of great families such attributes of honour are generally correspondent with the virtues of the person to whom they are applied but in the descendants they are too often the marks rather of grandeur than of merit the stamp and denomination still continues but the intrinsick value is frequently lost  the deathbed shews the emptiness of titles in a true light a poor dispirited sinner lies trembling under the apprehensions of the state he is entring on and is asked by a grave attendant how his holiness does another hears himself addressed to under the title of highness or excellency who lies under such mean circumstances of mortality as are the disgrace of human nature titles at such a time look rather like insults and mockery than respect  the truth of it is honours are in this world under no regulation true quality is neglected virtue is oppressed and vice triumphant the last day will rectify this disorder and assign to every one a station suitable to the dignity of his character ranks will be then adjusted and precedency set right  methinks we should have an ambition if not to advance our selves in another world at least to preserve our post in it and outshine our inferiors in virtue here that they may not be put above us in a state which is to settle the distinction for eternity  men in scripture are called strangers and sojourners upon earth and life a pilgrimage several heathen as well as christian authors under the same kind of metaphor have represented the world as an inn which was only designed to furnish us with accommodations in this our passage it is therefore very absurd to think of setting up our rest before we come to our journeys end and not rather to take care of the reception we shall there meet than to fix our thoughts on the little conveniences and advantages which we enjoy one above another in the way to it  epictetus makes use of another kind of allusion which is very beautiful and wonderfully proper to incline us to be satisfied with the post in which providence has placed us we are here says he as in a theatre where every one has a part allotted to him the great duty which lies upon a man is to act his part in perfection we may indeed say that our part does not suit us and that we could act another better but this says the philosopher is not our business all that we are concerned in is to excel in the part which is given us if it be an improper one the fault is not in us but in him who has cast our several parts and is the great disposer of the drama    the part that was acted by this philosopher himself was but a very indifferent one for he lived and died a slave his motive to contentment in this particular receives a very great inforcement from the abovementioned consideration if we remember that our parts in the other world will be new cast and that mankind will be there ranged in different stations of superiority and præeminence in proportion as they have here excelled one another in virtue and performed in their several posts of life the duties which belong to them  there are many beautiful passages in the little apocryphal book entitled the wisdom of solomon to set forth the vanity of honour and the like temporal blessings which are in so great repute among men and to comfort those who have not the possession of them it represents in very warm and noble terms this advancement of a good man in the other world and the great surprize which it will produce among those who are his superiors in this then shall the righteous man stand in great boldness before the face of such as have afflicted him and made no account of his labours when they see it they shall be troubled with terrible fear and shall be amazed at the strangeness of his salvation so far beyond all that they looked for and they repenting and groaning for anguish of spirit shall say within themselves this was he whom we had sometime in derision and a proverb of reproach we fools accounted his life madness and his end to be without honour how is he numbered among the children of god and his lot is among the saints    if the reader would see the description of a life that is passed away in vanity and among the shadows of pomp and greatness he may see it very finely drawn in the same place   in the mean time since it is necessary in the present constitution of things that order and distinction should be kept in the world we should be happy if those who enjoy the upper stations in it would endeavour to surpass others in virtue as much as in rank and by their humanity and condescension make their superiority easy and acceptable to those who are beneath them and if on the contrary those who are in meaner posts of life would consider how they may better their condition hereafter and by a just deference and submission to their superiors make them happy in those blessings with which providence has thought fit to distinguish them  c    footnote   epict enchirid ch      footnote   wisd ch v      footnote   ch v                                                   no   0

exhaust so fertile a subject if you would think fit   to resume it the following instances may if you think fit be added   by way of appendix to your discourses on that subject    that feat of poetical activity mentioned by horace of an author   who could compose two hundred verses while he stood upon one leg     has been imitated as i have heard by a modern writer who priding   himself on the hurry of his invention thought it no small addition to   his fame to have each piece minuted with the exact number of hours or   days it cost him in the composition he could taste no praise till he   had acquainted you in how short space of time he had deserved it and   was not so much led to an ostentation of his art as of his dispatch     accipe si vis     accipe jam tabulas detur nobis locus hora     custodes videamus uter plus scribere possit      hor    this was the whole of his ambition and therefore i cannot but think   the flights of this rapid author very proper to be opposed to those   laborious nothings which you have observed were the delight of the   german wits and in which they so happily got rid of such a tedious   quantity of their time    i have known a gentleman of another turn of humour who despising   the name of an author never printed his works but contracted his   talent and by the help of a very fine diamond which he wore on his   little finger was a considerable poet upon glass he had a very good   epigrammatick wit and there was not a parlour or tavern window where   he visited or dined for some years which did not receive some   sketches or memorials of it it was his misfortune at last to lose his   genius and his ring to a sharper at play and he has not attempted to   make a verse since    but of all contractions or expedients for wit i admire that of an   ingenious projector whose book i have seen   this virtuoso being a   mathematician has according to his taste thrown the art of poetry   into a short problem and contrived tables by which any one without   knowing a word of grammar or sense may to his great comfort be able   to compose or rather to erect latin verses his tables are a kind of   poetical logarithms which being divided into several squares and all   inscribed with so many incoherent words appear to the eye somewhat   like a fortunetelling screen what a joy must it be to the unlearned   operator to find that these words being carefully collected and writ   down in order according to the problem start of themselves into   hexameter and pentameter verses a friend of mine who is a student in   astrology meeting with this book performed the operation by the   rules there set down he shewed his verses to the next of his   acquaintance who happened to understand latin and being informed   they described a tempest of wind very luckily prefixed them together   with a translation to an almanack he was just then printing and was   supposed to have foretold the last great storm      i think the only improvement beyond this would be that which the   late duke of buckingham mentioned to a stupid pretender to poetry   as the project of a dutch mechanick viz a mill to make verses   this being the most compendious method of all which have yet been   proposed may deserve the thoughts of our modern virtuosi who are   employed in new discoveries for the publick good and it may be worth   the while to consider whether in an island where few are content   without being thought wits it will not be a common benefit that wit   as well as labour should be made cheap    i am sir your humble servant c

freedom and indifference   which they do all the rest of the world and not to drink to one   another only but sometimes cast a kind look with their service to    sir your humble servant     mr

ovo   usque ad mala    hor   when i have finished any of my speculations it is my method to consider which of the ancient authors have touched upon the subject that i treat of by this means i meet with some celebrated thought upon it or a thought of my own expressed in better words or some similitude for the illustration of my subject this is what gives birth to the motto of a speculation which i rather chuse to take out of the poets than the prosewriters as the former generally give a finer turn to a thought than the latter and by couching it in few words and in harmonious numbers make it more portable to the memory  my reader is therefore sure to meet with at least one good line in every paper and very often finds his imagination entertained by a hint that awakens in his memory some beautiful passage of a classick author  it was a saying of an ancient philosopher which i find some of our writers have ascribed to queen elizabeth who perhaps might have taken occasion to repeat it that a good face is a letter of recommendation   it naturally makes the beholders inquisitive into the person who is the owner of it and generally prepossesses them in his favour a handsome motto has the same effect besides that it always gives a supernumerary beauty to a paper and is sometimes in a manner necessary when the writer is engaged in what may appear a paradox to vulgar minds as it shews that he is supported by good authorities and is not singular in his opinion  i must confess the motto is of little use to an unlearned reader for which reason i consider it only as a word to the wise but as for my unlearned friends if they cannot relish the motto i take care to make provision for them in the body of my paper if they do not understand the sign that is hung out they know very well by it that they may meet with entertainment in the house and i think i was never better pleased than with a plain mans compliment who upon his friends telling him that he would like the spectator much better if he understood the motto replied that good wine needs no bush  i have heard of a couple of preachers in a country town who endeavoured which should outshine one another and draw together the greatest congregation one of them being well versed in the fathers used to quote every now and then a latin sentence to his illiterate hearers who it seems found themselves so edified by it that they flocked in greater numbers to this learned man than to his rival the other finding his congregation mouldering every sunday and hearing at length what was the occasion of it resolved to give his parish a little latin in his turn but being unacquainted with any of the fathers he digested into his sermons the whole book of quæ genus adding however such explications to it as he thought might be for the benefit of his people he afterwards entered upon as in præsenti   which he converted in the same manner to the use of his parishioners this in a very little time thickned his audience filled his church and routed his antagonist  the natural love to latin which is so prevalent in our common people makes me think that my speculations fare never the worse among them for that little scrap which appears at the head of them and what the more encourages me in the use of quotations in an unknown tongue is that i hear the ladies whose approbation i value more than that of the whole learned world declare themselves in a more particular manner pleased with my greek mottos  designing this days work for a dissertation upon the two extremities of my paper and having already dispatchd my motto i shall in the next place discourse upon those single capital letters which are placed at the end of it and which have afforded great matter of speculation to the curious i have heard various conjectures upon this subject some tell us that c is the mark of those papers that are written by the clergyman though others ascribe them to the club in general that the papers marked with r were written by my friend sir roger that l signifies the lawyer whom i have described in my second speculation and that t stands for the trader or merchant but the letter x which is placed at the end of some few of my papers is that which has puzzled the whole town as they cannot think of any name which begins with that letter except xenophon and xerxes who can neither of them be supposed to have had any hand in these speculations  in answer to these inquisitive gentlemen who have many of them made enquiries of me by letter i must tell them the reply of an ancient philosopher who carried something

wondered to find my self disappointed the rather because i   think it a subject every way agreeable to your design and by being   left unattempted by others seems reserved as a proper employment for   you i mean a disquisition from whence it proceeds that men of the   brightest parts and most comprehensive genius compleatly furnished   with talents for any province in humane affairs such as by their wise   lessons of oeconomy to others have made it evident that they have the   justest notions of life and of true sense in the conduct of it from   what unhappy contradictious cause it proceeds that persons thus   finished by nature and by art should so often fail in the management   of that which they so well understand and want the address to make a   right application of their own rules this is certainly a prodigious   inconsistency in behaviour and makes much such a figure in morals as   a monstrous birth in naturals with this difference only which   greatly aggravates the wonder that it happens much more frequently   and what a blemish does it cast upon wit and learning in the general   account of the world and in how disadvantageous a light does it   expose them to the busy class of mankind that there should be so many   instances of persons who have so conducted their lives in spite of   these transcendent advantages as neither to be happy in themselves   nor useful to their friends when every body sees it was entirely in   their own power to be eminent in both these characters for my part i   think there is no reflection more astonishing than to consider one of   these gentlemen spending a fair fortune running in every bodys debt   without the least apprehension of a future reckoning and at last   leaving not only his own children but possibly those of other people   by his means in starving circumstances while a fellow whom one   would scarce suspect to have a humane soul shall perhaps raise a vast   estate out of nothing and be the founder of a family capable of being   very considerable in their country and doing many illustrious   services to it that this observation is just experience has put   beyond all dispute but though the fact be so evident and glaring yet   the causes of it are still in the dark which makes me persuade my   self that it would be no unacceptable piece of entertainment to the   town to inquire into the hidden sources of so unaccountable an evil   i am sir your most humble servant    what this correspondent wonders at has been matter of admiration ever since there was any such thing as humane life horace reflects upon this inconsistency very agreeably in the character of tigellius whom he makes a mighty pretender to oeconomy and tells you you might one day hear him speak the most philosophick things imaginable concerning being contented with a little and his contempt of every thing but mere necessaries and in half a week after spend a thousand pound when he says this of him with relation to expence he describes him as unequal to himself in every other circumstance of life and indeed if we consider lavish men carefully we shall find it always proceeds from a certain incapacity of possessing themselves and finding enjoyment in their own minds mr dryden has expressed this very excellently in the character of zimri      a man so various that he seemd to be   not one but all

that indeed they are not so contemptible as they deserve tully says it is the greatest of wickedness to lessen your paternal estate and if a man would thoroughly consider how much worse than banishment it must be to his child to ride by the estate which should have been his had it not been for his fathers injustice to him he would be smitten with the reflection more deeply than can be understood by any but one who is a father sure there can be nothing more afflicting than to think it had been happier for his son to have been born of any other man living than himself  it is not perhaps much thought of but it is certainly a very important lesson to learn how to enjoy ordinary life and to be able to relish your being without the transport of some passion or gratification of some appetite for want of this capacity the world is filled with whetters tipplers cutters sippers and all the numerous train of those who for want of thinking are forced to be ever exercising their

quite disjointed and broken into pieces while some have wholly escaped the common wreck but the number of the last is very small    apparent rari nantes in gurgite vasto  among the mutilated poets of antiquity there is none whose fragments are so beautiful as those of sappho they give us a taste of her way of writing which is perfectly conformable with that extraordinary character we find of her in the remarks of those great criticks who were conversant with her works when they were entire one may see by what is left of them that she followed nature in all her thoughts without descending to those little points conceits and turns of wit with which many of our modern lyricks are so miserably infected her soul seems to have been made up of love and poetry she felt the passion in all its warmth and described it in all its symptoms she is called by ancient authors the tenth muse and by plutarch is compared to cacus the son of vulcan who breathed out nothing but flame i do not know by the character that is given of her works whether it is not for the benefit of mankind that they are lost they were filled with such bewitching tenderness and rapture that it might have been dangerous to have given them a reading  an inconstant lover called phaon occasioned great calamities to this poetical lady she fell desperately in love with him and took a voyage into sicily in pursuit of him he having withdrawn himself thither on purpose to avoid her it was in that island and on this occasion she is supposed to have made the hymn to venus with a translation of which i shall present my reader her hymn was ineffectual for the procuring that happiness which she prayed for in it phaon was still obdurate and sappho so transported with the violence of her passion that she was resolved to get rid of it at any price  there was a promontory in acarnania called leucrate   on the top of which was a little temple dedicated to apollo in this temple it was usual for despairing lovers to make their vows in secret and afterwards to fling themselves from the top of the precipice into the sea where they were sometimes taken up alive this place was therefore called the lovers leap and whether or no the fright they had been in or the resolution that could push them to so dreadful a remedy or the bruises which they often received in their fall banished all the tender sentiments of love and gave their spirits another turn those who had taken this leap were observed never to relapse into that passion sappho tried the cure but perished in the experiment  after having given this short account of sappho so far as it regards the following ode i shall subjoin the translation of it as it was sent me by a friend whose admirable pastorals and winterpiece have been already so well received   the reader will find in it that pathetick simplicity which is so peculiar to him and so suitable to the ode he has here translated this ode in the greek besides those beauties observed by madam dacier has several harmonious turns in the words which are not lost in the english i must farther add that the translation has preserved every image and sentiment of sappho notwithstanding it has all the ease and spirit of an original in a word if the ladies have a mind to know the manner of writing practised by the so much celebrated sappho they may here see it in its genuine and natural beauty without any foreign or affected ornaments     an hymn to venus   i    o venus beauty of the skies       to whom a thousand temples rise       gayly false in gentle smiles       full of loves

remain       bore back their empty carr again       then you with looks divinely mild       in evry heavnly feature smild       and askd what new complaints i made       and why i calld you to my aid

described as sending away her chariot upon her arrival at sapphos lodgings to denote that it was not a short transient visit which she intended to make her this ode was preserved by an eminent greek critick   who inserted it intire in his works as a pattern of perfection in the structure of it  longinus has quoted another ode of this great poetess which is likewise admirable in its kind and has been translated by the same hand with the foregoing one i shall oblige my reader with it in another paper in the mean while i cannot but wonder that these two finished pieces have never been attempted before by any of our countrymen but the truth of it is the compositions of the ancients which have not in them any of those unnatural witticisms that are the delight of ordinary readers are extremely

mankind and endeavour to trace out the principles of action in every individual it will i think seem highly probable that ambition runs through the whole species and that every man in proportion to the vigour of his complection is more or less actuated by it it is indeed no uncommon thing to meet with men who by the natural bent of their inclinations and without the discipline of philosophy aspire not to the heights of power and grandeur who never set their hearts upon a numerous train of clients and dependancies nor other gay appendages of greatness who are contented with a competency and will not molest their tranquillity to gain an abundance but it is not therefore to be concluded that such a man is not ambitious his desires may have cut out another channel and determined him to other pursuits the motive however may be still the same and in these cases likewise the man may be equally pushed on with the desire of distinction  though the pure consciousness of worthy actions abstracted from the views of popular applause be to a generous mind an ample reward yet the desire of distinction was doubtless implanted in our natures as an additional incentive to exert our selves in virtuous excellence  this passion indeed like all others is frequently perverted to evil and ignoble purposes so that we may account for many of the excellencies and follies of life upon the same innate principle to wit the desire of being remarkable for this as it has been differently cultivated by education study and converse will bring forth suitable effects as it falls in with an ingenuous   disposition or a corrupt mind it does accordingly express itself in acts of magnanimity or selfish cunning as it meets with a good or a weak understanding as it has been employed in embellishing the mind or adorning the outside it renders the man eminently praiseworthy or ridiculous ambition therefore is not to be confined only to one passion or pursuit for as the same humours in constitutions otherwise different affect the body after different manners so the same aspiring principle within us sometimes breaks forth upon one object sometimes upon another  it cannot be doubted but that there is as great desire of glory in a ring of wrestlers or cudgelplayers as in any other more refined competition for superiority no man that could avoid it would ever suffer his head to be broken but out of a principle of honour this is the secret spring that pushes them forward and the superiority which they gain above the undistinguishd many does more than repair those wounds they have received in the combat tis mr wallers opinion that julius cæsar had he not been master of the roman empire would in all probability have made an excellent wrestler    great julius on the mountains bred   a flock perhaps or herd had led   he that the world subdued had been   but the best wrestler on the green    that he subdued the world was owing to the accidents of art and knowledge had he not met with those advantages the same sparks of emulation would have kindled within him and prompted him to distinguish himself in some enterprize of a lower nature since therefore no mans lot is so unalterably fixed in this life but that a thousand accidents may either forward or disappoint his advancement it is methinks a pleasant and inoffensive speculation to consider a great man as divested of all the adventitious circumstances of fortune and to bring him down in ones imagination to that low station of life the nature of which bears some distant resemblance to that high one he is at present possessed of thus one may view him exercising in miniature those talents of nature which being drawn out by education to their full length enable him for the discharge of some important employment on the other hand one may raise uneducated merit to such a pitch of greatness as may seem equal to the possible extent of his improved capacity  thus nature furnishes a man with a general appetite of glory education determines it to this or that particular object the desire of distinction is not i think in any instance more observable than in the variety of outsides and new appearances which the modish part of the world are obliged to provide in order to make themselves remarkable for any thing glaring and particular either in behaviour or apparel is known to have this good effect that it catches the eye and will not suffer you to pass over the person so adorned without due notice and observation it has likewise upon this account been frequently resented as a very great slight to leave any gentleman out of a lampoon or satyr who has as much right to be there as his neighbour because it supposes the person not eminent enough to be taken notice of to this passionate fondness for distinction are owing various frolicksome and irregular practices as sallying out into nocturnal exploits breaking of windows singing of catches beating the watch getting drunk twice a day killing a great number of horses with many other enterprizes of the like fiery nature for certainly many a man is more rakish and extravagant than he would willingly be were there not others to look on and give their approbation  one very common and at the same time the most absurd ambition that ever shewed it self in humane nature is that which comes upon a man with experience and old age the season when it might be expected he should be wisest and therefore it cannot receive any of those lessening circumstances which do in some measure excuse the disorderly ferments of youthful blood i mean the passion for getting money exclusive of the character of the provident father the affectionate husband or the generous friend it may be remarked for the comfort of honest poverty that this desire reigns most in those who have but few good qualities to recommend them this is a weed that will grow in a barren soil humanity good nature and the advantages of a liberal education are incompatible with avarice tis strange to see how suddenly this abject passion kills all the noble sentiments and generous ambitions that adorn humane nature it renders the man who is overrun with it a peevish and cruel master a severe parent an unsociable husband a distant and mistrustful friend but it is more to the present purpose to consider it as an absurd passion of the heart rather than as a vicious affection of the mind as there are frequent instances to be met with of a proud humility so this passion contrary to most others affects applause by avoiding all show and appearance for this reason it will not sometimes endure even the common decencies of apparel a covetous man will call himself poor that you may sooth his vanity by contradicting him love and the desire of glory as they are the most natural so they are capable of being refined into the most delicate and rational passions tis true the wise man who strikes out of the secret paths of a private life for honour and dignity allured by the splendour of a court and the unfelt weight of publick employment whether he succeeds in his attempts or no usually comes near enough to this painted greatness to discern the dawbing he is then desirous of extricating himself out of the hurry of life that he may pass away the remainder of his days in tranquillity and retirement  it may be thought then but common prudence in a man not to change a better state for a worse nor ever to quit that which he knows he shall take up again with pleasure and yet if human life be not a little moved with the gentle gales of hopes and fears there may be some danger of its stagnating in an unmanly indolence and security it is a known story of domitian that after he had possessed himself of the roman empire his desires turnd upon catching flies active and masculine spirits in the vigour of youth neither can nor ought to remain at rest if they debar themselves from aiming at a noble object their desires will move downwards and they will feel themselves actuated by some low and abject passion  thus if you cut off the top branches of a tree and will not suffer it to grow any higher it will not therefore cease to grow but will quickly shoot out at the bottom the man indeed who goes into the world only with the narrow views of selfinterest who catches at the applause of an idle multitude as he can find no solid contentment at the end of his journey so he deserves to meet with disappointments in his way but he who is actuated by a noble principle whose mind is so far enlarged as to take in the prospect of his countrys good who is enamoured with that praise which is one of the fair attendants of virtue and values not those acclamations which are not seconded by the impartial testimony of his own mind who repines not at the low station which providence has at present allotted him but yet would willingly advance himself by justifiable means to a more rising and advantageous ground such a man is warmed with a generous emulation it is a virtuous movement in him to wish and to endeavour that his power of doing good may be equal to his will  the man who is fitted out by nature and sent into the world with great abilities is capable of doing great good or mischief in it it ought therefore to be the care of education to infuse into the untainted youth early notices of justice and honour that so the possible advantages of good parts may not take an evil turn nor be perverted to base and unworthy purposes it is the business of religion and philosophy not so much to extinguish our passions as to regulate and direct them to valuable wellchosen objects when these have pointed out to us which course we may lawfully steer tis no harm to set out all our sail if the storms and tempests of adversity should rise upon us and not suffer us to make the haven where we would be it will however prove no small consolation to us in these circumstances that we have neither mistaken our course nor fallen into calamities of our own procuring  religion therefore were we to consider it no farther than as it interposes in the affairs of this life is highly valuable and worthy of great veneration as it settles the various pretensions and otherwise interfering interests of mortal men and thereby consults the harmony and order of the great community as it gives a man room to play his part and exert his abilities as it animates to actions truly laudable in themselves in their effects beneficial to society as it inspires rational ambitions correct love and elegant desires  z    footnote   ingenious

have often thought if the minds of men were laid open we should see but little difference between that of the wise man and that of the fool there are infinite reveries numberless extravagancies and a perpetual train of vanities which pass through both the great difference is that the first knows how to pick and cull his thoughts for conversation by suppressing some and communicating others whereas the other lets them all indifferently fly out in words this sort of discretion however has no place in private conversation between intimate friends on such occasions the wisest men very often talk like the weakest for indeed the talking with a friend is nothing else but thinking aloud  tully has therefore very justly exposed a precept delivered by some ancient writers that a man should live with his enemy in such a manner as might leave him room to become his friend and with his friend in such a manner that if he became his enemy it should not be in his power to hurt him the first part of this rule which regards our behaviour towards an enemy is indeed very reasonable as well as very prudential but the latter part of it which regards our behaviour towards a friend savours more of cunning than of discretion and would cut a man off from the greatest pleasures of life which are the freedoms of conversation with a bosom friend besides that when a friend is turned into an enemy and as the son of sirach calls him a bewrayer of secrets the world is just enough to accuse the perfidiousness of the friend rather than the indiscretion of the person who confided in him  discretion does not only shew it self in words but in all the circumstances of action and is like an underagent of providence to guide and direct us in the ordinary concerns of life  there are many more shining qualities in the mind of man but there is none so useful as discretion it is this indeed which gives a value to all the rest which sets them at work in their proper times and places and turns them to the advantage of the person who is possessed of them without it learning is pedantry and wit impertinence virtue itself looks like weakness the best parts only qualify a man to be more sprightly in errors and active to his own prejudice  nor does discretion only make a man the master of his own parts but of other mens the discreet man finds out the talents of those he converses with and knows how to apply them to proper uses accordingly if we look into particular communities and divisions of men we may observe that it is the discreet man not the witty nor the learned nor the brave who guides the conversation and gives measures to the society a man with great talents but void of discretion is like polyphemus in the fable strong and blind endued with an irresistible force which for want of sight is of no use to him  though a man has all other perfections and wants discretion he will be of no great consequence in the world but if he has this single talent in perfection and but a common share of others he may do what he pleases in his particular station of life  at the same time that i think discretion the most useful talent a man can be master of i look upon cunning to be the accomplishment of little mean ungenerous minds discretion points out the noblest ends to us and pursues the most proper and laudable methods of attaining them cunning has only private selfish aims and sticks at nothing which may make them succeed discretion has large and extended views and like a wellformed eye commands a whole horizon cunning is a kind of shortsightedness that discovers the minutest objects which are near at hand but is not able to discern things at a distance discretion the more it is discovered gives a greater authority to the person who possesses it cunning when it is once detected loses its force and makes a man incapable of bringing about even those events which he might have done had he passed only for a plain man discretion is the perfection of reason and a guide to us in all the duties of life cunning is a kind of instinct that only looks out after our immediate interest and welfare discretion is only found in men of strong sense and good understandings cunning is often to be met with in brutes themselves and in persons who are but the fewest removes from them in short cunning is only the mimick of discretion and may pass upon weak men in the same manner as vivacity is often mistaken for wit and gravity for wisdom  the cast of mind which is natural to a discreet man makes him look forward into futurity and consider what will be his condition millions of ages hence as well as what it is at present he knows that the misery or happiness which are reservd for him in another world lose nothing of their reality by being placed at so great distance from him the objects do not appear little to him because they are remote he considers that those pleasures and pains which lie hid in eternity approach nearer to him every moment and will be present with him in their full weight and measure as much as those pains and pleasures which he feels at this very instant for this reason he is careful to secure to himself that which is the proper happiness of his nature and the ultimate design of his being he carries his thoughts to the end of every action and considers the most distant as well as the most immediate effects of it he supersedes every little prospect of gain and advantage which offers itself here if he does not find it consistent with his views of an hereafter in a word his hopes are full of immortality his schemes are large and glorious and his conduct suitable to one who knows his true interest and how to pursue it by proper methods  i have in this essay upon discretion considered it both as an accomplishment and as a virtue and have therefore described it in its full extent not only as it is conversant about worldly affairs but as it regards our whole existence not only as it is the guide of a mortal creature but as it is in general the director of a reasonable being it is in this light that discretion is represented by the wise man who sometimes mentions it under the name of discretion and sometimes under that of wisdom it is indeed as described in the latter part of this paper the greatest wisdom but at the same time in the power of every one to attain its advantages are infinite but its acquisition easy or to speak of her in the words of the apocryphal writer whom i quoted in my last saturdays paper wisdom is glorious and never fadeth away yet she is easily seen of them that love her and found

pictura poema    hor      i have very often lamented and hinted my sorrow in several speculations that the art of painting is made so little use of to the improvement of our manners when we consider that it places the action of the person represented in the most agreeable aspect imaginable that it does not only express the passion or concern as it sits upon him who is drawn but has under those features the height of the painters imagination what strong images of virtue and humanity might we not expect would be instilled into the mind from the labours of the pencil this is a poetry which would be understood with much less capacity and less expence of time than what is taught by writings but the use of it is generally perverted and that admirable skill prostituted to the basest and most unworthy ends who is the better man for beholding the most beautiful venus the best wrought bacchanal the images of sleeping cupids languishing nymphs or any of the representations of gods goddesses demygods satyrs polyphemes sphinxes or fauns but if the virtues and vices which are sometimes pretended to be represented under such draughts were given us by the painter in the characters of real life and the persons of men and women whose actions have rendered them laudable or infamous we should not see a good historypiece without receiving an instructive lecture there needs no other proof of this truth than the testimony of every reasonable creature who has seen the cartons in her majestys gallery at hamptoncourt these are representations of no less actions than those of our blessed saviour and his apostles as i now sit and recollect the warm images which the admirable raphael has raised it is impossible even from the faint traces in ones memory of what one has not seen these two years to be unmoved at the horror and reverence which appear in the whole assembly when the mercenary man fell down dead at the amazement of the man born blind when he first receives sight or at the graceless indignation of the sorcerer when he is struck blind the lame when they first find strength in their feet stand doubtful of their new vigour the heavenly apostles appear acting these great things with a deep sense of the infirmities which they relieve but no value of themselves who administer to their weakness they know themselves to be but instruments and the generous distress they are painted in when divine honours are offered to them is a representation in the most exquisite degree of the beauty of holiness when st paul is preaching to the athenians with what wonderful art are almost all the different tempers of mankind represented in that elegant audience you see one credulous of all that is said another wrapt up in deep suspence another saying there is some reason in what he says another angry that the apostle destroys a favourite opinion which he is unwilling to give up another wholly convinced and holding out his hands in rapture while the generality attend and wait for the opinion of those who are of leading characters in the assembly i will not pretend so much as to mention that chart on which is drawn the appearance of our blessed lord after his resurrection present authority late suffering humility and majesty despotick command and divine   love are at once seated in his celestial aspect the figures of the eleven apostles are all in the same passion of admiration but discover it differently according to their characters peter receives his masters orders on his knees with an admiration mixed with a more particular attention the two next with a more open ecstasy though still constrained by the awe of the divine   presence the beloved disciple whom i take to be the right of the two first figures has in his countenance wonder drowned in love and the last personage whose back is towards the spectators and his side towards the presence one would fancy to be st thomas as abashed by the conscience of his former diffidence which perplexed concern it is possible raphael thought too hard a task to draw but by this acknowledgment of the difficulty to describe it  the whole work is an exercise of the highest piety in the painter and all the touches of a religious mind are expressed in a manner much more forcible than can possibly be performed by the most moving eloquence these invaluable pieces are very justly in the hands of the greatest and most pious sovereign in the world and cannot be the frequent object of every one at their own leisure but as an engraver is to the painter what a printer is to an author it is worthy her majestys name that she has encouraged that noble artist monsieur dorigny   to publish these works of raphael we have of this gentleman a piece of the transfiguration which i think is held a work second to none in the world  methinks it would be ridiculous in our people of condition after their large bounties to foreigners of no name or merit should they overlook this occasion of having for a trifling subscription a work which it is impossible for a man of sense to behold without being warmed with the noblest sentiments that can be inspired by love admiration compassion contempt of this world and expectation of a better  it is certainly the greatest honour we can do our country to distinguish strangers of merit who apply to us with modesty and diffidence which generally accompanies merit no opportunity of this kind ought to be neglected and a modest behaviour should alarm us to examine whether we do not lose something excellent under that disadvantage in the possessor of that quality my skill in paintings where one is not directed by the passion of the pictures is so inconsiderable that i am in very great perplexity when i offer to speak of any performances of painters of landskips buildings or single figures this makes me at a loss how to mention the pieces which mr boul exposes to sale by auction on wednesday next in shandoisstreet but having heard him commended by those who have bought of him heretofore for great integrity in his dealing and overheard him himself tho a laudable painter say nothing of his own was fit to come into

i find has raised a great curiosity among several of my correspondents i there told them that this leap was used to be taken from a promontory of leucas this leucas was formerly a part of acarnania being joined to  it by a narrow neck of land which the sea has by length of time overflowed and washed away so that at present leucas is divided from the continent and is a little island in the ionian sea the promontory of this island from whence the lover took his leap was formerly called leucate if the reader has a mind to know both the island and the promontory by their modern titles he will find in his map the ancient island of leucas under the name of st mauro and the ancient promontory of leucate under the name of the cape of st mauro  since i am engaged thus far in antiquity i must observe that theocritus in the motto prefixed to my paper describes one of his despairing shepherds addressing himself to his mistress after the following manner alas what will become of me wretch that i am will you not hear me ill throw off my cloaths and take a leap into that part of the sea which is so much frequented by olphis the fisherman and tho i should escape with my life i know you will be pleased with it i shall leave it with the criticks to determine whether the place which this shepherd so particularly points out was not the abovementioned leucate or at least some other lovers leap which was supposed to have had the same effect i cannot believe as all the interpreters do that the shepherd means nothing farther here than that he would drown himself since he represents the issue of his leap as doubtful by adding that if he should escape with life  he knows his mistress would be pleased with it which is according to our interpretation that she would rejoice any way to get rid of a lover who was so troublesome to her  after this short preface i shall present my reader with some letters which i have received upon this subject the first is sent me by a physician     mr spectator    the lovers leap which you mention in your    d paper was   generally i believe a very effectual cure for love and not only for   love but for all other evils in short sir i am afraid it was such   a leap as that which hero took to get rid of her passion for   leander a man is in no danger of breaking his heart who breaks his   neck to prevent it i know very well the wonders which ancient authors   relate concerning this leap and in particular that very many persons   who tried it escaped not only with their lives but their limbs if by   this means they got rid of their love tho it may in part be ascribed   to the reasons you give for it why may not we suppose that the cold   bath into which they plunged themselves had also some share in their   cure a leap into the sea or into any creek of salt waters very often   gives a new motion to the spirits and a new turn to the blood for   which reason we prescribe it in distempers which no other medicine   will reach i could produce a quotation out of a very venerable   author in which the frenzy produced by love is compared to that   which is produced by the biting of a mad dog but as this comparison   is a little too coarse for your paper and might look as if it were   cited to ridicule the author who has made use of it i shall only hint   at it and desire you to consider whether if the frenzy produced by   these two different causes be of the same nature it may not very   properly be cured by the same means    i am sir    your most humble servant and wellwisher    esculapius      mr spectator    i am a young woman crossed in love my story is very long and   melancholy to give you the heads of it a young gentleman after   having made his applications to me for three years together and   filled my head with a thousand dreams of happiness some few days   since married another pray tell me in what part of the world your   promontory lies which you call the lovers leap and whether one   may go to it by land but alas i am afraid it has lost its virtue   and that a woman of our times would find no more relief in taking such   a leap than in singing an hymn to venus so that i must cry out   with

 she is so pettish and overrun with cholers against me that if i had   the good happiness to have my dwelling which is placed by my   creatcranfather upon the pottom of an hill no farther distance but   twenty mile from the lofers leap i would indeed indeafour to preak   my neck upon it on purpose now good mister spictatur of crete   prittain you must know it there is in caernaruanshire a fery pig

of   this mountain a very high rock like a parish steeple that cometh a   huge deal over the sea so when i am in my melancholies and i do   throw myself from it i do desire my fery good friend to tell me in   his spictatur if i shall be cure of my grefous lofes for there is   the sea clear as glass and as creen as the leek then likewise if i   be drown and preak my neck if mrs gwinifrid will not lose me   afterwards pray be speedy in your answers for i am in crete haste   and it is my tesires to do my pusiness without loss of time i remain   with cordial affections your ever lofing friend davyth ap   shenkyn    p s  my lawsuits have brought me to london but i have lost my   causes and so have made my resolutions to go down and leap before the   frosts begin for i am apt to take colds   ridicule perhaps is a better expedient against love than sober advice and i am of opinion that hudibras and don quixote may be as effectual to cure the extravagancies of this passion as any of the old philosophers i shall therefore publish very speedily the translation of a little greek manuscript which is sent me by a learned friend it appears to have been a piece of those records which were kept in the little temple of apollo that stood upon the promontory of leucate the reader will find it to be a summary account of several persons who tried the lovers leap and of the success they found in it as there seem to be in it some anachronisms and deviations from the ancient orthography i am not wholly satisfied myself that it is authentick and not rather the production of one of those grecian sophisters who have imposed upon the world several spurious works of this nature i speak this by way of precaution because i know there are several writers of uncommon erudition who would not fail to

capacity for conceiving what is said to it together with a pretty proper behaviour in all the occurrences of common life but naturally very vacant of thought in it self and therefore forced to apply it self to foreign assistances of this make is that man who is very inquisitive you may often observe that tho he speaks as good sense as any man upon any thing with which he is well acquainted he cannot trust to the range of his own fancy to entertain himself upon that foundation but goes on to still new enquiries thus tho you know he is fit for the most polite conversation you shall see him very well contented to sit by a jockey giving an account of the many revolutions in his horses health what potion he made him take how that agreed with him how afterwards he came to his stomach and his exercise or any the like impertinence and be as well pleased as if you talked to him on the most important truths this humour is far from making a man unhappy tho it may subject him to raillery for he generally falls in with a person who seems to be born for him which is your talkative fellow it is so ordered that there is a secret bent as natural as the meeting of different sexes in these two characters to supply each others wants i had the honour the other day to sit in a publick room and saw an inquisitive man look with an air of satisfaction upon the approach of one of these talkers  the man of ready utterance sat down by him and rubbing his head leaning on his arm and making an uneasy countenance he began there is no manner of news today i cannot tell what is the matter with me but i slept very ill last night whether i caught cold or no i know not but i fancy i do not wear shoes thick enough for the weather and i have coughed all this week it must be so for the custom of washing my head winter and summer with cold water prevents any injury from the season entering that way so it must come in at my feet but i take no notice of it as it comes so it goes most of our evils proceed from too much tenderness and our faces are naturally as little able to resist the cold as other parts the indian answered very well to an european who asked him how he could go naked i am all face  i observed this discourse was as welcome to my general enquirer as any other of more consequence could have been but some body calling our talker to another part of the room the enquirer told the next man who sat by him that mr such a one who was just gone from him used to wash his head in cold water every morning and so repeated almost verbatim all that had been said to him the truth is the inquisitive are the funnels of conversation they do not take in any thing for their own use but merely to pass it to another they are the channels through which all the good and evil that is spoken in town are conveyed such as are offended at them or think they suffer by their behaviour may themselves mend that inconvenience for they are not a malicious people and if you will supply them you may contradict any thing they have said before by their own mouths a farther account of a thing is one of the gratefullest goods that can arrive to them and it is seldom that they are more particular than to say the town will have it or i have it from a good hand so that there is room for the town to know the matter more particularly and for a better hand to contradict what was said by a good one  i have not known this humour more ridiculous than in a father who has been earnestly solicitous to have an account how his son has passed his leisure hours if it be in a way thoroughly insignificant there cannot be a greater joy than an enquirer discovers in seeing him follow so hopefully his own steps but this humour among men is most pleasant when they are saying something which is not wholly proper for a third person to hear and yet is in itself indifferent the other day there came in a welldressed young fellow and two gentlemen of this species immediately fell a whispering his pedigree i could overhear by breaks she was his aunt then an answer ay she was of the mothers side then again in a little lower voice his father wore generally a darker wig answer not much but this gentleman wears higher heels to his shoes  as the inquisitive in my opinion are such merely from a vacancy in their own imaginations there is nothing methinks so dangerous as to communicate secrets to them for the same temper of enquiry makes them as impertinently communicative but no man though he converses with them need put himself in their power for they will be contented with matters of less moment as well when there is fuel enough no matter what it isthus the ends of sentences in the news papers as this wants confirmation this occasions many speculations and time will discover the event are read by them and considered not as mere expletives  one may see now and then this humour accompanied with an insatiable desire of knowing what passes without turning it to any use in the world but merely their own entertainment a mind which is gratified this way is adapted to humour and pleasantry and formed for an unconcerned character in the world and like my self to be a mere spectator this curiosity without malice or selfinterest lays up in the imagination a magazine of circumstances which cannot but entertain when they are produced in conversation if one were to know from the man of the first quality to the meanest servant the different intrigues sentiments pleasures and interests of mankind would it not be the most pleasing entertainment imaginable to enjoy so constant a farce as the observing mankind much more different from themselves in their secret thoughts and publick actions than in their nightcaps and long periwigs     mr spectator    plutarch tells us that caius gracchus the roman was   frequently hurried by his passion into so loud and tumultuous a way of   speaking and so strained his voice as not to be able to proceed to   remedy this excess he had an ingenious servant by name licinius   always attended him with a pitchpipe or instrument to regulate the   voice who whenever he heard his master begin to be high immediately   touched a soft note at which tis said caius would presently   abate and grow calm    upon recollecting this story i have frequently wondered that this   useful instrument should have been so long discontinued especially   since we find that this good office of licinius has preserved his   memory for many hundred years which methinks should have encouraged   some one to have revived it if not for the publick good yet for his   own credit it may be objected that our loud talkers are so fond of   their own noise that they would not take it well to be checkd by   their servants but granting this to be true surely any of their   hearers have a very good title to play a soft note in their own   defence to be short no licinius appearing and the noise   increasing i was resolved to give this late long vacation to the good   of my country and i have at length by the assistance of an ingenious   artist who works to the royal society almost compleated my design   and shall be ready in a short time to furnish the publick with what   number of these instruments they please either to lodge at   coffeehouses or carry for their own private use in the mean time i   shall pay that respect to several gentlemen who i know will be in   danger of offending against this instrument to give them notice of it   by private letters in which i shall only write get a licinius    i should now trouble you no longer but that i must not conclude   without desiring you to accept one of these pipes which shall be left   for you with buckley and which i hope will be serviceable to you   since as you are silent yourself you are most open to the insults of   the noisy    i am sir c    wb    i had almost forgot to inform you that as an improvement in this   instrument there will be a particular note which i call a hushnote   and this is to be made use of against a long story swearing   obsceneness and the like                                               no                   thursday nov

of a statue   which has lost the arms legs and head but discovers such an exquisite workmanship in what remains of it that michael angelo declared he had learned his whole art from it indeed he studied it so attentively that he made most of his statues and even his pictures in that gusto to make use of the italian phrase for which reason this maimed statue is still called michael angelos school  a fragment of sappho which i design for the subject of this paper   is in as great reputation among the poets and criticks as the mutilated figure abovementioned is among the statuaries and painters several of our countrymen and mr dryden in particular seem very often to have copied after it in their dramatick writings and in their poems upon love  whatever might have been the occasion of this ode the english reader will enter into the beauties of it if he supposes it to have been written in the person of a lover sitting by his mistress i shall set to view three different copies of this beautiful original the first is a translation by catullus the second by monsieur boileau and the last by a gentleman whose translation of the hymn to venus has been so deservedly admired     ad lesbiam    ille mî par esse deo videtur   ille si fas est superare divos   qui sedens adversus identidem te        spectat et audit    dulce ridentem misero quod omnis   eripit sensus mihi nam simul

reader will know very well the reason why one of these verses is printed in roman letter   and if he compares this translation with the original will find that the three first stanzas are rendred almost word for word and not only with the same elegance but with the same short turn of expression which is so remarkable in the greek and so peculiar to the sapphick ode i cannot imagine for what reason madam dacier has told us that this ode of sappho is preserved entire in longinus since it is manifest to any one who looks into that authors quotation of it that there must at least have been another stanza which is not transmitted to us  the second translation of this fragment which i shall here cite is that of monsieur boileau     heureux qui prés de toi pour toi seule soûpire   qui jouït du plaisir de tentendre parler   qui te voit quelquefois doucement lui soûrire   les dieux dans son bonheur peuventils légaler    je sens de veine en veine une subtile flamme   courir par tout

douces langueurs   et pâle sans haleine interdite esperduë   un frisson me saisit je tremble je me meurs   the reader will see that this is rather an imitation than a translation the circumstances do not lie so thick together and follow one another with that vehemence and emotion as in the original in short monsieur boileau has given us all the poetry but not all the passion of this famous fragment i shall in the last place present my reader with the english translation   i   blest as thimmortal gods is he      the youth who fondly sits by thee      and hears and sees thee all the while      softly speak and sweetly smile  ii   twas this deprived my soul of rest      and raised such tumults in my breast      for while i gazd in transport tost      my breath was gone my voice was lost

my blood with gentle horrors thrilld      my feeble pulse forgot to play      i fainted sunk and dyd away   instead of giving any character of this last translation i shall desire my learned reader to look into the criticisms which longinus has made upon the original by that means he will know to which of the translations he ought to give the preference i shall only add that this translation is written in the very spirit of sappho and as near the greek as the genius of our language will possibly suffer  longinus has observed that this description of love in sappho is an exact copy of nature and that all the circumstances which follow one another in such an hurry of sentiments notwithstanding they appear repugnant to each other are really such as happen in the phrenzies of love  i wonder that not one of the criticks or editors through whose hands this ode has passed has taken occasion from it to mention a circumstance related by plutarch that author in the famous story of antiochus who fell in love with stratonice his motherinlaw and not daring to discover his passion pretended to be confined to his bed by sickness tells us that erasistratus the physician found out the nature of his distemper by those symptoms of love which he had learnt from sapphos writings   stratonice was in the room of the lovesick prince when these symptoms discovered themselves to his physician and it is probable that they were not very different from those which sappho here describes in a lover sitting by his mistress this story of antiochus is so well known that i need not add the sequel of it which has no relation to my present subject  c    footnote   the belvidere torso   footnote   the other translation by ambrose philips see note to no       footnote   wanting in copies then known it is here supplied by conjecture   footnote   in plutarchs life of demetrius    when others entered antiochus was entirely unaffected but when   stratonice came in as she often did he shewed all the symptoms   described by sappho the faltering voice the burning blush the   languid eye the sudden sweat the tumultuous pulse and at length   the passion overcoming his spirits a swoon and mortal

human nature appears a very deformed or a very beautiful object according to the different lights in which it is viewed when we see men of inflamed passions or of wicked designs tearing one another to pieces by open violence or undermining each other by secret treachery when we observe base and narrow ends pursued by ignominious and dishonest means when we behold men mixed in society as if it were for the destruction of it we are even ashamed of our species and out of humour with our own being but in another light when we behold them mild good and benevolent full of a generous regard for the publick prosperity compassionating each   others distresses and relieving each others wants we can hardly believe they are creatures of the same kind in this view they appear gods to each other in the exercise of the noblest power that of doing good and the greatest compliment we have ever been able to make to our own being has been by calling this disposition of mind humanity we cannot but observe a pleasure arising in our own breast upon the seeing or hearing of a generous action even when we are wholly disinterested in it i cannot give a more proper instance of this than by a letter from pliny in which he recommends a friend in the most handsome manner and methinks it would be a great pleasure to know the success of this epistle though each party concerned in it has been so many

signifies a warmer affection he has nothing thats aspiring and   though he might rise to the highest order of nobility he keeps   himself in an inferior rank yet i think my self bound to use my   endeavours to serve and promote him and would therefore find the   means of adding something to his honours while he neither expects nor   knows it nay though he should refuse it something in short i   would have for him that may be honourable but not troublesome and i   entreat that you will procure him the first thing of this kind that   offers by which you will not only oblige me but him also

sake of   the british youth to instruct them in such a manner that the most   dangerous page in virgil or homer may be read by them with much   pleasure and with perfect safety to their persons    could i prevail so far as to be honoured with the protection of some   few of them for i am not hero enough to rescue many my design is to   retire with them to an agreeable solitude though within the   neighbourhood of a city for the convenience of their being instructed   in musick dancing drawing designing or any other such   accomplishments which it is conceived may make as proper diversions   for them and almost as pleasant as the little sordid games which   dirty schoolboys are so much delighted with it may easily be   imagined how such a pretty society conversing with none beneath   themselves and sometimes admitted as perhaps not unentertaining   parties amongst better company commended and caressed for their   little performances and turned by such conversations to a certain   gallantry of soul might be brought early acquainted with some of the   most polite english writers this having given them some tolerable   taste of books they would make themselves masters of the latin   tongue by methods far easier than those in lilly with as little   difficulty or reluctance as young ladies learn to speak french or   to sing italian operas when they had advanced thus far it would be   time to form their taste something more exactly one that had any true   relish of fine writing might with great pleasure both to himself and   them run over together with them the best roman historians poets   and orators and point out their more remarkable beauties give them a   short scheme of chronology a little view of geography medals   astronomy or what else might best feed the busy inquisitive humour so   natural to that age such of them as had the least spark of genius   when it was once awakened by the shining thoughts and great sentiments   of those admired writers could not i believe be easily withheld   from attempting that more difficult sister language whose exalted   beauties they would have heard so often celebrated as the pride and   wonder of the whole learned world in the mean while it would be   requisite to exercise their style in writing any light pieces that ask   more of fancy than of judgment and that frequently in their native   language which every one methinks should be most concerned to   cultivate especially letters in which a gentleman must have so   frequent occasions to distinguish himself a set of genteel   goodnatured youths fallen into such a manner of life would form   almost a little academy and doubtless prove no such contemptible   companions as might not often tempt a wiser man to mingle himself in   their diversions and draw them into such serious sports as might   prove nothing less instructing than the gravest lessons i doubt not   but it might be made some of their favourite plays to contend which   of them should recite a beautiful part of a poem or oration most   gracefully or sometimes to join in acting a scene of terence   sophocles or our own shakespear the cause of milo might again   be

                   addison      o pudor o pietas    mart    looking over the letters which i have lately received from from my correspondents i met with the following one which is written with such a spirit of politeness that i could not but be very much pleased with it my self and question not but it will be as acceptable to the reader     mr spectator      you who are no stranger to publick assemblies cannot but have   observed the awe they often strike on such as are obliged to exert any   talent before them this is a sort of elegant distress to which   ingenuous minds are the most liable and may therefore deserve some   remarks in your paper many a brave fellow who has put his enemy to   flight in the field has been in the utmost disorder upon making a   speech before a body of his friends at home one would think there was   some kind of fascination in the eyes of a large circle of people when   darting altogether upon one person i have seen a new actor in a   tragedy so bound up by it as to be scarce able to speak or move and   have expected he would have died above three acts before the dagger or   cup of poison were brought in it would not be amiss if such an one   were at first introduced as a ghost or a statue till he recovered his   spirits and grew fit for some living part    as this sudden desertion of ones self shews a diffidence which is   not displeasing it implies at the same time the greatest respect to   an audience that can be it is a sort of mute eloquence which pleads   for their favour much better than words could do and we find their   generosity naturally moved to support those who are in so much   perplexity to entertain them i was extremely pleased with a late   instance of this kind at the opera of almahide in the encouragement   given to a young singer   whose more than ordinary concern on her   first appearance recommended her no less than her agreeable voice   and just performance meer bashfulness without merit is awkward and   merit without modesty insolent but modest merit has a double claim   to acceptance and generally meets with as many patrons as beholders   i am c   it is impossible that a person should exert himself to advantage in an assembly whether it be his part either to sing or speak who lies under too great oppressions of modesty i remember upon talking with a friend of mine concerning the force of pronunciation our discourse led us into the enumeration of the several organs of speech which an orator ought to have in perfection as the tongue the teeth the lips the nose the palate and the windpipe upon which says my friend you have omitted the most material organ of them all and that is the forehead  but notwithstanding an excess of modesty obstructs the tongue and renders it unfit for its offices a due proportion of it is thought so requisite to an orator that rhetoricians have recommended it to their disciples as a particular in their art cicero tells us that he never liked an orator who did not appear in some little confusion at the beginning of his speech and confesses that he himself never entered upon an oration without trembling and concern it is indeed a kind of deference which is due to a great assembly and seldom fails to raise a benevolence in the audience towards the person who speaks my correspondent has taken notice that the bravest men often appear timorous on these occasions as indeed we may observe that there is generally no creature more impudent than a coward   linguá melior sedfrigida bello   dextera  a bold tongue and a feeble arm are the qualifications of drances in virgil as homer to express a man both timorous and sawcy makes use of a kind of point which is very rarely to be met with in his writings namely that he had the eyes of a dog but the heart of a deer    a just and reasonable modesty does not only recommend eloquence but sets off every great talent which a man can be possessed of it heightens all the virtues which it accompanies like the shades in paintings it raises and rounds every figure and makes the colours more beautiful though not so glaring as they would be without it  modesty is not only an ornament but also a guard to virtue it is a kind of quick and delicate feeling in the soul which makes her shrink and withdraw her self from every thing that has danger in it it is such an exquisite sensibility as warns her to shun the first appearance of every thing which is hurtful  i cannot at present recollect either the place or time of what i am going to mention but i have read somewhere in the history of ancient greece that the women of the country were seized with an unaccountable melancholy which disposed several of them to make away with themselves the senate after having tried many expedients to prevent this selfmurder which was so frequent among them published an edict that if any woman whatever should lay violent hands upon her self her corps should be exposed naked in the street and dragged about the city in the most publick manner this edict immediately put a stop to the practice which was before so common we may see in this instance the strength of female modesty which was able to overcome the violence even of madness and despair the fear of shame in the fair sex was in those days more prevalent than that of death  if modesty has so great an influence over our actions and is in many cases so impregnable a fence to virtue what can more undermine morality than that politeness which reigns among the unthinking part of mankind and treats as unfashionable the most ingenuous part of our behaviour which recommends impudence as good breeding and keeps a man always in countenance not because he is innocent but because he is shameless  seneca thought modesty so great a check to vice that he prescribes to us the practice of it in secret and advises us to raise it in ourselves upon imaginary occasions when such as are real do not offer themselves for this is the meaning of his precept that when we are by ourselves and in our greatest solitudes we should fancy that cato stands before us and sees every thing we do in short if you banish modesty out of the world she carries away with her half the virtue that is in it  after these reflections on modesty as it is a virtue i must observe that there is a vicious modesty which justly deserves to be ridiculed and which those persons very often discover who value themselves most upon a wellbred confidence this happens when a man is ashamed to act up to his reason and would not upon any consideration be surprized in the practice of those duties for the performance of which he was sent into the world many an impudent libertine would blush to be caught in a serious discourse and would scarce be able to show his head after having disclosed a religious thought decency of behaviour all outward show of virtue and abhorrence of vice are carefully avoided by this set of shamefaced people as what would disparage their gayety of temper and infallibly bring them to dishonour this is such a poorness of spirit such a despicable cowardice such a degenerate abject state of mind as one would think human nature incapable of did we not meet with frequent instances of it in ordinary conversation  there is another kind of vicious modesty which makes a man ashamed of his person his birth his profession his poverty or the like misfortunes which it was not in his choice to prevent and is not in his power to rectify if a man appears ridiculous by any of the aforementioned circumstances he becomes much more so by being out of countenance for them they should rather give him occasion to exert a noble spirit and to palliate those imperfections which are not in his power by those perfections which are or to use a very witty allusion of an eminent author he should imitate cæsar who because his head was bald coverd that defect with laurels  c    footnote   this letter is by john hughes   footnote   mrs

wise and good friend sir andrew freeport divides himself almost equally between the town and the country his time in town is given up to the publick and the management of his private fortune and after every three or four days spent in this manner he retires for as many to his seat within a few miles of the town to the enjoyment of himself his family and his friend thus business and pleasure or rather in sir andrew labour and rest recommend each other they take their turns with so quick a vicissitude that neither becomes a habit or takes possession of the whole man nor is it possible he should be surfeited with either i often see him at our club in good humour and yet sometimes too with an air of care in his looks but in his country retreat he is always unbent and such a companion as i could desire and therefore i seldom fail to make one with him when he is pleased to invite me  the other day as soon as we were got into his chariot two or three beggars on each side hung upon the doors and solicited our charity with the usual rhetorick of a sick wife or husband at home three or four helpless little children all starving with cold and hunger we were forced to part with some money to get rid of their importunity and then we proceeded on our journey with the blessings and acclamations of these people    well then says sir andrew we go off with the prayers and good   wishes of the beggars and perhaps too our healths will be drunk at   the next alehouse so all we shall be able to value ourselves upon   is that we have promoted the trade of the victualler and the excises   of the government but how few ounces of wooll do we see upon the   backs of those poor creatures and when they shall next fall in our   way they will hardly be better dressd they must always live in rags   to look like objects of compassion if their families too are such as   they are represented tis certain they cannot be better clothed and   must be a great deal worse fed one would think potatoes should be all   their bread and their drink the pure element and then what goodly   customers are the farmers like to have for their wooll corn and   cattle such customers and such a consumption cannot choose but   advance the landed interest and hold up the rents of the gentlemen    but of all men living we merchants who live by buying and selling   ought never to encourage beggars the goods which we export are indeed   the product of the lands but much the greatest part of their value is   the labour of the people but how much of these peoples labour shall   we export whilst we hire them to sit still the very alms they receive   from us are the wages of idleness i have often thought that no man   should be permitted to take relief from the parish or to ask it in   the street till he has first purchased as much as possible of his own   livelihood by the labour of his own hands and then the publick ought   only to be taxed to make good the deficiency if this rule was   strictly observed we should see every where such a multitude of new   labourers as would in all probability reduce the prices of all our   manufactures it is the very life of merchandise to buy cheap and sell   dear the merchant ought to make his outset as cheap as possible that   he may find the greater profit upon his returns and nothing will   enable him to do this like the reduction of the price of labour upon   all our manufactures this too would be the ready way to increase the   number of our foreign markets the abatement of the price of the   manufacture would pay for the carriage of it to more distant   countries and this consequence would be equally beneficial both to   the landed and trading interests as so great an addition of labouring   hands would produce this happy consequence both to the merchant and   the gentle man our liberality to common beggars and every other   obstruction to the increase of labourers must be equally pernicious   to both  sir andrew then went on to affirm that the reduction of the prices of our manufactures by the addition of so many new hands would be no inconvenience to any man but observing i was something startled at the assertion he made a short pause and then resumed the discourse    it may seem says he a paradox that the price of labour should be   reduced without an abatement of wages or that wages can be abated   without any inconvenience to the labourer and yet nothing is more   certain than that both those things may happen the wages of the   labourers make the greatest part of the price of every thing that is   useful and if in proportion with the wages the prices of all other   things should be abated every labourer with less wages would be still   able to purchase as many necessaries of life where then would be the   inconvenience but the price of labour may be reduced by the addition   of more hands to a manufacture and yet the wages of persons remain as   high as ever the admirable sir william petty   has given examples   of this in some of his writings one of them as i remember is that   of a watch which i shall endeavour to explain so as shall suit my   present purpose it is certain that a single watch could not be made   so cheap in proportion by one only man as a hundred watches by a   hundred for as there is vast variety in the work no one person could   equally suit himself to all the parts of it the manufacture would be   tedious and at last but clumsily performed but if an hundred watches   were to be made by a hundred men the cases may be assigned to one   the dials to another the wheels to another the springs to another   and every other part to a proper artist as there would be no need of   perplexing any one person with too much variety every one would be   able to perform his single part with greater skill and expedition and   the hundred watches would be finished in one fourth part of the time   of the first one and every one of them at one fourth part of the   cost tho the wages of every man were equal the reduction of the   price of the manufacture would increase the demand of it all the same   hands would be still employed and as well paid the same rule will   hold in the clothing the shipping and all the other trades   whatsoever and thus an addition of hands to our manufactures will   only reduce the price of them the labourer will still have as much   wages and will consequently be enabled to purchase more conveniencies   of life so that every interest in the nation would receive a benefit   from the increase of our working people    besides i see no occasion for this charity to common beggars since   every beggar is an inhabitant of a parish and every parish is taxed   to the maintenance of their own poor      for my own part i cannot be mightily pleased with the laws which have   done this which have provided better to feed than employ the poor we   have a tradition from our forefathers that after the first of those   laws was made they were insulted with that famous song      hang sorrow and cast away care     the parish is bound to find us c    and if we will be so goodnatured as to maintain them without work   they can do no less in return than sing us the merry beggars    what then am i against all acts of charity god forbid i know of no   virtue in the gospel that is in more pathetical expressions   recommended to our practice i was hungry and ye   gave me no   meat thirsty and ye gave me no drink naked and ye clothed me not a   stranger and ye took me not in sick and in prison and ye visited me   not our blessed saviour treats the exercise or neglect of charity   towards a poor man as the performance or breach of this duty towards   himself i shall endeavour to obey the will of my lord and master and   therefore if an industrious man shall submit to the hardest labour and   coarsest fare rather than endure the shame of taking relief from the   parish or asking it in the street this is the hungry the thirsty   the naked and i ought to believe if any man is come hither for   shelter against persecution or oppression this is the stranger and i   ought to take him in if any countryman of our own is fallen into the   hands of infidels and lives in a state of miserable captivity this   is the man in prison and i should contribute to his ransom i ought   to give to an hospital of invalids to recover as many useful subjects   as i can but i shall bestow none of my bounties upon an almshouse of   idle people and for the same reason i should not think it a reproach   to me if i had withheld my charity from those common beggars but we   prescribe better rules than we are able to practise we are ashamed   not to give into the mistaken customs of our country but at the same   time i cannot but think it a reproach worse than that of common   swearing that the idle and the abandoned are suffered in the name of   heaven and all that is sacred to extort from christian and

have made to the publick by obliging them with a translation of the little greek manuscript which is said to have been a piece of those records that were preserved in the temple of apollo upon the promontory of leucate it is a short history of the lovers leap and is inscribed an account of persons male and female who offered up their vows in the temple of the pythian apollo in the forty sixth olympiad and leaped from the promontory of leucate into the ionian sea in order to cure themselves of the passion of love  this account is very dry in many parts as only mentioning the name of the lover who leaped the person he leaped for and relating in short that he was either cured or killed or maimed by the fall it indeed gives the names of so many who died by it that it would have looked like a bill of mortality had i translated it at full length i have therefore made an abridgment of it and only extracted such particular passages as have something extraordinary either in the case or in the cure or in the fate of the person who is mentioned in it after this short preface take the account as follows    battus the son of menalcas the sicilian leaped for bombyca   the musician got

anxious   for her safety and offered up vows for her deliverance marched    directly forwards to the utmost summit of the promontory where after   having repeated a stanza of her own verses which we could not hear   she threw herself off the rock with such an intrepidity as was never   before observed in any who had attempted that dangerous leap many who   were present related that they saw her fall into the sea from whence   she never rose again tho there were others who affirmed that she   never came to the bottom of her leap but that she was changed into a   swan as she fell and that they saw her hovering in the air under that   shape but whether or no the whiteness and fluttering of her garments   might not deceive those who looked upon her or whether she might not   really be

with particulars that destroy the jest but give light into the truth of the narration this sort of veracity though it is impertinent has something amiable in it because it proceeds from the love of truth even in frivolous occasions if such honest amendments do not promise an agreeable companion they do a sincere friend for which reason one should allow them so much of our time if we fall into their company as to set us right in matters that can do us no manner of harm whether the facts be one way or the other lies which are told out of arrogance and ostentation a man should detect in his own defence because he should not be triumphed over lies which are told out of malice he should expose both for his own sake and that of the rest of mankind because every man should rise against a

being attended at his entry with a servant   of his own besides a countryman he had taken up for a guide excited   the curiosity of the village to learn whence and what he might be the   countryman to whom they applied as most easy of access knew little   more than that the gentleman came from london to travel and see   fashions and was as he heard say a freethinker what religion that   might be he could not tell and for his own part if they had not   told him the man was a freethinker he should have guessed by his   way of talking he was little better than a heathen excepting only   that he had been a good gentleman to him and made him drunk twice in   one day over and above what they had bargained for    i do not look upon the simplicity of this and several odd inquiries   with which i shall not trouble you to be wondered at much less can i   think that our youths of fine wit and enlarged understandings have   any reason to laugh there is no necessity that every squire in great   britain should know what the word freethinker stands for but it   were much to be wished that they who value themselves upon that   conceited title were a little better instructed in what it ought to   stand for and that they would not perswade themselves a man is really   and truly a freethinker in any tolerable sense meerly by virtue of   his being an atheist or an infidel of any other

whatever conceit the extravagancy   of their inclination or their fancy shall suggest they can think as   wildly as they talk and act and will not endure that their wit should   be controuled by such formal things as decency and common sense   deduction coherence consistency and all the rules of reason they   accordingly disdain as too precise and mechanical for men of a   liberal education

nothing which lies more within the province of a spectator than publick shows and diversions and as among these there are none which can pretend to vie with those elegant entertainments that are exhibited in our theatres i think it particularly incumbent on me to take notice of every thing that is remarkable in such numerous and refined assemblies  it is observed that of late years there has been a certain person in the upper gallery of the playhouse who when he is pleased with any thing that is acted upon the stage expresses his approbation by a loud knock upon the benches or the wainscot which may be heard over the whole theatre this person is commonly known by the name of the trunkmaker in the upper gallery whether it be that the blow he gives on these occasions resembles that which is often heard in the shops of such artizans or that he was supposed to have been a real trunkmaker who after the finishing of his days work used to unbend his mind at these publick diversions with his hammer in his hand i cannot certainly tell there are some i know who have been foolish enough to imagine it is a spirit which haunts the upper gallery and from time to time makes those strange noises and the rather because he is observed to be louder than ordinary every time the ghost of hamlet appears others have reported that it is a dumb man who has chosen this way of uttering himself when he is transported with any thing he sees or hears others will have it to be the playhouse thunderer that exerts himself after this manner in the upper gallery when he has nothing to do upon the roof  but having made it my business to get the best information i could in a matter of this moment i find that the trunkmaker as he is commonly called is a large black man whom no body knows he generally leans forward on a huge oaken plant with great attention to every thing that passes upon the stage he is never seen to smile but upon hearing any thing that pleases him he takes up his staff with both hands and lays it upon the next piece of timber that stands in his way with exceeding vehemence after which he composes himself in his former posture till such time as something new sets him again at work  it has been observed his blow is so well timed that the most judicious critick could never except against it as soon as any shining thought is expressed in the poet or any uncommon grace appears in the actor he smites the bench or wainscot if the audience does not concur with him he smites a second time and if the audience is not yet awaked looks round him with great wrath and repeats the blow a third time which never fails to produce the clap he sometimes lets the audience begin the clap of themselves and at the conclusion of their applause ratifies it with a single thwack  he is of so great use to the playhouse that it is said a former director of it upon his not being able to pay his attendance by reason of sickness kept one in pay to officiate for him till such time as he recovered but the person so employed tho he laid about him with incredible violence did it in such wrong places that the audience soon found out that it was not their old friend the trunkmaker  it has been remarked that he has not yet exerted himself with vigour this season he sometimes plies at the opera and upon nicolinis first appearance was said to have demolished three benches in the fury of his applause he has broken half a dozen oaken plants upon dogget   and seldom goes away from a tragedy of shakespear without leaving the wainscot extremely shattered  the players do not only connive at his obstreperous approbation but very cheerfully repair at their own cost whatever damages he makes they had once a thought of erecting a kind of wooden anvil for his use that should be made of a very sounding plank in order to render his stroaks more deep and mellow but as this might not have been distinguished from the musick of a kettledrum the project was laid aside  in the mean while i cannot but take notice of the great use it is to an audience that a person should thus preside over their heads like the director of a consort in order to awaken their attention and beat time to their applauses or to raise my simile i have sometimes fancied the trunkmaker in the upper gallery to be like virgils ruler of the wind seated upon the top of a mountain who when he struck his sceptre upon the side of it roused an hurricane and set the whole cavern in an uproar    it is certain the trunkmaker has saved many a good play and brought many a graceful actor into reputation who would not otherwise have been taken notice of it is very visible as the audience is not a little abashed if they find themselves betrayed into a clap when their friend in the upper gallery does not come into it so the actors do not value themselves upon the clap but regard it as a meer brutum fulmen or empty noise when it has not the sound of the oaken plant in it i know it has been given out by those who are enemies to the trunkmaker that he has sometimes been bribed to be in the interest of a bad poet or a vicious player but this is a surmise which has no foundation his stroaks are always just and his admonitions seasonable he does not deal about his blows at random but always hits the right nail upon the head the   inexpressible force wherewith he lays them on sufficiently shows the evidence and strength of his conviction his zeal for a good author is indeed outrageous and breaks down every fence and partition every board and plank that stands within the expression of his applause  as i do not care for terminating my thoughts in barren speculations or in reports of pure matter of fact without drawing something from them for the advantage of my countrymen i shall take the liberty to make an humble proposal that whenever the trunkmaker shall depart this life or whenever he shall have lost the spring of his arm by sickness old age infirmity or the like some ablebodied critick should be advanced to this post and have a competent salary settled on him for life to be furnished with bamboos for operas crabtreecudgels for comedies and oaken plants for tragedy at the publick expence and to the end that this place should be always disposed of according to merit i would have none preferred to it who has not given convincing proofs both of a sound judgment and a strong arm and who could not upon occasion either knock down an ox or write a comment upon horaces art of poetry in short i would have him a due composition of hercules and apollo and so rightly qualified for this important office that the trunkmaker may not be missed by our posterity  c    footnote   thomas doggett an excellent comic actor who was for many years jointmanager

manner upon the subject of   marriage as that important case deserves it would not be improper to   observe upon the peculiarity in the youth of great britain of   railing and laughing at that institution and when they fall into it   from a profligate habit of mind being insensible of the satisfaction     in that way of life and treating their wives with the most   barbarous disrespect    particular circumstances and cast of temper must teach a man the   probability of mighty uneasinesses in that state for unquestionably   some there are whose very dispositions are strangely averse to   conjugal friendship but no one i believe is by his own natural   complexion prompted to teaze and torment another for no reason but   being nearly allied to him and can there be any thing more base or   serve to sink a man so much below his own distinguishing   characteristick i mean reason than returning evil for good in so   open a manner as that of treating an helpless creature with   unkindness who has had so good an opinion of him as to believe what   he said relating to one of the greatest concerns of life by   delivering her happiness in this world to his care and protection   must not that man be abandoned even to all manner of humanity who can   deceive a woman with appearances of affection and kindness for no   other end but to torment her with more ease and authority is any   thing more unlike a gentleman than when his honour is engaged for the   performing his promises because nothing but that can oblige him to   it to become afterwards false to his word and be alone the occasion   of misery to one whose happiness he but lately pretended was dearer to   him than his own ought such a one to be trusted in his common   affairs or treated but as one whose honesty consisted only in his   incapacity of being otherwise    there is one cause of this usage no less absurd than common which   takes place among the more unthinking men and that is the desire to   appear to their friends free and at liberty and without those   trammels they have so much ridiculed to avoid   this they fly   into the other extream and grow tyrants that they may seem masters   because an uncontroulable command of their own actions is a certain   sign of entire dominion they wont so much as recede from the   government even in one muscle of their faces a kind look they   believe would be fawning and a civil answer yielding the superiority   to this must we attribute an austerity they betray in every action   what but this can put a man out of humour in his wifes company tho   he is so distinguishingly pleasant every where else the bitterness of   his replies and the severity of his frowns to the tenderest of wives   clearly demonstrate that an illgrounded fear of being thought too   submissive is at the bottom of this as i am willing to call it   affected moroseness but if it be such only put on to convince his   acquaintance of his entire dominion let him take care of the   consequence which will be certain and worse than the present evil   his seeming indifference will by degrees grow into real contempt and   if it doth not wholly alienate the affections of his wife for ever   from him make both him and her more miserable than if it really did   so    however inconsistent it may appear to be thought a wellbred person   has no small share in this clownish behaviour a discourse therefore   relating to good breeding towards a loving and a tender wife would be   of great use to this sort of gentlemen could you but once convince   them that to be civil at least is not beneath the character of a   gentleman nor even tender affection towards one who would make it   reciprocal betrays any softness or effeminacy that the most masculine   disposition need be ashamed of could you satisfy them of the   generosity of voluntary civility and the greatness of soul that is   conspicuous in benevolence without immediate obligations could you   recommend to peoples practice the saying of the gentleman quoted in   one of your speculations that he thought it incumbent upon him to   make the inclinations of a woman of merit go along with her duty   could you i say perswade these men of the beauty and reasonableness   of this sort of behaviour i have so much charity for some of them at   least to believe you would convince them of a thing they are only   ashamed to allow besides you would recommend that state in its   truest and consequently its most agreeable colours and the gentlemen   who have for any time been such professed enemies to it when occasion   should serve would return you their thanks for assisting their   interest in prevailing over their prejudices marriage in general   would by this means be a more easy and comfortable condition the   husband would be no where so well satisfied as in his own parlour nor   the wife so pleasant as in the company of her husband a desire of   being agreeable in the lover would be increased in the husband and   the mistress be more amiable by becoming the wife besides all which   i am apt to believe we should find the race of men grow wiser as their   progenitors grew kinder and the affection of the parents would be   conspicuous in the wisdom of their children in short men would in   general be much better humoured than they are did not they so   frequently

in oedip    it is very reasonable to believe that part of the pleasure which happy minds shall enjoy in a future state will arise from an enlarged contemplation of the divine wisdom in the government of the world and a discovery of the secret and amazing steps of providence from the beginning to the end of time nothing seems to be an entertainment more adapted to the nature of man if we consider that curiosity is one of the strongest and most lasting appetites implanted in us and that admiration is one of our most pleasing passions and what a perpetual succession of enjoyments will be afforded to both these in a scene so large and various as shall then be laid open to our view in the society of superior spirits who perhaps will join with us in so delightful a prospect  it is not impossible on the contrary that part of the punishment of such as are excluded from bliss may consist not only in their being denied this privilege but in having their appetites at the same time vastly encreased without any satisfaction afforded to them in these the vain pursuit of knowledge shall perhaps add to their infelicity and bewilder them into labyrinths of error darkness distraction and uncertainty of every thing but their own evil state milton has thus represented the fallen angels reasoning together in a kind of respite from their torments and creating to themselves a new

lost    in our present condition which is a middle state our minds are as it were chequered with truth and falshood and as our faculties are narrow and our views imperfect it is impossible but our curiosity must meet with many repulses the business of mankind in this life being rather to act than to know their portion of knowledge is dealt to them accordingly  from hence it is that the reason of the inquisitive has so long been exercised with difficulties in accounting for the promiscuous distribution of good and evil to the virtuous and the wicked in this world from hence come all those pathetical complaints of so many tragical events which happen to the wise and the good and of such surprising prosperity which is often the lot  of the guilty and the foolish that reason is sometimes puzzled and at a loss what to pronounce upon so mysterious a dispensation  plato expresses his abhorrence of some fables of the poets which seem to reflect on the gods as the authors of injustice and lays it down as a principle that whatever is permitted to befal a just man whether poverty sickness or any of those things which seem to be evils shall either in life or death conduce to his good my reader will observe how agreeable this maxim is to what we find delivered by a greater authority seneca has written a discourse purposely on this subject  in which he takes pains after the doctrine of the stoicks to shew that adversity is not in itself an evil and mentions a noble saying of demetrius that nothing would be more unhappy than a man who had never known affliction he compares prosperity to the indulgence of a fond mother to a child which often proves his ruin but the affection of the divine being to that of a wise father who would have his sons exercised with labour disappointment and pain that they may gather strength and improve their fortitude on this occasion the philosopher rises into the celebrated sentiment that there is not on earth a spectator more worthy the regard of a creator intent on his works than a brave man superior to his sufferings to which he adds that it must be a pleasure to jupiter himself to look down from heaven and see cato amidst the ruins of his country preserving his integrity  this thought will appear yet more reasonable if we consider human life as a state of probation and adversity as the post of honour in it assigned often to the best and most select spirits  but what i would chiefly insist on here is that we are not at present in a proper situation to judge of the counsels by which providence acts since but little arrives at our knowledge and even that little we discern imperfectly or according to the elegant figure in holy writ we see but in part and as in a glass darkly it is to be considered that providence  in its oeconomy regards the whole system of time and things together so that we cannot discover the beautiful connection between incidents which lie widely separated in time and by losing so many links of the chain our reasonings become broken and imperfect thus those parts in the moral world which have not an absolute may yet have a relative beauty in respect of some other parts concealed from us but open to his eye before whom past present and to come are set together in one point of view and those events the permission of which seems now to accuse his goodness may in the consummation of things both magnify his goodness and exalt his wisdom and this is enough to check our presumption since it is in vain to apply our measures of regularity to matters of which we know neither the antecedents nor the consequents the beginning nor the end  i shall relieve my reader from this abstracted thought by relating here a jewish tradition concerning moses   which seems to be a kind of parable illustrating what i have last mentioned that great prophet it is said was called up by a voice from heaven to the top of a mountain where in a conference with the supreme being he was permitted to propose to him some questions concerning his administration of the universe in the midst of this divine colloquy   he was commanded to look down on the plain below at the foot of the mountain there issued out a clear spring of water at which a soldier alighted from his horse to drink he was no sooner gone than a little boy came to the same place and finding a purse of gold which the soldier had dropped took it up and went away with it immediately after this came an infirm old man weary with age and travelling and having quenched his thirst sat down to rest himself by the side of the spring the soldier missing his purse returns to search for it and demands it of the old man who affirms he had not seen it and appeals to heaven in witness of his innocence the soldier not believing his protestations kills him moses fell on his face with horror and amazement when the divine voice thus prevented his expostulation be not surprised moses nor ask why the judge of the whole earth has sufferd this thing to come to pass the child is the occasion that the blood of the old man is spilt but know that the old man whom thou sawst was the murderer of that childs father      footnote

quod non es    persius sat      among all the diseases of the mind there is not one more epidemical or more pernicious than the love of flattery for as where the juices of the body are prepared to receive a malignant influence there the disease rages with most violence so in this distemper of the mind where there is ever a propensity and inclination to suck in the poison it cannot be but that the whole order of reasonable action must be overturnd for like musick it   so softens and disarms the mind   that not one arrow can resistance find  first we flatter ourselves and then the flattery of others is sure of success it awakens our selflove within a party which is ever ready to revolt from our better judgment and join the enemy without hence it is that the profusion of favours we so often see poured upon the parasite are represented to us by our selflove as justice done to man who so agreeably reconciles us to our selves when we are overcome by such soft insinuations and ensnaring compliances we gladly recompense the artifices that are made use of to blind our reason and which triumph over the weaknesses of our temper and inclinations  but were every man perswaded from how mean and low a principle this passion is derived there can be no doubt but the person who should attempt to gratify it would then be as contemptible as he is now successful tis the desire of some quality we are not possessed of or inclination to be something we are not which are the causes of our giving ourselves up to that man who bestows upon us the characters and qualities of others which perhaps suit us as ill and were as little designd for our wearing as their cloaths instead of going out of our own complectional nature into that of others twere a better and more laudable industry to improve our own and instead of a miserable copy become a good original for there is no temper no disposition so rude and untractable but may in its own peculiar cast and turn be brought to some agreeable use in conversation or in the affairs of life a person of a rougher deportment and less tied up to the usual ceremonies of behaviour will like manly in the play  please by the grace which nature gives to every action wherein she is complied with the brisk and lively will not want their admirers and even a more reserved and melancholy temper may at some times be agreeable  when there is not vanity enough awake in a man to undo him the flatterer stirs up that dormant weakness and inspires him with merit enough to be a coxcomb but if flattery be the most sordid act that can be complied with the art of praising justly is as commendable for tis laudable to praise well as poets at one and the same time give immortality and receive it themselves for a reward both are pleased the one whilst he receives the recompence of merit the other whilst he shews he knows now to discern it but above all that man is happy in this art who like a skilful painter retains the features and complection but still softens the picture into the most agreeable likeness  there can hardly i believe be imagind a more desirable pleasure than that of praise unmixd with any possibility of flattery such was that which germanicus enjoyed when the night before a battle desirous of some sincere mark of the esteem of his legions for him he is described by tacitus listening in a disguise to the discourse of a soldier and wrapt up in the fruition of his glory whilst with an undesigned sincerity they praised his noble and majestick mien his affability his valour conduct and success in war how must a man have his heart fullblown with joy in such an article of glory as this what a spur and encouragement still to proceed in those steps which had already brought him to so pure a taste of the greatest of mortal enjoyments  it sometimes happens that even enemies and envious persons bestow the sincerest marks of esteem when they least design it such afford a greater pleasure as extorted by merit and freed from all suspicion of favour or flattery thus it is with malvolio he has wit learning and discernment but temperd with an allay of envy selflove and detraction malvolio turns pale at the mirth and good humour of the company if it center not in his person he grows jealous and displeased when he ceases to be the only person admired and looks upon the commendations paid to another as a detraction from his merit and an attempt to lessen the superiority he affects but by this very method he bestows such praise as can never be suspected of flattery his uneasiness and distastes are so many sure and certain signs of anothers title to that glory he desires and has the mortification to find himself not possessed of  a good name is fitly compared to a precious ointment  and when we are praised with skill and decency tis indeed the most agreeable perfume but if too strongly admitted into a brain of a less vigorous and happy texture twill like too strong an odour overcome the senses and prove pernicious to those nerves twas intended to refresh a generous mind is of all others the most sensible of praise and dispraise and a noble spirit is as much invigorated with its due proportion of honour and applause as tis depressed by neglect and contempt but tis only persons far above the common level who are thus affected with either of these extreams as in a thermometer tis only the purest and most sublimated spirit that is either contracted or dilated by the benignity or inclemency of the season     mr spectator    the translations which you have lately given us from the greek in   some of your last papers have been the occasion of my looking into   some of those authors among whom i chanced on a collection of letters   which pass under the name of aristaenetus of all the remains of   antiquity i believe there can be nothing producd of an air so   gallant and polite each letter contains a little novel or adventure   which is told with all the beauties of language and heightened with a   luxuriance of wit there are several of them translated  but with   such wide deviations from the original and in a style so far   differing from the authors that the translator seems rather to have   taken hints for the expressing his own sense and thoughts than to   have endeavoured to render those of aristænetus in the following   translation i have kept as near the meaning of the greek as i   could and have only added a few words to make the sentences in   english fit together a little better than they would otherwise have   done the story seems to be taken from that of pygmalion and the   statue in ovid some of the thoughts are of the same turn and the   whole is written in a kind of poetical prose      philopinax to chromation      never was man more overcome with so fantastical a passion as mine     i have painted a beautiful woman and am despairing dying for the     picture my own skill has undone me tis not the dart of venus     but my own pencil has thus wounded me ah me with what anxiety am i     necessitated to adore my own idol how miserable am i whilst every     one must as much pity the painter as he praises the picture and own     my torment more than equal to my art but why do i thus complain     have there not been more unhappy and unnatural passions than mine     yes i have seen the representations of phædra narcissus and     pasiphæ phædra was unhappy in her love that of pasiphæ was     monstrous and whilst the other caught at his beloved likeness he     destroyed the watery image which ever eluded his embraces the     fountain represented narcissus to himself and the picture both     that and him thirsting after his adored image but i am yet less     unhappy i enjoy her presence continually and if i touch her i     destroy not the beauteous form but she looks pleased and a sweet     smile sits in the charming space which divides her lips one would     swear that voice and speech were issuing out and that ones ears     felt the melodious sound how often have i deceived by a lovers     credulity hearkned if she had not something to whisper me and when     frustrated of my hopes how often have i taken my revenge in kisses     from her cheeks and eyes and softly wooed her to my embrace whilst     she as to me it seemd only withheld her tongue the more to     inflame me but madman that i am shall i be thus taken with the     representation only of a beauteous face and flowing hair and thus     waste myself and melt to tears for a shadow ah sure tis something     more tis a reality for see her beauties shine out with new     lustre and she seems to upbraid me with such unkind reproaches oh     may i have a living mistress of this form that when i shall compare     the work of nature with

with considering the several methods of managing a debate which have obtained m the world  the first races of mankind used to dispute as our ordinary people do nowadays in a kind of wild logick uncultivated by rules of art  socrates introduced a catechetical method of arguing he would ask his adversary question upon question till he had convinced him out of his own mouth that his opinions were wrong this way of debating drives an enemy up into a corner seizes all the passes through which he can make an escape and forces him to surrender at discretion  aristotle changed this method of attack and invented a great variety of little weapons calld syllogisms as in the socratick way of dispute you agree to every thing which your opponent advances in the aristotelick you are still denying and contradicting some part or other of what he says socrates conquers you by stratagem aristotle by force the one takes the town by sap the other sword in hand  the universities of europe for many years carried on their debates by syllogism insomuch that we see the knowledge of several centuries laid out into objections and answers and all the good sense of the age cut and minced into almost an infinitude of distinctions  when our universities found that there was no end of wrangling this way they invented a kind of argument which is not reducible to any mood or figure in aristotle it was called the argumentum basilinum others write it bacilinum or baculinum which is pretty well expressd in our english word clublaw when they were not able to confute their antagonist they knockd him down it was their method in these polemical debates first to discharge their syllogisms and afterwards to betake themselves to their clubs till such time as they had one way or other confounded

till they had dispersed themselves for shelter into their respective garrisons  this humour i find went very far in erasmuss time for that author tells us   that upon the revival of greek letters most of the universities in europe were divided into greeks and trojans the latter were those who bore a mortal enmity to the language of the grecians insomuch that if they met with any who understood it they did not fail to treat him as a foe erasmus himself had it seems the misfortune to fall into the hands of a party of trojans who laid him on with so many blows and buffets that he never forgot their hostilities to his dying day  there is a way of managing an argument not much unlike the former which is made use of by states and communities when they draw up a hundred thousand disputants on each side and convince one another by dint of sword a certain grand monarch   was so sensible of his strength in this way of reasoning that he writ upon his great gunsratio ultima regum the logick of kings but god be thanked he is now pretty well baffled at his own weapons when one was to do with a philosopher of this kind one should remember the old gentlemans saying who had been engaged in an argument with one of the roman emperors   upon his friends telling him that he wonderd he would give up the question when he had visibly the better of the dispute i am never ashamd says he to be confuted by one who is master of fifty legions  i shall but just mention another kind of reasoning which may be called arguing by poll and another which is of equal force in which wagers are made use of as arguments according to the celebrated line in hudibras    but the most notable way of managing a controversy is that which we may call arguing by torture this is a method of reasoning which has been made use of with the poor refugees and which was so fashionable in our country during the reign of queen mary that in a passage of an author quoted by monsieur bayle   it is said the price of wood was raised in england by reason of the executions that were made in smithfield these disputants convince their adversaries with a sorites   commonly called a pile of faggots the rack is also a kind of syllogism which has been used with good effect and has made multitudes of converts men were formerly disputed out of their doubts reconciled to truth by force of reason and won over to opinions by the candour sense and ingenuity of those who had the right on their side but this method of conviction operated too slowly pain was found to be much more enlightning than reason every scruple was looked upon as obstinacy and not to be removed but by several engines invented for that purpose in a word the application of whips racks gibbets gallies dungeons fire and faggot in a dispute may be lookd upon as popish refinements upon the old heathen logick  there is another way of reasoning which seldom fails tho it be of a quite different nature to that i have last mentioned i mean convincing a man by ready money or as it is ordinarily called bribing a man to an opinion this method has often proved successful when all the others have been made use of to no purpose a man who is furnished with arguments from the mint will convince his antagonist much sooner than one who draws them from reason and philosophy gold is a wonderful clearer of the understanding it dissipates

ambition of being   useful to mankind and to think that the chief end of being as to this   life i had these good impressions given me from the handsome   behaviour of a learned generous and wealthy man towards me when i   first began the world some dissatisfaction between me and my parents   made me enter into it with less relish of business than i ought and   to turn off this uneasiness i gave my self to criminal pleasures some   excesses and a general loose conduct i know not what the excellent   man abovementioned saw in me but he descended from the superiority   of his wisdom and merit to throw himself frequently into my company   this made me soon hope that i had something in me worth cultivating   and his conversation made me sensible of satisfactions in a regular   way which i had never before imagined when he was grown familiar   with me he opened himself like a good angel and told me he had long   laboured to ripen me into a preparation to receive his friendship and   advice both which i should daily command and the use of any part of   his fortune to apply the measures he should propose to me for the   improvement of my own i assure you i cannot recollect the goodness   and confusion of the good man when he spoke to this purpose to me   without melting into tears but in a word sir i must hasten to tell   you that my heart burns with gratitude towards him and he is so   happy a man that it can never be in my power to return him his   favours in kind but i am sure i have made him the most agreeable   satisfaction i could possibly in being ready to serve others to my   utmost ability as far as is consistent with the prudence he   prescribes to me dear mr spectator i do not owe to him only the   good will and esteem of my own relations who are people of   distinction the present ease and plenty of my circumstances but also   the government of my passions and regulation of my desires i doubt   not sir but in your imagination such virtues as these of my worthy   friend bear as great a figure as actions which are more glittering in   the common estimation what i would ask of you is to give us a whole   spectator upon heroick virtue in common

amongst them and on the other side how prettily they curtsied   and received me standing in proper rows and advancing as fast as   they saw their elders or their betters dispatchd by me but so it   is mr spectator that all our good breeding is of late lost by the   unhappy arrival of a courtier or town gentleman who came lately   among us this person whereever he came into a room made a profound   bow and fell back then recovered with a soft air and made a bow to   the next and so to one or two more and then took the gross of the   room by passing by them in a continued bow till he arrived at

sort of   beau who getting into one of the sideboxes on the stage before the   curtain drew was disposed to shew the whole audience his activity by   leaping over the spikes he passd from thence to one of the entering   doors where he took snuff with a tolerable good grace displayd his   fine cloaths made two or three feint passes at the curtain with his   cane then faced about and appeard at

lovers or laid down any methods how they should support   themselves under those long separations which they are sometimes   forced to undergo i am at present in this unhappy circumstance   having parted with the best of husbands who is abroad in the service   of his country and may not possibly return for some years his warm   and generous affection while we were together with the tenderness   which he expressed to me at parting make his absence almost   insupportable i think of him every moment of the day and meet him   every night in my dreams every thing i see puts me in mind of him i   apply myself with more than ordinary diligence to the care of his   family and his estate but this instead of relieving me gives me but   so many occasions of wishing for his return i frequent the rooms   where i used to converse with him and not meeting him there sit down   in his chair and fall a weeping i love to read the books he   delighted in and to converse with the persons whom he esteemed i   visit his picture a hundred times a day and place myself overagainst   it whole hours together i pass a great part of my time in the walks   where i used to lean upon his arm and recollect in my mind the   discourses which have there passed between us i look over the several   prospects and points of view which we used to survey together fix my   eye upon the objects which he has made me take notice of and call to   mind a thousand agreeable remarks which he has made on those   occasions i write to him by every conveyance and contrary to other   people am always in good humour when an eastwind blows because it   seldom fails of bringing me a letter from him let me entreat you   sir to give me your advice upon this occasion and to let me know how   i may relieve my self in this my widowhood    i am sir your most humble servant    asteria   absence is what the poets call death in love and has given occasion to abundance of beautiful complaints in those authors who have treated of this passion in verse ovids epistles are full of them otways monimia talks very tenderly upon this subject     it was not kind   to leave me like a turtle here alone   to droop and mourn the absence of my mate   when thou art from me every place is desert   and i methinks am savage and forlorn   thy presence only tis can make me blest   heal my unquiet mind and tune my soul  the consolations of lovers on these occasions are very extraordinary besides those mentioned by asteria there are many other motives of comfort which are made use of by absent lovers  i remember in one of scuderys romances a couple of honourable lovers agreed at their parting to set aside one half hour in the day to think of each other during a tedious absence the romance tells us that they both of them punctually observed the time thus agreed upon and that whatever company or business they were engaged in they left it abruptly as soon as the clock warned them to retire the romance further adds that the lovers expected the return of this stated hour with as much impatience as if it had been a real assignation and enjoyed an imaginary happiness that was almost as pleasing to them as what they would have found from a real meeting it was an inexpressible satisfaction to these divided lovers to be assured that each was at the same time employd in the same kind of contemplation and making equal returns of tenderness and affection  if i may be allowed to mention a more serious expedient for the alleviating of absence i shall take notice of one which i have known two persons practise who joined religion to that elegance of sentiments with which the passion of love generally inspires its votaries this was at the return of such an hour to offer up a certain prayer for each other which they had agreed upon before their parting the husband who is a man that makes a figure in the polite world as well as in his own family has often told me that he could not have supported an absence of three years without this expedient  strada in one of his prolusions   gives an account of a chimerical correspondence between two friends by the help of a certain loadstone which had such virtue in it that if it touched two several needles when one of the needles so touched began   to move the other tho at never so great a distance moved at the same time and in the same manner he tells us that the two friends being each of them possessed of one of these needles made a kind of a dialplate inscribing it with the four and twenty letters in the same manner as the hours of the day are marked upon the ordinary dialplate they then fixed one of the needles on each of these plates in such a manner that it could move round without impediment so as to touch any of the four and twenty letters upon their separating from one another into distant countries they agreed to withdraw themselves punctually into their closets at a certain hour of the day and to converse with one another by means of this their invention accordingly when they were some hundred miles asunder each of them shut himself up in his closet at the time appointed and immediately cast his eye upon his dialplate if he had a mind to write any thing to his friend he directed his needle to every letter that formed the words which he had occasion for making a little pause at the end of every word or sentence to avoid confusion the friend in the mean while saw his own sympathetick needle moving of itself to every letter which that of his correspondent pointed at by this means they talked together across a whole continent and conveyed their thoughts to one another in an instant over cities or mountains seas or desarts  if monsieur scudery or any other writer of romance had introduced a necromancer who is generally in the train of a knighterrant making a present to two lovers of a couple of those abovementioned needles the reader would not have been a little pleased to have seen them corresponding with one another when they were guarded by spies and watches or separated by castles and adventures  in the mean while if ever this invention should be revived or put in practice i would propose that upon the lovers dialplate there should be written not only the four and twenty letters but several entire words which have always a place in passionate epistles as flames darts die language absence cupid heart eyes hang drown and the like this would very much abridge the lovers pains in this way of writing a letter as it would enable him to express the most useful and significant words with a single touch of the needle  c    footnote   orphan act ii   footnote   in one of stradas prolusions he lib ii prol     footnote   begun and in first reprint                                        no

manners as i   could wish a former paper of yours   concerning the misbehaviour of   people who are necessarily in each others company in travelling   ought to have been a lasting admonition against transgressions of that   kind but i had the fate of your quaker in meeting with a rude fellow   in a stagecoach who entertained two or three women of us for there   was no man besides himself with language as indecent as was ever   heard upon the water the impertinent observations which the coxcomb   made upon our shame and confusion were such that it is an unspeakable   grief to reflect upon them as much as you have declaimed against   duelling i hope you will do us the justice to declare that if the   brute has courage enough to send to the place where he saw us all   alight together to get rid of him there is not one of us but has a   lover who shall avenge the insult it would certainly be worth your   consideration to look into the frequent misfortunes of this kind to   which the modest and innocent are exposed by the licentious behaviour   of such as are as much strangers to good breeding as to virtue could   we avoid hearing what we do not approve as easily as we can seeing   what is disagreeable there were some consolation but since in a box   at a play  in an assembly of ladies or even in a pew at church   it is in the power of a gross coxcomb to utter what a woman cannot   avoid hearing how miserable is her condition who comes within the   power of such impertinents and how necessary is it to repeat   invectives against such a behaviour if the licentious had not utterly   forgot what it is to be modest they would know that offended modesty   labours under one of the greatest sufferings to which human life can   be exposed if one of these brutes could reflect thus much tho they   want shame they would be moved by their pity to abhor an impudent   behaviour in the presence of the chaste and innocent if you will   oblige us with a spectator on this subject and procure it to be   pasted against every stagecoach in greatbritain as the law of the   journey you will highly oblige the whole sex for which you have   professed so great an esteem and in particular the two ladies my   late fellowsufferers and    sir your most humble servant    rebecca ridinghood      mr spectator    the matter which i am now going to send you is an unhappy story in   low life and will recommend it self so that you must excuse the   manner of expressing it a poor idle drunken weaver in   spittlefields has a faithful laborious wife who by her frugality   and industry had laid by her as much money as purchased her a ticket   in the present lottery she had hid this very privately in the bottom   of a trunk and had given her number to a friend and confident who   had promised to keep the secret and bring her news of the success   the poor adventurer was one day gone abroad when her careless   husband suspecting she had saved some money searches every corner   till at length he finds this same ticket which he immediately carries   abroad sells and squanders away the money without the wifes   suspecting any thing of the matter a day or two after this this   friend who was a woman comes and brings the wife word that she had   a benefit of five hundred pounds the poor creature overjoyed flies   up stairs to her husband who was then at work and desires him to   leave his loom for that evening and come and drink with a friend of   his and hers below the man received this chearful invitation as bad   husbands sometimes do and after a cross word or two told her he   woudnt come his wife with tenderness renewed her importunity and   at length said to him my love i have within these few months   unknown to you scraped together as much money as has bought us a   ticket in the lottery and now here is mrs quick come   to tell   me that tis come up this morning a five hundred pound prize the   husband replies immediately you lye you slut you have no ticket   for i have sold it the poor woman upon this faints away in a fit   recovers and is now run distracted as she had no design to defraud   her husband but was willing only to participate in his good fortune   every one pities her but thinks her husbands punishment but just   this sir is matter of fact and would if the persons and   circumstances were greater in a wellwrought play be called   beautiful distress i have only sketched it out with chalk and know   a good hand can make a moving picture with worse materials    sir c      mr spectator    i am what the world calls a warm fellow and by good success in trade   i have raised myself to a capacity of making some figure in the world   but no matter for that i have now under my guardianship a couple of   nieces who will certainly make me run mad which you will not wonder   at when i tell you they are female virtuosos and during the three   years and a half that i have had them under my care they never in the   least inclined their thoughts towards any one single part of the   character of a notable woman whilst they should have been considering   the proper ingredients for a sackposset you should hear a dispute   concerning the magnetick   and in first reprint virtue of the   loadstone or perhaps the pressure of the atmosphere their language   is peculiar to themselves and they scorn to express themselves on the   meanest trifle with words that are not of a latin derivation but   this were supportable still would they suffer me to enjoy an   uninterrupted ignorance but unless i fall in with their abstracted   idea of things as they call them i must not expect to smoak one pipe   in quiet in a late fit of the gout i complained of the pain of that   distemper when my niece kitty begged leave to assure me that   whatever i might think several great philosophers both ancient and   modern were of opinion that both pleasure and pain were imaginary   distinctions   and that there was no such thing as either in   rerum natura i have often heard them affirm that the fire was not   hot and one day when i with the authority of an old fellow desired   one of them to put my blue cloak on my knees she answered sir i   will reach the cloak but take notice i do not do it as allowing your   description for it might as well be called yellow as blue for colour   is nothing but the various infractions of the rays of the sun miss   molly told me one day that to say snow was white is allowing a   vulgar error for as it contains a great quantity of nitrous   particles it might more reasonably  be supposed to be black in   short the young husseys would persuade me that to believe ones eyes   is a sure way to be deceived and have often advised me by no means   to trust any thing so fallible as my senses what i have to beg of you   now is to turn one speculation to the due regulation of female   literature so far at least as to make it consistent with the quiet   of such whose fate it is to be liable to its insults and to tell us   the difference between a gentleman that should make cheesecakes and   raise paste and a lady that reads locke and understands the   mathematicks

  sapientiæ     tull offic    i do not remember to have read any discourse written expressly upon the beauty and loveliness of virtue without considering it as a duty and as the means of making us happy both now and hereafter i design therefore this speculation as an essay upon that subject in which i shall consider virtue no further than as it is in it self of an amiable nature after having premised that i understand by the word virtue such a general notion as is affixed to it by the writers of morality and which by devout men generally goes under the name of religion and by men of the world under the name of honour  hypocrisy it self does great honour or rather justice to religion and tacitly acknowledges it to be an ornament to human nature the hypocrite would not be at so much pains to put on the appearance of virtue if he did not know it was the most proper and effectual means to gain the love and esteem of mankind  we learn from hierodes it was a common saying among the heathens that the wise man hates no body but only loves the virtuous  tully has a very beautiful gradation of thoughts to shew how amiable virtue is we love a virtuous man says he who lives in the remotest parts of the earth though we are altogether out of the reach of his virtue and can receive from it no manner of benefit nay one who died several ages ago raises a secret fondness and benevolence for him in our minds when we read his story nay what is still more one who has been the enemy of our country provided his wars were regulated by justice and humanity as in the instance of pyrrhus whom tully mentions on this occasion in opposition to hannibal such is the natural beauty and loveliness of virtue  stoicism which was the pedantry of virtue ascribes all good qualifications of what kind soever to the virtuous man accordingly cato  in the character tully has left of him carried matters so far that he would not allow any one but a virtuous man to be handsome this indeed looks more like a philosophical rant than the real opinion of a wise man yet this was what cato very seriously maintained in short the stoics thought they could not sufficiently represent the excellence of virtue if they did not comprehend in the notion of it all possible perfections and therefore did not only suppose that it was transcendently beautiful in it self but that it made the very body amiable and banished every kind of deformity from the person in whom it resided  it is a common observation that the most abandoned to all sense of goodness are apt to wish those who are related to them of a different character and it is very observable that none are more struck with the charms of virtue in the fair sex than those who by their very admiration of it are carried to a desire of ruining it  a virtuous mind in a fair body is indeed a fine picture in a good light and therefore it is no wonder that it makes the beautiful sex all over charms  as virtue in general is of an amiable and lovely nature there are some particular kinds of it which are more so than others and these are such as dispose us to do good to mankind temperance and abstinence faith and devotion are in themselves perhaps as laudable as any other virtues but those which make a man popular and beloved are justice charity munificence and in short all the good qualities that render us beneficial to each other for which reason even an extravagant man who has nothing else to recommend him but a false generosity is often more beloved and esteemed than a person of a much more finished character who is defective in this particular  the two great ornaments of virtue which shew her in the most advantageous views and make her altogether lovely are chearfulness and goodnature these generally go together as a man cannot be agreeable to others who is not easy within himself they are both very requisite in a virtuous mind to keep out melancholy from the many serious thoughts it is engaged in and to hinder its natural hatred of vice from souring into severity and censoriousness  if virtue is of this amiable nature what can we think of those who can look upon it with an eye of hatred and illwill or can suffer their aversion for a party to blot out all the merit of the person who is engaged in it a man must be excessively stupid as well as uncharitable who believes that there is no virtue but on his own side and that there are not men as honest as himself who may differ from him in political principles men may oppose one another in some particulars but ought not to carry their hatred to those qualities which are of so amiable a nature in themselves and have nothing to do with the points in dispute men of virtue though of different interests ought to consider themselves as more nearly united with one another than with the vicious part of mankind who embark with them in the same civil concerns we should bear the same love towards a man of honour who is a living antagonist which tully tells us in the forementioned passage every one naturally does to an enemy that is dead in short we should esteem virtue though in a foe and abhor vice though in a friend  i speak this with an eye to those cruel treatments which men of all sides are apt to give the characters of those who do not agree with them how many persons of undoubted probity and exemplary virtue on either side are blackned and defamed how many men of honour exposed to publick obloquy and reproach those therefore who are either the instruments or abettors in such infernal dealings ought to be looked upon as persons who make use of religion to promote their cause not of their cause to promote religion  c    footnote   we find that cato                                               no

 satisfaction which a whole clan of virtuosos have received from those   hints which you have lately given the town on the cartons of the   inimitable raphael it   should be methinks the business of a   spectator to improve the pleasures of sight and there cannot be a   more immediate way to it than recommending the study and observation   of excellent drawings and pictures when i first went to view those of   raphael which you have celebrated i must confess   was but barely   pleased the next time i liked them better but at last as i grew   better acquainted with them i fell deeply in love with them like   wise speeches they sunk deep into my heart for you know mr   spectator that a man of wit may extreamly affect one for the present   but if he has not discretion his merit soon vanishes away while a   wise man that has not so great a stock of wit shall nevertheless give   you a far greater and more lasting satisfaction just so it is in a   picture that is smartly touched but not well studied one may call it   a witty picture tho the painter in the mean time may be in danger of   being called a fool on the other hand a picture that is thoroughly   understood in the whole and well performed in the particulars that   is begun on the foundation of geometry carried on by the rules of   perspective architecture and anatomy and perfected by a good   harmony a just and natural colouring and such passions and   expressions of the mind as are almost peculiar to raphael this is   what you may justly style a wise picture and which seldom fails to   strike us dumb till we can assemble all our faculties to make but a   tolerable judgment upon it other pictures are made for the eyes only   as rattles are made for childrens ears and certainly that picture   that only pleases the eye without representing some wellchosen part   of nature or other does but shew what fine colours are to be sold at   the colourshop and mocks the works of the creator if the best   imitator of nature is not to be esteemed the best painter but he that   makes the greatest show and glare of colours it will necessarily   follow that he who can array himself in the most gaudy draperies is   best drest and he that can speak loudest the best orator every man   when he looks on a picture should examine it according to that share   of reason he is master of or he will be in danger of making a wrong   judgment if men as they walk abroad would make more frequent   observations on those beauties of nature which every moment present   themselves to their view they would be better judges when they saw   her well imitated at home this would help to correct those errors   which most pretenders fall into who are over hasty in their   judgments and will not stay to let reason come in for a share in the   decision tis for want of this that men mistake in this case and in   common life a wild extravagant pencil for one that is truly bold and   great an impudent fellow for a man of true courage and bravery hasty   and unreasonable actions for enterprizes of spirit and resolution   gaudy colouring for that which is truly beautiful a false and   insinuating discourse for simple truth elegantly recommended the   parallel will hold through all the parts of life and painting too and   the virtuosos abovementioned will be glad to see you draw it with   your terms of

eye and fall on the hero so there should be but one object of our   love even the author of nature these and the like reflections well   improved might very much contribute to open the beauty of that art   and prevent young people from being poisoned by the ill gusto of an   extravagant workman that should be imposed upon us   i am sir   your most humble servant     mr spectator    though i am a woman yet i am one of those who confess themselves   highly pleased with a speculation you obliged the world with some time   ago   from an old greek poet you call simonides in relation to   the several natures and distinctions of our own sex i could not but   admire how justly the characters of women in this age fall in with   the times of simonides there being no one of those sorts i have not   at some time or other of my life met with a sample of but sir the   subject of this present address are a set of women comprehended i   think in the ninth specie of that speculation called the apes the   description of whom i find to be that they are such as are both ugly   and illnatured who have nothing beautiful themselves and endeavour   to detract from or ridicule every thing that appears so in others   now sir this sect as i have been told is very frequent in the   great town where you live but as my circumstance of life obliges me   to reside altogether in the country though not many miles from   london i cant have met with a great number of em nor indeed is   it a desirable acquaintance as i have lately found by experience you   must know sir that at the beginning of this summer a family of these   apes came and settled for the season not far from the place where i   live as they were strangers in the country they were visited by the   ladies about em of whom i was with an humanity usual in those that   pass most of their time in solitude the apes lived with us very   agreeably our own way till towards the end of the summer when they   began to bethink themselves of returning to town then it was mr   spectator that they began to set themselves about the proper and   distinguishing business of their character and as tis said of evil   spirits that they are apt to carry away a piece of the house they are   about to leave the apes without regard to common mercy civility or   gratitude thought fit to mimick and fall foul on the faces dress   and behaviour of their innocent neighbours bestowing abominable   censures and disgraceful appellations commonly called nicknames on   all of them and in short like true fine ladies made their honest   plainness and sincerity matter of ridicule i could not but acquaint   you with these grievances as well at the desire of all the parties   injurd as from my own inclination i hope sir if you cant propose   entirely to reform this evil you will take such notice of it in some   of your future speculations as may put the deserving part of our sex   on their guard against these creatures and at the same time the apes   may be sensible that this sort of mirth is so far from an innocent   diversion that it is in the highest degree that vice which is said to   comprehend all others      i am

is nothing which one regards so much with an eye of mirth and pity as innocence when it has in it a dash of folly at the same time that one esteems the virtue one is tempted to laugh at the simplicity which accompanies it when a man is made up wholly of the dove without the least grain of the serpent in his composition he becomes ridiculous in many circumstances of life and very often discredits his best actions the cordeliers tell a story of their founder st francis that as he passed the streets in the dusk of the evening he discovered a young fellow with a maid in a corner upon which the good man say they lifted up his hands to heaven with a secret thanksgiving that there was still so much christian charity in the world the innocence of the saint made him mistake the kiss of a lover for a salute of charity i am heartily concerned when i see a virtuous man without a competent knowledge of the world and if there be any use in these my papers it is this that without presenting vice under any false alluring notions they give my reader an insight into the ways of men and represent human nature in all its changeable colours the man who has not been engaged in any of the follies of the world or as shakespear expresses it hackneyd in the ways of men may here find a picture of its follies and extravagancies the virtuous and the innocent may know in speculation what they could never arrive at by practice and by this means avoid the snares of the crafty the corruptions of the vicious and the reasonings of the prejudiced their minds may be opened without being vitiated  it is with an eye to my following correspondent mr timothy doodle who seems a very wellmeaning man that i have written this short preface to which i shall subjoin a letter from the said mr doodle      sir    i could heartily wish that you would let us know your opinion upon   several innocent diversions which are in use among us and which are   very proper to pass away a winter night for those who do not care to   throw away their time at an opera or at the playhouse i would   gladly know in particular what notion you have of hotcockles as   also whether you think that questions and commands mottoes similes   and crosspurposes have not more mirth and wit in them than those   publick diversions which are grown so very fashionable among us if   you would recommend to our wives and daughters who read your papers   with a great deal of pleasure some of those sports and pastimes that   may be practised within doors and by the fireside we who are   masters of families should be hugely obliged to you i need not tell   you that i would have these sports and pastimes not only merry but   innocent for which reason i have not mentioned either whisk or   lanterloo nor indeed so much as one and thirty after having   communicated to you my request upon this subject i will be so free as   to tell you how my wife and i pass away these tedious winter evenings   with a great deal of pleasure tho she be young and handsome and   goodhumoured to a miracle she does not care for gadding abroad like   others of her sex there is a very friendly man a colonel in the   army whom i am mightily obliged to for his civilities that comes to   see me almost every night for he is not one of those giddy young   fellows that cannot live out of a playhouse when we are together we   very often make a party at blindmans buff which is a sport that i   like the better because there is a good deal of exercise in it the   colonel and i are blinded by turns and you would laugh your heart out   to see what pains my dear takes to hoodwink us so that it is   impossible for us to see the least glimpse of light the poor colonel   sometimes hits his nose against a post and makes us die with   laughing i have generally the good luck not to hurt myself but am   very often above half an hour before i can catch either of them for   you must know we hide ourselves up and down in corners that we may   have the more sport i only give you this hint as a sample of such   innocent diversions as i would have you recommend and am most   esteemed sir your ever loving friend timothy doodle   the following letter was occasioned by my last thursdays paper upon the absence of lovers and the methods therein mentioned of making such absence supportable     sir    among the several ways of consolation which absent lovers make use of   while their souls are in that state of departure which you say is   death in love there are some very material ones that have escaped   your notice among these the first and most received is a crooked   shilling which has administered great comfort to our forefathers and   is still made use of on this occasion with very good effect in most   parts of her majestys dominions there are some i know who think a   crownpiece cut into two equal parts and preserved by the distant   lovers is of more sovereign virtue than the former but since   opinions are divided in this particular why may not the same persons   make use of both the figure of a heart whether cut in stone or cast   in metal whether bleeding upon an altar stuck with darts or held in   the hand of a cupid has always been looked upon as talismanick in   distresses of this nature i am acquainted with many a brave fellow   who carries his mistress in the lid of his snuffbox and by that   expedient has supported himself under the absence of a whole campaign   for my own part i have tried all these remedies but never found so   much benefit from any as from a ring in which my mistresss hair is   platted together very artificially in a kind of truelovers knot as   i have received great benefit from this secret i think myself obliged   to communicate it to the publick for the good of my fellowsubjects   i desire you will add this letter as an appendix to your consolations   upon absence and am your very humble servant t b   i shall conclude this paper with a letter from an university gentleman occasioned by my last tuesdays paper wherein i gave some account of the great feuds which happened formerly in those learned bodies between the modern greeks and trojans     sir    this will give you to understand that there is at present in the   society whereof i am a member a very considerable body of trojans   who upon a proper occasion would not fail to declare ourselves in   the mean while we do all we can to annoy our enemies by stratagem and   are resolved by the first opportunity to attack mr joshua barnes     whom we look upon as the achilles of the opposite party as for   myself i have had the reputation ever since i came from school of   being a trusty trojan and am resolved never to give quarter to the   smallest particle of greek whereever i chance to meet it it is   for this reason i take it very ill of you that you sometimes hang out   greek colours at the head of your paper and sometimes give a word   of the enemy even in the body of it when i meet with any thing of   this nature i throw down your speculations upon the table with that   form of words which we make use of when we declare war upon an author      græcum est non potest legi      i give you

teatable i conjure you   to print what i now write to you for i have no other way to   communicate what i have to say to the fair sex on the most important   circumstance of life even the care of children i do not understand   that you profess your paper is always to consist of matters which are   only to entertain the learned and polite but that it may agree with   your design to publish some which may tend to the information of   mankind in general and when it does so you do more than writing wit   and humour give me leave then to tell you that of all the abuses   that ever you have as yet endeavoured to reform certainly not one   wanted so much your assistance as the abuse in nursing   children   it is unmerciful to see that a woman endowed with all the perfections   and blessings of nature can as soon as she is delivered turn off   her innocent tender and helpless infant and give it up to a woman   that is ten thousand to one neither in health nor good condition   neither sound in mind nor body that has neither honour nor   reputation neither love nor pity for the poor babe but more regard   for the money than for the whole child and never will take further   care of it than what by all the encouragement of money and presents   she is forced to like æsops earth which would not nurse the plant   of another ground altho never so much improved by reason that plant   was not of its own production and since anothers child is no more   natural to a nurse than a plant to a strange and different ground how   can it be supposed that the child should thrive and if it thrives   must it not imbibe the gross humours and qualities of the nurse like   a plant in a different ground or like a graft upon a different stock   do not we observe that a lamb sucking a goat changes very much its   nature nay even its skin and wooll into the goat kind the power of a   nurse over a child by infusing into it with her milk her qualities   and disposition is sufficiently and daily observed hence came that   old saying concerning an illnatured and malicious fellow that he had   imbibed his malice with his nurses milk or that some brute or other   had been his nurse hence romulus and remus were said to have been   nursed by a wolf telephus the son of hercules by a hind pelias   the son of neptune by a mare and ægisthus by a goat not that   they had actually suckd such creatures as some simpletons have   imagind but that their nurses had been of such a nature and temper   and infused such into them    many instances may be produced from good authorities and daily   experience that children actually suck in the several passions and   depraved inclinations of their nurses as anger malice fear   melancholy sadness desire and aversion this diodorus lib     witnesses when he speaks saying that nero the emperors nurse had   been very much addicted to drinking which habit nero received from   his nurse and was so very particular in this that the people took so   much notice of it as instead of tiberius nero they calld him   biberius mero the same diodorus also relates of caligula   predecessor to nero that his nurse used to moisten the nipples of   her breast frequently with blood to make caligula take the better   hold of them which says diodorus was the cause that made him so   bloodthirsty and cruel all his lifetime after that he not only   committed frequent murder by his own hand but likewise wished that   all human kind wore but one neck that he might have the pleasure to   cut it off such like degeneracies astonish the parents who not   knowing after whom the child can take see   one to incline to   stealing another to drinking cruelty stupidity yet all these are   not minded nay it is easy to demonstrate that a child although it   be born from the best of parents may be corrupted by an illtempered   nurse how many children do we see daily brought into fits   consumptions rickets c merely by sucking their nurses when in a   passion or fury but indeed almost any disorder of the nurse is a   disorder to the child and few nurses can be found in this town but   what labour under some distemper or other the first question that is   generally asked a young woman that wants to be a nurse why  she   should be a nurse to other peoples children is answered by her   having an ill husband and that she must make shift to live i think   now this very answer is enough to give any body a shock if duly   considered for an ill husband may or ten to one if he does not   bring home to his wife an ill distemper or at least vexation and   disturbance besides as she takes the child out of meer necessity her   food will be accordingly or else very coarse at best whence proceeds   an illconcocted and coarse food for the child for as the blood so   is the milk and hence i am very well assured proceeds the scurvy the   evil and many other distempers i beg of you for the sake of the   many poor infants that may and will be saved by weighing this case   seriously to exhort the people with the utmost vehemence to let the   children suck their own mothers   both for the benefit of mother   and child for the general argument that a mother is weakned by   giving suck to her children is vain and simple i will maintain that   the mother grows stronger by it and will have her health better than   she would have otherwise she will find it the greatest cure and   preservative for the vapours and future miscarriages much beyond any   other remedy whatsoever her children will be like giants whereas   otherwise they are but living shadows and like unripe fruit and   certainly if a woman is strong enough to bring forth a child she is   beyond all doubt strong enough to nurse it afterwards it grieves me   to observe and consider how many poor children are daily ruind by   careless nurses and yet how tender ought they to be of a poor infant   since the least hurt or blow especially upon the head may make it   senseless stupid or otherwise miserable for ever    but i cannot well leave this subject as yet for it seems to me very   unnatural that a woman that has fed a child as part of her self for   nine months should have no desire to nurse it farther when brought   to light and before her eyes and when by its cry it implores her   assistance and the office of a mother do not the very cruellest of   brutes tend their young ones with all the care and delight imaginable   for how can she be calld a mother that will not nurse her young ones   the earth is called the mother of all things not because she   produces but because she maintains and nurses what she produces the   generation of the infant is the effect of desire but the care of it   argues virtue and choice i am not ignorant but that there are some   cases of necessity where a mother cannot give suck and then out of   two evils the least must be chosen but there are so very few that i   am sure in a thousand there is hardly one real instance for if a   woman does but know that her husband can spare about three or six   shillings a week extraordinary altho this is but seldom considered   she certainly with the assistance of her gossips will soon perswade   the good man to send the child to nurse and easily impose upon him by   pretending indisposition this cruelty is supported by fashion and   nature gives place to custom sir your humble servant  t    footnote   nursing of and in first reprint   footnote   seeing and in  st r   footnote   is why and in  st r   footnote   mother

eloquence by a woman whose name if i am not mistaken was aspasia i have indeed very often looked upon that art as the most proper for the female sex and i think the universities would do well to consider whether they should not fill the rhetorick chairs with she professors  it has been said in the praise of some men that they could talk whole hours together upon any thing but it must be owned to the honour of the other sex that there are many among them who can talk whole hours together upon nothing i have known a woman branch out into a long extempore dissertation upon the edging of a petticoat and chide her servant for breaking a china cup in all the figures of rhetorick  were women admitted to plead in courts of judicature i am perswaded they would carry the eloquence of the bar to greater heights than it has yet arrived at if any one doubts this let him but be present at those debates which frequently arise among the ladies of the   british fishery  the first kind therefore of female orators which i shall take notice of are those who are employed in stirring up the passions a part of rhetorick in which socrates his wife had perhaps made a greater proficiency than his abovementioned teacher  the second kind of female orators are those who deal in invectives and who are commonly known by the name of the censorious the imagination and elocution of this set of rhetoricians is wonderful with what a fluency of invention and copiousness of expression will they enlarge upon every little slip in the behaviour of another with how many different circumstances and with what variety of phrases will they tell over the same story i have known an old lady make an unhappy marriage the subject of a months conversation she blamed the bride in one place pitied her in another laughed at her in a third wondered at her in a fourth was angry with her in a fifth and in short wore out a pair of coachhorses in expressing her concern for her at length after having quite exhausted the subject on this side she made a visit to the newmarried pair praised the wife for the prudent choice she had made told her the unreasonable reflections which some malicious people had cast upon her and desired that they might be better acquainted the censure and approbation of this kind of women are therefore only to be considerd as helps to discourse  a third kind of female orators may be comprehended under the word gossips mrs fiddle faddle is perfectly accomplished in this sort of eloquence she launches out into descriptions of christenings runs divisions upon an headdress knows every dish of meat that is served up in her neighbourhood and entertains her company a whole afternoon together with the wit of her little boy before he is able to speak  the coquet may be looked upon as a fourth kind of female orator to give her self the larger field for discourse she hates and loves in the same breath talks to her lapdog or parrot is uneasy in all kinds of weather and in every part of the room she has false quarrels and feigned obligations to all the men of her acquaintance sighs when she is not sad and laughs when she is not merry the coquet is in particular a great mistress of that part of oratory which is called action and indeed seems to speak for no other purpose but as it gives her an opportunity of stirring a limb or varying a feature of glancing her eyes or playing with her fan  as for newsmongers politicians mimicks storytellers with other characters of that nature which give birth to loquacity they are as commonly found among the men as the women for which reason i shall pass them over in silence  i have often been puzzled to assign a cause why women should have this talent of a ready utterance in so much greater perfection than men i have sometimes fancied that they have not a retentive power or the faculty of suppressing their thoughts as men have but that they are necessitated to speak every thing they think and if so it would perhaps furnish a very strong argument to the cartesians for the supporting of their doctrine  that the soul always thinks but as several are of opinion that the fair sex are not altogether strangers to the art of dissembling and concealing their thoughts i have been forced to relinquish that opinion and have therefore endeavoured to seek after some better reason in order to it a friend of mine who is an excellent anatomist has promised me by the first opportunity to dissect a womans tongue and to examine whether there may not be in it certain juices which render it so wonderfully voluble or   flippant or whether the fibres of it may not be made up of a finer or more pliant thread or whether there are not in it some particular muscles which dart it up and down by such sudden glances and vibrations or whether in the last place there may not be certain undiscovered channels running from the head and the heart to this little instrument of loquacity and conveying into it a perpetual affluence of animal spirits nor must i omit the reason which hudibras has given why those who can talk on trifles speak with the greatest fluency namely that the tongue is like a racehorse which runs the faster the lesser weight it carries  which of these reasons soever may be looked upon as the most probable i think the irishmans thought was very natural who after some hours conversation with a female orator told her that he believed her tongue was very glad when she was asleep for that it had not a moments rest all the while she was awake  that excellent old ballad of the wanton wife of bath has the following remarkable lines    i think quoth thomas womens tongues   of aspen leaves are made  and ovid though in the description of a very barbarous circumstance tells us that when the tongue of a beautiful female was cut out and thrown upon the ground it could not forbear muttering even in that posture   comprensam forcipe linguam   abstulit ense fero radix micat ultima linguæ   ipsa jacet terræque tremens immurmurat atræ   utque salire solet mutilatæ cauda colubræ   palpitat   if a tongue would be talking without a mouth what could it have done when it had all its organs of speech and accomplices of sound about it i might here mention the story of the pippinwoman had not i some reason to look upon it as fabulous  i must confess i am so wonderfully charmed with the musick of this little instrument that i would by no means discourage it all that i aim at by this dissertation is to cure it of several disagreeable notes and in particular of those little jarrings and dissonances which arise from anger censoriousness gossiping and coquetry in short i would always have it tuned by goodnature truth discretion and sincerity  c    footnote   that

endeavour to be beneficial to society and who upon all occasions which their circumstances of life can administer do not take a certain unfeigned pleasure in conferring benefits of one kind or other those whose great talents and high birth have placed them in conspicuous stations of life are indispensably obliged to exert some noble inclinations for the service of the world or else such advantages become misfortunes and shade and privacy are a more eligible portion where opportunities and inclinations are given to the same person we sometimes see sublime instances of virtue which so dazzle our imaginations that we look with scorn on all which in lower scenes of life we may our selves be able to practise but this is a vicious way of thinking and it bears some spice of romantick madness for a man to imagine that he must grow ambitious or seek adventures to be able to do great actions it is in every mans power in the world who is above meer poverty not only to do things worthy but heroick the great foundation of civil virtue is selfdenial and there is no one above the necessities of life but has opportunities of exercising that noble quality and doing as much as his circumstances will bear for the ease and convenience of other men and he who does more than ordinarily men practise upon such occasions as occur in his life deserves the value of his friends as if he had done enterprizes which are usually attended with the highest glory men of publick spirit differ rather in their circumstances than their virtue and the man who does all he can in a low station is more a  hero than he who omits any worthy action he is able to accomplish in a great one it is not many years ago since lapirius in wrong of his elder brother came to a great estate by gift of his father by reason of the dissolute behaviour of the firstborn shame and contrition reformed the life of the disinherited youth and he became as remarkable for his good qualities as formerly for his errors lapirius who observed his brothers amendment sent him on a newyears day in the morning the following letter    honoured brother    i enclose to you the deeds whereby my father gave me this

domestick way of life deny themselves many advantages to satisfy a generous benevolence which they bear to their friends oppressed with distresses and calamities such natures one may call stores of providence which are actuated by a secret celestial influence to undervalue the ordinary gratifications of wealth to give comfort to an heart loaded with affliction to save a falling family to preserve a branch of trade in their neighbourhood and give work to the industrious preserve the portion of the helpless infant and raise the head of the mourning father people whose hearts are wholly bent towards pleasure or intent upon gain never hear of the noble occurrences among men of industry and humanity it would look like a city romance to tell them of the generous merchant who the other day sent this billet to an eminent trader under difficulties to support himself in whose fall many hundreds besides himself had perished but because i think there is more spirit and true gallantry in it than in any letter i have ever read from strepkon to phillis i shall insert it even in the mercantile honest stile in which it was sent    sir    i have heard of the casualties which have involved

somewhere in montaigne mention made of a familybook wherein all the occurrences that happened from one generation of that house to another were recorded were there such a method in the families which are concerned in this generosity it would be an hard task for the greatest in europe to give in their own an instance of a benefit better placed or conferred with a more graceful air it has been heretofore urged how barbarous and inhuman is any unjust step made to the disadvantage of a trader and by how much such an act towards him is detestable by so much an act of kindness towards him is laudable i remember to have heard a bencher of the temple tell a story of a tradition in their house where they had formerly a custom of chusing kings for such a season and allowing him his expences at the charge of the society one of our kings said my friend carried his royal inclination a little too far and there was a committee ordered to look into the management of his treasury among other things it appeared that his majesty walking incog in the cloister had overheard a poor man say to another such a small sum would make me the happiest man in the world the king out of his royal

i make choice of a subject that has not been treated on by others i throw together my reflections on it without any order or method so that they may appear rather in the looseness and freedom of an essay than in the regularity of a set discourse it is after this manner that i shall consider laughter and ridicule in my present paper  man is the merriest species of the creation all above and below him are serious he sees things in a different light from other beings and finds his mirth arising from objects that perhaps cause something like pity or displeasure in higher natures laughter is indeed a very good counterpoise to the spleen and it seems but reasonable that we should be capable of receiving joy from what is no real good to us since we can receive grief from what is no real evil  i have in my fortyseventh paper raised a speculation on the notion of a modern philosopher   who describes the first motive of laughter to be a secret comparison which we make between our selves and the persons we laugh at or in other words that satisfaction which we receive from the opinion of some preeminence in our selves when we see the absurdities of another or when we reflect on any past absurdities of our own this seems to hold in most cases and we may observe that the vainest part of mankind are the most addicted to this passion  i have read a sermon of a conventual in the church of rome on those words of the wise man i said of laughter it is mad and of mirth what does it upon which he laid it down as a point of doctrine that laughter was the effect of original sin and that adam could not laugh before the fall  laughter while it lasts slackens and unbraces the mind weakens the faculties and causes a kind of remissness and dissolution in all the powers of the soul and thus far it may be looked upon as a weakness in the composition of human nature but if we consider the frequent reliefs we receive from it and how often it breaks the gloom which is apt to depress the mind and damp our spirits with transient unexpected gleams of joy one would take care not to grow too wise for so great a pleasure of life  the talent of turning men into ridicule and exposing to laughter those one converses with is the qualification of little ungenerous tempers a young man with this cast of mind cuts himself off from all manner of improvement every one has his flaws and weaknesses nay the greatest blemishes are often found in the most shining characters but what an absurd thing is it to pass over all the valuable parts of a man and fix our attention on his infirmities to observe his imperfections more than his virtues and to make use of him for the sport of others rather than for our own improvement  we therefore very often find that persons the most accomplished in ridicule are those who are very shrewd at hitting a blot without exerting any thing masterly in themselves as there are many eminent criticks who never writ a good line there are many admirable buffoons that animadvert upon every single defect in another without ever discovering the least beauty of their own by this means these unlucky little wits often gain reputation in the esteem of vulgar minds and raise themselves above persons of much more laudable characters  if the talent of ridicule were employed to laugh men out of vice and folly it might be of some use to the world but instead of this we find that it is generally made use of to laugh men out of virtue and good sense by attacking every thing that is solemn and serious decent and praiseworthy in human life  we may observe that in the first ages of the world when the great souls and masterpieces of human nature were produced men shined by a noble simplicity of behaviour and were strangers to those little embellishments which are so fashionable in our present conversation and it is very remarkable that notwithstanding we fall short at present of the ancients in poetry painting oratory history architecture and all the noble arts and sciences which depend more upon genius than experience we exceed them as much in doggerel humour burlesque and all the trivial arts of ridicule we meet with more raillery among the moderns but more good sense among the ancients  the two great branches of ridicule in writing are comedy and burlesque the first ridicules persons by drawing them in their proper characters the other by drawing them quite unlike themselves burlesque is therefore of two kinds the first represents mean persons in the accoutrements of heroes the other describes great persons acting and speaking like the basest among the people don quixote is an instance of the first and lucians gods of the second it is a dispute among the criticks whether burlesque poetry runs best in heroick verse like that of the dispensary   or in doggerel like that of hudibras i think where the low character is to be raised the heroick is the proper measure but when an hero is to be pulled down and degraded it is done best in doggerel  if hudibras had been set out with as much wit and humour in heroick verse as he is in doggerel he would have made a much more agreeable figure than he does though the generality of his readers are so wonderfully pleased with the double rhimes that i do not expect many will be of my opinion in this particular  i shall conclude this essay upon laughter with observing that the metaphor of laughing applied to fields and meadows when they are in flower or to trees when they are in blossom runs through all languages which i have not observed of any other metaphor excepting that of fire and burning when they are applied to love this shews that we naturally regard laughter as what is in it self both amiable and beautiful for this reason likewise venus has gained the title of greek philomeídaes the laughterloving dame as waller has translated it and is represented by horace as the goddess who delights in laughter milton in a joyous assembly of imaginary persons   has given us a very poetical figure of laughter his whole band of mirth is so finely described that i shall set   down the passage at length    but come thou goddess fair and free   in heaven ycleped euphrosyne   and by men hearteasing mirth   whom lovely venus at a birth   with two sister graces more   to ivycrowned bacchus bore   haste thee nymph and bring with

request by the latin motto which i address   to you i am very sensible i ought not to use many words to you who   are one of but few but the following piece as it relates to   speculation in propriety of speech being a curiosity in its kind   begs your patience it was found in a poetical virtuosos closet among   his rarities and since the several treatises of thumbs ears and   noses have obliged the world this of eyes is at your service    the first eye of consequence under the invisible author of all is   the visible luminary of the universe this glorious spectator is said   never to open his eyes at his rising in a morning without having a   whole kingdom of adorers in persian silk waiting at his levée   millions of creatures derive their sight from this original who   besides his being the great director of opticks is the surest test   whether eyes be of the same species with that of an eagle or that of   an owl the one he emboldens with a manly assurance to look speak   act or plead before the faces of a numerous assembly the other he   dazzles out of countenance into a sheepish dejectedness the sunproof   eye dares lead up a dance in a full court and without blinking at the   lustre of beauty can distribute an eye of proper complaisance to a   room crowded with company each of which deserves particular regard   while the other sneaks from conversation like a fearful debtor who   never dares to look out but when he can see no body and no body   him    the next instance of opticks is the famous argus who to  speak in   the language of cambridge was one of an hundred and being used as   a spy in the affairs of jealousy was obliged to have all his eyes   about him we have no account of the particular colours casts and   turns of this body of eyes but as he was pimp for his mistress   juno tis probable he used all the modern leers sly glances and   other ocular activities to serve his purpose some look upon him as   the then king at arms to the heathenish deities and make no more of   his eyes than as so many spangles of his heralds coat    the next upon the optick list is old janus who stood in a   doublesighted capacity like a person placed betwixt two opposite   lookingglasses and so took a sort of retrospective cast at one view   copies of this doublefaced way are not yet out of fashion with many   professions and the ingenious artists pretend to keep up this species   by doubleheaded canes and spoons   but there is no mark of this   faculty except in the emblematical way of a wise general having an   eye to both front and rear or a pious man taking a review and   prospect of his past and future state at the same time    i must own that the names colours qualities and turns of eyes vary   almost in every head for not to mention the common appellations of   the black the blue the white the gray and the like the most   remarkable are those that borrow their titles from animals by   vertue of some particular quality or resemblance they bear to the eyes   of the respective creatures as that of a greedy rapacious aspect   takes its name from the cat that of a sharp piercing nature from the   hawk those of an amorous roguish look derive their title even from   the sheep and we say such an one has a sheeps eye not so much to   denote the innocence as the simple slyness of the cast nor is this   metaphorical inoculation a modern invention for we find homer   taking the freedom to place the eye of an ox bull or cow in one of   his principal goddesses by that frequent expression of      greek boôpis pótnia haerae     now as to the peculiar qualities of the eye that fine part of our   constitution seems as much the receptacle and seat of our passions   appetites and inclinations as the mind it self and at least it is the   outward portal to introduce them to the house within or rather the   common thoroughfare to let our affections pass in and out love   anger pride and avarice all visibly move in those little orbs i   know a young lady that cant see a certain gentleman pass by without   shewing a secret desire of seeing him again by a dance in her   eyeballs nay she cant for the heart of her help looking half a   streets length after any man in a gay dress you cant behold a   covetous spirit walk by a goldsmiths shop without casting a wistful   eye at the heaps upon the counter does not a haughty person shew the   temper of his soul in the supercilious rowl of his eye and how   frequently in the height of passion does that moving picture in our   head start and stare gather a redness and quick flashes of lightning   and make all its humours sparkle with fire as virgil finely describes   it     ardentis ab ore     scintillæ absistunt oculis micat acribus ignis      as for the various turns of the eyesight such as the voluntary or   involuntary the half or the whole leer i shall not enter into a very   particular account of them but let me observe that oblique vision   when natural was anciently the mark of bewitchery and magical   fascination and to this day tis a malignant ill look but when tis   forced and affected it carries a wanton design and in playhouses   and other publick places this ocular intimation is often an   assignation for bad practices but this irregularity in vision   together with such enormities as tipping the wink the circumspective   rowl the sidepeep through a thin hood or fan must be put in the   class of heteropticks as all wrong notions of religion are ranked   under the general name of heterodox all the pernicious applications   of sight are more immediately under the direction of a spectator and   i hope you will arm your readers against the mischiefs which are daily   done by killing eyes in which you will highly oblige

disturb whole assemblies without any regard to time place or   modesty you complained also that a starer is not usually a person to   be convinced by reason of the thing nor so easily rebuked as to   amend by admonitions i thought therefore fit to acquaint you with a   convenient mechanical way which may easily prevent or correct   staring by an optical contrivance of new perspectiveglasses short

foreigner and frights a country squire than the cries of london my good friend sir roger often declares that he cannot get them out of his head or go to sleep for them the first week that he is in town on the contrary will honeycomb calls them the ramage de la ville and prefers them to the sounds of larks and nightingales with all the musick of the fields and woods i have lately received a letter from some very odd fellow upon this subject which i shall leave with my reader without saying any thing further of it     sir    i am a man of all business and would willingly turn my head to any   thing for an honest livelihood i have invented several projects for   raising many millions of money without burthening the subject but i   cannot get the parliament to listen to me who look upon me forsooth   as a crack and a projector so that despairing to enrich either my   self or my country by this publickspiritedness i would make some   proposals to you relating to a design which i have very much at heart   and which may procure me a   handsome subsistence if you will be   pleased to recommend it to the cities of london and westminster    the post i would aim at is to be comptrollergeneral of the london   cries which are at present under no manner of rules or discipline i   think i am pretty well qualified for this place as being a man of   very strong lungs of great insight into all the branches of our   british trades and manufactures and of a competent skill in musick    the cries of london may be divided into vocal and instrumental as   for the latter they are at present under a very great disorder a   freeman of london has the privilege of disturbing a whole street for   an hour together with the twanking of a brasskettle or a fryingpan   the watchmans thump at midnight startles us in our beds as much as   the breaking in of a thief the sowgelders horn has indeed something   musical in it but this is seldom heard within the liberties i would   therefore propose that no instrument of this nature should be made   use of which i have not tuned and licensed after having carefully   examined in what manner it may affect the ears of her majestys liege   subjects    vocal cries are of a much larger extent and indeed so full of   incongruities and barbarisms that we appear a distracted city to   foreigners who do not comprehend the meaning of such enormous   outcries milk is generally sold in a note above ela and in sounds   so exceeding   shrill that it often sets our teeth on   edge   the chimneysweeper is confined   to no certain pitch he   sometimes utters himself in the deepest base and sometimes in the   sharpest treble sometimes in the highest and sometimes in the lowest   note of the gamut the same observation might be made on the retailers   of smallcoal not to mention broken glasses or brickdust in these   therefore and the like cases it should be my care to sweeten and   mellow the voices of these itinerant tradesmen before they make their   appearance in our streets as also to accommodate their cries to their   respective wares and to take care in particular that those may not   make the most noise who have the least to sell which is very   observable in the venders of cardmatches to whom i cannot but apply   that old proverb of much cry but little wool    some of these last mentioned musicians are so very loud in the sale   of these trifling manufactures that an honest splenetick gentleman of   my acquaintance bargained with one of them never to come into the   street where he lived but what was the effect of this contract why   the whole tribe of cardmatchmakers which frequent that quarter   passed by his door the very next day in hopes of being bought off   after the same manner    it is another great imperfection in our london cries that there is   no just time nor measure observed in them our news should indeed be   published in a very quick time because it is a commodity that will   not keep cold it should not however be cried with the same   precipitation as fire yet this is generally the case a bloody battle   alarms the town from one end to another in an instant every motion of   the french is published in so great a hurry that one would think   the enemy were at our gates this likewise i would take upon me to   regulate in such a manner that there should be some distinction made   between the spreading of a victory a march or an incampment a   dutch a portugal or a spanish mail nor must i omit under this   head those excessive alarms with which several boisterous rusticks   infest our streets in turnip season and which are more inexcusable   because these are wares which are in no danger of cooling upon their   hands    there are others who affect a very slow time and are in my opinion   much more tuneable than the former the cooper in particular swells   his last note in an hollow voice that is not without its harmony nor   can i forbear being inspired with a most agreeable melancholy when i   hear that sad and solemn air with which the public are very often   asked if they have any chairs to mend your own memory may suggest to   you many other lamentable ditties of the same nature in which the   musick is wonderfully languishing and melodious    i am always pleased with that particular time of the year which is   proper for the pickling of dill and cucumbers but alas this cry   like the song of the nightingale   is not heard above two months   it would therefore be worth while to consider whether the same air   might not in some cases be adapted to other words    it might likewise deserve our most serious consideration how far in   a wellregulated city those humourists are to be tolerated who not   contented with the traditional cries of their forefathers have   invented particular songs and tunes of their own such as was not   many years since the pastryman commonly known by the name of the   collymollypuff and such as is at this day the vender of powder and   washballs who if i am rightly informed goes under the name of   powderwatt    i must not here omit one particular absurdity which runs through this   whole vociferous generation and which renders their cries very often   not only incommodious but altogether useless to the publick i mean   that idle accomplishment which they all of them aim at of crying so   as not to be understood whether or no they have learned this from   several of our affected singers i will not take upon me to say but   most certain it is that people know the wares they deal in rather by   their tunes than by their words insomuch that i have sometimes seen a   country boy run out to buy apples of a bellowsmender and gingerbread   from a grinder of knives and scissars nay so strangely infatuated are   some very eminent artists of this particular grace in a cry that none   but then acquaintance are able to guess at their profession for who   else can know that work if i had it should be the signification of   a corncutter    forasmuch therefore as persons of this rank are seldom men of genius   or capacity i think it would be very proper that some man of good   sense and sound judgment should preside over these publick cries who   should permit none to lift up their voices in our streets that have   not tuneable throats and are not only able to overcome the noise of   the croud and the rattling of coaches but also to vend their   respective merchandizes in apt phrases and in the most distinct and   agreeable sounds i do therefore humbly recommend my self as a person   rightly qualified for this post and if i meet with fitting   encouragement shall communicate some other projects which i have by   me that may no less conduce to the emolument of the

great   which moves men to that extravagance certain it is that the whole   strength of the mind is sometimes seated there that a kind look   imparts all that a years discourse could give you in one

shall in my next make you a present of   secret history by translating all the looks of the next assembly of   ladies and gentlemen into words to adorn some future paper i am   sir your faithful friend mary heartfree      dear mr spectator   i have a sot of a husband that lives a very scandalous life and   wastes away his body and fortune in debaucheries and is immoveable to   all the arguments i can urge to him i would gladly know whether in   some cases a cudgel may not be allowed as a good figure of speech and   whether it may not be lawfully used by a female orator   your humble servant   barbara crabtree      mr spectator      though i am a practitioner in the law of some standing and have heard   many eminent pleaders in my time as well as other eloquent speakers   of both universities yet i agree with you that women are better   qualified to succeed in oratory than the men and believe this is to   be resolved into natural causes you have mentioned only the   volubility of their tongue but what do you think of the silent   flattery of their pretty faces and the perswasion which even an   insipid discourse carries with it when flowing from beautiful lips to   which it would be cruel to deny any thing it is certain too that   they are possessed of some springs of rhetorick which men want such   as tears fainting fits and the like which i have seen employed upon   occasion with good success you must know i am a plain man and love my   money yet i have a spouse who is so great an orator in this way that   she draws from me what sum she pleases every room in my house is   furnished with trophies of her eloquence rich cabinets piles of   china japan screens and costly jars and if you were to come into my   great parlour you would fancy your self in an india warehouse   besides this she keeps a squirrel and i am doubly taxed to pay for   the china he breaks she is seized with periodical fits about the time   of the subscriptions to a new opera and is drowned in tears after   having seen any woman there in finer cloaths than herself these are   arts of perswasion purely feminine and which a tender heart cannot   resist what i would therefore desire of you is to prevail with your   friend who has promised to dissect a female tongue that he would at   the same time give us the anatomy of a female eye and explain the   springs and sluices which feed it with such ready supplies of   moisture and likewise shew by what means if possible they may be   stopped at a reasonable expence or indeed since there is something   so moving in the very image of weeping beauty it would be worthy his   art to provide that these eloquent drops may no more be lavished on   trifles or employed as servants to their wayward wills but reserved   for serious occasions in life to adorn generous pity true penitence   or real sorrow   i am c   t    footnote   quis temeros oculus mihi fascinat agnosvirg   footnote   this letter is by john hughes

nuper    hor    there is nothing which more denotes a great mind than the abhorrence of envy and detraction this passion reigns more among bad poets than among any other set of men  as there are none more ambitious of fame than those who are conversant in poetry it is very natural for such as have not succeeded in it to depreciate the works of those who have for since they cannot raise themselves to the reputation of their fellowwriters they must endeavour to sink it to their own pitch if they would still keep themselves upon a level with them  the greatest wits that ever were produced in one age lived together in so good an understanding and celebrated one another with so much generosity that each of them receives an additional lustre from his contemporaries and is more famous for having lived with men of so extraordinary a genius than if he had himself been the sole wonder   of the age i need not tell my reader that i here point at the reign of augustus and i believe he will be of my opinion that neither virgil nor horace would have gained so great a reputation in the world had they not been the friends and admirers of each other indeed all the great writers of that age for whom singly we have so great an esteem stand up together as vouchers for one anothers reputation but at the same time that virgil was celebrated by gallus propertius horace varius tucca and ovid we know that bavius and maevius were his declared foes and calumniators  in our own country a man seldom sets up for a poet without attacking the reputation of all his brothers in the art the ignorance of the moderns the scribblers of the age the decay of poetry are the topicks of detraction with which he makes his entrance into the world but how much more noble is the fame that is built on candour and ingenuity according to those beautiful lines of sir john denham in his poem on fletchers works    but whither am i strayed i need not raise   trophies to thee from other mens dispraise   nor is thy fame on lesser ruins built   nor needs thy juster title the foul guilt   of eastern kings who to secure their reign   must have their brothers sons and kindred slain  i am sorry to find that an author who is very justly esteemed among the best judges has admitted some stroaks of this nature into a very fine poem i mean the art of criticism which was publishd some months since and is a masterpiece in its kind   the observations follow one another like those in horaces art of poetry without that methodical regularity which would have been requisite in a prose author they are some of them uncommon but such as the reader must assent to when he sees them explained with that elegance and perspicuity in which they are delivered as for those which are the most known and the most received they are placed in so beautiful a light and illustrated with such apt allusions that they have in them all the graces of novelty and make the reader who was before acquainted with them still more convinced of their truth and solidity and here give me leave to mention what monsieur boileau has so very well enlarged upon in the preface to his works that wit and fine writing doth not consist so much in advancing things that are new as in giving things that are known an agreeable turn it is impossible for us who live in the latter ages of the world to make observations in criticism morality or in any art or science which have not been touched upon by others we have little else left us but to represent the common sense of mankind in more strong more beautiful or more uncommon lights if a reader examines horaces art of poetry he will find but very few precepts in it which he may not meet with in aristotle and which were not commonly known by all the poets of the augustan age his way of expressing and applying them not his invention of them is what we are chiefly to admire  for this reason i think there is nothing in the world so tiresome as the works of those criticks who write in a positive dogmatick way without either language genius or imagination if the reader would see how the best of the latin criticks writ he may find their manner very beautifully described in the characters of horace petronius quintilian and longinus as they are drawn in the essay of which i am now speaking  since i have mentioned longinus who in his reflections has given us the same kind of sublime which he observes in the several passages that occasioned them i cannot but take notice that our english author has after the same manner exemplified several of his precepts in the very precepts themselves i shall produce two or three instances of this kind speaking of the insipid smoothness which some readers are so much in love with he has the following verses    these equal syllables alone require   tho oft the ear the open vowels tire   while expletives their feeble aid do join   and ten low words oft creep in one dull line  the gaping of the vowels in the second line the expletive do in the third and the ten monosyllables in the fourth give such a beauty to this passage as would have been very much admired in an ancient poet the reader may observe the following lines in the same view    a needless alexandrine ends the song   that like a wounded snake drags its slow length along  and afterwards    tis not enough no harshness gives offence   the sound must seem an eccho to the sense   soft is the strain when zephyr gently blows   and the smooth stream in smoother numbers flows   but when loud surges lash the sounding shore   the hoarse rough verse shoud like the torrent roar   when ajax strives some rocks vast weight to throw   the line too labours and the words move slow   not so when swift camilla scours the plain   flies oer th unbending corn and skims along the main  the beautiful distich upon ajax in the foregoing lines puts me in mind of a description in homers odyssey which none of the criticks have taken notice of   it is where sisyphus is represented lifting his stone up the hill which is no sooner carried to the top of it but it immediately tumbles to the bottom this double motion of the stone is admirably described in the numbers of these verses as in the four first it is heaved up by several spondees intermixed with proper breathing places and at last trundles down in a continual line of dactyls    greek kaì màen sisyphon

occasion in a future paper to shew several of them which have escaped the observation of others  i cannot conclude this paper without taking notice that we have three poems in our tongue which are of the same nature and each of them a masterpiece in its kind the essay on translated verse   the essay on the art of poetry   and the essay upon criticism    footnote   single product   footnote   at the time when this paper was written pope was in his twentyfourth year he wrote to express his gratitude to addison and also to steele in his letter to addison he said    though it be the highest satisfaction to find myself commended by a   writer whom all the world commends yet i am not more obliged to you   for that than for your candour and frankness in acquainting me with   the error i have been guilty of in speaking too freely of my brother   moderns  the only moderns of whom he spoke slightingly were men of whom aftertime has ratified his opinion john dennis sir richard blackmore and luke milbourne when not long afterwards dennis attacked with his criticism addisons cato to which pope had contributed the prologue pope made this the occasion of a bitter satire on dennis called the narrative of dr robert norris a wellknown quack who professed the cure of lunatics upon the frenzy j d addison then through steele wrote to popes publisher of this manner of treating mr dennis that he could not be privy to it and was sorry to hear of it in      when pope issued to subscribers the first volume of homer tickells translation of the first book of the iliad appeared in the same week and had particular praise at buttons from addison tickells friend and patron pope was now indignant and expressed his irritation in the famous satire first printed in      and finally with the name of addison transformed to atticus embodied in the epistle to arbuthnot published in      here while seeing in addison a man    blest with each talent and each art to please   and born to live converse and write with ease  he said that should he jealous of his own supremacy damn with faint praise as one    willing to wound and yet afraid to strike   just hint the fault and hesitate dislike   who when two wits on rival themes contest   approves of both but likes the worse the best   like cato give his little senate laws   and sits attentive to his own applause   while wits and templars every sentence raise   and wonder with a foolish face of praise   who would not laugh if such a man there be   who would not weep if addison were he  but in this spectator paper young popes essay on criticism certainly was not damned with faint praise by the man most able to give it a firm standing in the world   footnote   odyssey bk xi in ticknells edition of addisons works the latter part of this sentence is omitted the same observation having been made by dionysius of halicarnassus   footnote   wentworth dillon earl of roscommon author of the essay on translated verse was nephew and godson to wentworth earl of strafford he was born in ireland in      educated at the protestant university of caen and was there when his father died he travelled in italy came to england at the restoration held one or two court offices gambled took a wife and endeavoured to introduce into england the principals of criticism with which he had found the polite world occupied in france he planned a society for refining our language and fixing its standard during the troubles of king jamess reign he was about to leave the kingdom when his departure was delayed by gout of which he died in      a foremost english representative of the chief literary movement of his time he translated into blank verse horaces art of poetry and besides a few minor translations and some short pieces of original verse which earned from pope the credit that    in all charless days   roscommon only boasts unspotted lays  he wrote in heroic couplets an essay on translated verse that was admired by dryden addison and pope and was in highest honour wherever the french influence upon our literature made itself felt roscommon believed in the superior energy of english wit and wrote himself with care and frequent vigour in the turning of his couplets it is from this poem that we get the often quoted lines    immodest words admit of no defence   for want of decency is want of sense   footnote   the other piece with which addison ranks popes essay on criticism was by john sheffield duke of buckingham who was living when the spectator first appeared he died aged    in the year      john sheffield by the death of his father succeeded at the age of nine to the title of earl of mulgrave in the reign of charles ii he served by sea and land and was as well as marlborough in the french service in the reign of james ii he was admitted into the privy council made lord chamberlain and though still protestant attended the king to mass he acquiesced in the revolution but remained out of office and disliked king william who in      made him marquis of normanby afterwards he was received into the cabinet council with a pension of £ 000 queen anne to whom walpole says he had made love before her marriage highly favoured him before her coronation she made him lord privy seal next year he was made first duke of normanby and then of buckinghamshire to exclude any latent claimant to the title which had been extinct since the miserable death of george villiers duke of buckingham the author of the rehearsal when the spectator appeared john sheffield had just built buckingham housenow a royal palaceon ground granted by the crown and taken office as lord chamberlain he wrote more verse than roscommon and poorer verse the essay on poetry in which he followed the critical fashion of the day he was praised into regarding as a masterpiece he was continually polishing it and during his lifetime it was reissued with frequent variations it is polished quartz not diamond a short piece of about   0 lines which has something to say of each of the chief forms of poetry from songs to epics sheffield shows most natural force in writing upon plays and here in objecting to perfect characters he struck out the oftenquoted line    a faultless monster which the world neer saw  when he comes to the epics he is of course all for homer and virgil    read homer once and you can read no more   for all books else appear so mean so poor   verse will seem prose but still persist to read   and homer will be all the books you need  and then it is supposed that some angel had disclosed to m bossu the french author of the treatise upon epic poetry then fashionable the sacred mysteries of homer john sheffield had a patronizing recognition for the genius of shakespeare and milton and was so obliging as to revise shakespeares julius cæsar and confine the action of that play within the limits prescribed in the french gospel according to the unities pope however had in the essay on criticism reckoned sheffield duke of buckingham among the sounder few    who durst assert the juster ancient cause   and have restored wits fundamental laws   such was the muse whose rules and practice tell   natures chief masterpiece is writing well  with those last words which form the second line in the essay on poetry popes citation has made many familiar addison paid young pope a valid compliment in naming him as a critic in verse with roscommon and what then passed on all hands for a valid compliment in holding him worthy also to be named as a poet in the same breath with the

character     my dear harriot    if thou art she but oh how fallen how changed what an apostate how   lost to all thats gay and agreeable to be married i find is to be   buried alive i cant conceive it more dismal to be shut up in a vault   to converse with the shades of my ancestors than to be carried down   to an old manorhouse in the country and confined to the conversation   of a sober husband and an awkward chambermaid for variety i suppose   you may entertain yourself with madam in her grogram gown the spouse   of your parish vicar who has by this time i am sure well furnished   you with receipts for making salves and possets distilling cordial   waters making syrups and applying poultices    blest solitude i wish thee joy my dear of thy loved retirement   which indeed you would perswade me is very agreeable and different   enough from what i have here described but child i am afraid thy   brains are a little disordered with romances and novels after six   months marriage to hear thee talk of love and paint the country   scenes so softly is a little extravagant one would think you lived   the lives of sylvan deities or roved among the walks of paradise   like the first happy pair but prythee leave these whimsies and come   to town in order to live and talk like other mortals however as i am   extremely interested in your reputation i would willingly give you a   little good advice at your first appearance under the character of a   married woman tis a little insolence in me perhaps to advise a   matron but i am so afraid youll make so silly a figure as a fond   wife that i cannot help warning you not to appear in any publick   places with your husband and never to saunter about st jamess   park together if you presume to enter the ring at hidepark   together you are ruined for ever nor must you take the least notice   of one another at the playhouse or opera unless you would be laughed   at for a very loving couple most happily paired in the yoke of   wedlock i would recommend the example of an acquaintance of ours to   your imitation she is the most negligent and fashionable wife in the   world she is hardly ever seen in the same place with her husband and   if they happen to meet you would think them perfect strangers she   never was heard to name him in his absence and takes care he shall   never be the subject of any discourse that she has a share in i hope   you propose this lady as a pattern tho i am very much afraid   youll be so silly to think portia c sabine and roman wives   much brighter examples i wish it may never come into your head to   imitate those antiquated creatures so far as to come into publick in   the habit as well as air of a roman matron you make already the   entertainment at mrs modishs teatable she says she always   thought you a discreet person and qualified to manage a family with   admirable prudence she dies to see what demure and serious airs   wedlock has given you but she says she shall never forgive your   choice of so gallant a man as bellamour to transform him to a meer   sober husband twas unpardonable you see my dear we all envy your   happiness and no person more than your humble servant lydia      be not in pain good madam for my appearance in town i shall   frequent no publick places or make any visits where the character of   a modest wife is ridiculous as for your wild raillery on matrimony   tis all hypocrisy you and all the handsome young women of our   acquaintance shew yourselves to no other purpose than to gain a   conquest over some man of worth in order to bestow your charms and   fortune on him theres no indecency in the confession the design is   modest and honourable and all your affectation cant disguise it    i am married and have no other concern but to please the man i love   hes the end of every care i have if i dress tis for him if i read   a poem or a play tis to qualify myself for a conversation agreeable   to his taste hes almost the end of my devotions half my prayers are   for his happiness i love to talk of him and never hear him named but   with pleasure and emotion i am your friend and wish your happiness   but am sorry to see by the air of your letter that there are a set of   women who are got into the commonplace raillery of every thing that   is sober decent and proper matrimony and the clergy are the topicks   of people of little wit and no understanding i own to you i have   learned of the vicars wife all you tax me with she is a discreet   ingenious pleasant pious woman i wish she had the handling of you   and mrs modish you would find if you were too free with her she   would soon make you as charming as ever you were she would make you   blush as much as if you had never been fine

only with his own thoughts these   things dear madam will be lasting satisfactions when the fine   ladies and the coxcombs by whom they form themselves are irreparably   ridiculous ridiculous in old age i am madam your most humble   servant mary home      dear mr spectator   you have no goodness in the world and are not in earnest in any thing   you say that is serious if you do not send me a plain answer to this   i happened some days past to be at the play where during the time of   performance i could not keep my eyes off from a beautiful young   creature who sat just before me and who i have been since informed   has no fortune it would utterly ruin my reputation for discretion to   marry such a one and by what i can learn she has a character of great   modesty so that there is nothing to be thought on any other way my   mind has ever since been so wholly bent on her that i am much in   danger of doing something very extravagant without your speedy advice   to    sir your most humble servant   i am sorry i cannot answer this impatient gentleman but by another question     dear correspondent would you marry to please other people or your   self  t

considered abstractedly from its passions is of a remiss and sedentary nature slow in its resolves and languishing in its executions the use therefore of the passions is to stir it up and to put it upon action to awaken the understanding to enforce the will and to make the whole man more vigorous and attentive in the prosecutions of his designs as this is the end of the passions in general so it is particularly of ambition which pushes the soul to such actions as are apt to procure honour and reputation to the actor but if we carry our reflections higher we may discover further ends of providence in implanting this passion in mankind  it was necessary for the world that arts should be invented and improved books written and transmitted to posterity nations conquered and civilized now since the proper and genuine motives to these and the like great actions would only influence virtuous minds there would be but small improvements in the world were there not some common principle of action working equally with all men and such a principle is ambition or a desire of fame by which great   endowments are not suffered to lie idle and useless to the publick and many vicious men overreached as it were and engaged contrary to their natural inclinations in a glorious and laudable course of action for we may further observe that men of the greatest abilities are most fired with ambition and that on the contrary mean and narrow minds are the least actuated by it whether it be that a mans sense of his own   incapacities makes him   despair of coming at fame or that he has   not enough range of thought to look out for any good which does not more immediately relate to his   interest or convenience or that providence in the very frame of his soul   would not subject him   to such a passion as would be useless to the world and a torment to himself    were not this desire of fame very strong the difficulty of obtaining it and the danger of losing it when obtained would be sufficient to deter a man from so vain a pursuit  how few are there who are furnished with abilities sufficient to recommend their actions to the admiration of the world and to distinguish themselves from the rest of mankind providence for the most part sets us upon a level and observes a kind of proportion in its dispensation towards us if it renders us perfect in one accomplishment it generally leaves us defective in another and seems careful rather of preserving every person from being mean and deficient in his qualifications than of making any single one eminent or extraordinary  and among those who are the most richly endowed by nature and accomplished by their own industry how few are there whose virtues are not obscured by the ignorance prejudice or envy of their beholders some men cannot discern between a noble and a mean action others are apt to attribute them to some false end or intention and others purposely misrepresent or put a wrong interpretation on them but the more to enforce this consideration we may observe that those are generally most unsuccessful in their pursuit after fame who are most desirous of obtaining it it is sallusts remark upon cato that the less he coveted glory the more he acquired it    men take an illnaturd pleasure in crossing our inclinations and disappointing us in what our hearts are most set upon when therefore they have discovered the passionate desire of fame in the ambitious man as no temper of mind is more apt to show it self they become sparing and reserved in their commendations they envy him the satisfaction of an applause and look on their praises rather as a kindness done to his person than as a tribute paid to his merit others who are free from this natural perverseness of temper grow wary in their praises of one who sets too great a value on them lest they should raise him too high in his own imagination and by consequence remove him to a greater distance from themselves  but further this desire of fame naturally betrays the ambitious man into such indecencies as are a lessening to his reputation he is still afraid lest any of his actions should be thrown away in private lest his deserts should be concealed from the notice of the world or receive any disadvantage from the reports which others make of them this often sets him on empty boasts and ostentations of himself and betrays him into vain fantastick recitals of his own performances his discourse generally leans one way and whatever is the subject of it tends obliquely either to the detracting from others or to the extolling of himself vanity is the natural weakness of an ambitious man which exposes him to the secret scorn and derision of those he converses with and ruins the character he is so industrious to advance by it for tho his actions are never so glorious they lose their lustre when they are drawn at large and set to show by his own hand and as the world is more apt to find fault than to commend the boast will probably be censured when the great action that occasioned it is forgotten  besides this very desire of fame is looked on as a meanness and  0 imperfection in the greatest character a solid and substantial greatness of soul looks down with a generous neglect on the censures and applauses of the multitude and places a man beyond the little noise and strife of tongues accordingly we find in our selves a secret awe and veneration for the character of one who moves above us in a regular and illustrious course of virtue without any regard to our good or ill opinions of him to our reproaches or commendations as on the contrary it is usual for us when we would take off from the fame and reputation of an action to ascribe it to vainglory and a desire of fame in the actor nor is this common judgment and opinion of mankind illfounded for certainly it denotes no great bravery of mind to be worked up to any noble action by so selfish a motive and to do that out of a desire of fame which we could not be prompted to by a disinterested love to mankind or by a generous passion for the glory of him that made us  thus is fame a thing difficult to be obtained by all but particularly by those who thirst after it since most men have so much either of illnature or of wariness as not to gratify or    sooth the vanity of the ambitious man and since this very thirst after fame naturally betrays him into such indecencies as are a lessening to his reputation and is it self looked upon as a weakness in the greatest characters  in the next place fame is easily lost and as difficult to be preserved as it was at first to be acquired but this i shall make the subject of a following paper  c    footnote   all great   footnote   the sense of their own   footnote   them

are many passions and tempers of mind which naturally dispose us to depress and vilify the merit of one rising in the esteem of mankind all those who made their entrance into the world with the same advantages and were once looked on as his equals are apt to think the fame of his merits a reflection on their own indeserts and will therefore take care to reproach him with the scandal of some past action or derogate from the worth of the present that they may still keep him on the same level with themselves the like kind of consideration often stirs up the envy of such as were once his superiors who think it a detraction from their merit to see another get ground upon them and overtake them in the pursuits of glory and will therefore endeavour to sink his reputation that they may the better preserve their own those who were once his equals envy and defame him because they now see him their superior and those who were once his superiors because they look upon him as their equal  but further a man whose extraordinary reputation thus lifts him up to the notice and observation of mankind draws a multitude of eyes upon him that will narrowly inspect every part of him consider him nicely in all views and not be a little pleased when they have taken him in the worst and most disadvantageous light there are many who find a pleasure in contradicting the common reports of fame and in spreading abroad the weaknesses of an exalted character they publish their illnaturd discoveries with a secret pride and applaud themselves for the singularity of their judgment which has searched deeper than others detected what the rest of the world have overlooked and found a flaw in what the generality of mankind admires others there are who proclaim the errors and infirmities of a great man with an inward satisfaction and complacency if they discover none of the like errors and infirmities in themselves for while they are exposing anothers weaknesses they are tacitly aiming at their own commendations who are not subject to the like infirmities and are apt to be transported with a secret kind of vanity to see themselves superior in some respects to one of a sublime and celebrated reputation nay it very often happens that none are more industrious in publishing the blemishes of an extraordinary reputation than such as lie open to the same censures in their own characters as either hoping to excuse their own defects by the authority of so high an example or raising an imaginary applause to themselves for resembling a person of an exalted reputation though in the blameable parts of his character if all these secret springs of detraction fail yet very often a vain ostentation of wit sets a man on attacking an established name and sacrificing it to the mirth and laughter of those about him a satyr or a libel on one of the common stamp never meets with that reception and approbation among its readers as what is aimed at a person whose merit places him upon an eminence and gives him a more conspicuous figure among men whether it be that we think it shews greater art to expose and turn to ridicule a man whose character seems so improper a subject for it or that we are pleased by some implicit kind of revenge to see him taken down and humbled in his reputation and in some measure reduced to our own rank who had so far raised himself above us in the reports and opinions of mankind  thus we see how many dark and intricate motives there are to detraction and defamation and how many malicious spies are searching into the actions of a great man who is not always the best prepared for so narrow an inspection for we may generally observe that our admiration of a famous man lessens upon our nearer acquaintance with him and that we seldom hear the description of a celebrated person without a catalogue of some notorious weaknesses and infirmities the reason may be because any little slip is more conspicuous and observable in his conduct than in anothers as it is not of a piece with the rest of his character or because it is impossible for a man at the same time to be attentive to the more important part   of his life and to keep a watchful eye over all the inconsiderable circumstances of his behaviour and conversation or because as we have before observed the same temper of mind which inclines us to a desire of fame naturally betrays us into such slips and unwarinesses as are not incident to men of a contrary disposition  after all it must be confessd that a noble and triumphant merit often breaks through and dissipates these little spots and sullies in its reputation but if by a mistaken pursuit after fame or through human infirmity any false step be made in the more momentous concerns of life the whole scheme of ambitious designs is broken and disappointed the smaller stains and blemishes may die away and disappear amidst the brightness that surrounds them but a blot of a deeper nature casts a shade on all the other beauties and darkens the whole character how difficult therefore is it to preserve a great name when he that has acquired it is so obnoxious to such little weaknesses and infirmities as are no small diminution to it when discovered especially when they are so industriously proclaimed and aggravated by such as were once his superiors or equals by such as would set to show their judgment or their wit and by such as are guilty or innocent of the same slips or misconducts in their own behaviour  but were there none of these dispositions in others to censure a famous man nor any such miscarriages in himself yet would he meet with no small trouble in keeping up his reputation in all its height and splendour there must be always a noble train of actions to preserve his fame in life and motion for when it is once at a stand it naturally flags and languishes admiration is a very shortlivd passion that immediately decays upon growing familiar with its object unless it be still fed with fresh discoveries and kept alive by a new perpetual succession of miracles rising up to its view and even the greatest actions of a celebrated person   labour under this disadvantage that however surprising and extraordinary they may be they are no more than what are expected from him but on the contrary if they fall any thing below the opinion that is conceived of him tho they might raise the reputation of another they are a diminution to his  one would think there should be something wonderfully pleasing in the possession of fame that notwithstanding all these mortifying considerations can engage a man in so desperate a pursuit and yet if we consider the little happiness that attends a great character and the multitude of disquietudes to which the desire of it subjects an ambitious mind one would be still the more surprised to see so many restless candidates for glory  ambition raises a secret tumult in the soul it inflames the mind and puts it into a violent hurry of thought it is still reaching after an empty imaginary good that has not in it the power to abate or satisfy it most other things we long for can allay the cravings of their proper sense and for a while set the appetite at rest but fame is a good so wholly foreign to our natures that we have no faculty in the soul adapted to it nor any organ in the body to relish it an object of desire placed out of the possibility of fruition it may indeed fill the mind for a while with a giddy kind of pleasure but it is such a pleasure as makes a man restless and uneasy under it and which does not so much satisfy the present thirst as it excites fresh desires and sets the soul on new enterprises for how few ambitious men are there who have got as much fame as they desired and whose thirst after it has not been as eager in the very height of their reputation as it was before they became known and eminent among men there is not any circumstance in cæsars character which gives me a greater idea of him than a saying which cicero tells us    he frequently made use of in private conversation that he was satisfied with his share of life and fame se satis vel ad naturam vel ad gloriam vixisse many indeed have given over their pursuits after fame but that has proceeded either from the disappointments they have met in it or from their experience of the little pleasure which attends it or from the better informations or natural coldness of old age but seldom from a full satisfaction and acquiescence in their present enjoyments of it  nor is fame only unsatisfying in it self but the desire of it lays us open to many accidental troubles which those are free from who have no such a tender regard for it how often is the ambitious man cast down and disappointed if he receives no praise where he expected it nay how often is he mortified with the very praises he receives if they do not rise so high as he thinks they ought which they seldom do unless increased by flattery since few men have so good an opinion of us as we have of our selves but if the ambitious man can be so much grieved even with praise it self how will he be able to bear up under scandal and defamation for the same temper of mind which makes him desire fame makes him hate reproach if he can be transported with the extraordinary praises of men he will be as much dejected by their censures how little therefore is the happiness of an ambitious man who gives every one a dominion over it who thus subjects himself to the good or ill speeches of others and puts it in the power of every malicious tongue to throw him into a fit of melancholy and destroy his natural rest and repose of mind especially when we consider that the world is more apt to censure than applaud and himself fuller of imperfections than virtues  we may further observe that such a man will be more grieved for the loss of fame than he could have been pleased with the enjoyment of it for tho the presence of this imaginary good cannot make us happy the absence of it may make us miserable because in the enjoyment of an object we only find that share of pleasure which it is capable of giving us but in the loss of it we do not proportion our grief to the real value it bears but to the value our fancies and imaginations set upon it  so inconsiderable is the satisfaction that fame brings along with it and so great the disquietudes to which it makes us liable the desire of it stirs up very uneasy motions in the mind and is rather inflamed than satisfied by the presence of the thing desired the enjoyment of it brings but very little pleasure tho the loss or want of it be very sensible and afflicting and even this little happiness is so very precarious that it wholly depends on the will of others we are not only tortured by the reproaches which are offered us but are disappointed by the silence of men when it is unexpected and humbled even by their praises    c    footnote   parts   footnote   name   footnote   oratio pro m marcello

first of all considered the reasons why providence may have implanted in our mind such a principle of action i have in the next place shewn from many considerations first that fame is a thing difficult to be obtained and easily lost secondly that it brings the ambitious man very little happiness but subjects him to much uneasiness and dissatisfaction i shall in the last place shew that it hinders us from obtaining an end which we have abilities to acquire and which is accompanied with fulness of satisfaction i need not tell my reader that i mean by this end that happiness which is reserved for us in another world which every one has abilities to procure and which will bring along with it fulness of joy and pleasures for evermore  how the pursuit after fame may hinder us in the attainment of this great end i shall leave the reader to collect from the three following considerations  first because the strong desire of fame breeds several vicious habits in the mind  secondly because many of those actions which are apt to procure fame are not in their nature conducive to this our ultimate happiness  thirdly because if we should allow the same actions to be the proper instruments both of acquiring fame and of procuring this happiness they would nevertheless fail in the attainment of this last end if they proceeded from a desire of the first  these three propositions are selfevident to those who are versed in speculations of morality for which reason i shall not enlarge upon them but proceed to a point of the same nature which may open to us a more uncommon field of speculation  from what has been already observed i think we may make a natural conclusion that it is the greatest folly to seek the praise or approbation of any being besides the supreme and that for these two reasons because no other being can make a right judgment of us and esteem us according to our merits and because we can procure no considerable benefit or advantage from the esteem and approbation of any other being  in the first place no other being can make a right judgment of us and esteem us according to our merits created beings see nothing but our outside and can therefore only frame a judgment of us from our exterior actions and behaviour but how unfit these are to give us a right notion of each others perfections may appear from several considerations there are many virtues which in their own nature are incapable of any outward representation many silent perfections in the soul of a good man which are great ornaments to human nature but not able to discover themselves to the knowledge of others they are transacted in private without noise or show and are only visible to the great searcher of hearts what actions can express the entire purity of thought which refines and sanctifies a virtuous man that secret rest and contentedness of mind which gives him a perfect enjoyment of his present condition that inward pleasure and complacency which he feels in doing good that delight and satisfaction which he takes in the prosperity and happiness of another these and the like virtues are the hidden beauties of a soul the secret graces which cannot be discovered by a mortal eye but make the soul lovely and precious in his sight from whom no secrets are concealed again there are many virtues which want an opportunity of exerting and shewing themselves in actions every virtue requires time and place a proper object and a fit conjuncture of circumstances for the due exercise of it a state of poverty obscures all the virtues of liberality and munificence the patience and fortitude of a martyr or confessor lie concealed in the flourishing times of christianity some virtues are only seen in affliction and some in prosperity some in a private and others in a publick capacity but the great sovereign of the world beholds every perfection in its obscurity and not only sees what we do but what we would do he views our behaviour in every concurrence of affairs and sees us engaged in all the possibilities of action he discovers the martyr and confessor without the tryal of flames and tortures and will hereafter entitle many to the reward of actions which they had never the opportunity of performing another reason why men cannot form a right judgment of us is because the same actions may be aimed at different ends and arise from quite contrary principles actions are of so mixt a nature and so full of circumstances that as men pry into them more or less or observe some parts more than others they take different hints and put contrary interpretations on them so that the same actions may represent a man as hypocritical and designing to one which make him appear a saint or hero to another he therefore who looks upon the soul through its outward actions often sees it through a deceitful medium which is apt to discolour and pervert the object so that on this account also he is the only proper judge of our perfections who does not guess at the sincerity of our intentions from the goodness of our actions but weighs the goodness of our actions by the sincerity of our intentions  but further it is impossible for outward actions to represent the perfections of the soul because they can never shew the strength of those principles from whence they proceed they are not adequate expressions of our virtues and can only shew us what habits are in the soul without discovering the degree and perfection of such habits they are at best but weak resemblances of our intentions faint and imperfect copies that may acquaint us with the general design but can never express the beauty and life of the original but the great judge of all the earth knows every different state and degree of human improvement from those weak stirrings and tendencies of the will which have not yet formed themselves into regular purposes and designs to the last entire finishing and consummation of a good habit he beholds the first imperfect rudiments of a virtue in the soul and keeps a watchful eye over it in all its progress till it has received every grace it is capable of and appears in its full beauty and perfection thus we see that none but the supreme being can esteem us according to our proper merits since all others must judge of us from our outward actions which can never give them a just estimate of us since there are many perfections of a man which are not capable of appearing in actions many which allowing no natural incapacity of shewing themselves want an opportunity of doing it or should they all meet with an opportunity of appearing by actions yet those actions maybe misinterpreted and applied to wrong principles or though they plainly discovered the principles from whence they proceeded they could never shew the degree strength and perfection of those principles  and as the supreme being is the only proper judge of our perfections so is he the only fit rewarder of them this is a consideration that comes home to our interest as the other adapts it self to our ambition and what could the most aspiring or the most selfish man desire more were he to form the notion of a being to whom he would recommend himself than such a knowledge as can discover the least appearance of perfection in him and such a goodness as will proportion a reward to it  let the ambitious man therefore turn all his desire of fame this way and that he may propose to himself a fame worthy of his ambition let him consider that if he employs his abilities to the best advantage the time will come when the supreme governor of the world the great judge of mankind who sees every degree of perfection in others and possesses all possible perfection in himself shall proclaim his worth before men and angels and pronounce to him in the presence of the whole creation that best and most significant of applauses well done thou good and faithful servant enter thou into thy masters joy  c

are tolerated it behoves persons of distinction with their power and example to preside over them in such a manner as to check any thing that tends to the corruption of manners or which is too mean or trivial for the entertainment of reasonable creatures as to the diversions of this kind in this town we owe them to the arts of poetry and musick my own private opinion with relation to such recreations i have heretofore given with all the frankness imaginable what concerns those arts at present the reader shall have from my correspondents the first of the letters with which i acquit myself for this day is written by one who proposes to improve our entertainments of dramatick poetry and the other comes from three persons who as soon as named will be thought capable of advancing the present state of musick     mr spectator    i am considerably obliged to you for your speedy publication of my   last in yours of the   th instant and am in no small hopes of being   settled in the post of comptroller of the cries of all the   objections i have hearkened after in publick coffeehouses there is   but one that seems to carry any weight with it viz that such a   post would come too near the nature of a monopoly now sir because i   would have all sorts of people made easy and being willing to have   more strings than one to my bow in case that of comptroller should   fail me i have since formed another project which being grounded on   the dividing a present monopoly i hope will give the publick an   equivalent to their full content you know sir it is allowed that   the business of the stage is as the latin has it jucunda et   idonea dicere vitæ now there being but one dramatick theatre   licensed for the delight and profit of this extensive metropolis i do   humbly propose for the convenience of such of its inhabitants as are   too distant from coventgarden that another theatre of ease may   be erected in some spacious part of the city and that the direction   thereof may be made a franchise in fee to me and my heirs for ever   and that the town may have no jealousy of my ever coming to an union   with the set of actors now in being i do further propose to   constitute for my deputy my near kinsman and adventurer kit   crotchet   whose long experience and improvements in those affairs   need no recommendation twas obvious to every spectator what a quite   different foot the stage was upon during his government and had he   not been bolted out of his trapdoors his garrison might have held   out for ever he having by long pains and perseverance arrivd at the   art of making his army fight without pay or provisions i must confess   it with a melancholy amazement i see so wonderful a genius laid   aside and the late slaves of the stage now become its masters dunces   that will be sure to suppress all theatrical entertainments and   activities that they are not able themselves to shine in    every man that goes to a play is not obliged to have either wit or   understanding and i insist upon it that all who go there should see   something which may improve them in a way of which they are capable   in short sir i would have something done as well as said on the   stage a man may have an active body though he has not a quick   conception for the imitation therefore of such as are as i may so   speak corporeal wits or nimble fellows i would fain ask any of the   present mismanagers why should not ropedancers vaulters tumblers   ladderwalkers and posturemakers appear again on our stage after   such a representation a fivebar gate would be leaped with a better   grace next time any of the audience went a hunting sir these things   cry loud for reformation and fall properly under the province of   spectator general but how indeed should it be otherwise while   fellows that for twenty years together were never paid but as their   master was in the humour now presume to pay others more than ever   they had in their lives and in contempt of the practice of persons of   condition have the insolence to owe no tradesman a farthing at the   end of the week sir all i propose is the publick good for no one   can imagine i shall ever get a private shilling by it therefore i   hope you will recommend this matter in one of your this weeks papers   and desire when my house opens you will accept the liberty of it for   the trouble you have receivd from   sir   your humble servant   ralph crotchet    ps i have assurances that the trunkmaker will declare for us      mr spectator    we whose names are subscribed   think you the properest person to   signify what we have to offer the town in behalf of our selves and   the art which we profess musick we conceive hopes of your favour   from the speculations on the mistakes which the town run into with   regard to their pleasure of this kind and believing your method of   judging is that you consider musick only valuable as it is agreeable   to and heightens the purpose of poetry we consent that that is not   only the true way of relishing that pleasure but also that without   it a composure of musick is the same thing as a poem where all the   rules of poetical numbers are observed tho the words have no sense   or meaning to say it shorter meer musical sounds are in our art no   other than nonsense verses are in poetry musick therefore is to   aggravate what is intended by poetry it must always have some passion   or sentiment to express or else violins voices or any other organs   of sound afford an entertainment very little above the rattles of   children it was from this opinion of the matter that when mr   clayton had finished his studies in italy and brought over the   opera of arsinoe that mr haym and mr dieupart who had the   honour to be well known and received among the nobility and gentry   were zealously inclined to assist by their solicitations in   introducing so elegant an entertainment as the italian musick   grafted upon english poetry for this end mr dieupart and mr   haym according to their several opportunities promoted the   introduction of arsinoe and did it to the best advantage so great a   novelty would allow it is not proper to trouble you with particulars   of the just complaints we all of us have to make but so it is that   without regard to our obliging pains we are all equally set aside in   the present opera our application therefore to you is only to insert   this letter in your papers that the town may know we have all three   joined together to make entertainments of musick for the future at mr   claytons house in yorkbuildings what we promise ourselves is   to make a subscription of two guineas for eight times and that the   entertainment with the names of the authors of the poetry may be   printed to be sold in the house with an account of the several   authors of the vocal as well as the instrumental musick for each   night the money to be paid at the receipt of the tickets at mr   charles lillies it will we hope sir be easily allowed that we   are capable of undertaking to exhibit by our joint force and different   qualifications all that can be done in musick but lest you should   think so dry a thing as an account of our proposal should be a matter   unworthy your paper which generally contains something of publick   use give us leave to say that favouring our design is no less than   reviving an art which runs to ruin by the utmost barbarism under an   affectation of knowledge we aim at establishing some settled notion   of what is musick as recovering from neglect and want very many   families who depend upon it at making all foreigners who pretend to   succeed in england to learn the language of it as we our selves have   done and not be so insolent as to expect a whole nation a refined   and learned nation should submit to learn them in a word mr   spectator with all deference and humility we hope to behave   ourselves in this undertaking in such a manner that all english men   who have any skill in musick may be furthered in it for their profit   or diversion by what new things we shall produce never pretending to   surpass others or asserting that any thing which is a science is not   attainable by all men of all nations who have proper genius for it we   say sir what we hope for is not expected will arrive to us by   contemning others but through the utmost diligence recommending   ourselves   we are sir   your most humble servants   thomas clayton   nicolino haym   charles dieupart    footnote

think could not need them of this kind are outward civilities and salutations these one would imagine might be regulated by every mans common sense without the help of an instructor but that which we call common sense suffers under that word for it sometimes implies no more than that faculty which is common to all men but sometimes signifies right reason and what all men should consent to in this latter acceptation of the phrase it is no great wonder people err so much against it since it is not every one who is possessed of it and there are fewer who against common rules and fashions dare obey its dictates as to salutations which i was about to talk of i observe as i strole about town there are great enormities committed with regard to this particular you shall sometimes see a man begin the offer of a salutation and observe a forbidding air or escaping eye in the person he is going to salute and stop short in the pole of his neck this in the person who believed he could do it with a good grace and was refused the opportunity is justly resented with a coldness the whole ensuing season your great beauties people in much favour or by any means or for any purpose overflattered are apt to practise this which one may call the preventing aspect and throw their attention another way lest they should confer a bow or a curtsie upon a person who might not appear to deserve that dignity others you shall find so obsequious and so very courteous as there is no escaping their favours of this kind of this sort may be a man who is in the fifth or sixth degree of favour with a minister this good creature is resolved to shew the world that great honours cannot at all change his manners he is the same civil person he ever was he will venture his neck to bow out of a coach in full speed at once to shew he is full of business and yet is not so taken up as to forget his old friend with a man who is not so well formed for courtship and elegant behaviour such a gentleman as this seldom finds his account in the return of his compliments but he will still go on for he is in his own way and must not omit let the neglect fall on your side or where it will his business is still to be wellbred to the end i think i have read in one of our english comedies a description of a fellow that affected knowing every body and for want of judgment in time and place would bow and smile in the face of a judge sitting in the court would sit in an opposite gallery and smile in the ministers face as he came up into the pulpit and nod as if he alluded to some familiarities between them in another place but now i happen to speak of salutation at church i must take notice that several of my correspondents have importuned me to consider that subject and settle the point of decorum in that particular  i do not pretend to be the best courtier in the world but i have often on publick occasions thought it a very great absurdity in the company during the royal presence to exchange salutations from all parts of the room when certainly common sense should suggest that all regards at that time should be engaged and cannot be diverted to any other object without disrespect to the sovereign but as to the complaint of my correspondents it is not to be imagined what offence some of them take at the custom of saluting in places of worship i have a very angry letter from a lady who tells me of one of her acquaintance who out of meer pride and a pretence to be rude takes upon her to return no civilities done to her in time of divine service and is the most religious woman for no other reason but to appear a woman of the best quality in the church this absurd custom had better be abolished than retained if it were but to prevent evils of no higher a nature than this is but i am informed of objections much more considerable a dissenter of rank and distinction was lately prevailed upon by a friend of his to come to one of the greatest congregations of the church of england about town after the service was over he declared he was very well satisfied with the little ceremony which was used towards god almighty but at the same time he feared he should not be able to go through those required towards one another as to this point he was in a state of despair and feared he was not wellbred enough to be a convert there have been many scandals of this kind given to our protestant dissenters from the outward pomp and respect we take to our selves in our religious assemblies a quaker who came one day into a church fixed his eyes upon an old lady with a carpet larger than that from the pulpit before her expecting when she would hold forth an anabaptist who designs to come over himself and all his family within few months is sensible they want breeding enough for our congregations and has sent his two eldest   daughters to learn to dance that they may not misbehave themselves at church it is worth considering whether in regard to awkward people with scrupulous consciences a good christian of the best air in the world ought not rather to deny herself the opportunity of shewing so many graces than keep a bashful proselyte without the pale of the church

increased upon me with the loss of power to gratify them i write   this like a criminal to warn people to enter upon what reformation   they may please to make in themselves in their youth and not expect   they shall be capable of it from a fond opinion some have often in   their mouths that if we do not leave our desires they will leave us   it is far otherwise i am now as vain in my dress and as flippant if   i see a pretty woman as when in my youth i stood upon a bench in the   pit to survey the whole circle of beauties the folly is so   extravagant with me and i went on with so little check of my desires   or resignation of them that i can assure you i very often meerly to   entertain my own thoughts sit with my spectacles on writing   loveletters to the beauties that have been long since in their   graves this is to warm my heart with the faint memory of delights   which were once agreeable to me but how much happier would my life   have been now if i could have looked back on any worthy action done   for my country if i had laid out that which i profused in luxury and   wantonness in acts of generosity or charity i have lived a batchelor   to this day and instead of a numerous offspring with which in the   regular ways of life i might possibly have delighted my self i have   only to amuse my self with the repetition of old stories and intrigues   which no one will believe i ever was concerned in i do not know   whether you have ever treated of it or not but you cannot fall on a   better subject than that of the art of growing old in such a lecture   you must propose that no one set his heart upon what is transient   the beauty grows wrinkled while we are yet gazing at her the witty   man sinks into a humourist imperceptibly for want of reflecting that   all things around him are in a flux and continually changing thus he   is in the space of ten or fifteen years surrounded by a new set of   people whose manners are as natural to them as his delights method of   thinking and mode of living were formerly to him and his friends   but the mischief is he looks upon the same kind of errors which he   himself was guilty of with an eye of scorn and with that sort of   illwill which men entertain against each other for different   opinions thus a crasie constitution and an uneasie mind is fretted   with vexatious passions for young mens doing foolishly what it is   folly to do at all dear sir this is my present state of mind i hate   those i should laugh at and envy those i contemn the time of youth   and vigorous manhood passed the way in which i have disposed of it is   attended with these consequences but to those who live and pass away   life as they ought all parts of it are equally pleasant only the   memory of good and worthy actions is a feast which must give a quicker   relish to the soul than ever it could possibly taste in the highest   enjoyments or jollities of youth as for me if i sit down in my great   chair and begin to ponder the vagaries of a child are not more   ridiculous than the circumstances which are heaped up in my memory   fine gowns country dances ends of tunes interrupted conversations   and midnight quarrels are what must necessarily compose my soliloquy   i beg of you to print this that some ladies of my acquaintance and   my years may be perswaded to wear warm nightcaps this cold season   and that my old friend jack tawdery may buy him a cane and not   creep with the air of a strut i must add to all this that if it were   not for one pleasure which i thought a very mean one till of very   late years i should have no one great satisfaction left but if i   live to the  0th of march      and all my securities are good i   shall be worth fifty thousand pound    i am sir your most humble servant jack afterday      mr spectator    you will infinitely oblige a distressed lover if you will insert in   your very next paper the following letter to my mistress you must   know i am not a person apt to despair but she has got an odd humour   of stopping short unaccountably and as she her self told a confident   of hers she has cold fits these fits shall last her a month or six   weeks together and as she falls into them without provocation so it   is to be hoped she will return from them without the merit of new   services but life and love will not admit of such intervals   therefore pray let her be admonished as follows      madam      i love you and i honour you therefore pray do not tell me of     waiting till decencies till forms till humours are consulted and     gratified if you have that happy constitution as to be indolent for     ten weeks together you should consider that all that while i burn     in impatiences and fevers but still you say it will be time enough     tho i and you too grow older while we are yet talking which do you     think the more reasonable that you should alter a state of     indifference for happiness and that to oblige me or i live in     torment and that to lay no manner of obligation upon you while i     indulge your insensibility i am doing nothing if you favour my     passion you are bestowing bright desires gay

always name with honour and gratitude has very frequently talked to me upon the subject of marriage i was in my younger years engaged partly by his advice and partly by my own inclinations in the courtship of a person who had a great deal of beauty and did not at my first approaches seem to have any aversion to me but as my natural taciturnity hindred me from showing my self to the best advantage she by degrees began to look upon me as a very silly fellow and being resolved to regard merit more than any thing else in the persons who made their applications to her she married a captain of dragoons who happened to be beating up for recruits in those parts  this unlucky accident has given me an aversion to pretty fellows ever since and discouraged me from trying my fortune with the fair sex the observations which i made in this conjuncture and the repeated advices which i received at that time from the good old man abovementioned have produced the following essay upon love and marriage  the pleasantest part of a mans life is generally that which passes in courtship provided his passion be sincere and the party beloved kind with discretion love desire hope all the pleasing motions of the soul rise in the pursuit  it is easier for an artful man who is not in love to persuade his mistress he has a passion for her and to succeed in his pursuits than for one who loves with the greatest violence true love has ten thousand griefs impatiences and resentments that render a man unamiable in the eyes of the person whose affection he sollicits besides that it sinks his figure gives him fears apprehensions and poorness of spirit and often makes him appear ridiculous where he has a mind to recommend himself  those marriages generally abound most with love and constancy that are preceded by a long courtship the passion should strike root and gather strength before marriage be grafted on it a long course of hopes and expectations fixes the idea in our minds and habituates us to a fondness of the person beloved  there is nothing of so great importance to us as the good qualities of one to whom we join ourselves for life they do not only make our present state agreeable but often determine our happiness to all eternity where the choice is left to friends the chief point under consideration is an estate where the parties chuse for themselves their thoughts turn most upon the person they have both their reasons the first would procure many conveniencies and pleasures of life to the party whose interests they espouse and at the same time may hope that the wealth of their friend will turn to their own credit and advantage the others are preparing for themselves a perpetual feast a good person does not only raise but continue love and breeds a secret pleasure and complacency in the beholder when the first heats of desire are extinguished it puts the wife or husband in countenance both among friends and strangers and generally fills the family with a healthy and beautiful race of children  i should prefer a woman that is agreeable in my own eye and not deformed in that of the world to a celebrated beauty if you marry one remarkably beautiful you must have a violent passion for her or you have not the proper taste of her charms and if you have such a passion for her it is odds but it would   be imbittered with fears and jealousies  goodnature and evenness of temper will give you an easie companion for life virtue and good sense an agreeable friend love and constancy a good wife or husband where we meet one person with all these accomplishments we find an hundred without any one of them the world notwithstanding is more intent on trains and equipages and all the showy parts of life we love rather to dazzle the multitude than consult our proper interests and as i have elsewhere observed it is one of the most unaccountable passions of human nature that we are at greater pains to appear easie and happy to others than really to make our selves so of all disparities that in humour makes the most unhappy marriages yet scarce enters into our thoughts at the contracting of them several that are in this respect unequally yoked and uneasie for life with a person of a particular character might have been pleased and happy with a person of a contrary one notwithstanding they are both perhaps equally virtuous and laudable in their kind  before marriage we cannot be too inquisitive and discerning in the faults of the person beloved nor after it too dimsighted and superficial however perfect and accomplished the person appears to you at a distance you will find many blemishes and imperfections in her humour upon a more intimate acquaintance which you never discovered or perhaps suspected here therefore discretion and goodnature are to shew their strength the first will hinder your thoughts from dwelling on what is disagreeable the other will raise in you all the tenderness of compassion and humanity and by degrees soften those very imperfections into beauties  marriage enlarges the scene of our happiness and miseries a marriage of love is pleasant a marriage of interest easie and a marriage where both meet happy a happy marriage has in it all the pleasures of friendship all the enjoyments of sense and reason and indeed all the sweets of life nothing is a greater mark of a degenerate and vicious age than the common ridicule which   passes on this state of life it is indeed only happy in those who can look down with scorn or neglect on the impieties of the times and tread the paths of life together in a constant uniform course of virtue    footnote   will   footnote   that                                               no                   monday december                        steele      nulla venenato littera mista joco est    ovid    i think myself highly obliged to the publick for their kind acceptance of a paper which visits them every morning and has in it none of those seasonings that recommend so many of the writings which are in vogue among us  as on the one side my paper has not in it a single word of news a reflection in politics nor a stroak of party so on the other there are no fashionable touches of infidelity no obscene ideas no satyrs upon priesthood marriage and the like popular topics of ridicule no private scandal nor any thing that may tend to the defamation of particular persons families or societies  there is not one of these abovementioned subjects that would not sell a very indifferent paper could i think of gratifying the publick by such mean and base methods but notwithstanding i have rejected every thing that savours of party every thing that is loose and immoral and every thing that might create uneasiness in the minds of particular persons i find that the demand of my papers has encreased every month since their first appearance in the world this does not perhaps reflect so much honour upon my self as on my readers who give a much greater attention to discourses of virtue and morality than ever i expected or indeed could hope  when i broke loose from that great body of writers who have employed their wit and parts in propagating vice and irreligion i did not question but i should be treated as an odd kind of fellow that had a mind to appear singular in my way of writing but the general reception i have found convinces me that the world is not so corrupt as we are apt to imagine and that if those men of parts who have been employed in vitiating the age had endeavourd to rectify and amend it they needed not   have sacrificed their good sense and virtue to their fame and reputation no man is so sunk in vice and ignorance but there are still some hidden seeds of goodness and knowledge in him which give him a relish of such reflections and speculations as have an aptness   to improve the mind and make the heart better  i have shewn in a former paper with how much care i have avoided all such thoughts as are loose obscene or immoral and i believe my reader would still think the better of me if he knew the pains i am at in qualifying what i write after such a manner that nothing may be interpreted as aimed at private persons for this reason when i draw any faulty character i consider all those persons to whom the malice of the world may possibly apply it and take care to dash it with such particular circumstances as may prevent all such illnatured applications if i write any thing on a black man i run over in my mind all the eminent persons in the nation who are of that complection when i place an imaginary name at the head of a character i examine every syllable and letter of it that it may not bear any resemblance to one that is real i know very well the value which every man sets upon his reputation and how painful it is to be exposed to the mirth and derision of the publick and should therefore scorn to divert my reader at the expence of any private man  as i have been thus tender of every particular persons reputation so i have taken more than ordinary care not to give offence to those who appear in the higher figures of life i would not make myself merry even with a piece of pasteboard that is invested with a publick character for which reason i have never glanced upon the late designed procession of his holiness and his attendants   notwithstanding it might have afforded matter to many ludicrous speculations among those advantages which the publick may reap from this paper it is not the least that it draws mens minds off from the bitterness of party and furnishes them with subjects of discourse that may be treated without warmth or passion this is said to have been the first design of those gentlemen who set on foot the royal society   and had then a very good effect as it turned many of the greatest geniuss of that age to the disquisitions of natural knowledge who if they had engaged in politicks with the same parts and application might have set their country in a flame the airpump the barometer the quadrant and the like inventions were thrown out to those busie spirits as tubs and barrels are to a whale that he may let the ship sail on without disturbance while he diverts himself with those innocent amusements  i have been so very scrupulous in this particular of not hurting any mans reputation that i have forborn mentioning even such authors as i could not name without honour this i must confess to have been a piece of very great selfdenial for as the publick relishes nothing better than the ridicule which turns upon a writer of any eminence so there is nothing which a man that has but a very ordinary talent in ridicule may execute with greater ease one might raise laughter for a quarter of a year together upon the works of a person who has published but a very few volumes for which reason   i am astonished that those who have appeared against this paper have made so very little of it the criticisms which i have hitherto published have been made with an intention rather to discover beauties and excellencies in the writers of my own time than to publish any of their faults and imperfections in the mean while i should take it for a very great favour from some of my underhand detractors if they would break all measures with me so far as to give me a pretence for examining their performances with an impartial eye nor shall i look upon it as any breach of charity to criticise the author so long as i keep clear of the person  in the mean while till i am provoked to such hostilities i shall from time to time endeavour to do justice to those who have distinguished themselves in the politer parts of learning and to point out such beauties in their works as may have escaped the observation of others  as the first place among our english poets is due to milton and as i have drawn more quotations out of him than from any other i shall enter into a regular criticism upon his paradise lost which i shall publish every saturday till i have given my thoughts upon that poem i shall not however presume to impose upon others my own particular judgment on this author but only deliver it as my private opinion criticism is of a very large extent and every particular master in this art has his favourite passages in an author which do not equally strike the best judges it will be sufficient for me if i discover many beauties or imperfections which others have not attended to and i should be very glad to see any of our eminent writers publish their discoveries on the same subject in short i would always be understood to write my papers of criticism in the spirit which horace has expressed in those two famous lines   si quid novisti rectius istis   candidus imperti si non his utere mecum    if you have made any better remarks of your own communicate them   with candour if not make use of these i present you with  c    footnote   not to   footnote   aptness in

diligamus    trebonius apud tull      mr spectator    i am the happy father of a very towardly son in whom i do not only   see my life but also my manner of life renewed it would be   extremely beneficial to society if you would frequently resume   subjects which serve to bind these sort of relations faster and   endear the ties of blood with those of goodwill protection   observance indulgence and veneration i would methinks have this   done after an uncommon method and do not think any one who is not   capable of writing a good play fit to undertake a work wherein there   will necessarily occur so many secret instincts and biasses of human   nature which would pass unobserved by common eyes i thank heaven i   have no outrageous offence against my own excellent parents to answer   for but when i am now and then alone and look back upon my past   life from my earliest infancy to this time there are many faults   which i committed that did not appear to me even till i my self   became a father i had not till then a notion of the earnings of   heart which a man has when he sees his child do a laudable thing or   the sudden damp which seizes him when he fears he will act something   unworthy it is not to be imagined what a remorse touched me for a   long train of childish negligencies of my mother when i saw my wife   the other day look out of the window and turn as pale as ashes upon   seeing my younger boy sliding upon the ice these slight intimations   will give you to understand that there are numberless little crimes   which children take no notice of while they are doing which upon   reflection when they shall themselves become fathers they will look   upon with the utmost sorrow and contrition that they did not regard   before those whom they offended were to be no more seen how many   thousand things do i remember which would have highly pleased my   father and i omitted for no other reason but that i thought what he   proposed the effect of humour and old age which i am now convinced   had reason and good sense in it i cannot now go into the parlour to   him and make his heart glad with an account of a matter which was of   no consequence but that i told it and acted in it the good man and   woman are long since in their graves who used to sit and plot the   welfare of us their children while perhaps we were sometimes   laughing at the old folks at another end of the house the truth of it   is were we merely to follow nature in these great duties of life   tho we have a strong instinct towards the performing of them we   should be on both sides very deficient age is so unwelcome to the   generality of mankind and growth towards manhood so desirable to all   that resignation to decay is too difficult a task in the father and   deference amidst the impulse of gay desires appears unreasonable to   the son there are so few who can grow old with a good grace and yet   fewer who can come slow enough into the world that a father were he   to be actuated by his desires and a son were he to consult himself   only could neither of them behave himself as he ought to the other   but when reason interposes against instinct where it would carry   either out of the interests of the other there arises that happiest   intercourse of good offices between those dearest relations of human   life the father according to the opportunities which are offered to   him is throwing down blessings on the son and the son endeavouring   to appear the worthy offspring of such a father it is after this   manner that camillus and his firstborn dwell together camillus   enjoys a pleasing and indolent old age in which passion is subdued   and reason exalted he waits the day of his dissolution with a   resignation mixed with delight and the son fears the accession of his   fathers fortune with diffidence lest he should not enjoy or become   it as well as his predecessor add to this that the father knows he   leaves a friend to the children of his friends an easie landlord to   his tenants and an agreeable companion to his acquaintance he   believes his sons behaviour will make him frequently remembered but   never wanted this commerce is so well cemented that without the pomp   of saying son be a friend to such a one when i am gone camillus   knows being in his favour is direction enough to the grateful youth   who is to succeed him without the admonition of his mentioning it   these gentlemen are honoured in all their neighbourhood and the same   effect which the court has on the manner of a kingdom their   characters have on all who live within the influence of them    my son and i are not of fortune to communicate our good actions or   intentions to so many as these gentlemen do but i will be bold to   say my son has by the applause and approbation which his behaviour   towards me has gained him occasioned that many an old man besides my   self has rejoiced other mens children follow the example of mine   and i have the inexpressible happiness of overhearing our neighbours   as we ride by point to their children and say with a voice of joy   there they go    you cannot mr spectator pass your time better than insinuating   the delights which these relations well regarded bestow upon each   other ordinary passions are no longer such but mutual love gives an   importance to the most indifferent things and a merit to actions the   most insignificant when we look round the world and observe the many   misunderstandings which are created by the malice and insinuation of   the meanest servants between people thus related how necessary will   it appear that it were inculcated that men would be upon their guard   to support a constancy of affection and that grounded upon the   principles of reason not the impulses of instinct    it is from the common prejudices which men receive from their parents   that hatreds are kept alive from one generation to another and when   men act by instinct hatreds will descend when good offices are   forgotten for the degeneracy of human life is such that our anger is   more easily transferred to our children than our love love always   gives something to the object it delights in and anger spoils the   person against whom it is moved of something laudable in him from   this degeneracy therefore and a sort of selflove we are more prone   to take up the illwill of our parents than to follow them in their   friendships    one would think there should need no more to make men keep up this   sort of relation with the utmost sanctity than to examine their own   hearts if every father remembered his own thoughts and inclinations   when he was a son and every son remembered what he expected from his   father when he himself was in a state of dependance this one   reflection would preserve men from being dissolute or rigid in these   several capacities the power and subjection between them when   broken make them more emphatically tyrants and rebels against each   other with greater cruelty of heart than the disruption of states   and empires can possibly produce i shall end this application to you   with two letters which passed between a mother and son very lately   and are as follows       dear frank      if the pleasures which i have the grief to hear you pursue in town     do not take up all your time do not deny your mother so much of it     as to read seriously this letter you said before mr letacre     that an old woman might live very well in the country upon half my     jointure and that your father was a fond fool to give me a     rentcharge of eight hundred a year to the prejudice of his son     what letacre said to you upon that occasion you ought to have     born with more decency as he was your fathers wellbeloved     servant than to have called him countryput in the first place     frank i must tell you i will have my rent duly paid for i will     make up to your sisters for the partiality i was guilty of in     making your father do so much as he has done for you i may it     seems live upon half my jointure i lived upon much less frank     when i carried you from place to place in these arms and could     neither eat dress or mind any thing for feeding and tending you a     weakly child and shedding tears when the convulsions you were then     troubled with returned upon you by my care you outgrew them to     throw away the vigour of your youth in the arms of harlots and deny     your mother what is not yours to detain both your sisters are     crying to see the passion which i smother but if you please to go     on thus like a gentleman of the town and forget all regards to your     self and family i shall immediately enter upon your estate for the     arrear due to me and without one tear more contemn you for     forgetting the fondness of your mother as much as you have the     example of your father o frank do i live to omit writing myself     your affectionate mother at       madam     i will come down tomorrow and pay the money on my knees pray write     so no more i will take care you never shall for i will be for ever     hereafter your most dutiful son ft      i will bring down new heads for my sisters pray let all be     forgotten   t                                        no                  wednesday january                       steele     secretum iter et fallentis semita vitæ    hor   it has been from age to age an affectation to love the pleasure of solitude amongst those who cannot possibly be supposed qualified for passing life in that manner this people have taken up from reading the many agreeable things which have been writ on that subject for which we are beholden to excellent persons who delighted in being retired and abstracted from the pleasures that enchant the generality of the world this way of life is recommended indeed with great beauty and in such a manner as disposes the reader for the time to a pleasing forgetfulness or negligence of the particular hurry of life in which he is engaged together with a longing for that state which he is charmed with in description but when we consider the world it self and how few there are capable of a religious learned or philosophick solitude we shall be apt to change a regard to that sort of solitude for being a little singular in enjoying time after the way a man himself likes best in the world without going so far as wholly to withdraw from it i have often observed there is not a man breathing who does not differ from all other men as much in the sentiments of his mind as the features of his face the felicity is when anyone is so happy as to find out and follow what is the proper bent of this genius and turn all his endeavours to exert himself according as that prompts him instead of this which is an innocent method of enjoying a mans self and turning out of the general tracks wherein you have crowds of rivals there are those who pursue their own way out of a sowrness and spirit of contradiction these men do every thing which they are able to support as if guilt and impunity could not go together they choose a thing only because another dislikes it and affect forsooth an inviolable constancy in matters of no manner of moment thus sometimes an old fellow shall wear this or that sort of cut in his cloaths with great integrity while all the rest of the world are degenerated into buttons pockets and loops unknown to their ancestors as insignificant as even this is if it were searched to the bottom you perhaps would find it not sincere but that he is in the fashion in his heart and holds out from mere obstinacy but i am running from my intended purpose which was to celebrate a certain particular manner of passing away life and is a contradiction to no man but a resolution to contract none of the exorbitant desires by which others are enslaved the best way of separating a mans self from the world is to give up the desire of being known to it after a man has preserved his innocence and performed all duties incumbent upon him his time spent his own way is what makes his life differ from that of a slave if they who affect show and pomp knew how many of their spectators derided their trivial taste they would be very much less elated and have an inclination to examine the merit of all they have to do with they would soon find out that there are many who make a figure below what their fortune or merit entities them to out of mere choice and an elegant desire of ease and disincumbrance it would look like romance to tell you in this age of an old man who is contented to pass for an humourist and one who does not understand the figure he ought to make in the world while he lives in a lodging of ten shillings a week with only one servant while he dresses himself according to the season in cloth or in stuff and has no one necessary attention to any thing but the bell which calls to prayers twice a day i say it would look like a fable to report that this gentleman gives away all which is the overplus of a great fortune by secret methods to other men if he has not the pomp of a numerous train and of professors of service to him he has every day he lives the conscience that the widow the fatherless the mourner and the stranger bless his unseen hand in their prayers this humourist gives up all the compliments which people of his own condition could make to him for the pleasures of helping the afflicted supplying the needy and befriending the neglected this humourist keeps to himself much more than he wants and gives a vast refuse of his superfluities to purchase heaven and by freeing others from the temptations of worldly want to carry a retinue with him thither of all men who affect living in a particular way next to this admirable character i am the most enamoured of irus whose condition will not admit of such largesses and perhaps would not be capable of making them if it were irus tho he is now turned of fifty has not appeared in the world in his real character since five and twenty at which age he ran out a small patrimony and spent some time after with rakes who had lived upon him a course of ten years time passed in all the little alleys bypaths and sometimes open taverns and streets of this town gave irus a perfect skill in judging of the inclinations of mankind and acting accordingly he seriously considered he was poor and the general horror which most men have of all who are in that condition irus judgd very rightly that while he could keep his poverty a secret he should not feel the weight of it he improved this thought into an affectation of closeness and covetousness upon this one principle he resolved to govern his future life and in the thirty sixth year of his age he repaired to longlane and looked upon several dresses which hung there deserted by their first masters and exposed to the purchase of the best bidder at this place he exchanged his gay shabbiness of cloaths fit for a much younger man to warm ones that would be decent for a much older one irus came out thoroughly equipped from head to foot with a little oaken cane in the form of a substantial man that did not mind his dress turned of fifty he had at this time fifty pounds in ready money and in this habit with this fortune he took his present lodging in st john street at the mansionhouse of a taylors widow who washes and can clearstarch his bands from that time to this he has kept the main stock without alteration under or over to the value of five pounds he left off all his old acquaintance to a man and all his arts of life except the play of backgammon upon which he has more than bore his charges irus has ever since he came into this neighbourhood given all the intimations he skilfully could of being a close hunks worth money no body comes to visit him he receives no letters and tells his money morning and evening he has from the publick papers a knowledge of what generally passes shuns all discourses of money but shrugs his shoulder when you talk of securities he denies his being rich with the air which all do who are vain of being so he is the oracle of a neighbouring justice of peace who meets him at the coffeehouse the hopes that what he has must come to somebody and that he has no heirs have that effect where ever he is known that he every day has three or four invitations to dine at different places which he generally takes care to choose in such a manner as not to seem inclined to the richer man all the young men respect him and say he is just the same man he was when they were boys he uses no artifice in the world but makes use of mens designs upon him to get a maintenance out of them this he carries on by a certain peevishness which he acts very well that no one would believe could possibly enter into the head of a poor fellow his mein his dress his carriage and his language are such that you would be at a loss to guess whether in the active part of his life he had been a sensible citizen or scholar that knew the world these are the great circumstances in the life of irus and thus does he pass away his days a stranger to mankind and at his death the worst that will be said of him will be that he got by every man who had expectations from him more than he had to leave him  i have an inclination to print the following letters for that i have heard the author of them has some where or other seen me and by an excellent faculty in mimickry my correspondents tell me he can assume my air and give my taciturnity a slyness which diverts more than any thing i could say if i were present thus i am glad my silence is attoned for to the good company in town he has carried his skill in imitation so far

wandered about england went to ireland and there obtained credit as an actor then returned to london and appeared at drury lane where his skill as a mimic enabled him to perform each part in the manner of the actor who had obtained chief credit by it his power of mimicry made him very diverting in society and as he had natural politeness with a sprightly wit his company was sought and paid for at the entertainments of the great dick estcourt was a great favourite with the duke of marlborough and when men of wit and rank joined in establishing the beefsteak club they made estcourt their providore with a small gold gridiron for badge hung round his neck by a green ribbon estcourt was a writer for the stage as well as actor and had shown his agreement with the spectators dramatic criticisms by ridiculing the italian opera with an interlude called prunella in the numbers of the spectator for december    and    estcourt had advertised that he would on the  st of january open the bumper tavern in jamess street westminster and had laid in    neat natural wines fresh and in perfection being bought by brooke   and hellier by whom the said tavern will from time to time be   supplied with the best growths that shall be imported to be sold by   wholesale as well as retail with the utmost fidelity by his old   servant trusty anthony who has so often adorned both the theatres in   england and ireland and as he is a person altogether unknowing in the   wine trade it cannot be doubted but that he will deliver the wine in   the same natural purity that he receives it

xôon philokôsmon an animal that delights in finery i have already treated of the sex in two or three papers conformably to this definition and have in particular observed that in all ages they have been more careful then the men to adorn that part of the head which we generally call the outside  this observation is so very notorious that when in ordinary discourse we say a man has a fine head a long head or a good head we express ourselves metaphorically and speak in relation to his understanding whereas when we say of a woman she has a fine a long or a good head we speak only in relation to her commode  it is observed among birds that nature has lavished all her ornaments upon the male who very often appears in a most beautiful headdress whether it be a crest a comb a tuft of feathers or a natural little plume erected like a kind of pinacle on the very top of the head as nature on the contrary   has poured out her charms in the greatest abundance upon the female part of our species so they are very assiduous in bestowing upon themselves the finest garnitures of art the peacock in all his pride does not display half the colours that appear in the garments of a british lady when she is dressed either for a ball or a birthday  but to return to our female heads the ladies have been for some time in a kind of moulting season with regard to that part of their dress having cast great quantities of ribbon lace and cambrick and in some measure reduced that part of the human figure to the beautiful globular form which is natural to it we have for a great while expected what kind of ornament would be substituted in the place of those antiquated commodes but our female projectors were all the last summer so taken up with the improvement of their petticoats that they had not time to attend to any thing else but having at length sufficiently adorned their lower parts they now begin to turn their thoughts upon the other extremity as well remembring the old kitchen proverb that if you light your fire at both ends the middle will shift for it self  i am engaged in this speculation by a sight which i lately met with at the opera as i was standing in the hinder part of the box i took notice of a little cluster of women sitting together in the prettiest coloured hoods that i ever saw one of them was blue another yellow and another philomot   the fourth was of a pink colour and the fifth of a pale green i looked with as much pleasure upon this little partycoloured assembly as upon a bed of tulips and did not know at first whether it might not be an embassy of indian queens but upon my going about into the pit and taking them in front i was immediately undeceived and saw so much beauty in every face that i found them all to be english such eyes and lips cheeks and foreheads could be the growth of no other country the complection of their faces hindred me from observing any farther the colour of their hoods though i could easily perceive by that unspeakable satisfaction which appeared in their looks that their own thoughts were wholly taken up on those pretty ornaments they wore upon their heads  i am informed that this fashion spreads daily insomuch that the whig and tory ladies begin already to hang out different colours and to shew their principles in their headdress nay if i may believe my friend will honeycomb there is a certain old coquet of his acquaintance who intends to appear very suddenly in a rainbow hood like the iris in drydens virgil not questioning but that among such a variety of colours she shall have a charm for every heart  my friend will who very much values himself upon his great insights into gallantry tells me that he can already guess at the humour a lady is in by her hood as the courtiers of morocco know the disposition of their present emperor by the colour of the dress which he puts on when melesinda wraps her head in flame colour her heart is set upon execution when she covers it with purple i would not says he advise her lover to approach her but if she appears in white it is peace and he may hand her out of her box with safety  will informs me likewise that these hoods may be used as signals why else says he does cornelia always put on a black hood when her husband is gone into the country  such are my friend honeycombs dreams of gallantry for my own part i impute this diversity of colours in the hoods to the diversity of complexion in the faces of my pretty country women ovid in his art of love has given some precepts as to this particular though i find they are different from those which prevail among the moderns he recommends a red striped silk to the pale complexion white to the brown and dark to the fair on the contrary my friend will who pretends to be a greater master in this art than ovid tells me that the palest features look the most agreeable in white sarsenet that a face which is overflushed appears to advantage in the deepest scarlet and that the darkest complexion is not a little alleviated by a black hood in short he is for losing the colour of the face in that of the hood as a fire burns dimly and a candle goes half out in the light of the sun this says he your ovid himself has hinted where he treats of these matters when he tells us that the blue water nymphs are dressed in sky coloured garments and that aurora who always appears in the light of the rising sun is robed in saffron  whether these his observations are justly grounded i cannot tell but i have often known him as we have stood together behind the ladies praise or dispraise the complexion of a face which he never saw from observing the colour of her hood and has been very seldom out in these his guesses  as i have nothing more at heart than the honour and improvement of the fair sex   i cannot conclude this paper without an exhortation to the british ladies that they would excel the women of all other nations as much in virtue and good sense as they do in beauty which they may certainly do if they will be as industrious to cultivate their minds as they are to adorn their bodies in the mean while i shall recommend to their most serious consideration the saying of an

general with relation to the gift of chastity but at present only enter upon that large field and begin with the consideration of poor and publick whores the other evening passing along near coventgarden i was jogged on the elbow as i turned into the piazza on the right hand coming out of jamesstreet by a slim young girl of about seventeen who with a pert air asked me if i was for a pint of wine i do not know but i should have indulged my curiosity in having some chat with her but that i am informed the man of the bumper knows me and it would have made a story for him not very agreeable to some part of my writings though i have in others so frequently said that i am wholly unconcerned in any scene i am in but meerly as a spectator this impediment being in my way we stood under   one of the arches by twilight and there i could observe as exact features as i had ever seen the most agreeable shape the finest neck and bosom in a word the whole person of a woman exquisitely beautiful she affected to allure me with a forced wantonness in her look and air but i saw it checked with hunger and cold her eyes were wan and eager her dress thin and tawdry her mein genteel and childish this strange figure gave me much anguish of heart and to avoid being seen with her i went away but could not forbear giving her a crown the poor thing sighed curtisied and with a blessing expressed with the utmost vehemence turned from me this creature is what they call newly come upon the town but who i suppose falling into cruel hands was left in the first month from her dishonour and exposed to pass through the hands and discipline of one of those hags of hell whom we call bawds but lest i should grow too suddenly grave on this subject and be my self outragiously good i shall turn to a scene in one of fletchers plays where this character is drawn and the oeconomy of whoredom most admirably described the passage i would point to is in the third scene of the second act of the humorous lieutenant leucippe who is agent for the kings lust and bawds at the same time for the whole court is very pleasantly introduced reading her minutes as a person of business with two maids her undersecretaries taking instructions at a table before her her women both those under her present tutelage and those which she is laying wait for are alphabetically set down in her book and as she is looking over the letter c in a muttering voice as if between soliloquy and speaking out she says    her maidenhead will yield me let me see now   she is not fifteen they say for her complexion   cloe cloe cloe here i have her   cloe the daughter of a country gentleman   here age upon fifteen now her complexion   a lovely brown here tis eyes black and rolling   the body neatly

poor some little share deducted   to buy him a hunting nag  these creatures are very well instructed in the circumstances and manners of all who are any way related to the fair one whom they have a design upon as cloe is to be purchased with   0   crowns and the father taken off with a pad the merchants wife next to her who abounds in plenty is not to have downright money but the mercenary part of her mind is engaged with a present of plate and a little ambition she is made to understand that it is a man of quality who dies for her the examination of a young girl for business and the crying down her value for being a slight thing together with every other circumstance in the scene are inimitably excellent and have the true spirit of comedy tho it were to be wished the author had added a circumstance which should make leucippes baseness more odious  it must not be thought a digression from my intended speculation to talk of bawds in a discourse upon wenches for a woman of the town is not thoroughly and properly such without having gone through the education of one of these houses but the compassionate case of very many is that they are taken into such hands without any the least suspicion previous temptation or admonition to what place they are going the last week i went to an inn in the city to enquire for some provisions which were sent by a waggon out of the country and as i waited in one of the boxes till the chamberlain had looked over his parcel i heard an old and a young voice repeating the questions and responses of the church catechism i thought it no breach of good manners to peep at a crevice and look in at people so well employed but who should i see there but the most artful procuress in the town examining a most beautiful countrygirl who had come up in the same waggon with my things whether she was well educated could forbear playing the wanton with servants and idle fellows of which this town says she is too full at the same time whether she knew enough of breeding as that if a squire or a gentleman or one that was her betters should give her a civil salute she should curtsy and be humble nevertheless her innocent forsooths yess andt please

coach the brother loaded with a great cheese he prevailed upon her to take for her civilities to his sister this poor creatures fate is not far off that of hers whom i spoke of above and it is not to be doubted but after she has been long enough a prey to lust she will be delivered over to famine the ironical commendation of the industry and charity of these antiquated ladies these   directors of sin after they can no longer commit it makes up the beauty of the inimitable dedication to the plaindealer   and is a masterpiece of raillery on this vice but to understand all the purleues of this

cedite romani scriptores cedite graii    propert    there is nothing in nature more irksome than   general discourses especially when they turn chiefly upon words for this reason i shall wave the discussion of that point which was started some years since whether miltons paradise lost may be called an heroick poem those who will not give it that title may call it if they please a divine poem it will be sufficient to its perfection if it has in it all the beauties of the highest kind of poetry and as for those who alledge   it is not an heroick poem they advance no more to the diminution of it than if they should say adam is not æneas nor eve helen  i shall therefore examine it by the rules of epic poetry and see whether it falls short of the iliad or æneid in the beauties which are essential to that kind of writing the first thing to be considered in an epic poem is the fable   which is perfect or imperfect according as the action which it relates is more or less so this action should have three qualifications in it first it should be but one action secondly it should be an entire action and thirdly it should be a great action   to consider the action of the iliad æneid and paradise lost in these three several lights homer to preserve the unity of his action hastens into the midst of things as horace has observed   had he gone up to ledas egg or begun much later even at the rape of helen or the investing of troy it is manifest that the story of the poem would have been a series of several actions he therefore opens his poem with the discord of his princes and artfully   interweaves in the several succeeding parts of it an account of every thing material which relates to them   and had passed before that fatal dissension after the same manner æneas makes his first appearance in the tyrrhene seas and within sight of italy because the action proposed to be celebrated was that of his settling himself in latium but because it was necessary for the reader to know what had happened to him in the taking of troy and in the preceding parts of his voyage virgil makes his hero relate it by way of episode in the second and third books of the æneid the contents of both which books come before those of the first book in the thread of the story tho for preserving of this unity of action they follow them in the disposition of the poem milton in imitation of these two great poets opens his paradise lost with an infernal council plotting the fall of man which is the action he proposed to celebrate and as for those great actions which preceded in point of time the battle of the angels and the creation of the world which would have entirely destroyed the unity of his principal action had he related them in the same order that they happened he cast them into the fifth sixth and seventh books by way of episode to this noble poem  aristotle himself allows that homer has nothing to boast of as to the unity of his fable   tho at the same time that great critick and philosopher endeavours to palliate this imperfection in the greek poet by imputing it in some measure to the very nature of an epic poem some have been of opinion that the æneid also labours  0 in this particular and has episodes which may be looked upon as excrescencies rather than as parts of the action on the contrary the poem which we have now under our consideration hath no other episodes than such as naturally arise from the subject and yet is filled with such a multitude of astonishing incidents   that it gives us at the same time a pleasure of the greatest variety and of the greatest simplicity uniform in its nature tho diversified in the execution     i must observe also that as virgil in the poem which was designed to celebrate the original of the roman empire has described the birth of its great rival the carthaginian commonwealth milton with the like art in his poem on the fall of man has related the fall of those angels who are his professed enemies besides the many other beauties in such an episode its running parallel with the great action of the poem hinders it from breaking the unity so much as another episode would have done that had not so great an affinity with the principal subject in short this is the same kind of beauty which the criticks admire in the spanish frier or the double discovery    where the two different plots look like counterparts and copies of one another  the second qualification required in the action of an epic poem is that it should be an entire action an action is entire when it is complete in all its parts or as aristotle describes it when it consists of a beginning a middle and an end nothing should go before it be intermixed with it or follow after it that is not related to it as on the contrary no single step should be omitted in that just and regular progress which it must be supposed to take from its original to its consummation thus we see the anger of achilles in its birth its continuance and effects and æneass settlement in italy carried on thro all the oppositions in his way to it both by sea and land the action in milton excels i think both the former in this particular we see it contrived in hell executed upon earth and punished by heaven the parts of it are told in the most distinct manner and grow out of one another in the most natural order     the third qualification of an epic poem is its greatness the anger of achilles was of such consequence that it embroiled the kings of greece destroyed the heroes of troy and engaged all the gods in factions æneass settlement in italy produced the cæsars and gave birth to the roman empire miltons subject was still greater than either of the former it does not determine the fate of single persons or nations but of a whole species the united powers of hell are joined together for the destruction of mankind which they affected in part and would have completed had not omnipotence it self interposed the principal actors are man in his greatest perfection and woman in her highest beauty their enemies are the fallen angels the messiah their friend and the almighty their protector in short every thing that is great in the whole circle of being whether within the verge of nature or out of it has a proper part assigned it in this noble poem  in poetry as in architecture not only the whole but the principal members and every part of them should be great i will not presume to say that the book of games in the æneid or that in the iliad are not of this nature nor to reprehend virgils simile of the top    and many other of the same kind    in the iliad as liable to any censure in this particular but i think we may say without derogating from    those wonderful performances that there is an unquestionable magnificence in every part of paradise lost and indeed a much greater than could have been formed upon any pagan system  but aristotle by the greatness of the action does not only mean that it should be great in its nature but also in its duration or in other words that it should have a due length in it as well as what we properly call greatness the just measure of this kind of magnitude he explains by the following similitude     an animal no bigger than a mite cannot appear perfect to the eye because the sight takes it in at once and has only a confused idea of the whole and not a distinct idea of all its parts if on the contrary you should suppose an animal of ten thousand furlongs in length the eye would be so filled with a single part of it that it could not give the mind an idea of the whole what these animals are to the eye a very short or a very long action would be to the memory the first would be as it were lost and swallowed up by it and the other difficult to be contained in it homer and virgil have shewn their principal art in this particular the action of the iliad and that of the æneid were in themselves exceeding short but are so beautifully extended and diversified by the invention     of episodes and the machinery of gods with the like poetical ornaments that they make up an agreeable story sufficient to employ the memory without overcharging it miltons action is enriched with such a variety of circumstances that i have taken as much pleasure in reading the contents of his books as in the best invented story i ever met with it is possible that the traditions on which the iliad and æneid were built had more circumstances in them than the history of the fall of man as it is related in scripture besides it was easier for homer and virgil to dash the truth with fiction as they were in no danger of offending the religion of their country by it but as for milton he had not only a very few circumstances upon which to raise his poem but was also obliged to proceed with the greatest caution in every thing that he added out of his own invention and indeed notwithstanding all the restraints he was under he has filled his story with so many surprising incidents which bear so close an analogy with what is delivered in holy writ that it is capable of pleasing the most delicate reader without giving offence to the most scrupulous  the modern criticks have collected from several hints in the iliad and æneid the space of time which is taken up by the action of each of those poems but as a great part of miltons story was transacted in regions that lie out of the reach of the sun and the sphere of day it is impossible to gratify the reader with such a calculation which indeed would be more curious than instructive none of the criticks either ancient or modern having laid down rules to circumscribe the action of an epic poem with any determind number of years days or hours  this piece of criticism on miltons paradise lost shall be carried on in the following saturdays papers  l    footnote   give place to him writers of rome and greece this application to milton of a line from the last elegy   th in the second book of propertius is not only an example of addisons felicity in choice of motto for a paper but was so bold and welltimed that it must have given a wholesome shock to the minds of many of the spectators readers addison was not before steele in appreciation of milton and diffusion of a true sense of his genius milton was the subject of the first piece of poetical criticism in the tatler where in his sixth number steele having said that all miltons thoughts are wonderfully just and natural dwelt on the passage in which adam tells his thoughts upon first falling asleep soon after his creation this passage he contrasts with the same apprehension of annihilation ascribed to eve in a much lower sense by dryden in his operatic version of paradise lost in tatlers and spectators steele and addison had been equal contributors to the diffusion of a sense of miltons genius in addison it had been strong even when at oxford in april      a young man trained in the taste of the day he omitted shakespeare from a rhymed account of the chief english poets but of milton said    whateer his pen describes i more than see   whilst evry verse arrayd in majesty   bold and sublime my whole attention draws   and seems above the critics nicer laws  eighteen years older than he was when he wrote that addison now prepares by a series of saturday essaysthe saturday paper which reached many subscribers only in time for sunday reading being always set apart in the spectator for moral or religious topics to show that judged also by aristotle and the critics nicer laws milton was even technically a greater epic poet than either homer or virgil this nobody had conceded dryden the best critic of the outgoing generation had said in the dedication of the translations of juvenal and persius published in         as for mr milton whom we all admire with so much justice his   subject is not that of an heroick poem properly so calld his   design is the losing of our happiness his event is not prosperous   like that of all other epique works drydens french spelling of   the word epic is suggestive for this new critical mode was one of the   fashions that had been imported from paris his heavenly machines   are many and his human persons are but two but i will not take mr   rymers work out of his hands he has promised the world a critique   on that author wherein tho he will not allow his poem for heroick   i hope he will grant us that his thoughts are elevated his words   sounding and that no man has so happily copyd the manner of homer   or so copiously translated his grecisms and the latin elegancies of   virgil tis true he runs into a flat of thought sometimes for a   hundred lines together but tis when he is got into a track of   scripture  neither will i justify milton for his blank verse   tho i may excuse him by the example of hanabal caro and other   italians who have used it for whatever causes he alledges for the   abolishing of rhime which i have not now the leisure to examine his   own particular reason is plainly this that rhime was not his talent   he had neither the ease of doing it nor the graces of it  so dryden who appreciated milton better than most of his critical neighbours wrote of him in      the promise of rymer to discuss milton was made in      when on the last page of his little book the tragedies of the last age considerd and examined by the practice of the ancients and by the common sense of all ages in a letter to fleetwold shepheard esq father of two ladies who contribute an occasional letter to the spectator he said with the remaining tragedies i shall also send you some reflections on that paradise lost of miltons which some are pleased to call a poem and assert rhime against the slender sophistry wherewith he attaques it but two years after the appearance of drydens juvenal and persius rymer prefixed to his translation of réné rapins reflections on aristotles poesie some reflections of his own on epic poets herein he speaks under the head epic poetry of chaucer in whose time language was not capable of heroic character or spenser who wanted a true idea and lost himself by following an unfaithful guide besides using a stanza which is in no wise proper for our language of sir william davenant who in gondibert has some strokes of an extraordinary judgment but is for unbeaten tracks and new ways of thinking his heroes are foreigners of cowley in whose davideis david is the least part of the poem and there is want of the one illustrious and perfect action which properly is the subject of an epick poem all failing through ignorance or negligence of the fundamental rules or laws of aristotle but he contemptuously passes over milton without mention réné rapin that great french oracle of whom dryden said in the preface to his own conversion of paradise lost into an opera that he was alone sufficient were all other critics lost to teach anew the art of writing réné rapin in the work translated and introduced by rymer worshipped in aristotle the one god of all orthodox critics of his laws he said    there is no arriving at perfection but by these rules and they   certainly go astray that take a different course and if a poem   made by these rules fails of success the fault lies not in the art   but in the artist all who have writ of this art have followed no   other idea but that of aristotle  again as to style    to say the truth what is good on this subject is all taken from   aristotle who is the only source whence good sense is to be drawn   when one goes about to write  this was the critical temper addison resolved to meet on its own ground and do battle with for the honour of that greatest of all epic poets to whom he fearlessly said that all the greeks and latins must give place in so doing he might suggest here and there cautiously and without bringing upon himself the discredit of much heresyindeed without being much of a hereticthat even the divine aristotle sometimes fell short of perfection the conventional critics who believed they kept the gates of fame would neither understand nor credit him nine years after these papers appeared charles gildon who passed for a critic of considerable mark edited with copious annotation as the laws of poetry      the duke of buckinghams essay on poetry roscommons essay on translated verse and lord lansdowne on unnatural flights in poetry and in the course of comment gildon said that    mr addison in the spectators in his criticisms upon milton seems   to have mistaken the matter in endeavouring to bring that poem to the   rules of the epopoeia which cannot be done  it is not an heroic   poem but a divine one and indeed of a new species it is plain that   the proposition of all the heroic poems of the ancients mentions some   one person as the subject of their poem but milton begins his poem   of things and not of men  the gildon are all gone and when in the next generation after theirs national life began in many parts of europe strongly to assert itself in literature against the pedantry of the french critical lawgivers in germany miltons name was inscribed on the foremost standard of the men who represented the new spirit of the age gottsched who dealt french critical law from leipzig by passing sentence against milton in his art of poetry in      raised in bodmer an opponent who led the revolt of all that was most vigorous in german thought and put an end to french supremacy bodmer in a book published in    0 vom wunderbaren in der poesie justified and exalted milton and brought addison to his aid by appending to his own work a translation of these milton papers out of the spectator gottsched replied bodmer retorted bodmer

which imitates by narration    it is obvious that the fable ought to be dramatically   constructed like that of tragedy and that it should have for its   subject one entire and perfect action having a beginning a middle   and an end  forming a complete whole like an animal and therein differing aristotle says from history which treats not of one action but of one time and of all the events casually connected which happened to one person or to many during that time   footnote   poetics i §      epic poetry agrees so far with tragic as it is an imitation of great   characters and actions

found in tragedy not all   those of tragedy in the epic poem   footnote      nec reditum diomedis ab interitu meleagri   nec gemino bellum trojanum orditur ab ovo   semper ad eventum festinat et in

such subordinate   parts each of which has a certain magnitude and unity of its own yet   is the construction of those poems as perfect and as nearly   approaching to the imitation of a single action

of the tragic and comic plots and sir walter scott said of it in his edition of drydens works that    the felicity does not consist in the ingenuity of his original   conception but in the minutely artificial strokes by which the reader   is perpetually reminded of the dependence of the one part of the play   on the other these are so frequent and appear so very natural that   the comic plot instead of diverting our attention from the tragic   business recalls it to our mind by constant and unaffected allusion   no great event happens in the higher region of the camp or court that   has not some indirect influence upon the intrigues of lorenzo and   elvira and the part which the gallant is called upon to act in the   revolution that winds up the tragic interest while it is highly in

any attempt towards it i am of opinion that i ought sometimes to lay before the world the plain letters of my correspondents in the artless dress in which they hastily send them that the reader may see i am not accuser and judge my self but that the indictment is properly and fairly laid before i proceed against the criminal     mr spectator      as you are spectatorgeneral i apply myself to you in the   following case viz i do not wear a sword but i often divert my self   at the theatre where i frequently see a set of fellows pull plain   people by way of humour and   frolick by the nose upon   frivolous or no occasions a friend of mine the other night applauding   what a graceful exit mr wilks made one of these nosewringers   overhearing him pinched him by the nose i was in the pit the other   night when it was very much crowded a gentleman leaning upon me   and very heavily i very civilly requested him to remove his hand for   which he pulled me by the nose i would not resent it in so publick a   place because i was unwilling to create a disturbance but have since   reflected upon it as a thing that is unmanly and disingenuous renders   the nosepuller odious and makes the person pulled by the nose look   little and contemptible this grievance i humbly request you would   endeavour to redress    i am your admirer c    james easy     mr spectator    your discourse of the   th of december on love and marriage is of so   useful a kind that i cannot forbear adding my thoughts to yours on   that subject methinks it is a misfortune that the marriage state   which in its own nature is adapted to give us the compleatest   happiness this life is capable of should be so uncomfortable a one to   so many as it daily proves but the mischief generally proceeds from   the unwise choice people make for themselves and expectation of   happiness from things not capable of giving it nothing but the good   qualities of the person beloved can be a foundation for a love of   judgment and discretion and whoever expects happiness from any thing   but virtue wisdom goodhumour and a similitude of manners will   find themselves widely mistaken but how few are there who seek after   these things and do not rather make riches their chief if not their   only aim how rare is it for a man when he engages himself in the   thoughts of marriage to place his hopes of having in such a woman a   constant agreeable companion one who will divide his cares and   double his joys who will manage that share of his estate he intrusts   to her conduct with prudence and frugality govern his house with   oeconomy and discretion and be an ornament to himself and family   where shall we find the man who looks out for one who places her chief   happiness in the practice of virtue and makes her duty her continual   pleasure no men rather seek for money as the complement of all their   desires and regardless of what kind of wives they take they think   riches will be a minister to all kind of pleasures and enable them to   keep mistresses horses hounds to drink feast and game with their   companions pay their debts contracted by former extravagancies or   some such vile and unworthy end and indulge themselves in pleasures   which are a shame and scandal to humane nature now as for the women   how few of them are there who place the happiness of their marriage in   the having a wise and virtuous friend one who will be faithful and   just to all and constant and loving to them who with care and   diligence will look after and improve the estate and without grudging   allow whatever is prudent and convenient rather how few are there   who do not place their happiness in outshining others in pomp and   show and that do not think within themselves when they have married   such a rich person that none of their acquaintance shall appear so   fine in their equipage so adorned in their persons or so magnificent   in their furniture as themselves thus their heads are filled with   vain ideas and i heartily wish i could say that equipage and show   were not the chief good of so many women as i fear it is    after this manner do both sexes deceive themselves and bring   reflections and disgrace upon the most happy and most honourable state   of life whereas if they would but correct their depraved taste   moderate their ambition and place their happiness upon proper   objects we should not find felicity in the marriage state such a   wonder in the world as it now is    sir if you think these thoughts worth inserting among   your own   be pleased to give them a better dress and let them pass abroad and   you will oblige your admirer    a b     mr spectator    as i was this day walking in the street there happened to pass by on   the other side of the way a beauty whose charms were so attracting   that it drew my eyes wholly on that side insomuch that i neglected my   own way and chanced to run my nose directly against a post which the   lady no sooner perceived but fell out into a fit of laughter though   at the same time she was sensible that her self was the cause of my   misfortune which in my opinion was the greater aggravation of her   crime i being busy wiping off the blood which trickled down my face   had not time to acquaint her with her barbarity as also with my   resolution viz never to look out of my way for one of her sex   more therefore that your humble servant may be revenged he desires   you to insert this in one of your next papers which he hopes will be   a warning to all the rest of the women gazers as well as to poor    anthony gape     mr spectator    i desire to know in your next if the merry game of the parson has   lost his cloak is not mightily in vogue amongst the fine ladies this   christmas because i see they wear hoods of all colours which i   suppose is for that purpose if it is and you think it proper i will   carry some of those hoods with me to our ladies in yorkshire   because they enjoyned me to bring them something from london that   was very new if you can tell any thing in which i can obey their   commands more agreeably be pleased to inform me and you will   extremely oblige    your humble servant     oxford dec       mr spectator    since you appear inclined to be a friend to the distressed i beg you   would assist me in an affair under which i have suffered very much   the reigning toast of this place is patetia i have pursued her with   the utmost diligence this twelvemonth and find nothing stands in my   way but one who flatters her more than i can pride is her favourite   passion therefore if you would be so far my friend as to make a   favourable mention of her in one of your papers i believe i should   not fail in my addresses the scholars stand in rows as they did to   be sure in your time at her pewdoor and she has all the devotion   paid to her by a crowd of youths who are unacquainted with the sex   and have inexperience added to their passion however if it succeeds   according to my vows you will make me the happiest man in the world   and the most obliged amongst all    your humble servants     mr spectator    i came to   my mistresss toilet this morning for i am admitted   when her face is stark naked she frowned and cryed pish when i said   a thing that i stole and i will be judged by you whether it was not   very pretty madam

simplicitas    ovid    i was this morning surprised with a great knocking at the door when my landladys daughter came up to me and told me that there was a man below desired to speak with me upon my asking her who it was she told me it was a very grave elderly person but that she did not know his name i immediately went down to him and found him to be the coachman of my worthy friend sir roger de coverley he told me that his master came to town last night and would be glad to take a turn with me in graysinn walks as i was wondring in my self what had brought sir roger to town not having lately received any letter from him he told me that his master was come up to get a sight of prince eugene   and that he desired i would immediately meet him  i was not a little pleased with the curiosity of the old knight though i did not much wonder at it having heard him say more than once in private discourse that he looked upon prince eugenio for so the knight always calls him to be a greater man than scanderbeg  i was no sooner come into graysinn walks but i heard my friend upon the terrace hemming twice or thrice to himself with great vigour for he loves to clear his pipes in good air to make use of his own phrase and is not a little pleased with any one who takes notice of the strength which he still exerts in his morning hems  i was touched with a secret joy at the sight of the good old man who before he saw me was engaged in conversation with a beggarman that had asked an alms of him i could hear my friend chide him for not finding out some work but at the same time saw him put his hand in his pocket and give him sixpence  our salutations were very hearty on both sides consisting of many kind shakes of the hand and several affectionate looks which we cast upon one another after which the knight told me my good friend his chaplain was very well and much at my service and that the sunday before he had made a most incomparable sermon out of dr barrow i have left says he all my affairs in his hands and being willing to lay an obligation upon him have deposited with him thirty marks to be distributed among his poor parishioners  he then proceeded to acquaint me with the welfare of will wimble upon which he put his hand into his fob and presented me in his name with a tobaccostopper telling me that will had been busy all the beginning of the winter in turning great quantities of them and that he made   a present of one to every gentleman in the country who has good principles and smoaks he added that poor will was at present under great tribulation for that tom touchy had taken the law of him for cutting some hazel sticks out of one of his hedges  among other pieces of news which the knight brought from his countryseat he informed me that moll white was dead and that about a month after her death the wind was so very high that it blew down the end of one of his barns but for my own part says sir roger i do not think that the old woman had any hand in it  he afterwards fell into an account of the diversions which had passed in his house during the holidays for sir roger after the laudable custom of his ancestors always keeps open house at christmas i learned from him that he had killed eight fat hogs for the season that he had dealt about his chines very liberally amongst his neighbours and that in particular he had sent a string of hogspuddings with a pack of cards to every poor family in the parish i have often thought says sir roger it happens very well that christmas should fall out in the middle of the winter it is the most dead uncomfortable time of the year when the poor people would suffer very much from their poverty and cold   if they had not good cheer warm fires and christmas gambols to support them i love to rejoice their poor hearts at this season and to see the whole village merry in my great hall i allow a double quantity of malt to my small beer and set it a running for twelve days to every one that calls for it i have always a piece of cold beef and a mincepye upon the table and am wonderfully pleased to see my tenants pass away a whole evening in playing their innocent tricks and smutting one another our friend will wimble is as merry as any of them and shews a thousand roguish tricks upon these occasions  i was very much delighted with the reflection of my old friend which carried so much goodness in it he then launched out into the praise of the late act of parliament   for securing the church of england and told me with great satisfaction that he believed it already began to take effect for that a rigid dissenter who chanced to dine at his house on christmas day had been observed to eat very plentifully of his plumbporridge  after having dispatched all our country matters sir roger made several inquiries concerning the club and particularly of his old antagonist sir andrew freeport he asked me with a kind of smile whether sir andrew had not taken advantage of his absence to vent among them some of his republican doctrines but soon after gathering up his countenance into a more than ordinary seriousness tell me truly says he dont you think sir andrew had a hand in the popes processionbut without giving me time to answer him well well says he i know you are a wary man and do not care to talk of publick matters  the knight then asked me if i had seen prince eugenio and made me promise to get him a stand in some convenient place where he might have a full sight of that extraordinary man whose presence does so much honour to the british nation he dwelt very long on the praises of this great general and i found that since i was with him in the country he had drawn many observations together out of his reading in bakers chronicle and other authors who   always lie in his hall window which very much redound to the honour of this prince  having passed away the greatest part of the morning in hearing the knights reflections which were partly private and partly political he asked me if i would smoak a pipe with him over a dish of coffee at squires as i love the old man i take delight in complying with every thing that is agreeable to him and accordingly waited on him to the coffeehouse where his venerable figure drew upon us the eyes of the whole room he had no sooner seated himself at the upper end of the high table but he called for a clean pipe a paper of tobacco a dish of coffee a waxcandle and the supplement with such an air of cheerfulness and goodhumour that all the boys in the coffeeroom who seemed to take pleasure in serving him were at once employed on his several errands insomuch that no body else could come at a dish of tea till the knight had got all his conveniences about him   l    footnote   prince eugene was at this in london

 hor    i do not know that i have been in greater delight for these many years than in beholding the boxes at the play the last time the scornful lady   was acted so great an assembly of ladies placed in gradual rows in all the ornaments of jewels silk and colours gave so lively and gay an impression to the heart that methought the season of the year was vanished and i did not think it an ill expression of a young fellow who stood near me that called the boxes those beds of tulips it was a pretty variation of the prospect when any one of these fine ladies rose up and did honour to herself and friend at a distance by curtisying and gave opportunity to that friend to shew her charms to the same advantage in returning the salutation here that action is as proper and graceful as it is at church unbecoming and impertinent by the way i must take the liberty to observe that i did not see any one who is usually so full of civilities at church offer at any such indecorum during any part of the action of the play  such beautiful prospects gladden our minds and when considered in general give innocent and pleasing ideas he that dwells upon any one object of beauty may fix his imagination to his disquiet but the contemplation of a whole assembly together is a defence against the encroachment of desire at least to me who have taken pains to look at beauty abstracted from the consideration of its being the object of desire at power only as it sits upon another without any hopes of partaking any share of it at wisdom and capacity without any pretensions to rival or envy its acquisitions i say to me who am really free from forming any hopes by beholding the persons of beautiful women or warming my self into ambition from the successes of other men this world is not only a meer scene but a very pleasant one did mankind but know the freedom which there is in keeping thus aloof from the world i should have more imitators than the powerfullest man in the nation has followers to be no mans rival in love or competitor in business is a character which if it does not recommend you as it ought to benevolence among those whom you live with yet has it certainly this effect that you do not stand so much in need of their approbation as you would if you aimed at it more in setting your heart on the same things which the generality doat on by this means and with this easy philosophy i am never less at a play than when i am at the theatre but indeed i am seldom so well pleased with the action as in that place for most men follow nature no longer than while they are in their nightgowns and all the busy part of the day are in characters which they neither become or act in with pleasure to themselves or their beholders but to return to my ladies i was very well pleased to see so great a crowd of them assembled at a play wherein the heroine as the phrase is is so just a picture of the vanity of the sex in tormenting their admirers the lady who pines for the man whom she treats with so much impertinence and inconstancy is drawn with much art and humour her resolutions to be extremely civil but her vanity arising just at the instant that she resolved to express her self kindly are described as by one who had studied the sex but when my admiration is fixed upon this excellent character and two or three others in the play i must confess i was moved with the utmost indignation at the trivial senseless and unnatural representation of the chaplain it is possible there may be a pedant in holy orders and we have seen one or two of them in the world but such a driveler as sir roger so bereft of all manner of pride which is the characteristick of a pedant is what one would not believe could come into the head of the same man who drew the rest of the play the meeting between welford and him shews a wretch without any notion of the dignity of his function and it is out of all common sense that he should give an account of himself as one sent four or five miles in a morning on foot for eggs it is not to be denied but his part and that of the maid whom he makes love to are excellently well performed but a thing which is blameable in it self grows still more so by the success in the execution of it it is so mean a thing to gratify a loose age with a scandalous representation of what is reputable among men not to say what is sacred that no beauty no excellence in an author ought to attone for it nay such excellence is an aggravation of his guilt and an argument that he errs against the conviction of his own understanding and conscience wit should be tried by this rule and an audience should rise against such a scene as throws down the reputation of any thing which the consideration of religion or decency should preserve from contempt but all this evil arises from this one corruption of mind that makes men resent offences against their virtue less than those against their understanding an author shall write as if he thought there was not one man of honour or woman of chastity in the house and come off with applause for an insult upon all the ten commandments with the little criticks is not so bad as the breach of an unity of time or place half wits do not apprehend the miseries that must necessarily flow from degeneracy of manners nor do they know that order is the support of society sir roger and his mistress are monsters of the poets own forming the sentiments in both of them are such as do not arise in fools of their education we all know that a silly scholar instead of being below every one he meets with is apt to be exalted above the rank of such as are really his superiors his arrogance is always founded upon particular notions of distinction in his own head accompanied with a pedantick scorn of all fortune and preheminence when compared with his knowledge and learning this very one character of sir roger as silly as it really is has done more towards the disparagement of holy orders and consequently of virtue it self than all the wit that author or any other could make up for in the conduct of the longest life after it i do not pretend in saying this to give myself airs of more virtue than my neighbours but assert it from the principles by which mankind must always be governed sallies of imagination are to be overlooked when they are committed out of warmth in the recommendation of what is praise worthy but a deliberate advancing of vice with all the wit in the world is as ill an action as any that comes before the magistrate and ought to be received as such by the people  t    footnote   beaumont and fletchers vol ii                                               no                  thursday january  0                    addison      mille trahens varios

the language or thought into my own way of speaking and thinking and always if it can be done without prejudice to the sense omit the many compliments and applauses which are usually bestowed upon me  besides the two advantages abovementioned which i receive from the letters that are sent me they give me an opportunity of lengthning out my paper by the skilful management of the subscribing part at

thursday in an assembly of ladies where there were   thirteen different coloured hoods your spectator of that day lying   upon the table they ordered me to read it to them which i did with a   very clear voice till i came to the greek verse at the end of it   i must confess i was a little startled at its popping upon me so   unexpectedly however i covered my confusion as well as i could and   after having mutterd two or three hard words to my self laughd   heartily and cried a very good jest faith the ladies desired me   to explain it to them but i begged their pardon for that and told   them that if it had been proper for them to hear they may be sure   the author would not have wrappd it up in greek i then let drop   several expressions as if there was something in it that was not fit   to be spoken before a company of ladies upon which the matron of the   assembly who was dressed in a cherrycoloured hood commended the   discretion of the writer for having thrown his filthy thoughts into   greek which was likely to corrupt but few of his readers at the   same time she declared herself very well pleased that he had not   given a decisive opinion upon the newfashioned hoods for to tell you   truly says she i was afraid he would have made us ashamed to shew   our heads now sir you must know since this unlucky accident   happened to me in a company of ladies among whom i passed for a most   ingenious man i have consulted one who is well versed in the greek   language and he assures me upon his word that your late quotation   means no more than that manners and not dress are the ornaments of a   woman if this comes to the knowledge of my female admirers i shall   be very hard put to it to bring my self off handsomely in the mean   while i give you this account that you may take care hereafter not to   betray any of your wellwishers into the like inconveniencies it is   in the number of these that i beg leave to subscribe my self    tom trippit

the little cavalier has so well acquitted   himself that his lady is with child the bigbellied woman and her   husband with their whimsical palfry are so very light that when   they are put together into a scale an ordinary man may weigh down the   whole family the little man is a bully in his nature but when he   grows cholerick i confine him to his box till his wrath is over by   which means i have hitherto prevented him from doing mischief his   horse is likewise very vicious for which reason i am forced to tie   him close to his manger with a packthread the woman is a coquet she   struts as much as it is possible for a lady of two foot high and   would ruin me in silks were not the quantity that goes to a large   pincushion sufficient to make her a gown and petticoat she told me   the other day that she heard the ladies wore coloured hoods and   ordered me to get her one of the finest blue i am forced to comply   with her demands while she is in her present condition being very   willing to have more of the same breed i do not know what she may   produce me but provided it be a show i shall be very well   satisfied such novelties should not i think be concealed from the

no   comfort but that common one to all in her condition the pleasure of   interrupting the amours of others it is impossible but you must have   seen several of these volunteers in malice who pass their whole time   in the most labourous way of life in getting intelligence running   from place to place with new whispers without reaping any other   benefit but the hopes of making others as unhappy as themselves mrs   jane happened to be at a place where i with many others well   acquainted with my passion for belinda passed a christmas   evening there was among the rest a young lady so free in mirth so   amiable in a just reserve that accompanied it i wrong her to call it   a reserve but there appeared in her a mirth or chearfulness which was   not a forbearance of more immoderate joy but the natural appearance   of all which could flow from a mind possessed of an habit of innocence   and purity i must have utterly forgot belinda to have taken no   notice of one who was growing up to the same womanly virtues which   shine to perfection in her had i not distinguished one who seemed to   promise to the world the same life and conduct with my faithful and   lovely belinda when the company broke up the fine young thing   permitted me to take care of her home mrs jane saw my particular   regard to her and was informed of my attending her to her fathers   house she came early to belinda the next morning and asked her if   mrs suchaone had been with her no if mr suchaones lady   no nor your cousin suchaone no lord says mrs jane what is   the friendship of womannay they may laugh at it and did no one   tell you any thing of the behaviour of your lover mr what dye call   last night but perhaps it is nothing to you that he is to be married   to young mrson tuesday next belinda was here ready to die with   rage and jealousy then mrs jane goes on i have a young kinsman   who is clerk to a great conveyancer who shall shew you the rough   draught of the marriage settlement the world says her father gives   him two thousand pounds more than he could have with you i went   innocently to wait on belinda as usual but was not admitted i writ   to her and my letter was sent back unopened poor betty her maid   who is on my side has been here just now blubbering and told me the   whole matter she says she did not think i could be so base and that   she is now odious to her mistress for having so often spoke well of   me that she dare not mention me more all our hopes are placed in   having these circumstances fairly represented in the spectator which   betty says she dare not but bring up as soon as it is brought in   and has promised when you have broke the ice to own this was laid   between us and when i can come to an hearing the young lady will   support what we say by her testimony that i never saw her but that   once in my whole life dear sir do not omit this true relation nor   think it too particular for there are crowds of forlorn coquets who   intermingle themselves with other ladies and contract familiarities   out of malice and with no other design but to blast the hopes of   lovers the expectation of parents and the benevolence of kindred i   doubt not but i shall be   sir   your most obliged   humble servant   cleanthes     wills coffeehouse jan  0    sir   the other day entering a room adorned with the fair sex

the next place consider the actors this is aristotles method of considering first the fable and secondly   the manners or as we generally call them in english the fable and the characters  homer has excelled all the heroic poets that ever wrote in the multitude and variety of his characters every god that is admitted into this poem acts a part which would have been suitable to no other deity his princes are as much distinguished by their manners as by their dominions and even those among them whose characters seem wholly made up of courage differ from one another as to the particular kinds of courage in which they excel in short there is scarce a speech or action in the iliad which the reader may not ascribe to the person that speaks or acts without seeing his name at the head of it  homer does not only outshine all other poets in the variety but also in the novelty of his characters he has introduced among his grecian princes a person who had lived thrice the age of man and conversed with theseus hercules polyphemus and the first race of heroes his principal actor is the son   of a goddess not to mention the offspring of other deities who have   likewise a place in his poem and the venerable trojan prince who was the father of so many kings and heroes there is in these several characters of homer a certain dignity as well as novelty which adapts them in a more peculiar manner to the nature of an heroic poem tho at the same time to give them the greater variety he has described a vulcan that is a buffoon among his gods and a thersites among his mortals  virgil falls infinitely short of homer in the characters of his poem both as to their variety and novelty æneas is indeed a perfect character but as for achates tho he is stiled the heros friend he does nothing in the whole poem which may deserve that title gyas mnesteus sergestus and cloanthus are all of them men of the same stamp and character   fortemque gyan fortemque cloanthum  there are indeed several very natural incidents on the part of ascanius as that of dido cannot be sufficiently admired i do not see any thing new or particular in turnus pallas and evander are remote copies of hector and priam as lausus and mezentius are almost parallels to pallas and evander the characters of nisus and eurialus are beautiful but common we must not forget the parts of sinon camilla and some few others which are fine improvements on the greek poet in short there is neither that variety nor novelty in the persons of the æneid which we meet with in those of the iliad  if we look into the characters of milton we shall find that he has introduced all the variety his fable   was capable of receiving the whole species of mankind was in two persons at the time to which the subject of his poem is confined we have however four distinct characters in these two persons we see man and woman in the highest innocence and perfection and in the most abject state of guilt and infirmity the two last characters are indeed very common and obvious but the two first are not only more magnificent but more new   than any characters either in virgil or homer or indeed in the whole circle of nature  milton was so sensible of this defect in the subject of his poem and of the few characters it would afford him that he has brought into it two actors of a shadowy and fictitious nature in the persons of sin and death   by which means he has wrought into   the body of his fable a very beautiful and wellinvented allegory but notwithstanding the fineness of this allegory may attone for it in some measure i cannot think that persons of such a chymerical existence are proper actors in an epic poem because there is not that measure of probability annexed to them which is requisite in writings of this kind as i shall shew more at large hereafter  virgil has indeed admitted fame as an actress in the æneid but the part she acts is very short and none of the most admired circumstances in that divine work we find in mockheroic poems particularly in the dispensary and the lutrin   several allegorical persons of this nature which are very beautiful in those compositions and may perhaps be used as an argument that the authors of them were of opinion such   characters might have a place in an epic work for my own part i should be glad the reader would think so for the sake of the poem i am now examining and must further add that if such empty unsubstantial beings may be ever made use of on this occasion never were any more nicely imagined and employed in more proper actions than those of which i am now speaking  another principal actor in this poem is the great enemy of mankind the part of ulysses in homers odyssey is very much admired by aristotle  0 as perplexing that fable with very agreeable plots and intricacies not only by the many adventures in his voyage and the subtility of his behaviour but by the various concealments and discoveries of his person in several parts of that poem but the crafty being i have now mentioned makes a much longer voyage than ulysses puts in practice many more wiles and stratagems and hides himself under a greater variety of shapes and appearances all of which are severally detected to the great delight and surprize of the reader  we may likewise observe with how much art the poet has varied several characters of the persons that speak to his infernal assembly on the contrary how has he represented the whole godhead exerting it self towards man in its full benevolence under the threefold distinction of a creator a redeemer and a comforter  nor must we omit the person of raphael who amidst his tenderness and friendship for man shews such a dignity and condescension in all his speech and behaviour as are suitable to a superior nature the angels are indeed as much diversified in milton and distinguished by their proper parts as the gods are in homer or virgil the reader will find nothing ascribed to uriel gabriel michael or raphael which is not in a particular manner suitable to their respective characters  there is another circumstance in the principal actors of the iliad and æneid which gives a peculiar    beauty to those two poems and was therefore contrived with very great judgment i mean the authors having chosen for their heroes persons who were so nearly related to the people for whom they wrote achilles was a greek and æneas the remote founder of rome by this means their countrymen whom they principally proposed to themselves for their readers were particularly attentive to all the parts of their story and sympathized with their heroes in all their adventures a roman could not but rejoice in the escapes successes and victories of æneas and be grieved at any defeats misfortunes or disappointments that befel him as a greek must have had the same regard for achilles and it is plain that each of those poems have lost this great advantage among those readers to whom their heroes are as strangers or indifferent persons  miltons poem is admirable in this respect since it is impossible for any of its readers whatever nation country or people he may belong to not to be related to the persons who are the principal actors in it but what is still infinitely more to its advantage the principal actors in this poem are not only our progenitors but our representatives we have an actual interest in every thing they do and no less than our utmost happiness is concerned and lies at stake in all their behaviour  i shall subjoin as a corollary to the foregoing remark an admirable observation out of aristotle which hath been very much misrepresented in the quotations of some modern criticks    if a man of perfect and consummate virtue falls into a misfortune it   raises our pity but not our terror because we do not fear that it   may be our own case who do not resemble the suffering person but as   that great philosopher adds if we see a man of virtue mixt with   infirmities fall into any misfortune it does not only raise our pity   but our terror because we are afraid that the like misfortunes may   happen to our selves who resemble the character of the suffering   person  i shall take another opportunity to observe that a person of an absolute and consummate virtue should never be introduced in tragedy and shall only remark in this place that the foregoing observation of aristotle    tho it may be true in other occasions does not hold in this because in the present case though the persons who fall into misfortune are of the most perfect and consummate virtue it is not to be considered as what may possibly be but what actually is our own case since we are embarked with them on the same bottom and must be partakers of their happiness or misery  in this and some other very few instances aristotles rules for epic poetry which he had drawn from his reflections upon homer cannot be supposed to quadrate exactly with the heroic poems which have been made since his time since it is plain his rules would still have been    more perfect could he have perused the æneid which was made some hundred years after his death  in my next i shall go through other parts of miltons poem and hope that what i shall there advance as well as what i have already written will not only serve as a comment upon milton but upon aristotle  l    footnote   these are what aristotle means by the fable and c   footnote   offspring   footnote   son of aurora who has   footnote   that his poem   footnote   it was especially for the novelty of paradise lost that john dennis had in   0  exalted milton above the ancients in putting forward a prospectus of a large projected work upon the grounds of criticism in poetry he gave as a specimen of the character of his work the substance of what would be said in the beginning of the criticism upon milton here he gave milton supremacy on ground precisely opposite to that chosen by addison he described him as    one of the greatest and most daring geniuss that has appeard in the   world and who has made his country a glorious present of the most   lofty but most irregular poem that has been producd by the mind of   man that great man had a desire to give the world something like an   epick poem but he resolvd at the same time to break thro the rules   of aristotle not that he was ignorant of them or contemned them   milton was the first who in the space of almost  000 years resolvd   for his countrys honour and his own to present the world with an   original poem that is to say a poem that should have his own   thoughts his own images and his own spirit in order to this he was   resolved to write a poem that by virtue of its extraordinary   subject cannot so properly be said to be against the rules as it may   be affirmed to be above them all  we shall now shew for what   reasons the choice of miltons subject as it set him free from the   obligation which he lay under to the poetical laws so it necessarily   threw him upon new thoughts new images and an original spirit in   the next place we shall shew that his thoughts his images and by   consequence too his spirit are actually new and different from those   of homer and virgil thirdly we shall shew that besides their   newness they have vastly the advantage of homer and virgil   footnote   paradise lost

steele      audire est operæ pretium procedere recte   qui moechis non vultis    hor    i have upon several occasions that have occurred since i first took into my thoughts the present state of fornication weighed with my self in behalf of guilty females the impulses of flesh and blood together with the arts and gallantries of crafty men and reflect with some scorn that most part of what we in our youth think gay and polite is nothing else but an habit of indulging a pruriency that way it will cost some labour to bring people to so lively a sense of this as to recover the manly modesty in the behaviour of my men readers and the bashful grace in the faces of my women but in all cases which come into debate there are certain things previously to be done before we can have a true light into the subject matter therefore it will in the first place be necessary to consider the impotent wenchers and industrious haggs who are supplied with and are constantly supplying new sacrifices to the devil of lust you are to know then if you are so happy as not to know it already that the great havock which is made in the habitations of beauty and innocence is committed by such as can only lay waste and not enjoy the soil when you observe the present state of vice and virtue the offenders are such as one would think should have no impulse to what they are pursuing as in business you see sometimes fools pretend to be knaves so in pleasure you will find old men set up for wenchers this latter sort of men are the great basis and fund of iniquity in the kind we are speaking of you shall have an old rich man often receive scrawls from the several quarters of the town with descriptions of the new wares in their hands if he will please to send word when he will be waited on this interview is contrived and the innocent is brought to such indecencies as from time to time banish shame and raise desire with these preparatives the haggs break their wards by little and little till they are brought to lose all apprehensions of what shall befall them in the possession of younger men it is a common postscript of an hagg to a young fellow whom she invites to a new woman she has i assure you seen none but old mr suchaone it pleases the old fellow that the nymph is brought to him unadorned and from his bounty she is accommodated with enough to dress her for other lovers this is the most ordinary method of bringing beauty and poverty into the possession of the town but the particular cases of kind keepers skilful pimps and all others who drive a separate trade and are not in the general society or commerce of sin will require distinct consideration at the same time that we are thus severe on the abandoned we are apt to represent the case of others with that mitigation as the circumstances demand calling names does no good to speak worse of any thing than it deserves does only take off from the credit of the accuser and has implicitly the force of an apology in the behalf of the person accused we shall therefore according as the circumstances differ vary our appellations of these criminals those who offend only against themselves and are not scandals to society but out of deference to the sober part of the world have so much good left in them as to be ashamed must not be huddled in the common word due to the worst of women but regard is to be had to their circumstances when they fell to the uneasy perplexity under which they lived under senseless and severe parents to the importunity of poverty to the violence of a passion in its beginning well grounded and all other alleviations which make unhappy women resign the characteristick of their sex modesty to do otherwise than thus would be to act like a pedantick stoick who thinks all crimes alike and not like an impartial spectator who looks upon them with all the circumstances that diminish or enhance the guilt i am in hopes if this subject be well pursued women will hereafter from their infancy be treated with an eye to their future state in the world and not have their tempers made too untractable from an improper sourness or pride or too complying from familiarity or forwardness contracted at their own houses after these hints on this subject i shall end this paper with the following genuine letter and desire all who think they may be concerned in future speculations on this subject to send in what they have to say for themselves for some incidents in their lives in order to have proper allowances made for their conduct     mr spectator january

one is obliged   to furnish you with what lights he can to expose the pernicious arts   and practices of those unnatural women called bawds in order to this   the enclosed is sent you which is verbatim the copy of a letter   written by a bawd of figure in this town to a noble lord i have   concealed the names of both my intention being not to expose the   persons but the thing   i am   sir   your humble servant       my lord     i having a great esteem for your honour and a better opinion of     you than of any of the quality makes me acquaint you of an affair     that i hope will oblige you to know i have a niece that came to     town about a fortnight ago her parents being lately dead she came     to me expecting to a found me in so good a condition as to a set     her up in a milliners shop her father gave fourscore pounds with     her for five years her time is out and she is not sixteen as     pretty a black gentlewoman as ever you saw a little woman which i     know your lordship likes well shaped and as fine a complection for     red and white as ever i saw i doubt not but your lordship will be     of the same opinion she designs to go down about a month hence     except i can provide for her which i cannot at present her father     was one with whom all he had died with him so there is four     children left destitute so if your lordship thinks fit to make an     appointment where i shall wait on you with my niece by a line or     two i stay for your answer for i have no place fitted up since i     left my house fit to entertain your honour i told her she should     go with me to see a gentleman a very good friend of mine so i     desire you to take no notice of my letter by reason she is ignorant     of the ways of the town my lord i desire if you meet us to come     alone for upon my word and honour you are the first that ever i     mentioned her to so i remain      your lordships     most humble servant to command      i beg of you to burn it

in an assembly of virtuosos where one of them produced many curious observations which he had lately made in the anatomy of an human body another of the company communicated to us several wonderful discoveries which he had also made on the same subject by the help of very fine glasses this gave birth to a great variety of uncommon remarks and furnished discourse for the remaining part of the day  the different opinions which were started on this occasion presented to my imagination so many new ideas that by mixing with those which were already there they employed my fancy all the last night and composed a very wild extravagant dream  i was invited methoughts to the dissection of a beaus head and of a coquets heart which were both of them laid on a table before us an imaginary operator opened the first with a great deal of nicety which upon a cursory and superficial view appeared like the head of another man but upon applying our glasses to it we made a very odd discovery namely that what we looked upon as brains were not such in reality but an heap of strange materials wound up in that shape and texture and packed together with wonderful art in the several cavities of the skull for as homer tells us that the blood of the gods is not real blood but only something like it so we found that the brain of a beau is not real brain but only something like it  the pineal gland which many of our modern philosophers suppose to be the seat of the soul smelt very strong of essence and orangeflower water and was encompassed with a kind of horny substance cut into a thousand little faces or mirrours which were imperceptible to the naked eye insomuch that the soul if there had been any here must have been always taken up in contemplating her own beauties  we observed a long antrum or cavity in the sinciput that was filled with ribbons lace and embroidery wrought together in a most curious piece of network the parts of which were likewise imperceptible to the naked eye another of these antrums or cavities was stuffed with invisible billetdoux loveletters pricked dances and other trumpery of the same nature in another we found a kind of powder which set the whole company a sneezing and by the scent discovered it self to be right spanish the several other cells were stored with commodities of the same kind of which it would be tedious to give the reader an exact inventory  there was a large cavity on each side of the head which i must not omit that on the right side was filled with fictions flatteries and falshoods vows promises and protestations that on the left with oaths and imprecations there issued out a duct from each of these cells which ran into the root of the tongue where both joined together and passed forward in one common duct to the tip of it we discovered several little roads or canals running from the ear into the brain and took particular care to trace them out through their several passages one of them extended itself to a bundle of sonnets and little musical instruments others ended in several bladders which were filled either with wind or froth but the latter canal entered into a great cavity of the skull from whence there went another canal into the tongue this great cavity was filled with a kind of spongy substance which the french anatomists call galimatias and the english nonsense  the skins of the forehead were extremely tough and thick and what very much surprized us had not in them any single bloodvessel that we were able to discover either with or without our glasses from whence we concluded that the party when alive must have been entirely deprived of the faculty of blushing  the os cribriforme was exceedingly stuffed and in some places damaged with snuff we could not but take notice in particular of that small muscle which is not often discovered in dissections and draws the nose upwards when it expresses the contempt which the owner of it has upon seeing any thing he does not like or hearing any thing he does not understand i need not tell my learned reader this is that muscle which performs the motion so often mentioned by the latin poets when they talk of a mans cocking his nose or playing the rhinoceros  we did not find any thing very remarkable in the eye saving only that the musculi amatorii or as we may translate it into english the ogling muscles were very much worn and decayed with use whereas on the contrary the elevator or the muscle which turns the eye towards heaven did not appear to have been used at all  i have only mentioned in this dissection such new discoveries as we were able to make and have not taken any notice of those parts which are to be met with in common heads as for the skull the face and indeed the whole outward shape and figure of the head we could not discover any difference from what we observe in the heads of other men we were informed that the person to whom this head belonged had passed for a man above five and thirty years during which time he eat and drank like other people dressed well talked loud laught frequently and on particular occasions had acquitted himself tolerably at a ball or an assembly to which one of the company added that a certain knot of ladies took him for a wit he was cut off in the flower of his age by the blow of a paringshovel having been surprized by an eminent citizen as he was tendring some civilities to his wife  when we had thoroughly examined this head with all its apartments and its several kinds of furniture we put up the brain such as it was into its proper place and laid it aside under a broad piece of scarlet cloth in order to be prepared and kept in a great repository of dissections our operator telling us that the preparation would not be so difficult as that of another brain for that he had observed several of the little pipes and tubes which ran through the brain were already filled with a kind of mercurial substance which he looked upon to be true quicksilver  he applied himself in the next place to the coquets heart which he likewise laid open with great dexterity there occurred to us many particularities in this dissection but being unwilling to burden my readers memory too much i shall reserve this subject for the speculation of another day  l                                        no                    wednesday january                     steele      errori nomen virtus posuisset honestum    hor      mr spectator    i hope you have philosophy enough to be capable of bearing the mention   of your faults your papers which regard the fallen part of the fair   sex are i think written with an indelicacy which makes them   unworthy to be inserted in the writings of a moralist who knows the   world i cannot allow that you are at liberty to observe upon the   actions of mankind with the freedom which you seem to resolve upon at   least if you do you should take along with you the distinction of   manners of the world according to the quality and way of life of the   persons concerned a man of breeding speaks of even misfortune among   ladies without giving it the most terrible aspect it can bear and   this tenderness towards them is much more to be preserved when you   speak of vices all mankind are so far related that care is to be   taken in things to which all are liable you do not mention what   concerns one in terms which shall disgust another thus to tell a rich   man of the indigence of a kinsman of his or abruptly inform a   virtuous woman of the lapse of one who till then was in the same   degree of esteem with her self is in a kind involving each of them in   some participation of those disadvantages it is therefore expected   from every writer to treat his argument in such a manner as is most   proper to entertain the sort of readers to whom his discourse is   directed it is not necessary when you write to the teatable that   you should draw vices which carry all the horror of shame and   contempt if you paint an impertinent selflove an artful glance an   assumed complection you say all which you ought to suppose they can   possibly be guilty of when you talk with this limitation you behave   your self so as that you may expect others in conversation may second   your raillery but when you do it in a stile which every body else   forbears in respect to their quality they have an easy remedy in   forbearing to read you and hearing no more of their faults a man   that is now and then guilty of an intemperance is not to be called a   drunkard but the rule of polite raillery is to speak of a mans   faults as if you loved him of this nature is what was said by   cæsar when one was railing with an uncourtly vehemence and broke   out what must we call him who was taken in an intrigue with another   mans wife cæsar answered very gravely a careless fellow this was   at once a reprimand for speaking of a crime which in those days had   not the abhorrence attending it as it ought as well as an intimation   that all intemperate behaviour before superiors loses its aim by   accusing in a method unfit for the audience a word to the wise all i   mean here to say to you is that the most free person of quality can   go no further than being a kind   woman and you should never say   of a man of figure worse than that he knows the world    i am sir   your most humble servant   francis courtly     mr spectator   i am a woman of an unspotted reputation and know nothing i have ever   done which should encourage such insolence but here was one the other   day and he was dressed like a

yore when all   dominion ended with the day and males and females met helter skelter   and the scowrers drove before them all who pretended to keep up order   or rule to the interruption of love and honour this is his way of   talk for he is very gay when he visits me but as his former   knowledge of the town has alarmed him into an invincible jealousy he   keeps me in a pair of slippers neat bodice warm petticoats and my   own hair woven in ringlets after a manner he says he remembers i   am not mistress of one farthing of money but have all necessaries   provided for me under the guard of one who procured for him while he   had any desires to gratify i know nothing of a wenchs life but the   reputation of it i have a natural voice and a pretty untaught step   in dancing his manner is to bring an old fellow who has been his   servant from his youth and is grayheaded this man makes on the   violin a certain jiggish noise to which i dance and when that is over   i sing to him some loose air that has more wantonness than musick in   it you must have seen a strange windowd house near hidepark   which is so built that no one can look out of any of the apartments   my rooms are after that manner and i never see man woman or child   but in company with the two persons abovementioned he sends me in   all the books pamphlets plays operas and songs that come out and   his utmost delight in me as a woman is to talk over old amours in my   presence to play with my neck say the time was give me a kiss   and bid me be sure to follow the directions of my guardian the   abovementioned lady and i shall never want the truth of my case is   i suppose that i was educated for a purpose he did not know he should   be unfit for when i came to years now sir what i ask of you as a   casuist is to tell me how far in these circumstances i am innocent   though submissive he guilty though impotent   i am   sir   your constant reader   pucella     to the man called the

morals of this our babylon   i gave credit to thy fair speeches and admitted one of thy papers   every day save sunday into my house for the edification of my   daughter tabitha and to the end that susannah the wife of my bosom   might profit thereby but alas my friend i find that thou art a   liar and that the truth is not in thee else why didst thou in a   paper which thou didst lately put forth make mention of those vain   coverings for the heads of our females which thou lovest to liken   unto tulips and which are lately sprung up amongst us nay why didst   thou make mention of them in such a seeming as if thou didst approve   the invention insomuch that my daughter tabitha beginneth to wax   wanton and to lust after these foolish vanities surely thou dost see   with the eyes of the flesh verily therefore unless thou dost   speedily amend and leave off following thine own imaginations i will   leave off thee    thy friend as hereafter thou dost demean thyself   hezekiah

not inform the polite part of my readers that before our correspondence with france was unhappily interrupted by the war our ladies had all their fashions from thence which the milliners took care to furnish them with by means of a jointed baby that came regularly over once a month habited after the manner of the most eminent toasts in paris  i am credibly informed that even in the hottest time of the war the sex made several efforts and raised large contributions towards the importation of this wooden madamoiselle  whether the vessel they set out was lost or taken or whether its cargo was seized on by the officers of the customhouse as a piece of contraband goods i have not yet been able to learn it is however certain their first attempts were without success to the no small disappointment of our whole female world but as their constancy and application in a matter of so great importance can never be sufficiently commended i am glad to find that in spight of all opposition they have at length carried their point of which i received advice by the two following letters     mr spectator   i am so great a lover of whatever is french that i lately   discarded an humble admirer because he neither spoke that tongue nor   drank claret i have long bewailed in secret the calamities of my   sex during the war in all which time we have laboured under the   insupportable inventions of english tirewomen who tho they   sometimes copy indifferently well can never compose with that goút   they do in france    i was almost in despair of ever more seeing a model from that dear   country when last sunday i overheard a lady in the next pew to me   whisper another that at the seven stars in kingstreet   coventgarden there was a madamoiselle compleatly dressed just   come from paris    i was in the utmost impatience during the remaining part of the   service and as soon as ever it was over having learnt the milleners   addresse i went directly to her house in kingstreet but was   told that the french lady was at a person of qualitys in   pallmall and would not be back again till very late that night i   was therefore obliged to renew my visit very early this morning and   had then a full view of the dear moppet from head to foot    you cannot imagine worthy sir how ridiculously i find we have all   been trussed up during the war and how infinitely the french dress   excels ours    the mantua has no leads in the sleeves and i hope we are not lighter   than the french ladies so as to want that kind of ballast the   petticoat has no whalebone but fits with an air altogether galant   and degagé the coiffeure is inexpressibly pretty and in short   the whole dress has a thousand beauties in it which i would not have   as yet made too publick    i thought fit however to give this notice that you may not be   surprized at my appearing à la mode de paris on the next   birthnight i am sir   your humble servant   teraminta   within an hour after i had read this letter i received another from the owner of the puppet    sir   on saturday last being the   th instant there arrived at my house   in kingstreet coventgarden a french baby for the year      i   have taken the utmost care to have her dressed by the most celebrated   tyrewomen and mantuamakers in paris and do not find that i have   any reason to be sorry for the expence i have been at in her cloaths   and importation however as i know no person who is so good a judge   of dress as your self if you please to call at my house in your way   to the city and take a view of her i promise to amend whatever you   shall disapprove in your next paper before i exhibit her as a pattern   to the publick   i am sir   your most humble admirer   and most obedient servant   betty crossstitch   as i am willing to do any thing in reason for the service of my countrywomen and had much rather prevent faults than find them i went last night to the house of the abovementioned mrs crossstitch as soon as i enterd the maid of the shop who i suppose was prepared for my coming without asking me any questions introduced me to the little damsel and ran away to call her mistress  the puppet was dressed in a cherrycoloured gown and petticoat with a short working apron over it which discovered her shape to the most advantage her hair was cut and divided very prettily with several ribbons stuck up and down in it the millener assured me that her complexion was such as was worn by all the ladies of the best fashion in paris her head was extreamly high on which subject having long since declared my sentiments i shall say nothing more to it at present i was also offended at a small patch she wore on her breast which i cannot suppose is placed there with any good design  her necklace was of an immoderate length being tied before in such a manner that the two ends hung down to her girdle but whether these supply the place of kissingstrings in our enemys country and whether our british ladies have any occasion for them i shall leave to their serious consideration  after having observed the particulars of her dress as i was taking a view of it altogether the shopmaid who is a pert wench told me that mademoiselle had something very curious in the tying of her garters but as i pay a due respect even to a pair of sticks when they are in petticoats i did not examine into that particular  upon the whole i was well enough pleased with the appearance of this gay lady and the more so because she was not talkative a quality very rarely to be met with in the rest of her countrywomen  as i was taking my leave the millener farther informed me that with the assistance of a watchmaker who was her neighbour and the ingenious mr powell she had also contrived another puppet which by the help of several little springs to be wound up within it could move all its limbs and that she had sent it over to her correspondent in paris to be taught the various leanings and bendings of the head the risings of the bosom the curtesy and recovery the genteel trip and the agreeable jet as they are now practised in the court of france  she added that she hoped she might depend upon having my encouragement as soon as it arrived but as this was a petition of too great importance to be answered extempore i left her without a reply and made the best of my way to will honeycombs lodgings without whose advice i never communicate any thing to the publick of this nature  x                                               no                   friday

disorders of families and several wives having   preferred your advice and directions to those of their husbands   emboldens me to apply to you at this time i am a shopkeeper and tho   but a young man i find by experience that nothing but the utmost   diligence both of husband and wife among trading people can keep   affairs in any tolerable order my wife at the beginning of our   establishment shewed her self very assisting to me in my business as   much as could lie in her way and i have reason to believe twas with   her inclination but of late she has got acquainted with a schoolman   who values himself for his great knowledge in the greek tongue he   entertains her frequently in the shop with discourses of the beauties   and excellencies of that language and repeats to her several passages   out of the greek poets wherein he tells her there is unspeakable   harmony and agreeable sounds that all other languages are wholly   unacquainted with he has so infatuated her with his jargon that   instead of using her former diligence in the shop she now neglects   the affairs of the house and is wholly taken up with her tutor in   learning by heart scraps of greek which she vents upon all   occasions she told me some days ago that whereas i use some latin   inscriptions in my shop she advised me with a great deal of concern   to have them changed into greek it being a language less   understood would be more conformable to the mystery of my profession   that our good friend would be assisting to us in this work and that a   certain faculty of gentlemen would find themselves so much obliged to   me that they would infallibly make my fortune in short her frequent   importunities upon this and other impertinences of the like nature   make me very uneasy and if your remonstrances have no more effect   upon her than mine i am afraid i shall be obliged to ruin my self to   procure her a settlement at oxford with her tutor for shes already   too mad for bedlam now sir you see the danger my family is   exposed to and the likelihood of my wifes becoming both troublesome   and useless unless her reading her self in your paper may make her   reflect she is so very learned that i cannot pretend by word of mouth   to argue with her she laughed out at your ending a paper in greek   and said twas a hint to women of literature and very civil not to   translate it to expose them to the vulgar you see how it is with    sir   your humble servant      mr spectator   if you have that humanity and compassion in your nature that you take   such pains to make one think you have you will not deny your advice   to a distressed damsel who intends to be determined by your judgment   in a matter of great importance to her you must know then there is   an agreeable young fellow to whose person wit and humour no body   makes any objection that pretends to have been long in love with me   to this i must add whether it proceeds from the vanity of my nature   or the seeming sincerity of my lover i wont pretend to say that i   verily believe he has a real value for me which if true youll allow   may justly augment his merit for his mistress in short i am so   sensible of his good qualities and what i owe to his passion that i   think i could sooner resolve to give up my liberty to him than any   body else were there not an objection to be made to his fortunes in   regard they dont answer the utmost mine may expect and are not   sufficient to secure me from undergoing the reproachful phrase so   commonly used that she has played the fool now tho i am one of   those few who heartily despise equipage diamonds and a coxcomb yet   since such opposite notions from mine prevail in the world even   amongst the best and such as are esteemed the most prudent people i   cant find in my heart to resolve upon incurring the censure of those   wise folks which i am conscious i shall do if when i enter into a   married state i discover a thought beyond that of equalling if not   advancing my fortunes under this difficulty i now labour not being   in the least determined whether i shall be governed by the vain world   and the frequent examples i meet with or hearken to the voice of my   lover and the motions i find in my heart in favour of him sir your   opinion and advice in this affair is the only thing i know can turn   the ballance and which i earnestly intreat i may receive soon for   till i have your thoughts upon it i am engaged not to give my swain a   final discharge    besides the particular obligation you will lay on me by giving this   subject room in one of your papers tis possible it may be of use to   some others of my sex who will be as grateful for the favour as   sir   your humble servant   florinda    p s to tell you the truth i am married to him already but pray say   something to justify me      mr spectator   you will forgive us professors of musick if we make a second   application to you in order to promote our design of exhibiting   entertainments of musick in yorkbuildings it is industriously   insinuated that our intention is to destroy operas in general but we   beg of you to insert this plain explanation of our selves in your   paper our purpose is only to improve our circumstances by improving   the art which we profess we see it utterly destroyed at present and   as we were the persons who introduced operas we think it a groundless   imputation that we should set up against the opera in it self what we   pretend to assert is that the songs of different authors   injudiciously put together and a foreign tone and manner which are   expected in every thing now performed among us has put musick it self   to a stand insomuch that the ears of the people cannot now be   entertained with any thing but what has an impertinent gayety without   any just spirit or a languishment of notes without any passion or   common sense we hope those persons of sense and quality who have done   us the honour to subscribe will not be ashamed of their patronage   towards us and not receive impressions that patronising us is being   for or against the opera but truly promoting their own diversions in   a more just and elegant manner than has been hitherto performed we   are sir   your most humble servants   thomas clayton   nicolino haym   charles dieupart     there will be no

addison      reddere personæ scit convenientia cuique    hor    we have already taken a general survey of the fable and characters in miltons paradise lost the parts which remain to be considered according to aristotles method are the sentiments and the language    before i enter upon the first of these i must advertise my reader that it is my design as soon as i have finished my general reflections on these four several heads to give particular instances out of the poem which is now before us of beauties and imperfections which may be observed under each of them as also of such other particulars as may not properly fall under any of them this i thought fit to premise that the reader may not judge too hastily of this piece of criticism or look upon it as imperfect before he has seen the whole extent of it  the sentiments in an epic poem are the thoughts and behaviour which the author ascribes to the persons whom he introduces and are just when they are conformable to the characters of the several persons the sentiments have likewise a relation to things as well as persons and are then perfect when they are such as are adapted to the subject if in either of these cases the poet endeavours to argue or explain to magnify or diminish to raise   love or hatred pity or terror or any other passion we ought to consider whether the sentiments he makes use of are proper for those   ends homer is censured by the criticks for his defect as to this particular in several parts of the iliad and odyssey tho at the same time those who have treated this great poet with candour have attributed this defect to the times in which he lived   it was the fault of the age and not of homer if there wants that delicacy in some of his sentiments which now appears in the works of men of a much inferior genius besides if there are blemishes in any particular thoughts there is an infinite beauty in the greatest part of them in short if there are many poets who would not have fallen into the meanness of some of his sentiments there are none who could have risen up to the greatness of others virgil has excelled all others in the propriety of his sentiments milton shines likewise very much in this particular nor must we omit one consideration which adds to his honour and reputation homer and virgil introduced persons whose characters are commonly known among men and such as are to be met with either in history or in ordinary conversation miltons characters most of them lie out of nature and were to be formed purely by his own invention it shews a greater genius in shakespear to have drawn his calyban than his hotspur or julius cæsar the one was to be supplied out of his own imagination whereas the other might have been formed upon tradition history and observation it was much easier therefore for homer to find proper sentiments for an assembly of grecian generals than for milton to diversify his infernal council with proper characters and inspire them with a variety of sentiments the lovers of dido and aeneas are only copies of what has passed between other persons adam and eve before the fall are a different species from that of mankind who are descended from them and none but a poet of the most unbounded invention and the most exquisite judgment could have filled their conversation and behaviour with so many apt   circumstances during their state of innocence  nor is it sufficient for an epic poem to be filled with such thoughts as are natural unless it abound also with such as are sublime virgil in this particular falls short of homer he has not indeed so many thoughts that are low and vulgar but at the same time has not so many thoughts that are sublime and noble the truth of it is virgil seldom rises into very astonishing sentiments where he is not fired by the iliad he every where charms and pleases us by the force of his own genius but seldom elevates and transports us where he does not fetch his hints from homer  miltons chief talent and indeed his distinguishing excellence lies in the sublimity of his thoughts there are others of the moderns who rival him in every other part of poetry but in the greatness of his sentiments he triumphs over all the poets both modern and ancient homer only excepted it is impossible for the imagination of man to distend itself with greater ideas than those which he has laid together in his first second and sixth books the seventh which describes the creation of the world is likewise wonderfully sublime tho not so apt to stir up emotion in the mind of the reader nor consequently so perfect in the epic way of writing because it is filled with less action let the judicious reader compare what longinus has observed   on several passages in homer and he will find parallels for most of them in the paradise lost  from what has been said we may infer that as there are two kinds of sentiments the natural and the sublime which are always to be pursued in an heroic poem there are also two kinds of thoughts which are carefully to be avoided the first are such as are affected and unnatural the second such as are mean and vulgar as for the first kind of thoughts we meet with little or nothing that is like them in virgil he has none of those trifling   points and puerilities that are so often to be met with in ovid none of the epigrammatick turns of lucan none of those swelling sentiments which are so frequent in statins and claudian none of those mixed embellishments of tasso every thing is just and natural his sentiments shew that he had a perfect insight into human nature and that he knew every thing which was the most proper to affect it    mr dryden has in some places which i may hereafter take notice of misrepresented virgils way of thinking as to this particular in the translation he has given us of the aeneid i do not remember that homer any where falls into the faults abovementioned which were indeed the false refinements of later ages milton it must be confest has sometimes erred in this respect as i shall shew more at large in another paper tho considering how all the poets of the age in which he writ were infected with this wrong way of thinking he is rather to be admired that he did not give more into it than that he did sometimes comply with the vicious taste which still prevails so much among modern writers  but since several thoughts may be natural which are low and groveling an epic poet should not only avoid such sentiments as are unnatural or affected but also such as are mean   and vulgar homer has opened a great field of raillery to men of more delicacy than greatness of genius by the homeliness of some of his sentiments but as i have before said these are rather to be imputed to the simplicity of the age in which he lived to which i may also add of that which he described than to any imperfection in that divine poet zoilus  0 among the ancients and monsieur perrault    among the moderns pushed their ridicule very far upon him on account of some such sentiments there is no blemish to be observed in virgil under this head and but a very few in milton  i shall give but one instance of this impropriety of thought    in homer and at the same time compare it with an instance of the same nature both in virgil and milton sentiments which raise laughter can very seldom be admitted with any decency into an heroic poem whose business it is to excite passions of a much nobler nature homer however in his characters of vulcan    and thersites    in his story of mars and venus    in his behaviour of irus    and in other passages has been observed to have lapsed into the burlesque character and to have departed from that serious air which seems essential to the magnificence of an epic poem i remember but one laugh in the whole æneid which rises in the fifth book upon monætes where he is represented as thrown overboard and drying himself upon a rock but this piece of mirth is so well timed that the severest critick can have nothing to say against it for it is in the book of games and diversions where the readers mind may be supposed to be sufficiently relaxed for such an entertainment the only piece of pleasantry in paradise lost is where the evil spirits are described as rallying the angels upon the success of their new invented artillery this passage i look upon to be the most exceptionable in the whole poem as being nothing else but a string of punns and those too very indifferent ones   satan beheld their plight   and to his mates thus in derision calld   o friends why come not on those victors proud   erewhile they fierce were coming and when we   to entertain them fair with open front   and breast what could we more propounded terms   of composition straight they changd their minds   flew off and into strange vagaries fell   as they would dance yet for a dance they seemd   somewhat extravagant and wild perhaps   for joy of offerd peace but i suppose   if our proposals once again were heard   we should compel them to a quick result    to whom thus belial in like gamesome mood   leader the terms we sent were terms of weight   of hard contents and full of force urgd home   such as we might perceive amusd them all   and stumbled many who receives them right   had need from head to foot will understand   not understood this gift they

one country is not   always so in others we are apt to smile at homers comparing ajax to   an ass in his iliad such a comparison nowadays would be indecent   and ridiculous because it would be indecent and ridiculous for a   person of quality to ride upon such a steed but heretofore this   animal was in better repute kings and princes did not disdain the   best so much as mere tradesman do in our time tis just the same with   many other smiles which in homers time were allowable we should now   pity a poet that should be so silly and ridiculous as to compare a   hero to a piece of fat

desire of pleasing makes a man agreeable or unwelcome to those with whom he converses according to the motive from which that inclination appears to flow if your concern for pleasing others arises from innate benevolence it never fails of success if from a vanity to excel its disappointment is no less certain what we call an agreeable man is he who is endowed with the   natural bent to do acceptable things from a delight he takes in them meerly as such and the affectation of that character is what constitutes a fop under these leaders one may draw up all those who make any manner of figure except in dumb show a rational and select conversation is composed of persons who have the talent of pleasing with delicacy of sentiments flowing from habitual chastity of thought but mixed company is frequently made up of pretenders to mirth and is usually pestered with constrained obscene and painful witticisms now and then you meet with a man so exactly formed for pleasing that it is no matter what he is doing or saying that is to say that there need no manner of importance in it to make him gain upon every body who hears or beholds him this felicity is not the gift of nature only but must be attended with happy circumstances which add a dignity to the familiar behaviour which distinguishes him whom we call an agreeable man it is from this that every body loves and esteems polycarpus he is in the vigour of his age and the gayety of life but has passed through very conspicuous scenes in it though no soldier he has shared the danger and acted with great gallantry and generosity on a decisive day of battle to have those qualities which only make other men conspicuous in the world as it were supernumerary to him is a circumstance which gives weight to his most indifferent actions for as a known credit is ready cash to a trader so is acknowledged merit immediate distinction and serves in the place of equipage to a gentleman this renders polycarpus graceful

general rules of good behaviour is the life of a slave a parasite differs in nothing from the meanest servant but that the footman hires himself for bodily labour subjected to go and come at the will

grievous than that of wearing his livery therefore we will speak of those methods only which are worthy and ingenuous  the happy talent of pleasing either those above you or below you seems to be

pleasure of such an equal company as could wholly exclude the regard of fortune in their conversations horace in the discourse from whence i take the hint of the present speculation lays down excellent rules for conduct in conversation with men of power but he speaks it with an air of one who had no need of such an application for any thing which related to himself it shews he understood what it was to be a skilful courtier by just admonitions against importunity and shewing how forcible it was to speak modestly of your own wants there is indeed something so shameless in taking all opportunities to speak of your own affairs that he who is guilty of it towards him upon whom he depends fares like the beggar who exposes his sores which instead of moving compassion makes the man he begs of turn away from the object  i cannot tell what is become of him but i remember about sixteen years ago an honest fellow who so justly understood how disagreeable the mention or appearance of his wants would make him that i have often reflected upon him as a counterpart of irus whom i have formerly mentioned this man whom i have missed for some years in my walks and have heard was someway employed about the army made it a maxim that good wigs delicate linen and a chearful air were to a poor dependent the same that working tools are to a poor artificer it was no small entertainment to me who knew his circumstances to see him who had fasted two days attribute the thinness they told him of to the violence of some gallantries he had lately been guilty of the skilful dissembler carried this on with the utmost address and if any suspected his affairs were narrow it was attributed to indulging himself in some fashionable vice rather than an irreproachable poverty which saved his credit with those on whom he depended  the main art is to be as little troublesome as you can and make all you hope for come rather as a favour from your patron than claim from you but i am here prating of what is the method of pleasing so as to succeed in the world when there are crowds who have in city town court and country arrived at considerable acquisitions and yet seem incapable of acting in any constant tenour of life but have gone on from one successful error to another therefore i think i may shorten this enquiry after the method of pleasing and as the old beau said to his son once for all pray jack be a fine gentleman so may i to my reader abridge my instructions and finish the art of pleasing in a word be rich  t    footnote   that

with the several discoveries made on that occasion i shall here according to my promise enter upon the dissection of a coquets heart and communicate to the public such particularities as we observed in that curious piece of anatomy  i should perhaps have waved this undertaking had not i been put in mind of my promise by several of my unknown correspondents who are very importunate with me to make an example of the coquet as i have already done of the beau it is therefore in compliance with the request of friends that i have looked over the minutes of my former dream in order to give the publick an exact relation to it which i shall enter upon without further preface  our operator before he engaged in this visionary dissection told us that there was nothing in his art more difficult than to lay open the heart of a coquet by reason of the many labyrinths and recesses which are to be found in it and which do not appear in the heart of any other animal  he desired us first of all to observe the pericardium or outward case of the heart which we did very attentively and by the help of our glasses discernd in it millions of little scars which seemd to have been occasioned by the points of innumerable darts and arrows that from time to time had glanced upon the outward coat though we could not discover the smallest orifice by which any of them had entered and pierced the inward substance  every smatterer in anatomy knows that this pericardium or case of the heart contains in it a thin reddish liquor supposed to be bred from the vapours which exhale out of the heart and being stopt here are condensed into this watry substance upon examining this liquor we found that it had in it all the qualities of that spirit which is made use of in the thermometer to shew the change of weather  nor must i here omit an experiment one of the company assured us he himself had made with this liquor which he found in great quantity about the heart of a coquet whom he had formerly dissected he affirmed to us that he had actually inclosed it in a small tube made after the manner of a weather glass but that instead of acquainting him with the variations of the atmosphere it shewed him the qualities of those persons who entered the room where it stood he affirmed also that it rose at the approach of a plume of feathers an embroidered coat or a pair of fringed gloves and that it fell as soon as an illshaped perriwig a clumsy pair of shoes or an unfashionable coat came into his house nay he proceeded so far as to assure us that upon his laughing aloud when he stood by it the liquor mounted very sensibly and immediately sunk again upon his looking serious in short he told us that he knew very well by this invention whenever he had a man of sense or a coxcomb in his room  having cleared away the pericardium or the case and liquor abovementioned we came to the heart itself the outward surface of it was extremely slippery and the mufro or point so very cold withal that upon endeavouring to take hold of it it glided through the fingers like a smooth piece of ice  the fibres were turned and twisted in a more intricate and perplexed manner than they are usually found in other hearts insomuch that the whole heart was wound up together in a gordian knot and must have had very irregular and unequal motions whilst it was employed in its vital function  one thing we thought very observable namely that upon examining all the vessels which came into it or issued out of it we could not discover any communication that it had with the tongue  we could not but take notice likewise that several of those little nerves in the heart which are affected by the sentiments of love hatred and other passions did not descend to this before us from the brain but from the muscles which lie about the eye  upon weighing the heart in my hand i found it to be extreamly light and consequently very hollow which i did not wonder at when upon looking into the inside of it i saw multitudes of cells and cavities running one within another as our historians describe the apartments of rosamonds bower several of these little hollows were stuffed with innumerable sorts of trifles which i shall forbear giving any particular account of and shall therefore only take notice of what lay first and uppermost which upon our unfolding it and applying our microscopes to it appeared to be a flamecoloured hood  we were informed that the lady of this heart when living received the addresses of several who made love to her and did not only give each of them encouragement but made every one she conversed with believe that she regarded him with an eye of kindness for which reason we expected to have seen the impression of multitudes of faces among the several plaits and foldings of the heart but to our great surprize not a single print of this nature discovered it self till we came into the very core and center of it we there observed a little figure which upon applying our glasses to it appeared dressed in a very fantastick manner the more i looked upon it the more i thought i had seen the face before but could not possibly recollect either the place or time when at length one of the company who had examined this figure more nicely than the rest shewd us plainly by the make of its face and the several turns of its features that the little idol which was thus lodged in the very middle of the heart was the deceased beau whose head i gave some account of in my last tuesdays paper  as soon as we had finished our dissection we resolved to make an experiment of the heart not being able to determine among our selves the nature of its substance which differd in so many particulars from that of the heart in other females accordingly we laid it into a pan of burning coals when we observed in it a certain salamandrine quality that made it capable of living in the midst of fire and flame without being consumed or so much as singed  as we were admiring this strange phoenomenon and standing round the heart in a circle it gave a most prodigious sigh or rather crack and dispersed all at once in smoke and vapour this imaginary noise which methought was louder than the burst of a cannon produced such a violent shake in my brain that it dissipated the fumes of sleep and left me in an instant broad awake  l

uttering sentences against the fickleness of fortune when people generally bring upon themselves all the calamities they fall into and are constantly heaping up matter for their own sorrow and disappointment that which produces the greatest part of the delusions   of mankind is a false hope which people indulge with so sanguine a flattery to themselves that their hearts are bent upon fantastical advantages which they had no reason to believe should ever have arrived to them by this unjust measure of calculating their happiness they often mourn with real affliction for imaginary losses when i am talking of this unhappy way of accounting for our selves i cannot but reflect upon a particular set of people who in their own favour resolve every thing that is possible into what is probable and then reckon on that probability as on what must certainly happen will honeycomb upon my observing his looking on a lady with some particular attention gave me an account of the great distresses which had laid waste that her very fine face and had given an air of melancholy to a very agreeable person that lady and a couple of sisters of hers were said will fourteen years ago the

passed their prime and got on the wrong side of thirty and must pass the remainder of their days upbraiding mankind that they mind nothing but money and bewailing that virtue sense and modesty are had at present in no manner of estimation  i mention this case of ladies before any other because it is the most irreparable for tho youth is the time less capable of reflection it is in that sex the only season in which they can advance their fortunes but if we turn our thoughts to the men we see such crowds of unhappy from no other reason but an illgrounded hope that it is hard to say which they rather deserve our pity or contempt it is not unpleasant to see a fellow after grown old in attendance and after having passed half a life in servitude call himself the unhappiest of all men and pretend to be disappointed because a courtier broke his word he that promises himself any thing but what may naturally arise from his own property or labour and goes beyond the desire of possessing above two parts in three even of that lays up for himself an encreasing heap of afflictions and disappointments there are but two means in the world of gaining by other men and these are by being either agreeable or considerable the generality of mankind do all things for their own sakes and when you hope any thing from persons above you if you cannot say i can be thus agreeable or thus serviceable it is ridiculous to pretend to the dignity of being unfortunate when they leave you you were injudicious in hoping for any other than to be neglected for such as can come within these descriptions of being capable to please or serve your patron when his humour or interests call for their capacity either way  it would not methinks be an useless comparison between the condition of a man who shuns all the pleasures of life and of one who makes it his business to pursue them hope in the recluse makes his austerities comfortable while the luxurious man gains nothing but uneasiness from his enjoyments what is the difference in the happiness of him who is macerated by abstinence and his who is surfeited with excess he who resigns the world has no temptation to envy hatred malice

pers    lucian   rallies the philosophers in his time who could not agree whether they should admit riches into the number of real goods the professors of the severer sects threw them quite out while others as resolutely inserted them  i am apt to believe that as the world grew more polite the rigid doctrines of the first were wholly discarded and i do not find any one so hardy at present as to deny that there are very great advantages in the enjoyment of a plentiful fortune indeed the best and wisest of men tho they may possibly despise a good part of those things which the world calls pleasures can i think hardly be insensible of that weight and dignity which a moderate share of wealth adds to their characters councils and actions  we find it is a general complaint in professions and trades that the richest members of them are chiefly encouraged and this is falsly imputed to the illnature of mankind who are ever bestowing their favours on such as least want them whereas if we fairly consider their proceedings in this case we shall find them founded on undoubted reason since supposing both equal in their natural integrity i ought in common prudence to fear foul play from an indigent person rather than from one whose circumstances seem to have placed him above the bare temptation of money  this reason also makes the commonwealth regard her richest subjects as those who are most concerned for her quiet and interest and consequently fittest to be intrusted with her highest imployments on the contrary catalines saying to those men of desperate fortunes who applied themselves to him and of whom he afterwards composed his army that they had nothing to hope for but a civil war was too true not to make the impressions he desired  i believe i need not fear but that what i have said in praise of money will be more than sufficient with most of my readers to excuse the subject of my present paper which i intend as an essay on the ways to raise a mans fortune or the art of growing rich  the first and most infallible method towards the attaining of this end is thrift all men are not equally qualified for getting money but it is in the power of every one alike to practise this virtue and i believe there are very few persons who if they please to reflect on their past lives will not find that had they saved all those little sums which they have spent unnecessarily they might at present have been masters of a competent fortune diligence justly claims the next place to thrift i find both these excellently well recommended to common use in the three following italian proverbs    never do that by proxy which you can do yourself   never defer that till tomorrow which you can do today   never neglect small matters and expences  a third instrument of growing rich is method in business which as well as the two former is also attainable by persons of the meanest capacities  the famous de wit one of the greatest statesmen of the age in which he lived being asked by a friend how he was able to dispatch that multitude of affairs in which he was engaged replyd that his whole art consisted in doing one thing at once if says he i have any necessary dispatches to make i think of nothing else till those are finished if any domestick affairs require my attention i give myself up wholly to them till they are set in order  in short we often see men of dull and phlegmatick tempers arriving to great estates by making a regular and orderly disposition of their business and that without it the greatest parts and most lively imaginations rather puzzle their affairs than bring them to an happy issue  from what has been said i think i may lay it down as a maxim that every man of good common sense may if he pleases in his particular station of life most certainly be rich the reason why we sometimes see that men of the greatest capacities are not so is either because they despise wealth in comparison of something else or at least are not content to be getting an estate unless they may do it their own way and at the same time enjoy all the pleasures and gratifications of life  but besides these ordinary forms of growing rich it must be allowed that there is room for genius as well in this as in all other circumstances of life  tho the ways of getting money were long since very numerous and tho so many new ones have been found out of late years there is certainly still remaining so large a field for invention that a man of an indifferent head might easily sit down and draw up such a plan for the conduct and support of his life as was never yet once thought of  we daily see methods put in practice by hungry and ingenious men which demonstrate the power of invention in this particular  it is reported of scaramouch the first famous italian comedian that being at paris and in great want he bethought himself of constantly plying near the door of a noted perfumer in that city and when any one came out who had been buying snuff never failed to desire a taste of them when he had by this means got together a quantity made up of several different sorts he sold it again at a lower rate to the same perfumer who finding out the trick called it tabac de mille fleures or snuff of a thousand flowers the story farther tells us that by this means he got a very comfortable subsistence till making too much haste to grow rich he one day took such an unreasonable pinch out of the box of a swiss officer as engaged him in a quarrel and obliged him to quit this ingenious way of life  nor can i in this place omit doing justice to a youth of my own country who tho he is scarce yet twelve years old has with great industry and application attained to the art of beating the grenadiers march on his chin i am credibly informed that by this means he does not only maintain himself and his mother but that he is laying up money every day with a design if the war continues to purchase a drum at least if not a colours  i shall conclude these instances with the device of the famous rabelais when he was at a great distance from paris and without money to bear his expences thither this ingenious author being thus sharp set got together a convenient quantity of brickdust and having disposed of it into several papers writ upon one poyson for monsieur upon a second poyson for the dauphin and on a third poyson for the king having made this provision for the royal family of france he laid his papers so that his landlord who was an inquisitive man and a good subject might get a sight of them  the plot succeeded as he desired the host gave immediate intelligence to the secretary of state the secretary presently sent down a special messenger who brought up the traitor to court and provided him at the kings expence with proper accommodations on the road as soon as he appeared he was known to be the celebrated rabelais and his powder upon examination being found very innocent the jest was only laught at for which a less eminent drole would have been sent to the gallies  trade and commerce might doubtless be still varied a thousand ways out of which would arise such branches as have not yet been touched the famous doily is still fresh in every ones memory who raised a fortune by finding out materials for such stuffs as might at once be cheap and genteel i have heard it affirmed that had not he discovered this frugal method of gratifying our pride we should hardly have been able  to carry on the last war  i regard trade not only as highly advantageous to the commonwealth in general but as the most natural and likely method of making a mans fortune having observed since my being a spectator in the world greater estates got about change than at whitehall or at st jamess i believe i may also add that the first acquisitions are generally attended with more satisfaction and as good a conscience  i must not however close this essay without observing that what has been said is only intended for persons in the common ways of thriving and is not designed for those men who from low beginnings push themselves up to the top of states and the most considerable figures in life my maxim of saving is not designed for such as these since nothing is more usual than for thrift to disappoint the ends of ambition it being almost impossible that the mind should be   intent upon trifles while it is at the same time forming some great design  i may therefore compare these men to a great poet who as longinus says while he is full of the most magnificent ideas is not always at leisure to mind the little beauties and niceties of his art  i would however have all my readers take great care how they mistake themselves for uncommon geniuss and men above rule since it is very easy for them to be deceived in this particular  x    footnote   in his auction of philosophers   footnote   able so well   footnote   descend to and be                                               no

professed maxim with these people never to think there is something so solemn in reflexion they forsooth can never give themselves time for such a way of employing themselves it happens often that this sort of man is heavy enough in his nature to be a good proficient in such matters as are attainable by industry but alas he has such an ardent desire to be what he is not to be too volatile to have the faults of a person of spirit that he professes himself the most unfit man living for any manner of application when this humour enters into the head of a female she gently professes sickness upon all occasions and acts all things with an indisposed air she is offended but her mind is too lazy to raise her to anger therefore she lives only as actuated by a violent spleen and gentle scorn she has hardly curiosity to listen to scandal of her acquaintance and has never attention enough to hear them commended this affectation in both sexes makes them vain of being useless and take a certain pride in their insignificancy  opposite to this folly is another no less unreasonable and that is the impertinence of being always in a hurry there are those who visit ladies and beg pardon afore they are well seated in their chairs that they just called in but are obliged to attend business of importance elsewhere the very next moment thus they run from place to place professing that they are obliged to be still in another company than that which they are in these persons who are just a going somewhere else should never be detained let   all the world allow that business is to be

freedom of conversation i have hardly seen a line from any of these gentlemen but spoke them as absent from what they were doing as they profess they are when they come into company for the folly is

smile and curtsy to one at the lower end of the church in   the midst of a gloria patri and when i have spoke the assent to a   prayer with a long amen uttered with decent gravity she has been   rolling her eyes around about in such a manner as plainly shewed   however she was moved it was not towards an heavenly object in fine   she extended her conquests so far over the males and raised

world is very much divided upon milton as to this point i hope they will excuse me if i appear particular in any of my opinions and encline to those who judge the most advantageously of the author  it is requisite that the language of an heroic poem should be both perspicuous and sublime   in proportion as either of these two qualities are wanting the language is imperfect perspicuity is the first and most necessary qualification insomuch that a goodnaturd reader sometimes overlooks a little slip even in the grammar or syntax where it is impossible for him to mistake the poets sense of this kind is that passage in milton wherein he speaks of satan   god and his son except   created thing nought valud he nor shunnd  and that in which he describes adam and eve    adam the goodliest man of men since born   his sons the fairest of her daughters eve  it is plain that in the former of these passages according to the natural syntax the divine persons mentioned in the first line are represented as created beings and that in the other adam and eve are confounded with their sons and daughters such little blemishes as these when the thought is great and natural we should with horace   impute to a pardonable inadvertency or to the weakness of human nature which cannot attend to each minute particular and give the last finishing to every circumstance in so long a work the ancient criticks therefore who were acted by a spirit of candour rather than that of cavilling invented certain figures of speech on purpose to palliate little errors of this nature in the writings of those authors who had so many greater beauties to attone for them  if clearness and perspicuity were only to be consulted the poet would have nothing else to do but to cloath his thoughts in the most plain and natural expressions but since it often happens that the most obvious phrases and those which are used in ordinary conversation become too familiar to the ear and contract a kind of meanness by passing through the mouths of the vulgar a poet should take particular care to guard himself against idiomatick ways of speaking ovid and lucan have many poornesses of expression upon this account as taking up with the first phrases that offered without putting themselves to the trouble of looking after such as would not only have been natural but also elevated and sublime milton has but few failings in this kind of which however you may meet with some instances as   in the following passages    embrios and idiots eremites and fryars   white black and greywith all their trumpery   here pilgrims roam   a while discourse they hold   no fear lest dinner coolwhen thus began   our author    who of all ages to succeed but feeling   the evil on him brought by me will curse   my head ill fare our ancestor impure   for this we may thank adam  the great masters in composition knew very well that many an elegant phrase becomes improper for a poet or an orator when it has been debased by common use for this reason the works of ancient authors which are written in dead languages have a great advantage over those which are written in languages that are now spoken were there any mean phrases or idioms in virgil and homer they would not shock the ear of the most delicate modern reader so much as they would have done that of an old greek or roman because we never hear them pronounced in our streets or in ordinary conversation  it is not therefore sufficient that the language of an epic poem be perspicuous unless it be also sublime to this end it ought to deviate from the common forms and ordinary phrases of speech the judgment of a poet very much discovers it self in shunning the common roads of expression without falling into such ways of speech as may seem stiff and unnatural he must not swell into a false sublime by endeavouring to avoid the other extream among the greeks æschylus and sometimes sophocles were guilty of this fault among the latins claudian and statius and among our own countrymen shakespear and lee in these authors the affectation of greatness often hurts the perspicuity of the stile as in many others the endeavour after perspicuity prejudices its greatness  aristotle has observed that the idiomatick stile may be avoided and the sublime formed by the following methods    first by the use of metaphors  such are those of milton      imparadised in one anothers arms   and in his hand a reed   stood waving tipt with fire    the grassie clods now calvd    spangled with eyes  in these and innumerable other instances the metaphors are very bold but just i must however observe that the metaphors are not so thick sown in milton which always savours too much of wit that they never clash with one another which as aristotle observes turns a sentence into a kind of an enigma or riddle   and that he seldom has recourse to them where the proper and natural words will do as well  another way of raising the language and giving it a poetical turn is to make use of the idioms of other tongues virgil is full of the greek forms of speech which the criticks call hellenisms as horace in his odes abounds with them much more than virgil i need not mention the several dialects which homer has made use of for this end milton in conformity with the practice of the ancient poets and with aristotles rule has infused a great many latinisms as well as græcisms and sometimes hebraisms into the language of his poem as towards the beginning of it    nor did they not perceive the evil plight   in which they were or the fierce pains not feel   yet to their genrals voice they soon obeyd   who shall tempt with wandring feet   the dark unbottomd infinite abyss   and through the palpable obscure find out   his uncouth way or spread his airy flight   upborn with indefatigable wings   over the vast abrupt    so both ascend   in the visions of god        book    under this head may be reckond the placing the adjective after the substantive the transposition of words the turning the adjective into a substantive with several other foreign modes of speech which this poet has naturalized to give his verse the greater sound and throw it out of prose  the third method mentioned by aristotle is what agrees with the genius of the greek language more than with that of any other tongue and is therefore more used by homer than by any other poet i mean the lengthning of a phrase by the addition of words which may either be inserted or omitted as also by the extending or contracting of particular words by the insertion or omission of certain syllables milton has put in practice this method of raising his language as far as the nature of our tongue will permit as in the passage abovementioned eremite for what is hermit in common discourse if you observe the measure of his verse he has with great judgment suppressed a syllable in several words and shortned those of two syllables into one by which method besides the abovementioned advantage he has given a greater variety to his numbers but this practice is more particularly remarkable in the names of persons and of countries as beëlzebub hessebon and in many other particulars wherein he has either changed the name or made use of that which is not the most commonly known that he might the better depart from the language of the vulgar  the same reason recommended to him several old words which also makes his poem appear the more venerable and gives it a greater air of antiquity  i must likewise take notice that there are in milton several words of his own coining as cerberean miscreated helldoomd embryon atoms and many others if the reader is offended at this liberty in our english poet i would recommend him to a discourse in plutarch   which shews us how frequently homer has made use of the same liberty  milton by the abovementioned helps and by the choice of the noblest words and phrases which our tongue would afford him has carried our language to a greater height than any of the english poets have ever done before or after him and made the sublimity of his stile equal to that of his sentiments  i have been the more particular in these observations on miltons stile because it is that part of him in which he appears the most singular the remarks i have here made upon the practice of other poets with my observations out of aristotle will perhaps alleviate the prejudice which some have taken to his poem upon this account tho after all i must confess that i think his stile tho admirable in general is in some places too much stiffened and obscured by the frequent use of those methods which aristotle has prescribed for the raising of it  this redundancy of those several ways of speech which aristotle calls foreign language and with which milton has so very much enriched and in some places darkned the language of his poem was the more proper for his use because his poem is written in blank verse rhyme without any other assistance throws the language off from prose and very often makes an indifferent phrase pass unregarded but where the verse is not built upon rhymes there pomp of sound and energy of expression are indispensably necessary to support the stile and keep it from falling into the flatness of prose  those who have not a taste for this elevation of stile and are apt to ridicule a poet when he departs from the common forms of expression would do well to see how aristotle has treated an ancient author called euclid   for his insipid mirth upon this occasion mr dryden used to call these  sort of men his prosecriticks  i should under this head of the language consider miltons numbers in which he has made use of several elisions which are not customary among other english poets as may be particularly observed in his cutting off the letter y when it precedes a vowel  0 this and some other innovation in the measure of his verse has varied his numbers in such a manner as makes them incapable of satiating the ear and cloying the reader which the same uniform measure would certainly have done and which the perpetual returns of rhime never fail to do in long narrative poems i shall close these reflections upon the language of paradise lost with observing that milton has copied after homer rather than virgil in the length of his periods the copiousness of his phrases and the running of his verses into one another  l    footnote   aristotle poetics ii §      the excellence of diction consists in being perspicuous without being   mean   footnote      verum ubi plura

in glory above his peers  for the line would be ruined were the y to be omitted by a reader the extreme shortness of the two unaccented syllables y and a gives them the quantity of one in the metre and allows by the turn of voice a suggestion of exuberance heightening the force of the word glory three lines lower milton has no elision of the y before a vowel in the line    against the throne and monarchy of god  nor eight lines after that in the words day and night there is elision of y in the line    that were an ignominy and shame beneath   this downfall  but none a few lines lower down in    sole reigning holds the tyranny of heaven  when the y stands by itself unaccented immediately after an accented syllable and precedes a vowel that is part of another unaccented syllable standing immediately before an accented one milton accepts the consequence and does not attempt to give it the force of a distinct syllable but addisons vague notion that it was miltons custom to cut off the final y when it precedes a vowel and that for the sake of being uncommon came of inaccurate observation for the reasons just given the y of the word glory runs into the succeeding syllable and most assuredly is not cut off when we read of            the excess   of glory obscured as when the sun new risn   looks through the horizontal misty air  but the y in  misty  stands as a full syllable because the word air is accented so again in    death as oft accused   of tardy execution since denouncd   the day of his offence  the y of  tardy is a syllable because the vowel following it is accented the y also of  day remains because although an unaccented vowel follows it is itself part of an accented syllable                                               no                   monday

pleases to use it but it may not be amiss to inform your readers   that there is a false delicacy as well as a true one true delicacy   as i take it consists in exactness of judgment and dignity of   sentiment or if you will purity of affection as this is opposed to   corruption and grossness there are pedants in breeding as well as in   learning the eye that cannot bear the light is not delicate but sore   a good constitution appears in the soundness and vigour of the parts   not in the squeamishness of the stomach and a false delicacy is   affectation not politeness what then can be the standard of delicacy   but truth and virtue virtue which as the satyrist long since   observed is real honour whereas the other distinctions among mankind   are meerly titular judging by that rule in my opinion and in that   of many of your virtuous female readers you are so far from deserving   mr courtlys accusation that you seem too gentle and to allow too   many excuses for an enormous crime

would think should take place of those rules   which men of corrupt minds and those of weak understandings follow i   know not any thing more pernicious to good manners than the giving   fair names to foul actions for this confounds vice and virtue and   takes off that natural horrour we have to evil an innocent creature   who would start at the name of strumpet may think it pretty to be   called a mistress especially if her seducer has taken care to inform   her that a union of hearts is the principal matter in the sight of   heaven and that the business at church is a meer idle ceremony who   knows not that the difference between obscene and modest words   expressing the same action consists only in the accessary idea for   there is nothing immodest in letters and syllables fornication and   adultery are modest words because they express an evil action as   criminal and so as to excite horrour and aversion whereas words   representing the pleasure rather than the sin are for this reason   indecent and dishonest your papers would be chargeable with something   worse than indelicacy they would be immoral did you treat the   detestable sins of uncleanness in the same manner as you rally an   impertinent selflove and an artful glance as those laws would be   very unjust that should chastise murder and petty larceny with the   same punishment even delicacy requires that the pity shewn

were i to choose of what religion i would be and under what government i would live i should most certainly give the preference to that form of religion and government which is established in my own country in this point i think i am determined by reason and conviction but if i shall be told that i am acted by prejudice i am sure it is an honest prejudice it is a prejudice that arises from the love of my country and therefore such an one as i will always indulge i have in several papers endeavoured to express my duty and esteem for the church of england and design this as an essay upon the civil part of our constitution having often entertained my self with reflections on this subject which i have not met with in other writers  that form of government appears to me the most reasonable which is most conformable to the equality that we find in human nature provided it be consistent with publick peace and tranquillity this is what may properly be called liberty which exempts one man from subjection to another so far as the order and oeconomy of government will permit  liberty should reach every individual of a people as they all share one common nature if it only spreads among particular branches there had better be none at all since such a liberty only aggravates the misfortune of those who are deprivd of it by setting before them a disagreeable subject of comparison this liberty is best preserved where the legislative power is lodged in several persons especially if those persons are of different ranks and interests for where they are of the same rank and consequently have an interest to manage peculiar to that rank it differs but little from a despotical government in a single person but the greatest security a people can have for their liberty is when the legislative power is in the hands of persons so happily distinguished that by providing for the particular interests of their several ranks they are providing for the whole body of the people or in other words when there is no part of the people that has not a common interest with at least one part of the legislators  if there be but one body of legislators it is no better than a tyranny if there are only two there will want a casting voice and one of them must at length be swallowed up by disputes and contentions that will necessarily arise between them four would have the same inconvenience as two and a greater number would cause too much confusion i could never read a passage in polybius and another in cicero to this purpose without a secret pleasure in applying it to the english constitution which it suits much better than the roman both these great authors give the preeminence to a mixt government consisting of three branches the regal the noble and the popular they had doubtless in their thoughts the constitution of the roman commonwealth in which the consul represented the king the senate the nobles and the tribunes the people this division of the three powers in the roman constitution was by no means so distinct and natural as it is in the english form of government among several objections that might be made to it i think the chief are those that affect the consular power which had only the ornaments without the force of the regal authority their number had not a casting voice in it for which reason if one did not chance to be employed abroad while the other sat at home the publick business was sometimes at a stand while the consuls pulled two different ways in it besides i do not find that the consuls had ever a negative voice in the passing of a law or decree of senate so that indeed they were rather the chief body of the nobility or the first ministers of state than a distinct branch of the sovereignty in which none can be looked upon as a part who are not a part of the legislature had the consuls been invested with the regal authority to as great a degree as our monarchs there would never have been any occasions for a dictatorship which had in it the power of all the three orders and ended in the subversion of the whole constitution  such an history as that of suelonius which gives us a succession of absolute princes is to me an unanswerable argument against despotick power where the prince is a man of wisdom and virtue it is indeed happy for his people that he is absolute but since in the common run of mankind for one that is wise and good you find ten of a contrary character it is very dangerous for a nation to stand to its chance or to have its publick happiness or misery depend on the virtues or vices of a single person look into the history   i have mentioned or into any series of absolute princes how many tyrants must you read through before you come to an emperor that is supportable but this is not all an honest private man often grows cruel and abandoned when converted into an absolute prince give a man power of doing what he pleases with impunity you extinguish his fear and consequently overturn in him one of the great pillars of morality this too we find confirmed by matter of fact how many hopeful heirs apparent to grand empires when in the possession of them have become such monsters of lust and cruelty as are a reproach to human nature  some tell us we ought to make our governments on earth like that in heaven which say they is altogether monarchical and unlimited was man like his creator in goodness and justice i should be for following this great model but where goodness and justice are not essential to the ruler i would by no means put myself into his hands to be disposed of according to his particular will and pleasure  it is odd to consider the connection between despotic government and barbarity and how the making of one person more than man makes the rest less about nine parts of the world in ten are in the lowest state of slavery and consequently sunk into the most gross and brutal ignorance european slavery is indeed a state of liberty if compared with that which prevails in the other three divisions of the world and therefore it is no wonder that those who grovel under it have many tracks of light among them of which the others are wholly destitute  riches and plenty are the natural fruits of liberty and where these abound learning and all the liberal arts will immediately lift up their heads and flourish as a man must have no slavish fears and apprehensions hanging upon his mind who   will indulge the flights of fancy or speculation and push his researches into all the abstruse corners of truth so it is necessary for him to have about him a competency of all the conveniencies of life  the first thing every one looks after is to provide himself with necessaries this point will engross our thoughts till it be satisfied if this is taken care of to our hands we look out for pleasures and amusements and among a great number of idle people there will be many whose pleasures will lie in reading and contemplation these are the two great sources of knowledge and as men grow wise they naturally love to communicate their discoveries and others seeing the happiness of such a learned life and improving by their conversation emulate imitate and surpass one another till a nation is filled with races of wise and understanding persons ease and plenty are therefore the great cherishers of knowledge and as most of the despotick governments of the world have neither of them they are naturally overrun with ignorance and barbarity in europe indeed notwithstanding several of its princes are absolute there are men famous for knowledge and learning but the reason is because the subjects are many of them rich and wealthy the prince not thinking fit to exert himself in his full tyranny like the princes of the eastern nations lest his subjects should be invited to newmould their constitution having so many prospects of liberty within their view but in all despotic governments tho a particular prince may favour arts and letters there is a natural degeneracy of mankind as you may observe from augustuss reign how the romans lost themselves by degrees till they fell to an equality with the most barbarous nations that surrounded them look upon greece under its free states and you would think its inhabitants lived in different climates and under different heavens from those at present so different are the geniuss which are formed under turkish slavery and grecian liberty  besides poverty and want there are other reasons that debase the minds of men who live under slavery though i look on this as the principal this natural tendency of despotic power to ignorance and barbarity tho not insisted upon by others is i think an unanswerable argument against that form of government as it shews how repugnant it is to the good of mankind and the perfection of human nature which ought to be the great ends of all civil institutions  l    footnote   historian   footnote   that

species of mankind under the   denomination of male jilts they are gentlemen who do not design to   marry yet that they may appear to have some sense of gallantry   think they must pay their devoirs to one particular fair in order to   which they single out from amongst the herd of females her to whom   they design to make their fruitless addresses this done they first   take every opportunity of being in her company and then never fail   upon all occasions to be particular to her laying themselves at her   feet protesting the reality of their passion with a thousand oaths   solliciting a return and saying as many fine things as their stock of   wit will allow and if they are not deficient that way generally   speak so as to admit of a double interpretation which the credulous   fair is apt to turn to her own advantage since it frequently happens   to be a raw innocent young creature who thinks all the world as   sincere as her self and so her unwary heart becomes an easy prey to   those deceitful monsters who no sooner perceive it but immediately   they grow cool and shun her whom they before seemed so much to   admire and proceed to act the same commonplace villany towards   another a coxcomb flushed with many of these infamous victories shall   say he is sorry for the poor fools protest and vow he never thought   of matrimony and wonder talking civilly can be so strangely   misinterpreted now mr spectator you that are a professed friend to   love will i hope observe upon those who abuse that noble passion   and raise it in innocent minds by a deceitful

it is wonderful one could so long overlook it but this false gallantry proceeds from an impotence of mind which makes those who are guilty of it incapable of pursuing what they themselves approve many a man wishes a woman his wife whom he dares not take for such tho no one has power over his inclinations or fortunes he is a slave to common fame for this reason i think melainia gives them too soft a name in that of male coquets i know not why irresolution of mind should not be more contemptible than impotence of body and these frivolous admirers would be but tenderly used in being only included in the same term with the insufficient another way they whom my correspondent calls male coquets shall hereafter be called fribblers a fribbler is one who professes rapture and admiration for the woman to whom he addresses and dreads nothing so much as her consent his heart can flutter by the force of imagination but cannot fix from the force of judgment it is not uncommon for the parents of young women of moderate fortune to wink at the addresses of fribblers and expose their children to the ambiguous behaviour which melainia complains of till by the fondness to one they are to lose they become incapable of love towards others and by consequence in their future marriage lead a joyless or a miserable life as therefore i shall in the speculations which regard love be as severe as i ought on jilts and libertine women so will i be as little merciful to insignificant and mischievous men in order to this all visitants who frequent families wherein there are young females are

 vitæ summa brevis spem nos vetat inchoare longam    hor    upon taking my seat in a coffeehouse i often draw the eyes of the whole room upon me when in the hottest seasons of news and at a time that perhaps the dutch mail is just come in they hear me ask the coffeeman for his last weeks bill of mortality i find that i have been sometimes taken on this occasion for a parish sexton sometimes for an undertaker and sometimes for a doctor of physick in this however i am guided by the spirit of a philosopher as i take occasion from hence to reflect upon the regular encrease and diminution of mankind and consider the several various ways through which we pass from life to eternity i am very well pleased with these weekly admonitions that bring into my mind such thoughts as ought to be the daily entertainment of every reasonable creature and can consider with pleasure to my self by which of those deliverances or as we commonly call them distempers i may possibly make my escape out of this world of sorrows into that condition of existence wherein i hope to be happier than it is possible for me at present to conceive  but this is not all the use i make of the abovementioned weekly paper a bill of mortality   is in my opinion an unanswerable argument for a providence how can we without supposing our selves under the constant care of a supreme being give any possible account for that nice proportion which we find in every great city between the deaths and births of its inhabitants and between the number of males and that of females who are brought into the world what else could adjust in so exact a manner the recruits of every nation to its losses and divide these new supplies of people into such equal bodies of both sexes chance could never hold the balance with so steady a hand were we not counted out by an intelligent supervisor we should sometimes be overcharged with multitudes and at others waste away into a desart we should be sometimes a populus virorum as florus elegantly expresses it a generation of males and at others a species of women we may extend this consideration to every species of living creatures and consider the whole animal world as an huge army made up of innumerable corps if i may use that term whose quotas have been kept entire near five thousand years in so wonderful a manner that there is not probably a single species lost during this long tract of time could we have general bills of mortality of every kind of animal or particular ones of every species in each continent and island i could almost say in every wood marsh or mountain what astonishing instances would they be of that providence which watches over all its works  i have heard of a great man in the romish church who upon reading those words in the vth chapter of genesis and all the days that adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years and he died and all the days of seth were nine hundred and twelve years and he died and all the days of methuselah were nine hundred and sixty nine years and he died immediately shut himself up in a convent and retired from the world as not thinking any thing in this life worth pursuing which had not regard to another  the truth of it is there is nothing in history which is so improving to the reader as those accounts which we meet with of the deaths of eminent persons and of their behaviour in that dreadful season i may also add that there are no parts in history which affect and please the reader in so sensible a manner the reason i take to be this because there is no other single circumstance in the story of any person which can possibly be the case of every one who reads it a battle or a triumph are conjunctures in which not one man in a million is likely to be engaged but when we see a person at the point of death we cannot forbear being attentive to every thing he says or does because we are sure that some time or other we shall our selves be in the same melancholy circumstances the general the statesman or the philosopher are perhaps characters which we may never act in but the dying man is one whom sooner or later we shall certainly resemble  it is perhaps for the same kind of reason that few books written   in english have been so much perused as dr sherlocks discourse upon death though at the same time i must own that he who has not perused this excellent piece has not perhaps read one of the strongest persuasives to a religious life that ever was written in any language  the consideration with which i shall close this essay upon death is one of the most ancient and most beaten morals that has been recommended to mankind but its being so very common and so universally received though it takes away from it the grace of novelty adds very much to the weight of it as it shews that it falls in with the general sense of mankind in short i would have every one consider that he is in this life nothing more than a passenger and that he is not to set up his rest here but to keep an attentive eye upon that state of being to which he approaches every moment and which will be for ever fixed and permanent this single consideration would be sufficient to extinguish the bitterness of hatred the thirst of avarice and the cruelty of ambition  i am very much pleased with the passage of antiphanes a very ancient poet who lived near an hundred years before socrates which represents the life of man under this view as i have here translated it word for word be not grieved says he above measure for thy deceased friends they   are not dead but have only finished that journey which it is necessary for every one of us to take we ourselves must go to that great place of reception in which they are all of them assembled and in this general rendezvous of mankind live together in another state of being  i think i have in a former paper taken notice of those beautiful metaphors in scripture where life is termed a pilgrimage and those who pass through it are called strangers and sojourners upon earth i shall conclude this with a story which i have somewhere read in the travels of sir john chardin   that gentleman after having told us that the inns which receive the caravans in persia and the eastern countries are called by the name of caravansaries gives us a relation to the following purpose  a dervise travelling through tartary being arrived at the town of balk went into the kings palace by mistake as thinking it to be a publick inn or caravansary having looked about him for some time he enterd into a long gallery where he laid down his wallet and spread his carpet in order to repose himself upon it after the manner of the eastern nations he had not been long in this posture before he was discovered by some of the guards who asked him what was his business in that place the dervise told them he intended to take up his nights lodging in that caravansary the guards let him know in a very angry manner that the house he was in was not a caravansary but the kings palace it happened that the king himself passed through the gallery during this debate and smiling at the mistake of the dervise asked him how he could possibly be so dull as not to distinguish a palace from a caravansary sir says the dervise give me leave to ask your majesty a question or two who were the persons that lodged in this house when it was first built the king replied his ancestors and who says the dervise was the last person that lodged here the king replied his father and who is it says the dervise that lodges here at present the king told him that it was he himself and who says the dervise will be here after you the king answered the young prince his son ah sir said the dervise a house that changes its inhabitants so often and receives such a perpetual succession of guests is not a palace but a caravansary  l    footnote   bills of mortality containing the weekly number of christenings and deaths with the cause of death were first compiled by the

not have a better occasion of obliging me than one which they lately took hold of they desired my friend will honeycomb to bring me to the reading of a new tragedy it is called the distressed mother   i must confess tho some days are passed since i enjoyed that entertainment the passions of the several characters dwell strongly upon my imagination and i congratulate to the age that they are at last to see truth and humane life represented in the incidents which concern heroes and heroines the stile of the play is such as becomes those of the first education and the sentiments worthy those of the highest figure it was a most exquisite pleasure to me to observe real tears drop from the eyes of those who had long made it their profession to dissemble affliction and the player who read frequently throw down the book till he had given vent to the humanity which rose in him at some irresistible touches of the imagined sorrow we have seldom had any female distress on the stage which did not upon cool examination appear to flow from the weakness rather than the misfortune of the person represented but in this tragedy you are not entertained with the ungoverned passions of such as are enamoured of each other merely as they are men and women but their regards are founded upon high conceptions of each others virtue and merit and the character which gives name to the play is one who has behaved her self with heroic virtue in the most important circumstances of a female life those of a wife a widow and a mother if there be those whose minds have been too attentive upon the affairs of life to have any notion of the passion of love in such extremes as are known only to particular tempers yet in the abovementioned considerations the sorrow of the heroine will move even the generality of mankind domestick virtues concern all the world and there is no one living who is not interested that andromache should be an imitable character the generous affection to the memory of her deceased husband that tender care for her son which is ever heightned with the consideration of his father and these regards preserved in spite of being tempted with the possession of the highest greatness are what cannot but be venerable even to such an audience as at present frequents the english theatre my friend will honeycomb commended several tender things that were said and told me they were very genteel but whisperd me that he feared the piece was not busy enough for the present taste to supply this he recommended to the players to be very careful in their scenes and above all things that every part should be perfectly new dressed i was very glad to find that they did not neglect my friends admonition because there are a great many in his class of criticism who may be gained by it but indeed the truth is that as to the work it self it is every where nature the persons are of the highest quality in life even that of princes but their quality is not represented by the poet with direction that guards and waiters should follow them in every scene but their grandeur appears in greatness of  sentiments flowing from minds worthy their condition to make a character truly great this author understands that it should have its foundation in superior thoughts and maxims of conduct it is very certain that many an honest woman would make no difficulty tho she had been the wife of hector for the sake of a kingdom to marry the enemy of her husbands family and country and indeed who can deny but she might be still an honest woman but no heroine that may be defensible nay laudable in one character which would be in the highest degree exceptionable in another when cato uticensis killed himself cottius a roman of ordinary quality and character did the same thing upon which one said smiling cottius might have lived tho cæsar has seized the roman liberty cottiuss condition might have been the same let things at the upper end of the world pass as they would what is further very extraordinary in this work is that the persons are all of them laudable and their misfortunes arise rather from unguarded virtue than propensity to vice the town has an opportunity of doing itself justice in supporting the representation of passion sorrow indignation even despair itself within the rules of decency honour and goodbreeding and since there is no one can flatter himself his life will be always fortunate they may here see sorrow as they would wish to bear it whenever it arrives     mr spectator    i am appointed to act a part in the new tragedy called the distressed

language and have shewn that he excels in general under each of these heads i hope that i have made several discoveries which may appear new even to those who are versed in critical learning were i indeed to chuse my readers by whose judgment i would stand or fall they should not be such as are acquainted only with the french and italian criticks but also with the ancient and moderns who have written in either of the learned languages above all i would have them well versed in the greek and latin poets without which a man very often fancies that he understands a critick when in reality he does not comprehend his meaning  it is in criticism as in all other sciences and speculations one who brings with him any implicit notions and observations which he has made in his reading of the poets will find his own reflections methodized and explained and perhaps several little hints that had passed in his mind perfected and improved in the works of a good critick whereas one who has not these previous lights is very often an utter stranger to what he reads and apt to put a wrong interpretation upon it  nor is it sufficient that a man who sets up for a judge in criticism should have perused the authors above mentioned unless he has also a clear and logical head without this talent he is perpetually puzzled and perplexed amidst his own blunders mistakes the sense of those he would confute or if he chances to think right does not know how to convey his thoughts to another with clearness and perspicuity aristotle who was the best critick was also one of the best logicians that ever appeared in the world  mr locks essay on human understanding   would be thought a very odd book for a man to make himself master of who would get a reputation by critical writings though at the same time it is very certain that an author who has not learned the art of distinguishing between words and things and of ranging his thoughts and setting them in proper lights whatever notions he may have will lose himself in confusion and obscurity i might further observe that there is not a greek or latin critick who has not shewn even in the style of his criticisms that he was a master of all the elegance and delicacy of his native tongue  the truth of it is there is nothing more absurd than for a man to set up for a critick without a good insight into all the parts of learning whereas many of those who have endeavoured to signalize themselves by works of this nature among our english writers are not only defective in the abovementioned particulars but plainly discover by the phrases which they make use of and by their confused way of thinking that they are not acquainted with the most common and ordinary systems of arts and sciences a few general rules extracted out of the french authors   with a certain cant of words has sometimes set up an illiterate heavy writer for a most judicious and formidable critick  one great mark by which you may discover a critick who has neither taste nor learning is this that he seldom ventures to praise any passage in an author which has not been before received and applauded by the publick and that his criticism turns wholly upon little faults and errors this part of a critick is so very easie to succeed in that we find every ordinary reader upon the publishing of a new poem has wit and illnature enough to turn several passages of it into ridicule and very often in the right place this mr dryden has very agreeably remarked in those two celebrated lines    errors like straws upon the surface flow   he who would search for pearls must dive below    a true critick ought to dwell rather upon excellencies than imperfections to discover the concealed beauties of a writer and communicate to the world such things as are worth their observation the most exquisite words and finest strokes of an author are those which very often appear the most doubtful and exceptionable to a man who wants a relish for polite learning and they are these which a sower undistinguishing critick generally attacks with the greatest violence tully observes that it is very easie to brand or fix a mark upon what he calls verbum ardens   or as it may be rendered into english a glowing bold expression and to turn it into ridicule by a cold illnatured criticism a little wit is equally capable of exposing a beauty and of aggravating a fault and though such a treatment of an author naturally produces indignation in the mind of an understanding reader it has however its effect among the generality of those whose hands it falls into the rabble of mankind being very apt to think that every thing which is laughed at with any mixture of wit is ridiculous in it self  such a mirth as this is always unseasonable in a critick as it rather prejudices the reader than convinces him and is capable of making a beauty as well as a blemish the subject of derision a man who cannot write with wit on a proper subject is dull and stupid but one who shews it in an improper place is as impertinent and absurd besides a man who has the gift of ridicule is apt to find fault with any thing that gives him an opportunity of exerting his beloved talent and very often censures a passage not because there is any fault in it but because he can be merry upon it such kinds of pleasantry are very unfair and disingenuous in works of criticism in which the greatest masters both ancient and modern have always appeared with a serious and instructive air  as i intend in my next paper to shew the defects in miltons paradise lost i thought fit to premise these few particulars to the end that the reader may know i enter upon it as on a very ungrateful work and that i shall just point at the imperfections without endeavouring to enflame them with ridicule i must also observe with longinus   that the productions of a great genius with many lapses and inadvertencies are infinitely preferable to the works of an inferior kind of author which are scrupulously exact and conformable to all the rules of correct writing  i shall conclude my paper with a story out of boccalini   which sufficiently shews us the opinion that judicious author entertained of the sort of criticks i have been here mentioning a famous critick says he having gathered together all the faults of an eminent poet made a present of them to apollo who received them very graciously and resolved to make the author a suitable return for the trouble he had been at in collecting them in order to this he set before him a sack of wheat as it had been just threshed out of the sheaf he then bid him pick out the chaff from among the corn and lay it aside by it self the critick applied himself to the task with great industry and pleasure and after having made the due separation was presented by apollo with the chaff for his pains    l    footnote   first published in    0   footnote   dryden accounted among critics the greatest of his age

intrinsically the same and the same good may be done with different degrees of lustre no man should be contented with himself that he barely does well but he should perform every thing in the best and most becoming manner that he is able  tully tells us he wrote his book of offices because there was no time of life in which some correspondent duty might not be practised nor is there a duty without a certain decency accompanying it by which every virtue tis joind to will seem to be doubled another may do the same thing and yet the action want that air and beauty which distinguish it from others like that inimitable sunshine titian is said to have diffused over his landschapes which denotes them his and has been always unequalled by any other person  there is no one action in which this quality i am speaking of will be more sensibly perceived than in granting a request or doing an office of kindness mummius by his way of consenting to a benefaction shall make it lose its name while carus doubles the kindness and the obligation from the first the desired request drops indeed at last but from so doubtful a brow that the obliged has almost as much reason to resent the manner of bestowing it as to be thankful for the favour it self carus invites with a pleasing air to give him an opportunity of doing an act of humanity meets the petition half way and consents to a request with a countenance which proclaims the satisfaction of his mind in assisting the distressed  the decency then that is to be observed in liberality seems to consist in its being performed with such cheerfulness as may express the godlike pleasure is to be met with in obliging ones fellowcreatures that may shew goodnature and benevolence overflowed and do not as in some men run upon the tilt and taste of the sediments of a grutching uncommunicative disposition  since i have intimated that the greatest decorum is to be preserved in the bestowing our good offices i will illustrate it a little by an example drawn from private life which carries with it such a profusion of liberality that it can be exceeded by nothing but the humanity and goodnature which accompanies it it is a letter of plinys  which i shall here translate because the action will best appear in its first dress of thought without any foreign or ambitious ornaments     pliny to quintilian    tho i am fully acquainted

intrinsick worth be not augmented yet will it receive both ornament   and lustre and knowing your estate to be as moderate as the riches of   your mind are abundant i must challenge to my self some part of the   burthen and as a parent of your child i present her with twelve   hundred and fifty crowns towards these expences which sum had been   much larger had i not feared the smallness of it would be the   greatest inducement with you to accept of it farewell  thus should a benefaction be done with a good grace and shine in the strongest point of light it should not only answer all the hopes and exigencies of the receiver but even outrun his wishes tis this happy manner of behaviour which adds new charms to it and softens those gifts of art and nature which otherwise would be rather distasteful than agreeable without it valour would degenerate into brutality learning into pedantry and the genteelest demeanour into affectation even religion its self unless decency be the handmaid which waits upon her is apt to make people appear guilty of sourness and ill humour but this shews virtue in her first original form adds a comeliness to religion and gives its professors the justest title to the beauty of holiness a man fully instructed in this art may assume a thousand shapes and please in all he may do a thousand actions shall become none other but himself not that the things themselves are different but the manner of doing them  if you examine each feature by its self aglaura and callidea are equally handsome but take them in the whole and you cannot suffer the comparison tho one is full of numberless nameless graces the other of as many nameless faults  the comeliness of person and decency of behaviour add infinite weight to what is pronounced by any one tis the want of this that often makes the rebukes and advice of old rigid persons of no effect and leave a displeasure in the minds of those they are directed to but youth and beauty if accompanied with a graceful

wherein he lays down maxims for a mans advancing himself at court advises his reader to associate himself with the fortunate and to shun the company of the unfortunate which notwithstanding the baseness of the precept to an honest mind may have something useful in it for those who push their interest in the world it is certain a great part of what we call good or ill fortune rises out of right or wrong measures and schemes of life when i hear a man complain of his being unfortunate in all his undertakings i shrewdly suspect him for a very weak man in his affairs in conformity with this way of thinking cardinal richelieu used to say that unfortunate and imprudent were but two words for the same thing as the cardinal himself had a great share both of prudence and goodfortune his famous antagonist the count dolivarez was disgraced at the court of madrid because it was alledged against him that he had never any success in his undertakings this says an eminent author was indirectly accusing him of imprudence  cicero recommended pompey to the romans for their general upon three accounts as he was a man of courage conduct and goodfortune it was perhaps for the reason abovementioned namely that a series of goodfortune supposes a prudent management in the person whom it befalls that not only sylla the dictator but several of the roman emperors as is still to be seen upon their medals among their other titles gave themselves that of felix or fortunate the heathens indeed seem to have valued a man more for his goodfortune than for any other quality which i think is very natural for those who have not a strong belief of another world for how can i conceive a man crowned with many distinguishing blessings that has not some extraordinary fund of merit and perfection in him which lies open to the supreme eye tho perhaps it is not discovered by my observation what is the reason homers and virgils heroes do not form a resolution or strike a blow without the conduct and direction of some deity doubtless because the poets esteemed it the greatest honour to be favoured by the gods and thought the best way of praising a man was to recount those favours which naturally implied an extraordinary merit in the person on whom they descended  those who believe a future state of rewards and punishments act very absurdly if they form their opinions of a mans merit from his successes but certainly if i thought the whole circle of our being was concluded between our births and deaths i should think a mans goodfortune the measure and standard of his real merit since providence would have no opportunity of rewarding his virtue and perfections but in the present life a virtuous unbeliever who lies under the pressure of misfortunes has reason to cry out as they say brutus did a little before his death o virtue i have worshipped thee as a substantial good but i find thou art an empty name  but to return to our first point tho prudence does undoubtedly in a great measure produce our good or ill fortune in the world it is certain there are many unforeseen accidents and occurrences which very often pervert the finest schemes that can be laid by human wisdom the race is not always to the swift nor the battle to the strong nothing less than infinite wisdom can have an absolute command over fortune the highest degree of it which man can possess is by no means equal to fortuitous events and to such contingencies as may rise in the prosecution of our affairs nay it very often happens that prudence which has always in it a great mixture of caution hinders a man from being so fortunate as he might possibly have been without it a person who only aims at what is likely to succeed and follows closely the dictates of human prudence never meets with those great and unforeseen successes which are often the effect of a sanguine temper or a more happy rashness and this perhaps may be the reason that according to the common observation fortune like other females delights rather in favouring the young than the old  upon the whole since man is so shortsighted a creature and the accidents which may happen to him so various i cannot but be of dr tillotsons opinion in another case that were there any doubt of a providence yet it certainly would be very desirable there should be such a being of infinite wisdom and goodness on whose direction we might rely in the conduct of human life  it is a great presumption to ascribe our successes to our own management and not to esteem our selves upon any blessing rather as it is the bounty of heaven than the acquisition of our own prudence i am very well pleased with a medal which was struck by queen elizabeth a little after the defeat of the invincible armada to perpetuate the memory of that extraordinary event it is well known how the king of spain and others who were the enemies of that great princess to derogate from her glory ascribed the ruin of their fleet rather to the violence of storms and tempests than to the bravery of the english queen elizabeth instead of looking upon this as a diminution of her honour valued herself upon such a signal favour of providence and accordingly in   the reverse of the medal above mentioned has represented a fleet beaten by a tempest and falling foul upon one another with that religious inscription afflavit deus et dissipantur he blew with his wind and they were scattered  it is remarked of a famous grecian general whose name i cannot at present recollect   and who had been a particular favourite of fortune that upon recounting his victories among his friends he added at the end of several great actions and in this fortune had no share after which it is observed in history that he never prospered in any thing he undertook  as arrogance and a conceitedness of our own abilities are very shocking and offensive to men of sense and virtue we may be sure they are highly displeasing to that being who delights in an humble mind and by several of his dispensations seems purposely to shew us that our own schemes or prudence have no share in our advancements  since on this subject i have already admitted several quotations which have occurred to my memory upon writing this paper i will conclude it with a little persian fable a drop of water fell out of a cloud into the sea and finding it self lost in such an immensity of fluid matter broke out into the following reflection alas what an insignificant   creature  am i in this prodigious ocean of waters my existence is of  no concern   to the universe i am reduced to a kind of nothing and am less then the least of the works of god it so happened that an oyster which lay in the neighbourhood of this drop chanced to gape and swallow it up in the midst of this its   humble soliloquy the drop says the fable lay a great while hardning in the shell till by degrees it was ripend into a pearl which falling into the hands of a diver after a long series of adventures is

wednesday february                       steele      difficile est plurimum virtutem revereri qui semper secunda fortuna   sit usus    tull ad herennium    insolence is the crime of all others which every man is most apt to rail at and yet is there one respect in which almost all men living are guilty of it and that is in the case of laying a greater value upon the gifts of fortune than we ought it is here in england come into our very language as a propriety of distinction to say when we would speak of persons to their advantage they are people of condition there is no doubt but the proper use of riches implies that a man should exert all the good qualities imaginable and if we mean by a man of condition or quality one who according to the wealth he is master of shews himself just beneficent and charitable that term ought very deservedly to be had in the highest veneration but when wealth is used only as it is the support of pomp and luxury to be rich is very far from being a recommendation to honour and respect it is indeed the greatest insolence imaginable in a creature who would feel the extreams of thirst and hunger if he did not prevent his appetites before they call upon him to be so forgetful of the common necessity of human nature as never to cast an eye upon the poor and needy the fellow who escaped from a ship which struck upon a rock in the west and joind with the country people to destroy his brother sailors and make her a wreck was thought a most execrable creature but does not every man who enjoys the possession of what he naturally wants and is unmindful of the unsupplied distress of other men betray the same temper of mind when a man looks about him and with regard to riches and poverty beholds some drawn in pomp and equipage and they and their very servants with an air of scorn and triumph overlooking the multitude that pass by them and in the same street a creature of the same make crying out in the name of all that is good and sacred to behold his misery and give him some supply against hunger and nakedness who would believe these two beings were of the same species but so it is that the consideration of fortune has taken up all our minds and as i have often complained poverty and riches stand in our imaginations in the places of guilt and innocence but in all seasons there will be some instances of persons who have souls too large to be taken with popular prejudices and while the rest of mankind are contending for superiority in power and wealth have their thoughts bent upon the necessities of those below them the charityschools which have been erected of late years are the greatest instances of publick spirit the age has produced but indeed when we consider how long this sort of beneficence has been on foot it is rather from the good management of those institutions than from the number or value of the benefactions to them that they make so great a figure one would think it impossible that in the space of fourteen years there should not have been five thousand pounds bestowed in gifts this way nor sixteen hundred children including males and females put out to methods of industry it is not allowed me to speak of luxury and folly with the severe spirit they deserve i shall only therefore say i shall very readily compound with any lady in a hooppetticoat if she gives the price of one half yard of the silk towards cloathing feeding and instructing an innocent helpless creature of her own sex in one of these schools the consciousness of such an action will give her features a nobler life on this illustrious day   than all the jewels that can hang in her hair or can be clustered at her bosom it would be uncourtly to speak in harsher words to the fair but to men one may take a little more freedom it is monstrous how a man can live with so little reflection as to fancy he is not in a condition very unjust and disproportioned to the rest of mankind while he enjoys wealth and exerts no benevolence or bounty to others as for this particular occasion of these schools there cannot any offer more worthy a generous mind would you do an handsome thing without return do it for an infant that is not sensible of the obligation would you do it for publick good do it for one who will be an honest artificer would you do it for the sake of heaven give it to one who shall be instructed in the worship of him for whose sake you gave it it is methinks a most laudable institution this if it were of no other expectation than that of producing a race of good and useful servants who will have more than a liberal a religious education what would not a man do in common prudence to lay out in purchase of one about him who would add to all his orders he gave the weight of the commandments to inforce an obedience to them for one who would consider his master as his father his friend and benefactor upon the easy terms and in expectation of no other return but moderate wages and gentle usage it is the common vice of children to run too much among the servants from such as are educated in these places they would see nothing but lowliness in the servant which would not be disingenuous in the child all the ill offices and defamatory whispers which take their birth from domesticks would be prevented if this charity could be made universal and a good man might have a knowledge of the whole life of the persons he designs to take into his house for his own service or that of his family or children long before they were admitted this would create endearing dependencies and the obligation would have a paternal air in the master who would be relieved from much care and anxiety from the gratitude and diligence of an humble friend attending him as his servant i fall into this discourse from a letter sent to me to give me notice that fifty boys would be cloathed and take their seats at the charge of some generous benefactors in st brides church on sunday next i wish i could promise to my self any thing which my correspondent seems to expect from a publication of it in this paper for there can be nothing added to what so many excellent and learned men have said on this occasion but that there may be something here which would move a generous mind like that of him who writ to me i shall transcribe an handsome paragraph of dr snapes sermon on these charities which my correspondent enclosed with this letter    the wise providence has amply compensated the disadvantages of the   poor and indigent in wanting many of the conveniencies of this life   by a more abundant provision for their happiness in the next had they   been higher born or more richly endowed they would have wanted this   manner of education of which those only enjoy the benefit who are   low enough to submit to it where they have such advantages without   money and without price as the rich cannot purchase with it the   learning which is given is generally more edifying to them than that   which is sold to others thus do they become more exalted in goodness   by being depressed in fortune and their poverty is in reality their   preferment    t    footnote   queen annes birthday she was

reputat quanti sibi gandia constent    juv      mr spectator    i am turned of my great climacteric and am naturally a man of a meek   temper about a dozen years ago i was married for my sins to a young   woman of a good family and of an high spirit but could not bring her   to close with me before i had entered into a treaty with her longer   than that of the grand alliance among other articles it was therein   stipulated that she should have £ 00 a year for pinmoney which i   obliged my self to pay quarterly into the hands of one who had acted   as her plenipotentiary in that affair i have ever since religiously   observed my part in this solemn agreement now sir so it is that   the lady has had several children since i married her to which if i   should credit our malicious neighbours her pinmoney has not a little   contributed the education of these my children who contrary to my   expectation are born to me every year streightens me so much that i   have begged their mother to free me from the obligation of the   abovementioned pinmoney that it may go towards making a provision   for her family this proposal makes her noble blood swell in her   veins insomuch that finding me a little tardy in her last quarters   payment she threatens me every day to arrest me and proceeds so far   as to tell me that if i do not do her justice i shall die in a jayl   to this she adds when her passion will let her argue calmly that she   has several playdebts on her hand which must be discharged very   suddenly and that she cannot lose her money as becomes a woman of her   fashion if she makes me any abatements in this article i hope sir   you will take an occasion from hence to give your opinion upon a   subject which you have not yet touched and inform us if there are any   precedents for this usage among our ancestors or whether you find any   mention of pinmoney in grotius puffendorf or any other of the   civilians    i am ever   the humblest of your admirers   josiah fribble esq   as there is no man living who is a more professed advocate for the fair sex than my self so there is none that would be more unwilling to invade any of their ancient rights and privileges but as the doctrine of pinmoney is of a very late date unknown to our great grandmothers and not yet received by many of our modern ladies i think it is for the interest of both sexes to keep it from spreading  mr fribble may not perhaps be much mistaken where he intimates that the supplying a mans wife with pinmoney is furnishing her with arms against himself and in a manner becoming accessary to his own dishonour we may indeed generally observe that in proportion as a woman is more or less beautiful and her husband advanced in years she stands in need of a greater or less number of pins and upon a treaty of marriage rises or falls in her demands accordingly it must likewise be owned that high quality in a mistress does very much inflame this article in the marriage reckoning  but where the age and circumstances of both parties are pretty much upon a level i cannot but think the insisting upon pinmoney is very extraordinary and yet we find several matches broken off upon this very head what would a foreigner or one who is a stranger to this practice think of a lover that forsakes his mistress because he is not willing to keep her in pins but what would he think of the mistress should he be informed that she asks five or six hundred pounds a year for this use should a man unacquainted with our customs be told the sums which are allowed in great britain under the title of pinmoney what a prodigious consumption of pins would he think there was in this island a pin a day says our frugal proverb is a groat a year so that according to this calculation my friend fribbles wife must every year make use of eight millions six hundred and forty thousand new pins  i am not ignorant that our british ladies allege they comprehend under this general term several other conveniencies of life i could therefore wish for the honour of my countrywomen that they had rather called it needlemoney which might have implied something of goodhousewifry and not have given the malicious world occasion to think that dress and trifles have always the uppermost place in a womans thoughts  i know several of my fair reasoners urge in defence of this practice that it is but a necessary provision they make for themselves in case their husband proves a churl or a miser so that they consider this allowance as a kind of alimony which they may lay their claim to without actually separating from their husbands but with submission i think a woman who will give up her self to a man in marriage where there is the least room for such an apprehension and trust her person to one whom she will not rely on for the common necessaries of life may very properly be accused in the phrase of an homely proverb of being penny wise and pound foolish  it is observed of overcautious generals that they never engage in a battel without securing a retreat in case the event should not answer their expectations on the other hand the greatest conquerors have burnt their ships or broke down the bridges behind them as being determined either to succeed or die in the engagement in the same manner i should very much suspect a woman who takes such precautions for her retreat and contrives methods how she may live happily without the affection of one to whom she joins herself for life separate purses between man and wife are in my opinion as unnatural as separate beds a marriage cannot be happy where the pleasures inclinations and interests of both parties are not the same there is no greater incitement to love in the mind of man than the sense of a persons depending upon him for her ease and happiness as a woman uses all her endeavours to please the person whom she looks upon as her honour her comfort and her support  for this reason i am not very much surprized at the behaviour of a rough country squire who being not a little shocked at the proceeding of a young widow that would not recede from her demands of pinmoney was so enraged at her mercenary temper that he told her in great wrath as much as she thought him her slave he would shew all the world he did not care a pin for her upon which he flew out of the room and never saw her more  socrates in platos altibiades says he was informed by one who had travelled through persia that as he passed over a great tract of lands and enquired what the name of the place was they told him it was the queens girdle to which he adds that another wide field which lay by it was called the queens veil and that in the same manner there was a large portion of ground set aside for every part of her majestys dress these lands might not be improperly called the queen of persias pinmoney  i remember my friend sir roger who i dare say never read this passage in plato told me some time since that upon his courting the perverse widow of whom i have given an account in former papers he had disposed of an hundred acres in a diamondring which he would have presented her with had she thought fit to accept it and that upon her weddingday she should have carried on her head fifty of the tallest oaks upon his estate he further informed me that he would have given her a colepit to keep her in clean linnen that he would have allowed her the profits of a windmill for her fans and have presented her once in three years with the sheering of his sheep for her   underpetticoats to which the knight always adds that though he did not care for fine cloaths himself there should not have been a woman in the country better dressed than my lady coverley sir roger perhaps may in this as well as in many other of his devices appear something odd and singular but if the humour of pinmoney prevails i think it would be very proper for every gentleman of an estate to mark out so many acres of it under the title of the pins  l    footnote   to keep her in                                               no                 friday february                        steele      nugis addere

duty incumbent on me to impart it to you in hopes of a   reformation which is only to be effected by a restoration of the   latin to the usual dignity in your papers which of late the greek   to the great displeasure of your female readers has usurpd for tho   the latin has the recommendation of being as unintelligible to them as   the greek yet being written of the same character with their   mothertongue by the assistance of a spellingbook its legible   which quality the greek wants and since the introduction of operas   into this nation the ladies are so charmed with sounds abstracted   from their ideas that they adore and honour the sound of latin as it   is old italian i am a sollicitor for the fair sex and therefore   think my self in that character more likely to be prevalent in

continually   at her window either at work reading taking snuff or putting her   self in some toying posture on purpose to draw my eyes that way the   confession of this vain soldier made me reflect

                     addison    velut si   egregio inspersos reprendas corpore nævos    hor   after what i have said in my last saturdays paper i shall enter on the subject of this without further preface and remark the several defects which appear in the fable the characters the sentiments and the language of miltons paradise lost not doubting but the reader will pardon me if i alledge at the same time whatever may be said for the extenuation of such defects the first imperfection which i shall observe in the fable is that the event of it is unhappy  the fable of every poem is according to aristotles division either simple or implex   it is called simple when there is no change of fortune in it implex when the fortune of the chief actor changes from bad to good or from good to bad the implex fable is thought the most perfect i suppose because it is more proper to stir up the passions of the reader and to surprize him with a greater variety of accidents  the implex fable is therefore of two kinds in the first the chief actor makes his way through a long series of dangers and difficulties till he arrives at honour and prosperity as we see in the story of ulysses   in the second the chief actor in the poem falls from some eminent pitch of honour and prosperity into misery and disgrace thus we see adam and eve sinking from a state of innocence and happiness into the most abject condition of sin and sorrow  the most taking tragedies among the ancients were built on this last sort of implex fable particularly the tragedy of oedipus which proceeds upon a story if we may believe aristotle the most proper for tragedy that could be invented by the wit of man   i have taken some pains in a former paper to shew that this kind of implex fable wherein the event is unhappy is more apt to affect an audience than that of the first kind notwithstanding many excellent pieces among the ancients as well as most of those which have been written of late years in our own country are raised upon contrary plans i must however own that i think this kind of fable which is the most perfect in tragedy is not so proper for an heroic poem  milton seems to have been sensible of this imperfection in his fable and has therefore endeavoured to cure it by several expedients particularly by the mortification which the great adversary of mankind meets with upon his return to the assembly of infernal spirits as it is described in a   beautiful passage of the tenth book and likewise by the vision wherein adam at the close of the poem sees his offspring triumphing over his great enemy and himself restored to a happier paradise than that from which he fell  there is another objection against miltons fable which is indeed almost the same with the former tho placed in a different light namely that the hero in the paradise lost is unsuccessful and by no means a match for his enemies this gave occasion to mr drydens reflection that the devil was in reality miltons hero    i think i have obviated this objection in my first paper the paradise lost is an epic or a narrative poem and he that looks for an hero in it searches for that which milton never intended but   if he will needs fix the name of an hero upon any person in it tis certainly the messiah who is the hero both in the principal action and in the chief episodes   paganism could not furnish out a real action for a fable greater than that of the iliad or æneid and therefore an heathen could not form a higher notion of a poem than one of that kind which they call an heroic whether miltons is not of a sublimer   nature i will not presume to determine it is sufficient that i shew there is in the paradise lost all the greatness of plan regularity of design and masterly beauties which we discover in homer and virgil  i must in the next place observe that milton has interwoven in the texture of his fable some particulars which do not seem to have probability enough for an epic poem particularly in the actions which he ascribes to sin and death and the picture which he draws of the limbo of vanity with other passages in the second book such allegories rather savour of the spirit of spenser and ariosto than of homer and virgil  in the structure of his poem he has likewise admitted of too many digressions it is finely observed by aristotle that the author of an heroic poem should seldom speak himself but throw as much of his work as he can into the mouths of those who are his principal actors    aristotle has given no reason for this precept but i presume it is because the mind of the reader is more awed and elevated when he hears æneas or achilles speak than when virgil or homer talk in their own persons besides that assuming the character of an eminent man is apt to fire the imagination and raise the ideas of the author tully tells us  0 mentioning his dialogue of old age in which cato is the chief speaker that upon a review of it he was agreeably imposed upon and fancied that it was cato and not he himself who uttered his thoughts on that subject  if the reader would be at the pains to see how the story of the iliad and the æneid is delivered by those persons who act in it he will be surprized to find how little in either of these poems proceeds from the authors milton has in the general disposition of his fable very finely observed this great rule insomuch that there is scarce a third part of it which comes from the poet the rest is spoken either by adam and eve or by some good or evil spirit who is engaged either in their destruction or defence  from what has been here observed it appears that digressions are by no means to be allowed of in an epic poem if the poet even in the ordinary course of his narration should speak as little as possible he should certainly never let his narration sleep for the sake of any reflections of his own i have often observed with a secret admiration that the longest reflection in the æneid is in that passage of the tenth book where turnus is represented as dressing himself in the spoils of pallas whom he had slain virgil here lets his fable stand still for thesake of the following remark how is the mind of man ignorant of futurity and unable to bear prosperous fortune with moderation  the time will come when turnus shall wish that he had left the body of pallas untouched and curse the day on which he dressed himself in these spoils  as the great event of the æneid and the death of turnus whom æneas slew because he saw him adorned with the spoils of pallas turns upon this incident virgil went out of his way to make this reflection upon it without which so small a circumstance might possibly have slipped out of his readers memory lucan who was an injudicious poet lets drop his story very frequently for the sake of his unnecessary digressions or his diverticula as scaliger calls them    if he gives us an account of the prodigies which preceded the civil war he declaims upon the occasion and shews how much happier it would be for man if he did not feel his evil fortune before it comes to pass and suffer not only by its real weight but by the apprehension of it miltons complaint for    his blindness his panegyrick on marriage his reflections on adam and eves going naked of the angels eating and several other passages in his poem are liable to the same exception tho i must confess there is so great a beauty in these very digressions that i would not wish them out of his poem  i have in a former paper spoken of the characters of miltons paradise lost and declared my opinion as to the allegorical persons who are introduced in it  if we look into the sentiments i think they are sometimes defective under the following heads first as there are several of them too much pointed and some that degenerate even into punns of this last kind i am afraid is that in the first book where speaking of the pigmies he calls them   the small infantry   warrdon by cranes  another blemish that    appears in some of his thoughts is his frequent allusion to heathen fables which are not certainly of a piece with the divine subject of which he treats i do not find fault with these allusions where the poet himself represents them as fabulous as he does in some places but where he mentions them as truths and matters of fact the limits of my paper will not give me leave to be particular in instances of this kind the reader will easily remark them in his perusal of the poem  a third fault in his sentiments is an unnecessary ostentation of learning which likewise occurs very frequently it is certain that both homer and virgil were masters of all the learning of their times but it shews it self in their works after an indirect and concealed manner milton seems ambitious of letting us know by his excursions on freewill and predestination and his many glances upon history astronomy geography and the like as well as by the terms and phrases he sometimes makes use of that he was acquainted with the whole circle of arts and sciences  if in the last place we consider the language of this great poet we must allow what i have hinted in a former paper that it is often too much laboured and sometimes obscured by old words transpositions and foreign idioms senecas objection to the style of a great author riget ejus oratio nihil in eâ placidum nihil lene is what many criticks make to milton as i cannot wholly refuse it so i have already apologized for it in another paper to which i may further add that miltons sentiments and ideas were so wonderfully sublime that it would have been impossible for him to have represented them in their full strength and beauty without having recourse to these foreign assistances our language sunk under him and was unequal to that greatness of soul which furnished him with such glorious conceptions  a second fault in his language is that he often affects a kind of jingle in his words as in the following passages and many others    and brought into the world a world of woe   begirt th almighty throne   beseeching or besieging    this tempted our attempt    at one slight bound high overleapt all bound  i know there are figures for this kind of speech that some of the greatest ancients have been guilty of it and that aristotle himself has given it a place in his rhetorick among the beauties of that art    but as it is in its self poor and trifling it is i think at present universally exploded by all the masters of polite writing  the last fault which i shall take notice of in miltons style is the frequent use of what the learned call technical words or terms of art it is one of the great beauties of poetry to make hard things intelligible and to deliver what is abstruse of    it self in such easy language as may be understood by ordinary readers besides that the knowledge of a poet should rather seem born with him or inspired than drawn from books and systems i have often wondered how mr dryden could translate a passage out of virgil after the following manner    tack to the larboard and stand off to sea   veer starboard sea and land  milton makes use of larboard in the same manner when he is upon building he mentions doric pillars pilasters cornice freeze architrave when he talks of heavenly bodies you meet with eccliptic and eccentric the trepidation stars dropping from the zenith rays culminating from the equator to which might be added many instances of the like kind in several other arts and sciences  i shall in my next papers    give an account of the many particular beauties in milton which would have been too long to insert under those general heads i have already treated of and with which i intend to conclude this piece of criticism  l    footnote   poetics cap x addison

after speaking of small claimants of the honours of the epic he says    spencer has a better for his fairy queen had his action been   finished or been one and milton if the devil had not been his

that   human in his poem   footnote   or   footnote   episode   footnote   greater   footnote   poetics cap xxv the reason he gives is that when the poet speaks in his own person he is not then the

papers being expressions of his personal appreciation of the several books of paradise lost we may note here that milton would have been quite ready to have his work tried by the test addison has been applying in his letter to samuel hartlib sketching his ideal of a good education he assigns to advanced pupils logic and then    rhetoric taught out of the rules of plato aristotle phalereus   cicero hermogenes longinus to which poetry would be made   subsequent or indeed rather precedent as being less subtile and   fine but more simple sensuous and passionate i mean not here the   prosody of a verse which they could not but have hit on before among   the rudiments of grammar but that sublime art which in aristotles   poetics in horace and the italian commentaries of castelvetro   tasso mazzoni and others teaches what the laws are of a true epic   poem what of a dramatic what of a lyric what decorum is which is   the grand masterpiece to observe this would make them soon perceive

have not reason more than enough do you and the world judge from this   ensuing account which i think will prove the evil to be universal    you must know then that since your reprehension of this female   degeneracy came out ive had a tender of respects from no less than   five persons of tolerable figure too as times go but the misfortune   is that four of the five are professed followers of the mode they   would face me down that all women of good sense ever were and ever   will be latitudinarians in wedlock and always did and will give   and take what they profanely term conjugal liberty of conscience    the two first of them a captain and a merchant to strengthen their   argument pretend to repeat after a couple a brace of ladies of   quality and wit that venus was always kind to mars and what soul   that has the least spark of generosity can deny a man of bravery any   thing and how pitiful a trader that whom no woman but his own wife   will have correspondence and dealings with thus these whilst the   third the country squire confessed that indeed he was surprized   into good breeding and entered into the knowledge of the world   unawares that dining tother day at a gentlemans house the person   who entertained was obliged to leave him with his wife and nieces   where they spoke with so much contempt of an absent gentleman for   being slow at a hint that he had resolved never to be drowsy   unmannerly or stupid for the future at a friends house and on a   hunting morning not to pursue the game either with the husband   abroad or with the wife at home    the next that came was a tradesman no   less full of the age   than the former for he had the gallantry to tell me that at a late   junket which he was invited to the motion being made and the   question being put twas by maid wife and widow resolved nemine   contradicente that a young sprightly journeyman is absolutely   necessary in their way of business to which they had the assent and

been very averse to hear any of them from my observation on   these abovementioned till i hoped some good from the character of   my present admirer a clergyman but i find even amongst them there   are indirect practices in relation to love and our treaty is at   present a little in suspence till some circumstances are cleared   there is a charge against him among the women and the case is this   it is alledged that a certain endowed female would have appropriated   her self to and consolidated her self with a church which my divine   now enjoys or which is the same thing did prostitute her self to   her friends doing this for her that my ecclesiastick to obtain the   one did engage himself to take off the other that lay on hand but   that on his success in the spiritual he again renounced the carnal    i put this closely to him and taxed him with disingenuity he to   clear himself made the subsequent defence and that in the most solemn   manner possible that he was applied to and instigated to accept of a   benefice that a conditional offer thereof was indeed made him at   first but with disdain by him rejected that when nothing as they   easily perceived of this nature could bring him to their purpose   assurance of his being entirely unengaged beforehand and safe from   all their afterexpectations the only stratagem left to draw him in   was given him that pursuant to this the donation it self was without   delay before several reputable witnesses tendered to him gratis   with the open profession of not the least reserve or most minute   condition but that yet immediately after induction his insidious   introducer or her crafty procurer which you will industriously   spread the report which had reached my ears not only in the   neighbourhood of that said church but in london in the university   in mine and his own county and whereever else it might probably   obviate his application to any other woman and so confine him to this   alone and in a word that as he never did make any previous offer of   his service or the least step to her affection so on his discovery   of these designs thus laid to trick him he could not but afterwards   in justice to himself vindicate both his innocence and freedom by   keeping his proper distance    this is his apology and i think i shall be satisfied with it but i   cannot conclude my tedious epistle without recommending to you not   only to resume your former chastisement but to add to your criminals   the simoniacal ladies who seduce the sacred order into the difficulty   of either breaking a mercenary troth made to them whom they ought not   to deceive or by breaking or keeping it offending against him whom   they cannot deceive your assistance and labours of this sort would be   of great benefit

virtue than by the finest rules and precepts of morality in the same manner a representation of those calamities and misfortunes which a weak man suffers from wrong measures and illconcerted schemes of life is apt to make a deeper impression upon our minds than the wisest maxims and instructions that can be given us for avoiding the like follies and indiscretions on our own private conduct it is for this reason that i lay before my reader the following letter and leave it with him to make his own use of it without adding any reflections of my own upon the subject matter     mr spectator    having carefully perused a letter sent you by josiah fribble esq   with your subsequent discourse upon pinmoney i do presume to trouble   you with an account of my own case which i look upon to be no less   deplorable than that of squire fribble i am a person of no   extraction having begun the world with a small parcel of rusty iron   and was for some years commonly known by the name of jack anvil   i   have naturally a very happy genius for getting money insomuch that by   the age of five and twenty i had scraped together four thousand two   hundred pounds five shillings and a few odd pence i then launched   out into considerable business and became a bold trader both by sea   and land which in a few years raised me a very great   fortune   for these my good services i was knighted in the thirty fifth year of   my age and lived with great dignity among my cityneighbours by the   name of sir john anvil being in my temper very ambitious i was now   bent upon making a family and accordingly resolved that my   descendants should have a dash of good blood in their veins in order   to this i made love to the lady mary oddly an indigent young woman   of quality to cut short the marriage treaty i threw her a charte   blanche as our news papers call it desiring her to write upon it her   own terms she was very concise in her demands insisting only that   the disposal of my fortune and the regulation of my family should be   entirely in her hands her father and brothers appeared exceedingly   averse to this match and would not see me for some time but at   present are so well reconciled that they dine with me almost every   day and have borrowed considerable sums of me which my lady mary   very often twits me with when she would shew me how kind her   relations are to me she had no portion as i told you before but   what she wanted in fortune she makes up in spirit she at first   changed my name to sir john envil and at present writes her self mary   enville i have had some children by her whom she has christened with   the sirnames of her family in order as she tells me to wear out the   homeliness of their parentage by the fathers side our eldest son is   the honourable oddly enville esq and our eldest daughter harriot   enville upon her first coming into my family she turned off a parcel   of very careful servants who had been long with me and introduced in   their stead a couple of blackamoors and three or four very genteel   fellows in laced liveries besides her french woman who is   perpetually making a noise in the house in a language which no body   understands except my lady mary she next set her self to reform   every room of my house having glazed all my chimneypieces with   lookingglass and planted every corner with such heaps of china that   i am obliged to move about my own house with the greatest caution and   circumspection for fear of hurting some of our brittle furniture she   makes an illumination once a week with waxcandles in one of the   largest rooms in order as she phrases it to see company at which   time she always desires me to be abroad or to confine my self to the   cockloft that i may not disgrace her among her visitants of quality   her footmen as i told you before are such beaus that i do not much   care for asking them questions when i do they answer me with a sawcy   frown and say that every thing which i find fault with was done by   my lady marys order she tells me that she intends they shall wear   swords with their next liveries having lately observed the footmen of   two or three persons of quality hanging behind the coach with swords   by their sides as soon as the first honeymoon was over i   represented to her the unreasonableness of those daily innovations   which she made in my family but she told me i was no longer to   consider my self as sir john anvil but as her husband and added   with a frown that i did not seem to know who she was i was surprized   to be treated thus after such familiarities as had passed between us   but she has since given me to know that whatever freedoms she may   sometimes indulge me in she expects in general to be treated with the   respect that is due to her birth and quality our children have been   trained up from their infancy with so many accounts of their mothers   family that they know the stories of all the great men and women it   has produced their mother tells them that such an one commanded in   such a sea engagement that their great grandfather had a horse shot   under him at edgehill that their uncle was at the siege of buda and   that her mother danced in a ball at court with the duke of monmouth   with abundance of fiddlefaddle of the same nature i was the other   day a little out of countenance at a question of my little daughter   harriot who asked me with a great deal of innocence why i never   told them of the generals and admirals that had been in my family as   for my eldest son oddly he has been so spirited up by his mother   that if he does not mend his manners i shall go near to disinherit   him he drew his sword upon me before he was nine years old and told   me that he expected to be used like a gentleman upon my offering to   correct him for his insolence my lady mary stept in between us and   told me that i ought to consider there was some difference between   his mother and mine she is perpetually finding out the features of   her own relations in every one of my children tho by the way i   have a little chubfaced boy as like me as he can stare if i durst say   so but what most angers me when she sees me playing with any of them   upon my knee she has begged me more than once to converse with the   children as little as possibly that they may not learn any of my   awkward tricks    you must farther know since i am opening my heart to you that she   thinks her self my superior in sense as much as she is in quality   and therefore treats me like a plain wellmeaning man who does not   know the world she dictates to me in my own business sets me right   in point of trade and if i disagree with her about any of my ships at   sea wonders that i will dispute with her when i know very well that   her great grandfather was a flag officer    to compleat my sufferings she has teazed me for this quarter of a     year last past to remove into one of the squares at the other   end of the town promising for my encouragement that i shall have as   good a cockloft as any gentleman in the square to which the   honourable oddly enville esq always adds like a jackanapes as he   is that he hopes twill be as near the court as possible    in short mr spectator i am so much out of my natural element that   to recover my old way of life i would be content to begin the world   again and be plain jack anvil but alas i am in for life and am   bound to subscribe my self with great sorrow of heart    your humble servant    john enville knt   l    footnote   this has

methinks you should take care to leave no fault unobserved which   concerns the state of marriage the great vexation that i have   observed in it is that the wedded couple seem to want opportunities   of being often enough alone together and are forced to quarrel and be   fond before company mr hotspur and his lady in a room full of their   friends are ever saying something so smart to each other and that   but just within rules that the whole company stand in the utmost   anxiety and suspence for fear of their falling into extremities which   they could not be present at on the other side tom faddle and his   pretty spouse whereever they come are billing at such a rate as they   think must do our hearts good who behold em cannot you possibly   propose a mean between being wasps and doves in publick i should   think if you advised to hate or love sincerely it would be better for   if they would be so discreet as to hate from the very bottom of their   hearts their aversion would be too strong for little gibes every   moment and if they loved with that calm and noble value which dwells   in the heart with a warmth like that of lifeblood they would not be   so impatient of their passion as to fall into observable fondness   this method in each case would save appearances but as those who   offend on the fond side are by much the fewer i would have you begin   with them and go on to take notice of a most impertinent licence   married women take not only to be very loving to their spouses in   publick but also make nauseous allusions to private familiarities   and the like lucina is a lady of the greatest discretion you must   know in the world and withal very much a physician upon the   strength of these two qualities there is nothing she will not speak of   before us virgins and she every day talks with a very grave air in   such a manner as is very improper so much as to be hinted at but to   obviate the greatest extremity those whom they call good bodies   notable people hearty neighbours and the purest goodest company in   the world are the great offenders in this kind here i think i have   laid before you an open field for pleasantry and hope you will shew   these people that at least they are not witty in which you will save   from many a blush a daily sufferer who is very much    your most humble servant   susanna loveworth     mr spectator    in yours of wednesday the  0th past you and your correspondent are   very severe on a sort of men whom you call male coquets but without   any other reason in my apprehension than that of paying a shallow   compliment to the fair sex by accusing some men of imaginary faults   that the women may not seem to be the more faulty sex though at the   same time you suppose there are some so weak as to be imposed upon by   fine things and false addresses i cant persuade my self that your   design is to debar the sexes the benefit of each others conversation   within the rules of honour nor will you i dare say recommend to   em or encourage the common teatable talk much less that of   politicks and matters of state and if these are forbidden subjects of   discourse then as long as there are any women in the world who take   a pleasure in hearing themselves praised and can bear the sight of a   man prostrate at their feet so long i shall make no wonder that there   are those of the other sex who will pay them those impertinent   humiliations we should have few people such fools as to practise   flattery if all were so wise as to despise it i dont deny but you   would do a meritorious act if you could prevent all impositions on   the simplicity of young women but i must confess i dont apprehend   you have laid the fault on the proper person and if i trouble you   with my thoughts upon it i promise my self your pardon such of the   sex as are raw and innocent and most exposed to these attacks have   or their parents are much to blame if they have not one to advise and   guard em and are obliged themselves to take care of em but if   these who ought to hinder men from all opportunities of this sort of   conversation instead of that encourage and promote it the suspicion   is very just that there are some private reasons for it and ill   leave it to you to determine on which side a part is then acted some   women there are who are arrived at years of discretion i mean are got   out of the hands of their parents and governours and are set up for   themselves who yet are liable to these attempts but if these are   prevailed upon you must excuse me if i lay the fault upon them that   their wisdom is not grown with their years my client mr strephon   whom you summoned to declare himself gives you thanks however for   your warning and begs the favour only to inlarge his time for a week   or to the last day of the term and then hell appear gratis and pray   no day over   yours   philanthropes     mr spectator    i was last night to visit a lady who i much esteem and always took   for my friend but met with so very different a reception from what i   expected that i cannot help applying my self to you on this occasion   in the room of that civility and familiarity i used to be treated with   by her an affected strangeness in her looks and coldness in her   behaviour plainly told me i was not the welcome guest which the   regard and tenderness she has often expressed

with any little accomplishments either of body or mind which have once made us remarkable in the world that we endeavour to perswade our selves it is not in the power of time to rob us of them we are eternally pursuing the same methods which first procured us the applauses of mankind it is from this notion that an author writes on tho he is come to dotage without ever considering that his memory is impaired and that he has lost that life and those spirits which formerly raised his fancy and fired his imagination the same folly hinders a man from submitting his behaviour to his age and makes

charms if she now attracts the eyes of any beholders it is only by being remarkably ridiculous even her own sex laugh at her affectation and the men who always enjoy an illnatured pleasure in seeing an imperious beauty humbled and neglected regard her with the same satisfaction that a free nation sees a tyrant in disgrace  will honeycomb who is a great admirer of the gallantries in king charles the seconds reign lately communicated to me a letter written by a wit of that age to his mistress who it seems was a lady of canidias humour and tho i do not always approve of my friend wills taste i liked this letter so well that i took a copy of it with which i shall here present my reader     to cloe   madam    since my waking thoughts have never been able to influence you in my   favour i am resolved to try whether my dreams can make any impression   on you to this end i shall give you an account of a very odd one   which my fancy presented to me last night within a few hours after i   left you    methought i was unaccountably conveyed into the most delicious place   mine eyes ever beheld it was a large valley divided by a river of the   purest water i had ever seen the ground on each side of it rose by an   easie ascent and was covered with flowers of an infinite variety   which as they were reflected in the water doubled the beauties of the   place or rather formed an imaginary scene more beautiful than the   real on each side of the river was a range of lofty trees whose   boughs were loaden with almost as many birds as leaves every tree was   full of harmony    i had not gone far in this pleasant valley when i perceived that it   was terminated by a most magnificent temple the structure was   ancient and regular on the top of it was figured the god saturn in   the same shape and dress that the poets usually represent time    as i was advancing to satisfie my curiosity by a nearer view i was   stopped by an object far more beautiful than any i had before   discovered in the whole place i fancy madam you will easily guess   that this could hardly be any thing but your self in reality it was   so you lay extended on the flowers by the side of the river so that   your hands which were thrown in a negligent posture almost touched   the water your eyes were closed but if your sleep deprived me of the   satisfaction of seeing them it left me at leisure to contemplate   several other charms which disappear when your eyes are open i could   not but admire the tranquility you slept in especially when i   considered the uneasiness you produce in so many others    while i was wholly taken up in these reflections the doors of the   temple flew open with a very great noise and lifting up my eyes i   saw two figures in human shape coming into the valley upon a nearer   survey i found them to be youth and love the first was encircled   with a kind of purple light that spread a glory over all the place   the other held a flaming torch in his hand i could observe that all   the way as they came towards us the colours of the flowers appeared   more lively the trees shot out in blossoms the birds threw   themselves into pairs and serenaded them as they passed the whole   face of nature glowed with new beauties they were no sooner arrived   at the place where you lay when they seated themselves on each side   of you on their approach methought i saw a new bloom arise in your   face and new charms diffuse themselves over your whole person you   appeared more than mortal but to my great surprise continued fast   asleep tho the two deities made several gentle efforts to awaken   you    after a short time youth displaying a pair of wings which i had   not before taken notice of flew off love still remained and holding   the torch which he had in his hand before your face you still   appeared as beautiful as ever the glaring of the light in your eyes   at length awakened you when to my great surprise instead of   acknowledging the favour of the deity you frowned upon him and   struck the torch out of his hand into the river the god after having   regarded you with a look that spoke at once   his pity and   displeasure flew away immediately a kind of gloom overspread the   whole place at the same time i saw an hideous spectre enter at one   end of the valley his eyes were sunk into his head his face was pale   and withered and his skin puckered up in wrinkles as he walked on   the sides of the bank the river froze the flowers faded the trees   shed their blossoms the birds dropped from off the boughs and fell   dead at his feet by these marks i knew him to be oldage you were   seized with the utmost horror and amazement at his approach you   endeavoured to have fled but the phantome caught you in his arms you   may easily guess at the change you suffered in this embrace for my   own part though i am still too full of the frightful   idea i   will not shock you with a description of it i was so startled at the   sight that my sleep immediately left me and i found my self awake at   leisure to consider of a dream which seems too extraordinary to be   without a meaning i am madam with the greatest passion

came to my hands i shall be very glad to find there are many guessed at for emilia     mr spectator      if this paper has the good fortune to be honoured with a place in your   writings i shall be the more pleased because the character of emilia   is not an imaginary but a real one i have industriously obscured the   whole by the addition of one or two circumstances of no consequence   that the person it is drawn from might still be concealed and that   the writer of it might not be in the least suspected and for other     reasons i chuse not to give it the form of a letter but if   besides the faults of the composition there be any thing in it more   proper for a correspondent than the spectator himself to write i   submit it to your better judgment to receive any other model you   think fit   i am sir   your very humble servant      there is nothing which gives one so pleasing a prospect of human     nature as the contemplation of wisdom and beauty the latter is the     peculiar portion of that sex which is therefore called fair but the     happy concurrence of both these excellencies in the same person is     a character too celestial to be frequently met with beauty is an     overweaning selfsufficient thing careless of providing it self     any more substantial ornaments nay so little does it consult its     own interests that it too often defeats it self by betraying that     innocence which renders it lovely and desirable as therefore virtue     makes a beautiful woman appear more beautiful so beauty makes a     virtuous woman really more virtuous whilst i am considering these     two perfections gloriously united in one person i cannot help     representing to my mind the image of emilia      who ever beheld the charming emilia without feeling in his breast     at once the glow of love and the tenderness of virtuous friendship     the unstudied graces of her behaviour and the pleasing accents of     her tongue insensibly draw you on to wish for a nearer enjoyment of     them but even her smiles carry in them a silent reproof to the     impulses of licentious love thus tho the attractives of her     beauty play almost irresistibly upon you and create desire you     immediately stand corrected not by the severity but the decency of     her virtue that sweetness and goodhumour which is so visible in     her face naturally diffuses it self into every word and action a     man must be a savage who at the sight of emilia is not more     inclined to do her good than gratifie himself her person as it is     thus studiously embellished by nature thus adorned with     unpremeditated graces is a fit lodging for a mind so fair and     lovely there dwell rational piety modest hope and chearful     resignation      many of the prevailing passions of mankind do undeservedly pass     under the name of religion which is thus made to express itself in     action according to the nature of the constitution in which it     resides so that were we to make a judgment from appearances one     would imagine religion in some is little better than sullenness and     reserve in many fear in others the despondings of a melancholly     complexion in others the formality of insignificant unaffecting     observances in others severity in others ostentation in emilia it     is a principle founded in reason and enlivened with hope it does     not break forth into irregular fits and sallies of devotion but is     an uniform and consistent tenour of action it is strict without     severity compassionate without weakness it is the perfection of     that good humour which proceeds from the understanding not the     effect of an easy constitution      by a generous sympathy in nature we feel our selves disposed to     mourn when any of our fellowcreatures are afflicted but injured     innocence and beauty in distresses an object that carries in it     something inexpressibly moving it softens the most manly heart with     the tenderest sensations of love and compassion till at length it     confesses its humanity and flows out into tears      were i to relate that part of emilias life which has given her an     opportunity of exerting the heroism of christianity it would make     too sad too tender a story but when i consider her alone in the     midst of her distresses looking beyond this gloomy vale of     affliction and sorrow into the joys of heaven and immortality and     when i see her in conversation thoughtless and easie as if she were     the most happy creature in the world i am transported with     admiration surely never did such a philosophic soul inhabit such a     beauteous form for beauty is often made a privilege against thought     and reflection it laughs at wisdom and will not abide the gravity     of its instructions      were i able to represent emilias virtues in their proper colours     and their due proportions love or flattery might perhaps be thought     to have drawn the picture larger than life but as this is but an     imperfect draught of so excellent a character and as i cannot will     not hope to have any interest in her person all that i can say of     her is but impartial praise extorted from me by the prevailing     brightness of her virtues so rare a pattern of female excellence     ought not to be concealed but should be set out to the view and     imitation of the world for how amiable does virtue appear thus as     it were made visible to us in so fair an example      honorias disposition is of a very different turn her thoughts are     wholly bent upon conquest and arbitrary power that she has some wit     and beauty no body denies and therefore has the esteem of all her     acquaintance as a woman of an agreeable person and conversation but     whatever her husband may think of it that is not sufficient for     honoria she waves that title to respect as a mean acquisition and     demands veneration in the right of an idol for this reason her     natural desire of life is continually checked with an inconsistent     fear of wrinkles and old age      emilia cannot be supposed ignorant of her personal charms tho she     seems to be so but she will not hold her happiness upon so     precarious a tenure whilst her mind is adorned with beauties of a     more exalted and lasting nature when in the full bloom of youth and     beauty we saw her surrounded with a crowd of adorers she took no     pleasure in slaughter and destruction gave no false deluding hopes     which might encrease the torments of her disappointed lovers but     having for some time given to the decency of a virgin coyness and     examined the merit of their several pretensions she at length     gratified her own by resigning herself to the ardent passion of     bromius bromius was then master of many good qualities and a     moderate fortune which was soon after unexpectedly encreased to a     plentiful estate this for a good while proved his misfortune as it     furnished his unexperienced age with the opportunities of evil     company and a sensual life he might have longer wandered in the     labyrinths of vice and folly had not emilias prudent conduct won     him over to the government of his reason her ingenuity has been     constantly employed in humanizing his passions and refining his     pleasures she shewed him by her own example that virtue is     consistent with decent freedoms and good humour or rather that it     cannot subsist without em her good sense readily instructed her     that a silent example and an easie unrepining behaviour will always     be more perswasive than the severity of lectures and admonitions     and that there is so much pride interwoven into the make of human     nature that an obstinate man must only take the hint from another     and then be left to advise and correct himself thus by an artful     train of management and unseen perswasions having at first brought     him not to dislike and at length to be pleased with that which     otherwise he would not have bore to hear of she then knew how to     press and secure this advantage by approving it as his thoughts     and seconding it as his proposal by this means she has gained an     interest in some of his leading passions and made them accessary to     his reformation      there is another particular of emilias conduct which i cant     forbear mentioning to some perhaps it may at first sight appear but     a trifling inconsiderable circumstance but for my part i think it     highly worthy of observation and to be recommended to the     consideration of the fair sex i have often thought wrapping gowns     and dirty linnen with all that huddled oeconomy of dress which     passes under the general name of a mob the bane of conjugal love     and one of the readiest means imaginable to alienate the affection     of an husband especially a fond one i have heard some ladies who     have been surprized by company in such a deshabille apologize for     it after this manner truly i am ashamed to be caught in this     pickle but my husband and i were sitting all alone by our selves     and i did not expect to see such good companythis by the way is a     fine compliment to the good man which tis ten to one but he     returns in dogged answers and a churlish behaviour without knowing     what it is that puts him out of humour      emilias observation teaches her that as little inadvertencies and     neglects cast a blemish upon a great character so the neglect of     apparel even among the most intimate friends does insensibly     lessen their regards to each other by creating a familiarity too     low and contemptible she understands the importance of those things     which the generality account trifles and considers every thing as a     matter of consequence that has the least tendency towards keeping     up or abating the affection of her husband him she esteems as a fit     object to employ her ingenuity in pleasing because he is to be     pleased for life      by the help of these and a thousand other nameless arts which tis     easier for her to practise than for another to express by the     obstinacy of her goodness and unprovoked submission in spight of     all her afflictions and ill usage bromius is become a man of sense     and a kind husband and emilia

acumen    hor    i have seen in the works of a modern philosopher a map of the spots in the sun my last paper of the faults and blemishes in miltons paradise lost may be considered as a piece of the same nature to pursue the allusion as it is observed that among the bright parts of the luminous body above mentioned there are some which glow more intensely and dart a stronger light than others so notwithstanding i have already shewn miltons poem to be very beautiful in general i shall now proceed to take notice of such beauties as appear to me more exquisite than the rest milton has proposed the subject of his poem in the following verses    of mans first disobedience and the fruit   of that forbidden tree whose mortal taste   brought death into the world and all our woe   with loss of eden till one greater man   restore us and regain the blisful seat   sing heavenly muse  these lines are perhaps as plain simple and unadorned as any of the whole poem in which particular the author has conformed himself to the example of homer and the precept of horace  his invocation to a work which turns in a great measure upon the creation of the world is very properly made to the muse who inspired moses in those books from whence our author drew his subject and to the holy spirit who is therein represented as operating after a particular manner in the first production of nature this whole exordium rises very happily into noble language and sentiment as i think the transition to the fable is exquisitely beautiful and natural  the nine days astonishment in which the angels lay entranced after their dreadful overthrow and fall from heaven before they could recover either the use of thought or speech is a noble circumstance and very finely imagined the division of hell into seas of fire and into firm ground impregnated with the same furious element with that particular circumstance of the exclusion of hope from those infernal regions are instances of the same great and fruitful invention  the thoughts in the first speech and description of satan who is one of the principal actors in this poem are wonderfully proper to give us a full idea of him his pride envy and revenge obstinacy despair and impenitence are all of them very artfully interwoven in short his first speech is a complication of all those passions which discover themselves separately in several other of his speeches in the poem the whole part of this great enemy of mankind is filled with such incidents as are very apt to raise and terrifie the readers imagination of this nature in the book now before us is his being the first that awakens out of the general trance with his posture on the burning lake his rising from it and the description of his shield and spear    thus satan talking to his nearest mate   with head uplift above the wave and eyes   that sparkling blazed his other parts beside   prone on the flood extended long and large   lay floating many a rood    forthwith upright he rears from off the pool   his mighty stature on each hand the flames   drivn backward slope their pointing spires and roared   in billows leave ith midst a horrid vale   then with expanded wings he steers his flight   aloft incumbent on the dusky air   that felt unusual weight   his pondrous shield   ethereal temper massie large and round   behind him cast the broad circumference   hung on his shoulders like the moon whose orb   thro optick glass the tuscan artist views   at evning from the top of fesole   or in valdarno to descry new lands   rivers or mountains on her spotted globe   his spear to equal which the tallest pine   hewn on norwegian hills to be the mast   of some great admiral were but a wand   he walkd with to support uneasie steps   over the burning marl  to which we may add his call to the fallen angels that lay plunged and stupified in the sea of fire    he calld so loud that all the hollow deep   of hell resounded  but there is no single passage in the whole poem worked up to a greater sublimity than that wherein his person is described in those celebrated lines   he above the rest   in shape and gesture proudly eminent   stood like a tower c  his sentiments are every way answerable to his character and suitable to a created being of the most exalted and most depraved nature such is that in which he takes possession of his place of torments   hail horrors hail   infernal world and thou profoundest hell   receive thy new possessor one who brings   a mind not to be changed by place or time  and afterwards   here at least   we shall be free thalmighty hath not built   here for his envy will not drive us hence   here we may reign secure and in my choice   to reign is worth ambition tho in hell   better to reign in hell than serve in heavn  amidst those impieties which this enraged spirit utters in other places of the poem the author has taken care to introduce none that is not big with absurdity and incapable of shocking a religious reader his words as the poet himself describes them bearing only a semblance of worth not substance he is likewise with great art described as owning his adversary to be almighty whatever perverse interpretation he puts on the justice mercy and other attributes of the supreme being he frequently confesses his omnipotence that being the perfection he was forced to allow him and the only consideration which could support his pride under the shame of his defeat  nor must i here omit that beautiful circumstance of his bursting out in tears upon his survey of those innumerable spirits whom he had involved in the same guilt and ruin with himself   he now prepared   to speak whereat their doubled ranks they bend   from wing to wing and half enclose him round   with all his peers attention held them mute   thrice he assayed and thrice in spite of scorn   tears such as angels weep burst forth  the catalogue of evil spirits has abundance of learning in it and a very agreeable turn of poetry which rises in a great measure from its   describing the places where they were worshipped by those beautiful marks of rivers so frequent among the ancient poets the author had doubtless in this place homers catalogue of ships and virgils list of warriors in his view the characters of moloch and belial prepare the readers mind for their respective speeches and behaviour in the second and sixth book the account of thammuz is finely romantick and suitable to what we read among the ancients of the worship which was paid to that idol   thammuz came next behind   whose annual wound in lebanon allured   the syrian damsels to lament his fate   in amorous ditties all a summers day   while smooth adonis from his native rock   ran purple to the sea supposed with blood   of thammuz yearly wounded the love tale   infected zions daughters with like heat   whose wanton passions in the sacred porch   ezekiel saw when by the vision led   his eye surveyd the dark idolatries   of alienated judah  the reader will pardon me if i insert as a note on this beautiful passage the account given us by the late ingenious mr maundrell   of this ancient piece of worship and probably the first occasion of such a superstition    we came to a fair large riverdoubtless the ancient river adonis so   famous for the idolatrous rites performed here in lamentation of   adonis we had the fortune to see what may be supposed to be the   occasion of that opinion which lucian relates concerning this river   viz that this stream at certain seasons of the year especially   about the feast of adonis is of a bloody colour which the heathens   looked upon as proceeding from a kind of sympathy in the river for the   death of adonis who was killed by a wild boar in the mountains out   of which this stream rises something like this we saw actually come   to pass for the water was staind to a surprizing redness and as we   observd in travelling had discolourd the sea a great way into a   reddish hue occasiond doubtless by a sort of minium or red earth   washed into the river by the violence of the rain and not by any   stain from adoniss blood  the passage in the catalogue explaining the manner how spirits transform themselves by contractions or enlargement of their dimensions is introduced with great judgment to make way for several surprizing accidents in the sequel of the poem there follows one at the very end of the first book which is what the french criticks call marvellous but at the same time probable by reason of the passage last mentioned as soon as the infernal palace is finished we are told the multitude and rabble of spirits immediately shrunk themselves into a small compass that there might be room for such a numberless assembly in this capacious hall but it is the poets refinement upon this thought which i most admire and which is indeed very noble in its self for he tells us that notwithstanding the vulgar among the fallen spirits contracted their forms those of the first rank and dignity still preserved their natural dimensions    thus incorporeal spirits to smallest forms   reduced their shapes immense and were at large   though without number still amidst the hall   of that infernal court but far within   and in their own dimensions like themselves   the great seraphick lords and cherubim   in close recess and secret conclave sate   a thousand demygods on golden seats   frequent and full  the character of mammon and the description of the pandæmonium are full of beauties  there are several other strokes in the first book wonderfully poetical and instances of that sublime genius so peculiar to the author such is the description of azazels stature and of the infernal standard which he unfurls as also of that ghastly light by which the fiends appear to one another in their place of torments    the seat of desolation void of light   save what the glimmring of those livid flames   casts pale and dreadful  the shout of the whole host of fallen angels when drawn up in battel array   the universal host up sent   a shout that tore hells concave and beyond   frighted the reign of chaos and old night  the review which the leader makes of his infernal army   he thro the armed files   darts his experiencd eye and soon traverse   the whole battalion mews their order due   their visages and stature as of gods   their number last he sums and now his heart   distends with pride and hardning in his strength   glories  the flash of light which appeard upon the drawing of their swords    he spake and to confirm his words outflew   millions of flaming swords drawn from the thighs   of mighty cherubim the sudden blaze   far round illumind hell  the sudden production of the pandæmonium    anon out of the earth a fabrick huge   rose like an exhalation with the sound   of dulcet symphonies and voices sweet  the artificial illuminations made in it   from the arched roof   pendent by subtle magick many a row   of starry lamps and blazing crescets fed   with naphtha and asphaltus yielded light   as from a sky  there are also several noble similes and allusions in the first book of paradise lost and here i must observe that when milton alludes either to things or persons he never quits his simile till it rises to some very great idea which is often foreign to the occasion that gave birth to it the resemblance does not perhaps last above a line or two but the poet runs on with the hint till he has raised out of it some glorious image or sentiment proper to inflame the mind of the reader and to give it that sublime kind of entertainment which is suitable to the nature of an heroick poem those who are acquainted with homers and virgils way of writing cannot but be pleased with this kind of structure in miltons similitudes i am the more particular on this head because ignorant readers who have formed their taste upon the quaint similes and little turns of wit which are so much in vogue among modern poets cannot relish these beauties which are of a much higher nature and are therefore apt to censure miltons comparisons in which they do not see any surprizing points of likeness monsieur perrault was a man of this viciated relish and for that very reason has endeavoured to turn into ridicule several of homers similitudes which he calls comparisons a longue queue longtails comparisons   i shall conclude this paper on the first book of milton with the answer which monsieur boileau makes to perrault on this occasion    comparisons says he in odes and epic poems are not introduced only   to illustrate and embellish the discourse but to amuse and relax the   mind of the reader by frequently disengaging him from too painful an   attention to the principal subject and by leading him into other   agreeable images homer says he excelled in this particular whose   comparisons abound with such images of nature as are proper to relieve   and diversifie his subjects he continually instructs the reader and   makes him take notice even in objects which are every day before our   eyes of such circumstances as we should not otherwise have observed  to this he adds as a maxim universally acknowledged    that it is not necessary in poetry for the points of the comparison   to correspond with one another exactly but that a general resemblance   is sufficient and that too much nicety in this particular favours of   the rhetorician and epigrammatist  in short if we look into the conduct of homer virgil and milton as the great fable is the soul of each poem so to give their works an agreeable variety their episodes are so many short fables and their similes so many short episodes to which you may add if you please that their metaphors are so many short similes if the reader considers the comparisons in the first book of milton of the sun in an eclipse of the sleeping leviathan of the bees swarming about their hive of the fairy dance in the view wherein i have here placed

years indulged a passion for a young lady of age and   quality suitable to my own but very much superior in fortune it is   the fashion with parents how justly i leave you to judge to make all

i reaped   from it towards the better conduct of my life a certain complacency   to all the world a strong desire to oblige whereever it lay in my   power and a circumspect behaviour in all my words

certain persons of   monmouthstreet and longlane who by the strength of their arms and   loudness of their throats draw off the regard of all passengers from   your said petitioners from which violence they are distinguished by   the name of the worriers    that while your petitioners stand ready to receive passengers with a   submissive bow and repeat with a gentle voice ladies what do you   want pray look in here the worriers reach out their hands at   pistolshot and seize the customers at arms length    that while the fawners strain and relax the muscles of their faces in   making distinction between a spinster in a coloured scarf and an   handmaid in a strawhat the worriers use the same roughness to both   and prevail upon the easiness of the passengers to the impoverishment   of your petitioners    your petitioners therefore most humbly pray that the worriers may not   be permitted to inhabit the politer parts of the town and that   roundcourt may remain a receptacle for buyers of a more soft   education    and your petitioners c   the petition of the newexchange concerning the arts of buying and selling and particularly valuing goods by the complexion of the seller

tempus eget    virg    our late newspapers being full of the project now on foot in the court of france for establishing a political academy and i my self having received letters from several virtuosos among my foreign correspondents which give some light into that affair i intend to make it the subject of this days speculation a general account of this project may be met with in the daily courant of last friday in the following words translated from the gazette of amsterdam    paris february      tis confirmed that the king has resolved to establish a new academy   for politicks of which the marquis de torcy minister and secretary   of state is to be protector six academicians are to be chosen   endowed with proper talents for beginning to form this academy into   which no person is to be admitted under twentyfive years of age they   must likewise each have an estate of two thousand livres a year   either in possession or to come to em by inheritance the king will   allow to each a pension of a thousand livres they are likewise to   have able masters to teach em the necessary sciences and to instruct   them in all the treaties of peace alliance and others which have   been made in several ages past these members are to meet twice a week   at the louvre from this seminary are to be chosen secretaries to   ambassies who by degrees may advance to higher employments  cardinal richelieus politicks made france the terror of europe the statesmen who have appeared in the nation of late years have on the contrary rendered it either the pity or contempt of its neighbours the cardinal erected that famous academy which has carried all the parts of polite learning to the greatest height his chief design in that institution was to divert the men of genius from meddling with politicks a province in which he did not care to have any one else interfere with him on the contrary the marquis de torcy seems resolved to make several young men in france as wise as himself and is therefore taken up at present in establishing a nursery of statesmen  some private letters add that there will also be erected a seminary of petticoat politicians who are to be brought up at the feet of madam de maintenon and to be dispatched into foreign courts upon any emergencies of state but as the news of this last project has not been yet confirmed i shall take no farther notice of it  several of my readers may doubtless remember that upon the conclusion of the last war which had been carried on so successfully by the enemy their generals were many of them transformed into ambassadors but the conduct of those who have commanded in the present war has it seems brought so little honour and advantage to their great monarch that he is resolved to trust his affairs no longer in the hands of those military gentlemen  the regulations of this new academy very much deserve our attention the students are to have in possession or reversion an estate of two thousand french livres per annum which as the present exchange runs will amount to at least one hundred and twenty six pounds english this with the royal allowance of a thousand livres will enable them to find themselves in coffee and snuff not to mention newspapers pen and ink wax and wafers with the like necessaries for politicians  a man must be at least five and twenty before he can be initiated into the mysteries of this academy tho there is no question but many grave persons of a much more advanced age who have been constant readers of the paris gazette will be glad to begin the world anew and enter themselves upon this list of politicians  the society of these hopeful young gentlemen is to be under the direction of six professors who it seems are to be speculative statesmen and drawn out of the body of the royal academy these six wise masters according to my private letters are to have the following parts allotted them  the first is to instruct the students in state legerdemain as how to take off the impression of a seal to split a wafer to open a letter to fold it up again with other the like ingenious feats of dexterity and art when the students have accomplished themselves in this part of their profession they are to be delivered into the hands of their second instructor who is a kind of posturemaster  this artist is to teach them how to nod judiciously to shrug up their shoulders in a dubious case to connive with either eye and in a word the whole practice of political grimace  the third is a sort of languagemaster who is to instruct them in the style proper for a foreign minister in his ordinary discourse and to the end that this college of statesmen may be thoroughly practised in the political style they are to make use of it in their common conversations before they are employed either in foreign or domestick affairs if one of them asks another what aclock it is the other is to answer him indirectly and if possible to turn off the question if he is desired to change a louis dor he must beg time to consider of it if it be enquired of him whether the king is at versailles or marly he must answer in a whisper if he be asked the news of the late gazette or the subject of a proclamation he is to reply that he has not yet read it or if he does not care for explaining himself so far he needs only draw his brow up in wrinkles or elevate the left shoulder  the fourth professor is to teach the whole art of political characters and hieroglyphics and to the end that they may be perfect also in this practice they are not to send a note to one another tho it be but to borrow a tacitus or a machiavil which is not written in cypher  their fifth professor it is thought will be chosen out of the society of jesuits and is to be well read in the controversies of probable doctrines mental reservation and the rights of princes this learned man is to instruct them in the grammar syntax and construing part of treatylatin how to distinguish between the spirit and the letter and likewise demonstrate how the same form of words may lay an obligation upon any prince in europe different from that which it lays upon his most christian majesty he is likewise to teach them the art of finding flaws loopholes and evasions in the most solemn compacts and particularly a great rabbinical secret revived of late years by the fraternity of jesuits namely that contradictory interpretations of the same article may both of them be true and valid  when our statesmen are sufficiently improved by these several instructors they are to receive their last polishing from one who is to act among them as master of the ceremonies this gentleman is to give them lectures upon those important points of the elbow chair and the stair head to instruct them in the different situations of the righthand and to furnish them with bows and inclinations of all sizes measures and proportions in short this professor is to give the society their stiffening and infuse into their manners that beautiful political starch which may qualifie them for levees conferences visits and make them shine in what vulgar minds are apt to look upon as trifles i have not yet heard any further particulars which are to be observed in this society of unfledged statesmen but i must confess had i a son of five and twenty that should take it into his head at that age to set up for a politician i think i should go near to disinherit him for a blockhead besides i should be apprehensive lest the same arts which are to enable him to negotiate between potentates might a little infect his ordinary behaviour between man and man there is no question but these young machiavils will in a little time turn their college upsidedown with plots and stratagems and lay as many schemes to circumvent one another in a frog or a sallad as they may hereafter put in practice to overreach a neighbouring prince or state  we are told that the spartans tho they punished theft in their young men when it was discovered looked upon it as honourable if it succeeded provided the conveyance was clean and unsuspected a youth might afterwards boast of it this say the historians was to keep them sharp and to hinder them from being imposed upon either in their publick or private negotiations whether any such relaxations of morality such little jeux desprit ought not to be allowed in this intended seminary of politicians i shall leave to the wisdom of their founder  in the mean time we have fair warning given us by this doughty body of statesmen and as sylla saw many mariuss in cæsar so i think we may discover many torcys in this college of academicians whatever we think of our selves i am afraid neither our smyrna or st jamess will be a match for it our coffeehouses are indeed very good institutions but whether or no these our british schools of politicks may furnish out as able envoys and secretaries as an academy that is set apart for that purpose will deserve our serious consideration especially if we remember that our country is more famous for producing men of integrity than statesmen and that on the contrary french truth and british policy make a conspicuous figure in nothing as the earl of rochester has very well observed in his admirable poem upon that barren subject  l                                               no  0

and therefore deserves a consolatory discourse on the   subject i was within this halfyear in the possession of as much   beauty and as many lovers as any young lady in england but my   admirers have left me and i cannot complain of their behaviour i   have within that time had the smallpox and this face which   according to many amorous epistles which i have by me was the seat   of all that is beautiful in woman is now disfigured with scars it   goes to the very soul of me to speak what i really think of my face   and tho i think i did not overrate my beauty while i had it it has   extremely advancd in its value with me now it is lost there is one   circumstance which makes my case very particular the ugliest fellow   that ever pretended to me was and is most in my favour and he treats   me at present the most unreasonably if you could make him return an   obligation which he owes me in liking a person that is not   amiablebut there is i fear no possibility of making passion move   by the rules of reason and gratitude but say what you can to one who   has survived her self and knows not how to act in a new being my   lovers are at the feet of my rivals my rivals are every day bewailing   me and i cannot enjoy what i am by reason of the distracting   reflection upon what i was consider the woman i was did not die of   old age but i was taken off in the prime of my youth and according   to the course of nature may have forty years afterlife to come i   have nothing of my self left which i like but that   i am sir   your most humble servant   parthenissa   when lewis of france had lost the battle of ramelies the addresses to him at that time were full of his fortitude and they turned his misfortune to his glory in that during his prosperity he could never have manifested his heroick constancy under distresses and so the world had lost the most eminent part of his character parthenissas condition gives her the same opportunity and to resign conquests is a task as difficult in a beauty as an hero in the very entrance upon this work she must burn all her loveletters or since she is so candid as not to call her lovers who follow her no longer unfaithful it would be a very good beginning of a new life from that of a beauty to send them back to those who writ them with this honest inscription articles of a marriage treaty broken off by the smallpox i have known but one instance where a matter of this kind went on after a like misfortune where the lady who was a woman of spirit writ this billet to her lover    sir   if you flattered me before i had this terrible malady pray come and   see me now but if you sincerely liked me stay away for i am not the   same   corinna   the lover thought there was something so sprightly in her behaviour that he answered    madam   i am not obliged since you are not the same woman to let you know   whether i flattered you or not but i assure you i do not when i   tell you i now like you above all your sex and hope you will bear   what may befall me when we are both one as well as you do what   happens to your self now you are single therefore i am ready to take   such a spirit for my companion as soon as you please   amilcar  if parthenissa can now possess her own mind and think as little of her beauty as she ought to have done when she had it there will be no great diminution of her charms and if she was formerly affected too much with them an easie behaviour will more than make up for the loss of them take the whole sex together and you find those who have the strongest possession of mens hearts are not eminent for their beauty you see it often happen that those who engage men to the greatest violence are such as those who are strangers to them would take to be remarkably defective for that end the fondest lover i know said to me one day in a crowd of women at an entertainment of musick you have often heard me talk of my beloved that woman there continued he smiling when he had fixed my eye is her very picture the lady he shewed me was by much the least remarkable for beauty of any in the whole assembly but having my curiosity extremely raised i could not keep my eyes off of her her eyes at last met mine and with a sudden surprize she looked round her to see who near her was remarkably handsome that i was gazing at this little act explaind the secret she did not understand herself for the object of love and therefore she was so the lover is a very honest plain man and what charmed him was a person that goes along with him in the cares and joys of life not taken up with her self but sincerely attentive with a ready and chearful mind to accompany him in either  i can tell parthenissa for her comfort that the beauties generally speaking are the most impertinent and disagreeable of women an apparent desire of admiration a reflection upon their own merit and a precious behaviour in their general conduct are almost inseparable accidents in beauties all you obtain of them is granted to importunity and sollicitation for what did not deserve so much of your time and you recover from the possession of it as out of a dream  you are ashamed of the vagaries of fancy which so strangely misled you and your admiration of a beauty merely as such is inconsistent with a tolerable reflection upon your self the chearful goodhumoured creatures into whose heads it never entred that they could make any man unhappy are the persons formed for making men happy theres miss liddy can dance a jigg raise paste write a good hand keep an account give a reasonable answer and do as she is bid while her elder sister madam martha is out of humour has the spleen learns by reports of people of higher quality new ways of being uneasie and displeased and this happens for no reason in the world but that poor liddy knows she has no such thing as a certain negligence that is so becoming that there is not i know not what in her air and that if she talks like a fool there is no one will say well i know not what it is but every thing pleases when she speaks it  ask any of the husbands of your great beauties and theyll tell you that they hate their wives nine hours of every day they pass together there is such a particularity for ever affected by them that they are incumbered with their charms in all they say or do they pray at publick devotions as they are beauties they converse on ordinary occasions as they are beauties ask belinda what it is a clock and she is at a stand whether so great a beauty should answer you in a word i think instead of offering to administer consolation to parthenissa i should congratulate her metamorphosis and however she thinks she was not in the least insolent in the prosperity of her charms she was enough so to find she may make her self a much more agreeable creature in her present adversity the endeavour to please is highly promoted by a consciousness that the approbation of the person you would be agreeable to is a favour you do not deserve for in this case assurance of success is the most certain way to disappointment goodnature will always supply the absence of beauty but beauty cannot long supply the absence of goodnature  p s  madam february    i have yours of this day wherein you twice bid me not to disoblige you but you must explain yourself further before i know what to do your most obedient servant the

publick      sir   though i believe none of your readers more admire your agreeable   manner of working up trifles than my self yet as your speculations   are now swelling into volumes and will in all probability pass down   to future ages methinks i would have no single subject in them   wherein the general good of mankind is concernd left unfinished    i have a long time expected with great impatience that you would   enlarge upon the ordinary mistakes which are committed in the   education of our children i the more easily flattered my self that   you would one time or other resume this consideration because you   tell us that your    th paper was only composed of a few broken hints   but finding myself hitherto disappointed i have venturd to send you   my own thoughts on this subject    i remember pericles in his famous oration at the funeral of those   athenian young men who perished in the samian expedition has a   thought very much celebrated by several ancient criticks namely that   the loss which the commonwealth suffered by the destruction of its   youth was like the loss which the year would suffer by the   destruction of the spring the prejudice which the publick sustains   from a wrong education of children is an evil of the same nature as   it in a manner starves posterity and defrauds our country of those   persons who with due care might make an eminent figure in their   respective posts of life    i have seen a book written by juan huartes  a spanish physician   entitled examen de ingenios wherein he lays it down as one of his   first positions that nothing but nature can qualifie a man for   learning and that without a proper temperament for the particular art   or science which he studies his utmost pains and application   assisted by the ablest masters will be to no purpose    he illustrates this by the example of tullys son marcus    cicero in order to accomplish his son in that sort of learning which   he designed him for sent him to athens the most celebrated academy   at that time in the world and where a vast concourse out of the most   polite nations could not but furnish a young gentleman with a   multitude of great examples and accidents that might insensibly have   instructed him in his designed studies he placed him under the care   of cratippus who was one of the greatest philosophers of the age   and as if all the books which were at that time written had not been   sufficient for his use he composed others on purpose for him   notwithstanding all this history informs us that marcus proved a   meer blockhead and that nature who it seems was even with the son   for her prodigality to the father rendered him incapable of improving   by all the rules of eloquence the precepts of philosophy his own   endeavours and the most refined conversation in athens this author   therefore proposes that there should be certain tryers or examiners   appointed by the state to inspect the genius of every particular boy   and to allot him the part that is most suitable to his natural   talents    plato in one of his dialogues tells us that socrates who was the   son of a midwife used to say that as his mother tho she was very   skilful in her profession could not deliver a woman unless she was   first with child so neither could he himself raise knowledge out of a   mind where nature had not planted it    accordingly the method this philosopher took of instructing his   scholars by several interrogatories or questions was only helping the   birth and bringing their own thoughts to light    the spanish doctor above mentioned as his speculations grow more   refined asserts that every kind of wit has a particular science   corresponding to it and in which alone it can be truly excellent as   to those geniuss which may seem to have an equal aptitude for   several things he regards them as so many unfinished pieces of nature   wrought off in haste    there are indeed but very few to whom nature has been so unkind   that they are not capable of shining in some science or other there   is a certain byass towards knowledge in every mind which may be   strengthened and improved by proper applications    the story of clavius   is very well known he was entered in a   college of jesuits and after having been tryed at several parts of   learning was upon the point of being dismissed as an hopeless   blockhead till one of the fathers took it into his head to make an   assay of his parts in geometry which it seems hit his genius so   luckily that he afterwards became one of the greatest mathematicians   of the age it is commonly thought that the sagacity of these fathers   in discovering the talent of a young student has not a little   contributed to the figure which their order has made in the world    how different from this manner of education is that which prevails in   our own country where nothing is more usual than to see forty or   fifty boys of several ages tempers and inclinations ranged together   in the same class employed upon the same authors and enjoyned the   same tasks whatever their natural genius may be they are all to be   made poets historians and orators alike they are all obliged to   have the same capacity to bring in the same tale of verse and to   furnish out the same portion of prose every boy is bound to have as   good a memory as the captain of the form to be brief instead of   adapting studies to the particular genius of a youth we expect from   the young man that he should adapt his genius to his studies this i   must confess is not so much to be imputed to the instructor as to   the parent who will never be brought to believe that his son is not   capable of performing as much as his neighbours and that he may not   make him whatever he has a mind to    if the present age is more laudable than those which have gone before   it in any single particular it is in that generous care which several   welldisposed persons have taken in the education of poor children   and as in these charityschools there is no place left for the   overweening fondness of a parent the directors of them would make   them beneficial to the publick if they considered the precept which i   have been thus long inculcating they might easily by well examining   the parts of those under their inspection make a just distribution of   them into proper classes and divisions and allot to them this or that   particular study as their genius qualifies them for professions   trades handicrafts or service by sea or land    how is this kind of regulation wanting in the three great   professions    dr south complaining of persons who took upon them holy orders tho   altogether unqualified for the sacred function says somewhere that   many a man runs his head against a pulpit who might have done his   country excellent service at a ploughtail    in like manner many a lawyer who makes but an indifferent figure at   the bar might have made a very elegant waterman and have shined at   the temple stairs tho he can get no business in the house    i have known a corncutter who with a right education would have   been an excellent physician    to descend lower are not our streets filled with sagacious draymen   and politicians in liveries we have several taylors of six foot high   and meet with many a broad pair of shoulders that are thrown away upon   a barber when perhaps at the same time we see a pigmy porter reeling   under a burthen who might have managed a needle with much dexterity   or have snapped his fingers with great ease to himself and advantage   to the publick    the spartans tho they acted with the spirit which i am here   speaking of carried it much farther than what i propose among them   it was not lawful for the father himself to bring up his children   after his own fancy as soon as they were seven years old they were   all listed in several companies and disciplined by the publick the   old men were spectators of their performances who often raised   quarrels among them and set them at strife with one another that by   those early discoveries they might see how their several talents lay   and without any regard to their quality dispose of them accordingly   for the service of the commonwealth by this means sparta soon became   the mistress of greece and famous through the whole world for her   civil and military discipline    if you think this letter deserves a place among your speculations i   may perhaps trouble you with some other thoughts on the same subject   i am

honestly and as it is natural to study what one likes i have   industriously applied my self to understand them the present   circumstance relating to them is that i think there wants under you   as spectator a person to be distinguished and vested in the power and   quality of a censor on marriages i lodge at the temple and know by   seeing women come hither and afterwards observing them conducted by   their council to judges chambers that there is a custom in case of   making conveyance of a wifes estate that she is carried to a judges   apartment and left alone with him to be examined in private whether   she has not been frightened or sweetned by her spouse into the act she   is going to do or whether it is of her own free will now if this be   a method founded upon reason and equity why should there not be also   a proper officer for examining such as are entring into the state of   matrimony whether they are forced by parents on one side or moved by   interest only on the other to come together and bring forth such   awkward heirs as are the product of half love and constrained   compliances there is no body though i say it my self would be   fitter for this office than i am for i am an ugly fellow of great wit   and sagacity my father was an hail countrysquire my mother a witty   beauty of no fortune the match was made by consent of my mothers

caligine mersas    virg    i have before observed in general that the persons whom milton introduces into his poem always discover such sentiments and behaviour as are in a peculiar manner conformable to their respective characters every circumstance in their speeches and actions is with great justness and delicacy adapted to the persons who speak and act as the poet very much excels in this consistency of his characters i shall beg leave to consider several passages of the second book in this light that superior greatness and mockmajesty which is ascribed to the prince of the fallen angels is admirably preserved in the beginning of this book his opening and closing the debate his taking on himself that great enterprize at the thought of which the whole infernal assembly trembled his encountering the hideous phantom who guarded the gates of hell and appeared to him in all his terrors are instances of that proud and daring mind which could not brook submission even to omnipotence    satan was now at hand and from his seat   the monster moving onward came as fast   with horrid strides hell trembled as he strode   th undaunted fiend what this might be admird   admired not feard  the same boldness and intrepidity of behaviour discovers it self in the several adventures which he meets with during his passage through the regions of unformed matter and particularly in his address to those tremendous powers who are described as presiding over it  the part of moloch is likewise in all its circumstances full of that fire and fury which distinguish this spirit from the rest of the fallen angels he is described in the first book as besmeared with the blood of human sacrifices and delighted with the tears of parents and the cries of children in the second book he is marked out as the fiercest spirit that fought in heaven and if we consider the figure which he makes in the sixth book where the battle of the angels is described we find it every way answerable to the same furious enraged character   where the might of gabriel fought   and with fierce ensigns piercd the deep array   of moloc furious king who him defyd   and at his chariot wheels to drag him bound   threatened nor from the holy one of heavn   refraind his tongue blasphemous but anon   down cloven to the waste with shatterd arms   and uncouth pain fled bellowing  it may be worth while to observe that milton has represented this violent impetuous spirit who is hurried only by such precipitate passions as the first that rises in that assembly to give his opinion upon their present posture of affairs accordingly he declares himself abruptly for war and appears incensed at his companions for losing so much time as even to deliberate upon it all his sentiments are rash audacious and desperate such is that of arming themselves with their tortures and turning their punishments upon him who inflicted them   no let us rather chuse   armd with hell flames and fury all at once   oer heavens high towrs to force resistless way   turning our tortures into horrid arms   against the torturer when to meet the noise   of his almighty engine he shall hear   infernal thunder and for lightning see   black fire and horror shot with equal rage   among his angels and his throne it self   mixt with tartarean sulphur and strange fire   his own invented torments  his preferring annihilation to shame or misery is also highly suitable to his character as the comfort he draws from their disturbing the peace of heaven that if it be not victory it is revenge is a sentiment truly diabolical and becoming the bitterness of this implacable spirit  belial is described in the first book as the idol of the lewd and luxurious he is in the second book pursuant to that description characterised as timorous and slothful and if we look in the sixth book we find him celebrated in the battel of angels for nothing but that scoffing speech which he makes to satan on their supposed advantage over the enemy as his appearance is uniform and of a piece in these three several views we find his sentiments in the infernal assembly every way conformable to his character such are his apprehensions of a second battel his horrors of annihilation his preferring to be miserable rather than not to be i need not observe that the contrast of thought in this speech and that which precedes it gives an agreeable variety to the debate  mammons character is so fully drawn in the first book that the poet adds nothing to it in the second we were before told that he was the first who taught mankind to ransack the earth for gold and silver and that he was the architect of pandæmonium or the infernal place where the evil spirits were to meet in council his speech in this book is every way suitable to so depraved a character how proper is that reflection of their being unable to taste the happiness of heaven were they actually there in the mouth of one who while he was in heaven is said to have had his mind dazled with the outward pomps and glories of the place and to have been more intent on the riches of the pavement than on the beatifick vision i shall also leave the reader to judge how agreeable the following sentiments are to the same character   this deep world   of darkness do we dread how oft amidst   thick cloud and dark doth heavns allruling sire   chuse to reside his glory umobscured   and with the majesty of darkness round   covers his throne from whence deep thunders roar   mustering their rage and heavn resembles hell   as he our darkness cannot we his light   imitate when we please this desart soil   wants not her hidden lustre gems and gold   nor want we skill or art from whence to raise   magnificence and what can heavn shew more  beelzebub who is reckoned the second in dignity that fell and is in the first book the second that awakens out of the trance and confers with satan upon the situation of their affairs maintains his rank in the book now before us there is a wonderful majesty described in his rising up to speak he acts as a kind of moderator between the two opposite parties and proposes a third undertaking which the whole assembly gives into the motion he makes of detaching one of their body in search of a new world is grounded upon a project devised by satan and cursorily proposed by him in the following lines of the first book    space may produce new worlds whereof so rife   there went a fame in heavn that he erelong   intended to create and therein plant   a generation whom his choice regard   should favour equal to the sons of heaven   thither if but to pry shall be perhaps   our first eruption thither or elsewhere   for this infernal pit shall never hold   celestial spirits in bondage nor th abyss   long under darkness cover but these thoughts   full counsel must mature  it is on this project that beelzebub grounds his proposal   what if we find   some easier enterprise there is a place   if ancient and prophetick fame in heavn   err not another world the happy seat   of some new race calld man about this time   to be created like to us though less   in power and excellence but favoured more   of him who rules above so was his will   pronouncd among the gods and by an oath   that shook heavns whole circumference confirmd  the reader may observe how just it was not to omit in the first book the project upon which the whole poem turns as also that the prince of the fallen angels was the only proper person to give it birth and that the next to him in dignity was the fittest to second and support it  there is besides i think something wonderfully beautiful and very apt to affect the readers imagination in this ancient prophecy or report in heaven concerning the creation of man nothing could shew more the dignity of the species than this tradition which ran of them before their existence they are represented to have been the talk of heaven before they were created virgil in compliment to the roman commonwealth makes the heroes of it appear in their state of preexistence but milton does a far greater honour to mankind in general as he gives us a glimpse of them even before they are in being  the rising of this great assembly is described in a very sublime and poetical manner    their rising all at once was as the sound   of thunder heard remote  the diversions of the fallen angels with the particular account of their place of habitation are described with great pregnancy of thought and copiousness of invention the diversions are every way suitable to beings who had nothing left them but strength and knowledge misapplied such are their contentions at the race and in feats of arms with their entertainment in the following lines    others with vast typhæan rage more fell   rend up both rocks and hills and ride the air   in whirlwind hell scarce holds the wild uproar  their musick is employed in celebrating their own criminal exploits and their discourse in sounding the unfathomable depths of fate freewill and foreknowledge  the several circumstances in the description of hell are finely imagined as the four rivers which disgorge themselves into the sea of fire the extreams of cold and heat and the river of oblivion the monstrous animals produced in that infernal world are represented by a single line which gives us a more horrid idea of them than a much longer description would have done   nature breeds   perverse all monstrous all prodigious things   abominable inutterable and worse   than fables yet have feignd or fear conceivd   gorgons and hydras and chimeras dire  this episode of the fallen spirits and their place of habitation comes in very happily to unbend the mind of the reader from its attention to the debate an ordinary poet would indeed have spun out so many circumstances to a great length and by that means have weakned instead of illustrated the principal fable  the flight of satan to the gates of hell is finely imaged i have already declared my opinion of the allegory concerning sin and death which is however a very finished piece in its kind when it is not considered as a part of an epic poem the genealogy of the several persons is contrived with great delicacy sin is the daughter of satan and death the offspring of sin the incestuous mixture between sin and death produces those monsters and hellhounds which from time to time enter into their mother and tear the bowels of her who gave them birth these are the terrors of an evil conscience and the proper fruits of sin which naturally rise from the apprehensions of death this last beautiful moral is i think clearly intimated in the speech of sin where complaining of this her dreadful issue she adds    before mine eyes in opposition sits   grim death my son and foe who sets them on   and me his parent would full soon devour   for want of other prey but that he knows   his end with mine involvd  i need not mention to the reader the beautiful circumstance in the last part of this quotation he will likewise observe how naturally the three persons concerned in this allegory are tempted by one common interest to enter into a confederacy together and how properly sin is made the portress of hell and the only being that can open the gates to that world of tortures  the descriptive part of this allegory is likewise very strong and full of sublime ideas the figure of death the regal crown upon his head his menace of satan his advancing to the combat the outcry at his birth are circumstances too noble to be past over in silence and extreamly suitable to this king of terrors i need not mention the justness of thought which is observed in the generation of these several symbolical persons that sin was produced upon the first revolt of satan that death appeard soon after he was cast into hell and that the terrors of conscience were conceived at the gate of this place of torments the description of the gates is very poetical as the opening of them is full of miltons spirit   on a sudden open fly   with impetuous recoil and jarring sound   th infernal doors and on their hinges grate   harsh thunder that the lowest bottom shook   of erebus she opend but to shut   excelld her powr the gates wide open stood   that with extended wings a bannerd host   under spread ensigns marching might pass through   with horse and chariots rankd in loose array   so wide they stood and like a furnace mouth   cast forth redounding smoak and ruddy flame  in satans voyage through the chaos there are several imaginary persons described as residing in that immense waste of matter this may perhaps be conformable to the taste of those criticks who are pleased with nothing in a poet which has not life and manners ascribed to it but for my own part i am pleased most with those passages in this description which carry in them a greater measure of probability and are such as might possibly have happened of this kind is his first mounting in the smoke that rises from the infernal pit his falling into a cloud of nitre and the like combustible materials that by their explosion still hurried him forward in his voyage his springing upward like a pyramid of fire with his laborious passage through that confusion of elements which the poet calls    the womb of nature and perhaps her grave  the glimmering light which shot into the chaos from the utmost verge of the creation with the distant discovery of the earth that hung close by the moon are wonderfully beautiful and poetical  l

debarred the liberty of conversing with her the grounds of   our difference was this that when we had enquired into each others   circumstances we found that at our first setting out into the world   we should owe five hundred pounds more than her fortune would pay off   my estate is seven hundred pounds a year besides the benefit of   tinmines now dear spec upon this state of the case and the

is one of those   creatures who set up for negligence of men are forsooth the most   rigidly virtuous in the world and yet their nicety will permit them   at the command of parents to go to bed to the most utter stranger   that can be proposed to them as to me my self i was introduced by   the father of my mistress but find i owe my being at first received   to a comparison of my estate with that of a former lover and that i   am now in like manner turned off to give way to an humble servant   still richer than i am what makes this treatment the more extravagant   is that the young lady is in the management of this way of fraud and   obeys her fathers orders on these occasions without any manner of   reluctance and does it with the same air that one of your men of the   world would signifie the necessity of affairs for turning another out   of office when i came home last night i found this letter from my   mistress       sir      i hope you will not think it is any manner of

which you   have enriched your speculations you have never given us a picture of   those audacious young fellows among us who commonly go by the name of   fortunestealers you must know sir i am one who live in a continual   apprehension of this sort of people that lye in wait day and night   for our children and may be considered as a kind of kidnappers within   the law i am the father of a young heiress whom i begin to look upon   as marriageable and who has looked upon her self as such for above   these six years she is now in the eighteenth year of her age the   fortunehunters have already cast their eyes upon her and take care   to plant themselves in her view whenever she appears in any publick   assembly i have my self caught a young jackanapes with a pair of   silver fringed gloves in the very fact you must know sir i have   kept her as a prisoner of state ever since she was in her teens her   chamber windows are crossbarred she is not permitted to go out of   the house but with her keeper who is a stayd relation of my own i   have likewise forbid her the use of pen and ink for this twelvemonth   last past and do not suffer a banbox to be carried into her room   before it has been searched notwithstanding these precautions i am   at my wits end for fear of any sudden surprize there were two or   three nights ago some fiddles heard in the street which i am afraid   portend me no good not to mention a tall irishman that has been   seen walking before my house more than once this winter my kinswoman   likewise informs me that the girl has talked to her twice or thrice   of a gentleman in a fair wig and that she loves to go to church more   than ever she did in her life she gave me the slip about a week ago   upon which my whole house was in alarm i immediately dispatched a hue   and cry after her to the change to her mantuamaker and to the young   ladies that visit her but after above an hours search she returned   of herself having been taking a walk as she told me by rosamonds   pond i have hereupon turned off her woman doubled her guards and   given new instructions to my relation who to give her her due keeps   a watchful eye over all her motions this sir keeps me in a   perpetual anxiety and makes me very often watch when my daughter   sleeps as i am afraid she is even with me in her turn now sir what   i would desire of you is to represent to this fluttering tribe of   young fellows who are for making their fortunes by these indirect   means that stealing a mans daughter for the sake of her portion is   but a kind of tolerated robbery and that they make but a poor amends   to the father whom they plunder after this manner by going to bed   with his child dear sir be speedy in your thoughts on this subject   that if possible

daughter to an indigent man of merit or to a worthless man of an estate replied that he should prefer a man without an estate to an estate without a man the worst of it is our modern fortunehunters are those who turn their heads that way because they are good for nothing else if a young fellow finds he can make nothing of cook and littleton he provides himself with a ladder of ropes and by that means very often enters upon the premises  the same art of scaling has likewise been practised with good success by many military ingineers stratagems of this nature make parts and industry superfluous and cut short the way to riches  nor is vanity a less motive than idleness to this kind of mercenary pursuit a fop who admires his person in a glass soon enters into a resolution of making his fortune by it not questioning but every woman that falls in his way will do him as much justice as he does himself when an heiress sees a man throwing particular graces into his ogle or talking loud within her hearing she ought to look to her self but if withal she observes a pair of redheels a patch or any other particularity in his dress she cannot take too much care of her person these are baits not to be trifled with charms that have done a world of execution and made their way into hearts which have been thought impregnable the force of a man with these qualifications is so well known that i am credibly informed there are several female undertakers about the change who upon the arrival of a likely man out of a neighbouring kingdom will furnish him with proper dress from head to foot to be paid for at a double price on the day of marriage  we must however distinguish between fortunehunters and fortunestealers the first are those assiduous gentlemen who employ their whole

ill success will with his usual gaiety tells us that he always found her   preengaged  widows are indeed the great game of your fortunehunters there is scarce a young fellow in the town of six foot

the young innocent creatures who have no knowledge and experience of the world are those whose safety i would principally consult in this speculation the stealing of such an one should in my opinion be as punishable as a rape where there is no judgment there is no choice and why the inveigling a woman before she is come to years of discretion should not be as criminal as the seducing of her

it is absolutely necessary for them to know sorrow and pain to be in their right senses prosperous people for happy there are none are hurried away with a fond sense of their present condition and thoughtless of the mutability of fortune fortune is a term which we must use in such discourses as these for what is wrought by the unseen hand of the disposer of all things but methinks the disposition of a mind which is truly great is that which makes misfortunes and sorrows little when they befall our selves great and lamentable when they befall other men the most unpardonable malefactor in the world going to his death and bearing it with composure would win the pity of those who should behold him and this not because his calamity is deplorable but because he seems himself not to deplore it we suffer for him who is less sensible of his own misery and are inclined to despise him who sinks under the weight of his distresses on the other hand without any touch of envy a temperate and wellgovernd mind looks down on such as are exalted with success with a certain shame for the imbecility of human nature that can so far forget how liable it is to calamity as to grow giddy with only the suspence of sorrow which is the portion of all men he therefore who turns his face from the unhappy man who will not look again when his eye is cast upon modest sorrow who shuns affliction like a contagion does but pamper himself up for a sacrifice and contract in himself a greater aptitude to misery by attempting to escape it a gentleman where i happened to be last night fell into a discourse which i thought shewed a good discerning in him he took notice that whenever men have looked into their heart for the idea of true excellency in human nature they have found it to consist in suffering after a right manner and with a good grace heroes are always drawn bearing sorrows struggling with adversities undergoing all kinds of hardships and having in the service of mankind a kind of appetite to difficulties and dangers the gentleman went on to observe that it is from this secret sense of the high merit which there is in patience under calamities that the writers of romances when they attempt to furnish out characters of the highest excellence ransack nature for things terrible they raise a new creation of monsters dragons and giants where the danger ends the hero ceases when he won an empire or gained his mistress the rest of his story is not worth relating my friend carried his discourse so far as to say that it was for higher beings than men to join happiness and greatness in the same idea but that in our condition we have no conception of superlative excellence or heroism but as it is surrounded with a shade of distress  it is certainly the proper education we should give our selves to be prepared for the ill events and accidents we are to meet with in a life sentenced to be a scene of sorrow but instead of this expectation we soften our selves with prospects of constant delight and destroy in our minds the seeds of fortitude and virtue which should support us in hours of anguish the constant pursuit of pleasure has in it something insolent and improper for our being there is a pretty sober liveliness in the ode of horace to delius where he tells him loud mirth or immoderate sorrow inequality of behaviour either in prosperity or adversity are alike ungraceful in man that is born to die moderation in both circumstances is peculiar to generous minds men of that sort ever taste the gratifications of health and all other advantages of life as if they were liable to part with them and when bereft of them resign them with a greatness of mind which shews they know their value and duration the contempt of pleasure is a certain preparatory for the contempt of pain without this the mind is as it were taken suddenly by any unforeseen event but he that has always during health and prosperity been abstinent in his satisfactions enjoys in the worst of difficulties the reflection that his anguish is not aggravated with the comparison of past pleasures which upbraid his present condition tully tells us a story after pompey which gives us a good taste of the pleasant manner the men of wit and philosophy had in old times of alleviating the distresses of life by the force of reason and philosophy pompey when he came to rhodes had a curiosity to visit the famous philosopher possidonius but finding him in his sick bed he bewailed the misfortune that he should not hear a discourse from him but you may answered possidonius and immediately entered into the point of stoical philosophy which says pain is not an evil during the discourse upon every puncture he felt from his distemper he smiled and cried out pain pain be as impertinent and troublesome as you please i shall never own that thou art an evil     mr spectator   having seen in several of your papers a concern for the honour of the   clergy and their doing every thing as becomes their character and   particularly performing the publick service with a due zeal and   devotion i am the more encouraged to lay before them by your means   several expressions used by some of them in their prayers before   sermon which i am not well satisfied in as their giving some titles   and epithets to great men which are indeed due to them in their   several ranks and stations but not properly used i think in our   prayers is it not contradiction to say illustrious right reverend   and right honourable poor sinners these distinctions are suited only   to our state here and have no place in heaven we see they are   omitted in the liturgy which i think the clergy should take for their   pattern in their own forms of devotion   there is another   expression which i would not mention but that i have heard it several   times before a learned congregation to bring in the last petition of   the prayer in these words o let not the lord be angry and i will   speak but this once as if there was no difference between abrahams   interceding for sodom for which he had no warrant as we can find and   our asking those things which we are required to pray for they would   therefore have much more reason to fear his anger if they did not make   such petitions to him there is another pretty fancy when a young man   has a mind to let us know who gave him his scarf he speaks a   parenthesis to the almighty bless as i am in duty bound to pray the   right honourable the countess is not that as much as to say bless   her for thou knowest i am her chaplain    your humble servant    j o   t    footnote   devotion another expression which i take to be improper is this the whole race of mankind when they pray for all men for race signifies lineage or descent and if the race of mankind may be used for the present generation though i think not very fitly the whole race takes in all from the beginning to the end of the world i dont remember to have met with that expression in their sense anywhere but in the old version of psal    which those men i suppose have but little esteem for and some when they have prayed for all schools and nurserys of good learning and true religion especially the two universities add these words grant that from them and all other places dedicated to thy worship and service may come forth such persons but what do they mean by all other places it seems to me that this is either a tautology as being the same with all schools and nurserys before expressed or else it runs too far for there are general places dedicated to the divine service which cannot properly be intended here                                               no                thursday february                       budgell      exigite ut mores teneros ceu pollice ducat   ut si quis cerâ vultum facit    juv    i shall give the following letter no other recommendation than by telling my readers that it comes from the same hand with that of last thursday     sir    i send you according to my promise some farther thoughts on the   education of youth in which i intend to discuss that famous question   whether the education at a publick school or under a private tutor   is to be preferred    as some of the greatest men in most ages have been of very different   opinions in this matter i shall give a short account of what i think   may be best urged on both sides and afterwards leave every person to   determine for himself    it is certain from suetonius that the romans thought the education   of their children a business properly belonging to the parents   themselves and plutarch in the life of marcus cato tells us that   as soon as his son was capable of learning cato would suffer no body   to teach him but himself tho he had a servant named chilo who was   an excellent grammarian and who taught a great many other youths    on the contrary the greeks seemed more inclined to publick schools   and seminaries     a private education promises in the first place virtue and   goodbreeding a publick school manly assurance and an early   knowledge in the ways of the world     mr locke in his celebrated treatise of education   confesses   that there are inconveniencies to be feared on both sides if says   he  i keep my son at home he is in danger of becoming my young   master if i send him abroad it is scarce possible to keep him from   the reigning contagion of rudeness and vice he will perhaps be more   innocent at home but more ignorant of the world and more sheepish   when he comes abroad  however as this learned author asserts that   virtue is much more difficult to be attained than knowledge of the   world and that vice is a more stubborn as well as a more dangerous   fault than sheepishness he is altogether for a private education and   the more so because he does not see why a youth with right   management might not attain the same assurance in his fathers house   as at a publick school to this end he advises parents to accustom   their sons to whatever strange faces come to the house to take them   with them when they visit their neighbours and to engage them in   conversation with men of parts and breeding    it may be objected to this method that conversation is not the only   thing necessary but that unless it be a conversation with such as are   in some measure their equals in parts and years there can be no room   for emulation contention and several of the most lively passions of   the mind which without being sometimes moved by these means may   possibly contract a dulness and insensibility    one of the greatest writers our nation ever produced observes that a   boy who forms parties and makes himself popular in a school or a   college would act the same part with equal ease in a senate or a   privy council and mr osborn speaking like a man versed in the ways   of the world affirms that the well laying and carrying on of a   design to rob an orchard trains up a youth insensibly to caution   secrecy and circumspection and fits him for matters of greater   importance    in short a private education seems the most natural method for the   forming of a virtuous man a publick education for making a man of   business the first would furnish out a good subject for platos   republick the latter a member for a community overrun with artifice   and corruption    it must however be confessed that a person at the head of a publick   school has sometimes so many boys under his direction that it is   impossible he should extend a due proportion of his care to each of   them this is however in reality the fault of the age in which we   often see twenty parents who tho each expects his son should be made   a scholar are not contented altogether to make it worth while for any   man of a liberal education to take upon him the care of their   instruction    in our great schools indeed this fault has been of late years   rectified so that we have at present not only ingenious men for the   chief masters but such as have proper ushers and assistants under   them i must nevertheless own that for want of the same encouragement   in the country we have many a promising genius spoiled and abused in   those seminaries    i am the more inclined to this opinion having my self experienced   the usage of two rural masters each of them very unfit for the trust   they took upon them to discharge the first imposed much more upon me   than my parts tho none of the weakest could endure and used me   barbarously for not performing impossibilities the latter was of   quite another temper and a boy who would run upon his errands wash   his coffeepot or ring the bell might have as little conversation   with any of the classicks as he thought fit i have known a lad at   this place excused his exercise for assisting the cookmaid and   remember a neighbouring gentlemans son was among us five years most   of which time he employed in airing and watering our masters grey   pad i scorned to compound for my faults by doing any of these   elegant offices and was accordingly the best scholar and the worst   used of any boy in the school    i shall conclude this discourse with an advantage mentioned by   quintilian as accompanying a publick way of education which i have   not yet taken notice of namely that we very often contract such   friendships at school as are a service to us all the following part   of our lives    i shall give you under this head a story very well known to several   persons and which you may depend upon as a real truth    every one who is acquainted with westminsterschool knows that   there is a curtain which used to be drawn across the room to   separate the upper school from the lower a youth happened by some   mischance to tear the abovementioned curtain the severity of the   master   was too well known for the criminal to expect any pardon   for such a fault so that the boy who was of a meek temper was   terrified to death at the thoughts of his appearance when his friend   who sat next to him bad him be of good cheer for that he would take   the fault on himself he kept his word accordingly as soon as they   were grown up to be men the civil war broke out in which our two   friends took the opposite sides one of them followed the parliament   the other the royal party    as their tempers were different the youth who had torn the curtain   endeavoured to raise himself on the civil list and the other who had   born the blame of it on the military the first succeeded so well   that he was in a short time made a judge under the protector the   other was engaged in the unhappy enterprize of penruddock and groves   in the west i suppose sir i need not acquaint you with the event of   that undertaking every one knows that the royal party was routed and   all the heads of them among whom was the curtain champion imprisoned   at exeter it happened to be his friends lot at that time to go to   the western circuit the tryal of the rebels as they were then   called was very short and nothing now remained but to pass sentence   on them when the judge hearing the name of his old friend and   observing his face more attentively which he had not seen for many   years asked him if he was not formerly a westminsterscholar by the   answer he was soon convinced that it was his former generous friend   and without saying any thing more at that time made the best of his   way to london where employing all his power and interest with the   protector he saved his friend from the fate of his unhappy   associates    the gentleman whose life was thus preservd by the gratitude of his   schoolfellow was afterwards the father of a son whom he lived to   see promoted in the church and who still deservedly fills one of the   highest stations in it     x    footnote   some thoughts concerning education §  0 the references to suetonius and plutarchs life of cato are from

the same age about this half year i go to see   her six days in the week but never could have the happiness of being   with her alone if any of her friends are at home she will see me in   their company but if they be not in the way she flies to her   chamber i can discover no signs of her aversion but either a fear of   falling into the toils of matrimony or a childish timidity deprives   us of an interview apart and drives us upon the difficulty of   languishing out our lives in fruitless expectation now mr   spectator if you think us ripe for oeconomy perswade the dear   creature that to pine away into barrenness and deformity under a   mothers shade is not so honourable nor does she appear so amiable   as she would in full bloom there is a great deal left out before he   concludes mr spectator   your humble servant   bob harmless   if this gentleman be really no more than eighteen i must do him the justice to say he is the most knowing infant i have yet met with he does not i fear yet understand that all he thinks of is another woman therefore till he has given a further account of himself the young lady is hereby directed to keep close to her mother the spectator  i cannot comply with the request in mr trotts letter but let it go just as it came to my hands for being so familiar with the old gentleman as rough as he is to him since mr trott has an ambition to make him his fatherinlaw he ought to treat him with more respect besides his style to me might have been more distant than he has thought fit to afford me moreover his mistress shall continue in her confinement till he has found out which word in his letter is not wrightly spelt      mr spectator    i shall ever own my self your obliged humble servant for the advice   you gave me concerning my dancing which unluckily came too late for   as i said i would not leave off capering till i had your opinion of   the matter was at our famous assembly the day before i received your   papers and there was observed by an old gentleman who was informed i   had a respect for his daughter told me i was an insignificant little   fellow and said that for the future he would take care of his child   so that he did not doubt but to crosse my amorous inclinations the   lady is confined to her chamber and for my part am ready to hang my   self with the thoughts that i have danced my self out of favour with   her father i hope you will pardon the trouble i give but shall take   it for a mighty favour if you will give me a little more of your   advice to put me in a write way to cheat the old dragon and obtain my   mistress i am once more    sir    your obliged humble servant john trott    york feb              let me desire you to make what alterations you please and insert this   as soon as possible pardon mistake by haste   i never do pardon mistakes by haste the spectator     feb              sir    pray be so kind as to let me know what you esteem to be the chief   qualification of a good poet especially of one who writes plays and   you will very much oblige    sir your very humble servant n b   to be a very wellbred man the spectator     mr spectator    you are to know that i am naturally brave and love fighting as well   as any man in england this gallant temper of mine makes me extremely   delighted with battles on the stage i give you this trouble to   complain to you that nicolini refused to gratifie me in that part of   the opera for which i have most taste i observe its become a custom   that whenever any gentlemen are particularly pleased with a song at   their crying out encore or altro volto the performer is so obliging   as to sing it over again i was at the opera the last time hydaspes   was performed at that part of it where the heroe engages with the   lion the graceful manner with which he put that terrible monster to   death gave me so great a pleasure and at the same time so just a   sense of that gentlemans intrepidity and conduct that i could not   forbear desiring a repetition of it by crying out altro volto in a   very audible voice and my friends flatter me that i pronounced those   words with a tolerable good accent considering that was but the third   opera i had ever seen in my life yet notwithstanding all this there   was so little regard had to me that the lion was carried off and   went to bed without being killed any more that night now sir pray   consider that i did not understand a word of what mr nicolini said to   this cruel creature besides i have no ear for musick so that during   the long dispute between em the whole entertainment i had was from   my eye why then have not i as much right to have a graceful action   repeated as another has a pleasing sound since he only hears as i   only see and we neither of us know that there is any reasonable thing   a doing pray sir settle the business of this claim in the audience   and let us know when we may cry altro volto anglicè again again   for the future i am an englishman and expect some reason or other to   be given me and perhaps an ordinary one may serve but i expect your   answer    i am sir   your most humble servant   toby rentfree     nov       mr spectator    you must give me leave amongst the rest of your female   correspondents to address you about an affair which has already given   you many a speculation and which i know i need not tell you have   had a very happy influence over the adult part of our sex but as many   of us are either too old to learn or too obstinate in the pursuit of   the vanities which have been bred up with us from our infancy and all   of us quitting the stage whilst you are prompting us to act our part   well you ought methinks rather to turn your instructions for the   benefit of that part of our sex who are yet in their native   innocence and ignorant of the vices and that variety of unhappinesses   that reign amongst us    i must tell you mr spectator that it is as much a part of your   office to oversee the education of the female part of the nation as   well as of the male and to convince the world you are not partial   pray proceed to detect the male administration of governesses as   successfully as you have exposed that of pedagogues and rescue our   sex from the prejudice and tyranny of education as well as that of   your own who without your seasonable interposition are like to   improve upon the vices that are now in vogue    i who know the dignity of your post as spectator and the authority a   skilful eye ought to bear in the female world could not forbear   consulting you and beg your advice in so critical a point as is that   of the education of young gentlewomen having already provided myself   with a very convenient house in a good air im not without hope but   that you will promote this generous design i must farther tell you   sir that all who shall be committed to my conduct beside the usual   accomplishments of the needle dancing and the french tongue shall   not fail to be your constant readers it is therefore my humble   petition that you will entertain the town on this important subject   and so far oblige a stranger as to raise a curiosity and enquiry in   my behalf by publishing the following advertisement    i am sir   your constant admirer   m w   t                                                                     advertisement  the boardingschool for young gentlewomen which was formerly kept on mileendgreen being laid down there is now one set up almost opposite to it at the two goldenballs and much more convenient in every respect where beside the common instructions given to young gentlewomen they will be taught the whole art of paistrey and preserving with whatever may render them accomplished those who please to make tryal of the vigilance and ability of the persons concerned may enquire at the two goldenballs on mileendgreen near stepney where they will receive further satisfaction  this is to give notice that the spectator has taken upon him to be visitant of all boardingschools where young women are educated and designs to proceed in the said office after the same manner that the visitants of colleges do in the two famous universities of this land  all lovers who write to the spectator are desired to forbear one expression which is in most of the letters to him either out of laziness or want of invention and is true of not above two thousand women in the whole world viz she has in her all that is valuable in woman                                        no                     saturday march                       addison      nec deus intersit nisi dignus vindice nodus   inciderit    hor    horace advises a poet to consider thoroughly the nature and force of his genius   milton seems to have known perfectly well wherein his strength lay and has therefore chosen a subject entirely conformable to those talents of which he was master as his genius was wonderfully turned to the sublime his subject is the noblest that could have entered into the thoughts of man every thing that is truly great and astonishing has a place in it the whole system of the intellectual world the chaos and the creation heaven earth and hell enter into the constitution of his poem  having in the first and second books represented the infernal world with all its horrors the thread of his fable naturally leads him into the opposite regions of bliss and glory  if miltons majesty forsakes him any where it is in those parts of his poem where the divine persons are introduced as speakers one may i think observe that the author proceeds with a kind of fear and trembling whilst he describes the sentiments of the almighty he dares not give his imagination its full play but chuses to confine himself to such thoughts as are drawn from the books of the most orthodox divines and to such expressions as may be met with in scripture the beauties therefore which we are to look for in these speeches are not of a poetical nature nor so proper to fill the mind with sentiments of grandeur as with thoughts of devotion the passions which they are designed to raise are a divine love and religious fear the particular beauty of the speeches in the third book consists in that shortness and perspicuity of style in which the poet has couched the greatest mysteries of christianity and drawn together in a regular scheme the whole dispensation of providence with respect to man he has represented all the abstruse doctrines of predestination freewill and grace as also the great points of incarnation and redemption which naturally grow up in a poem that treats of the fall of man with great energy of expression and in a clearer and stronger light than i ever met with in any other writer as these points are dry in themselves to the generality of readers the concise and clear manner in which he has treated them is very much to be admired as is likewise that particular art which he has made use of in the interspersing of all those graces of poetry which the subject was capable of receiving  the survey of the whole creation and of every thing that is transacted in it is a prospect worthy of omniscience and as much above that in which virgil has drawn his jupiter as the christian idea of the supreme being is more rational and sublime than that of the heathens the particular objects on which he is described to have cast his eye are represented in the most beautiful and lively manner    now had th almighty father from above   from the pure empyrean where he sits   high thrond above all height bent down his eye   his own works and their works at once to view   about him all the sanctities of heavn   stood thick as stars and from his sight received   beatitude past uttrance on his right   the radiant image of his glory sat   his only son on earth he first beheld   our two first parents yet the only two   of mankind in the happy garden placd   reaping immortal fruits of joy and love   uninterrupted joy unrivald love   in blissful solitude he then surveyed   hell and the gulph between and satan there   coasting the wall of heaven on this side night   in the dun air sublime and ready now   to stoop with wearied wings and willing feel   on the bare outside of this world that seemd   firm land imbosomd without firmament   uncertain which in ocean or in air   him god beholding from his prospect high   wherein past present future he beholds   thus to his only son foreseeing spake  satans approach to the confines of the creation is finely imaged in the beginning of the speech which immediately follows the effects of this speech in the blessed spirits and in the divine person to whom it was addressed cannot but fill the mind of the reader with a secret pleasure and complacency    thus while god spake ambrosial fragrance filld   all heavn and in the blessed spirits elect   sense of new joy ineffable diffusd   beyond compare the son of god was seen   most glorious in him all his father shone   substantially expressed and in his face   divine compassion visibly appeared   love without end and without measure grace  i need not point out the beauty of that circumstance wherein the whole host of angels are represented as standing mute nor shew how proper the occasion was to produce such a silence in heaven the close of this divine colloquy with the hymn of angels that follows upon it are so wonderfully beautiful and poetical that i should not forbear inserting the whole passage if the bounds of my paper would give me leave    no sooner had th almighty ceasd but all   the multitudes of angels with a shout   loud as from numbers without number sweet   as from blest voices uttring joy heavn rung   with jubilee and loud hosannas filld   th eternal regions c c  satans walk upon the outside of the universe which at a distance appeared to him of a globular form but upon his nearer approach looked like an unbounded plain is natural and noble as his roaming upon the frontiers of the creation between that mass of matter which was wrought into a world and that shapeless unformed heap of materials which still lay in chaos and confusion strikes the imagination with something astonishingly great and wild i have before spoken of the limbo of vanity which the poet places upon this outermost surface of the universe and shall here explain my self more at large on that and other parts of the poem which are of the same shadowy nature  aristotle observes  that the fable of an epic poem should abound in circumstances that are both credible and astonishing or as the french criticks chuse to phrase it the fable should be filled with the probable and the marvellous this rule is as fine and just as any in aristotles whole art of poetry  if the fable is only probable it differs nothing from a true history if it is only marvellous it is no better than a romance the great secret therefore of heroic poetry is to relate such circumstances as may produce in the reader at the same time both belief and astonishment this is brought to pass in a wellchosen fable by the account of such things as have really happened or at least of such things as have happened according to the received opinions of mankind miltons  fable is a masterpiece of this nature as the war in heaven the condition of the fallen angels the state of innocence and temptation of the serpent and the fall of man though they are very astonishing in themselves are not only credible but actual points of faith  the next method of reconciling miracles with credibility is by a happy invention of the poet as in particular when he introduces agents of a superior nature who are capable of effecting what is wonderful and what is not to be met with in the ordinary course of things ulyssess ship being turned into a rock and æneass fleet into a shoal of water nymphs though they are very surprising accidents are nevertheless probable when we are told that they were the gods who thus transformed them it is this kind of machinery which fills the poems both of homer and virgil with such circumstances as are wonderful but not impossible and so frequently produce in the reader the most pleasing passion that can rise in the mind of man which is admiration if there be any instance in the æneid liable to exception upon this account it is in the beginning of the third book where æneas is represented as tearing up the myrtle that dropped blood to qualifie this wonderful circumstance polydorus tells a story from the root of the myrtle that the barbarous inhabitants of the country having pierced him with spears and arrows the wood which was left in his body took root in his wounds and gave birth to that bleeding tree this circumstance seems to have the marvellous without the probable because it is represented as proceeding from natural causes without the interposition of any god or other supernatural power capable of producing it the spears and arrows grow of themselves without so much as the modern help of an enchantment if we look into the fiction of miltons fable though we find it full of surprizing incidents they are generally suited to our notions of the things and persons described and tempered with a due measure of probability i must only make an exception to the limbo of vanity with his episode of sin and death and some of the imaginary persons in his chaos these  passages are astonishing but not credible the reader cannot so far impose upon himself as to see a possibility in them they are the description of dreams and shadows not of things or persons i know that many criticks look upon the stories of circe polypheme the sirens nay the whole odyssey and iliad to be allegories but allowing this to be true they are fables which considering the opinions of mankind that prevailed in the age of the poet might possibly have been according to the letter the persons are such as might have acted what is ascribed to them as the circumstances in which they are represented might possibly have been truths and realities this appearance of probability is so absolutely requisite in the greater kinds of poetry that aristotle observes the ancient tragick writers made use of the names of such great men as had actually lived in the world tho the tragedy proceeded upon adventures they were never engaged in on purpose to make the subject more credible in a word besides the hidden meaning of an epic allegory the plain litteral sense ought to appear probable the story should be such as an ordinary reader may acquiesce in whatever natural moral or political truth may be discovered in it by men of greater penetration  satan after having long wandered upon the surface or outmost wall of the universe discovers at last a wide gap in it which led into the creation and is described as the opening through which the angels pass to and fro into the lower world upon their errands to mankind his sitting upon the brink of this passage and taking a survey of the whole face of nature that appeared to him new and fresh in all its beauties with the simile illustrating this circumstance fills the mind of the reader with as surprizing and glorious an idea as any that arises in the whole poem he looks down into that vast hollow of the universe with the eye or as milton calls it in his first book with the kenn of an angel he surveys all the wonders in this immense amphitheatre that lye between both the poles of heaven and takes in at one view the whole round of the creation  his flight between the several worlds that shined on every side of him with the particular description of the sun are set forth in all the wantonness of a luxuriant imagination his shape speech and behaviour upon his transforming himself into an angel of light are touched with exquisite beauty the poets thought of directing satan to the sun which in the vulgar opinion of mankind is the most conspicuous part of the creation and the placing in it an angel is a circumstance very finely contrived and the more adjusted to a poetical probability as it was a received doctrine among the most famous philosophers that every orb had its intelligence and as an apostle in sacred writ is said to have seen such an angel in the sun in the answer which this angel returns to the disguised evil spirit there is such a becoming majesty as is altogether suitable to a superior being the part of it in which he represents himself as present at the creation is very noble in it self and not only proper where it is introduced but requisite to prepare the reader for what follows in the seventh book    i saw when at his word the formless mass   this worlds material mould came to a heap   confusion heard his voice and wild uproar   stood ruld stood vast infinitude confind   till at his second bidding darkness fled   light shon c  in the following part of the speech he points out the earth with such circumstances that the reader can scarce forbear fancying himself employed on the same distant view of it    look downward on the globe whose hither side   with light from hence tho but reflected shines   that place is earth the seat of man that light   his day c  i must not conclude my reflections upon this third book of paradise lost without taking notice of that celebrated complaint of milton with which it opens and which certainly deserves all the praises that have been given it tho as i have before hinted it may rather be looked upon as an excrescence than as an essential part of the poem the same observation might be applied to that beautiful digression upon hypocrisie in the same book   l    footnote   de arte poetica ii    0   footnote   poetics iii      the surprising is necessary in tragedy but the epic poem goes   farther and admits even the improbable and incredible from which the   highest degree of the surprising results because there the action is   not seen                                               no

pleasure for   the reality of its complaints this may have reason to hope for a   favourable acceptance and if time be the most irretrievable loss the   regrets which follow will be thought i hope the most justifiable   the regaining of my liberty from a long state of indolence and   inactivity and the desire of resisting the further encroachments of   idleness make me apply to you and the uneasiness with which i i   recollect the past years and the apprehensions with which i expect   the future soon determined me to it    idleness is so general a distemper that i cannot but imagine a   speculation on this subject will be of universal use there is hardly   any one person without some allay of it and thousands besides my self   spend more time in an idle uncertainty which to begin first of two   affairs that would have been sufficient to have ended them both the   occasion of this seems to be the want of some necessary employment to   put the spirits in motion and awaken them out of their lethargy if i   had less leisure i should have more for i should then find my time   distinguished into portions some for business and others for the   indulging of pleasures but now one face of indolence overspreads the   whole and i have no landmark to direct my self by were ones time a   little straitned by business like water inclosed in its banks it   would have some determined course but unless it be put into some   channel it has no current but becomes a deluge without either use or   motion    when scanderbeg prince of epirus was dead the turks who had but too   often

manner for the   good of my countrymen who are troubled with too exorbitant a degree   of fire all foxhunters upon wearing me would in a short time be   brought to endure their beds in a morning and perhaps even quit them   with regret at ten instead of hurrying away to teaze a poor animal   and run away from their own thoughts a chair or a chariot would be   thought the most desirable means of performing a remove from one place   to another i should be a cure for the unnatural desire of john trott   for dancing and a specifick to lessen the inclination mrs fidget has   to motion and cause

violent sallies of youth and give each action its proper weight   and repose    i can stifle any violent inclination and oppose a torrent of anger   or the sollicitations of revenge with success but indolence is a   stream which flows slowly on but yet undermines the foundation of   every virtue a vice of a more lively nature were a more desirable   tyrant than this rust of the mind which gives a tincture of its   nature to every action of ones life it were as little hazard to be   lost in a storm as to lye thus perpetually becalmed and it is to no   purpose to have within one the seeds of a thousand good qualities if   we want the vigour and resolution necessary for the exerting them   death brings all persons back to an equality and this image of it   this slumber of the mind leaves no difference between the greatest   genius and the meanest understanding a faculty of doing things   remarkably praiseworthy thus concealed is of no more use to the   owner than a heap of gold to the man who dares not use it    tomorrow is still the fatal time when all is to be rectified   tomorrow comes it goes and still i please my self with the shadow   whilst i lose the reality unmindful that the present time alone is   ours the future is yet unborn and the past is dead and can only   live as parents in their children in the actions it has produced    the time we live ought not to be computed by the numbers of years   but by the use has been made of it thus tis not the extent of   ground but the yearly rent which gives the value to the estate   wretched and thoughtless creatures in the only place where   covetousness were a virtue we turn prodigals nothing lies upon our   hands with such uneasiness nor has there been so many devices for any   one thing as to make it slide away imperceptibly and to no purpose a   shilling shall be hoarded up with care whilst that which is above the   price of an estate is flung away with disregard and contempt there   is nothing nowadays so much avoided as a sollicitous improvement of   every part of time tis a report must be shunned as one tenders the   name of a wit and a fine genius and as one fears the dreadful   character of a laborious plodder but notwithstanding this the   greatest wits any age has produced thought far otherwise for who can   think either socrates or demosthenes lost any reputation by their   continual pains both in overcoming the defects and improving the gifts   of nature all are acquainted with the labour and assiduity with which   tully acquired his eloquence    seneca in his letters

account of the various methods he used to fill up every   vacancy of time after several imployments which he enumerates   sometimes says he i hunt but even then i carry with me a   pocketbook that whilst my servants are busied in disposing of the   nets and other matters i may be employed in something that may be   useful to me in my studies and that if i miss of my game i may at   the least bring home some of my own thoughts with me and not have the   mortification of having caught nothing all day     thus sir you see how many examples i recall to mind and what   arguments i use with my self to regain my liberty but as i am afraid   tis no ordinary perswasion that will be of service i shall expect   your thoughts on this subject with the greatest impatience   especially since the good will not be confined to me alone but will   be of universal use for there is no hopes of amendment where men are   pleased with their ruin and whilst they think laziness is a desirable   character whether it be that they like the state it self or that   they think it gives them a new lustre when they do exert themselves   seemingly to be able to do that without labour and application

extraordinary merit let me then says he go off the stage with your applause using the expression with which the roman actors made their exit at the conclusion of a dramatick piece i could wish that men while they are in health would consider well the nature of the part they are engaged in and what figure it will make in the minds of those they leave behind them whether it was worth coming into the world for whether it be suitable to a reasonable being in short whether it appears graceful in this life or will turn to an advantage in the next let the sycophant or buffoon the satyrist or the good companion consider with himself when his body shall be laid in the grave and his soul pass into another state of existence how much it will redound to his praise to have it said of him that no man in england eat better that he had an admirable talent at turning his friends into ridicule that no body outdid him at an illnatured jest or that he never went to bed before he had dispatched his third bottle these are however very common funeral orations and elogiums on deceased persons who have acted among mankind with some figure and reputation  but if we look into the bulk of our species they are such as are not likely to be remembred a moment after their disappearance they leave behind them no traces of their existence but are forgotten as tho they had never been they are neither wanted by the poor regretted by the rich nor celebrated by the learned they are neither missed in the commonwealth nor lamented by private persons their actions are of no significancy to mankind and might have been performed by creatures of much less dignity than those who are distinguished by the faculty of reason an eminent french author speaks somewhere to the following purpose i have often

few days since this honest man being of greater consequence in his own thoughts than in the eye of the world had for some years past kept a journal of his life sir andrew shewed us one week of it since   the occurrences set down in it mark out such a road of action as that i have been speaking of i shall present my reader with a faithful copy of it after having first informd him that the

not but the reader will be surprized to find the abovementioned journalist taking so much care of a life that was filled with such inconsiderable actions and received so very small improvements and yet if we look into the behaviour of many whom we daily converse with we shall find that most of their hours are taken up in those three important articles of eating drinking and sleeping i do not suppose that a man loses his time who is not engaged in publick affairs or in an illustrious course of action on the contrary i believe our hours may very often be more profitably laid out in such transactions as make no figure in the world than in such as are apt to draw upon them the attention of mankind one may become wiser and better by several methods of employing ones self in secrecy and silence and do what is laudable without noise or ostentation i would however recommend to every one of my readers the keeping a journal of their lives for one week and setting down punctually their whole series of employments during that space of time this kind of selfexamination would give them a true state of themselves and incline them to consider seriously what they are about one day would rectifie the omissions of another and make a man weigh all those indifferent actions which though they are easily forgotten must certainly be accounted for  l    footnote   as

not yet been   considered by you as growing so deep in the heart of man that the   affectation outlives the practice of it you must have observed that   men who have been bred in arms preserve to the most extreme and feeble   old age a certain daring in their aspect in like manner they who   have passd their time in gallantry and adventure keep up as well as   they can the appearance of it and carry a petulant inclination to   their last moments let this serve for a preface to a relation i am   going to give you of an old beau in town that has not only been   amorous and a follower of women in general but also in spite of the   admonition of grey hairs been from his sixtythird year to his   present seventieth in an actual pursuit of a young lady the wife of   his friend and a man of merit the gay old escalus has wit good   health and is perfectly well bred but from the fashion and manners   of the court when he was in his bloom has such a natural tendency to   amorous adventure that he thought it would be an endless reproach to   him to make no use of a familiarity he was allowed at a gentlemans   house whose good humour and confidence exposed his wife to the   addresses of any who should take it in their head to do him the good   office it is not impossible that escalus might also resent that the   husband was particularly negligent of him and tho he gave many   intimations of a passion towards the wife the husband either did not   see them or put him to the contempt of overlooking them in the mean   time isabella for so we shall call our heroine saw his passion and   rejoiced in it as a foundation for much diversion and an opportunity   of indulging her self in the dear delight of being admired addressed   to and flattered with no ill consequence to her reputation this   lady is of a free and disengaged behaviour ever in good humour such   as is the image of innocence with those who are innocent and an   encouragement to vice with those who are abandoned from this kind of   carriage and an apparent approbation of his gallantry escalus had   frequent opportunities of laying amorous epistles in her way of   fixing his eyes attentively upon her action of performing a thousand   little offices which are neglected by the unconcerned but are so many   approaches towards happiness with the enamoured it was now as is   above hinted almost the end of the seventh year of his passion when   escalus from general terms and the ambiguous respect which criminal   lovers retain in their addresses began to bewail that his passion   grew too violent for him to answer any longer for his behaviour   towards her and that he hoped she would have consideration for his   long and patient respect to excuse the motions of a heart now no   longer under the direction of the unhappy owner of it such for some   months had been the language of escalus both in his talk and his   letters to isabella who returned all the profusion of kind things   which had been the collection of fifty years with i must not hear you   you will make me forget that you are a gentleman i would not   willingly lose you as a friend and the like expressions which the   skilful interpret to their own advantage as well knowing that a   feeble denial is a modest assent i should have told you that   isabella during the whole progress of this amour communicated it to   her husband and that an account of escaluss love was their usual   entertainment after half a days absence isabella therefore upon her   lovers late more open assaults with a smile told her husband she   could hold out no longer but that his fate was now come to a crisis   after she had explained her self a little farther with her husbands   approbation she proceeded in the following manner the next time that   escalus was alone with her and repeated his importunity the crafty   isabella looked on her fan with an air of great attention as   considering of what importance such a secret was to her and upon the   repetition of a warm expression she looked at him with an eye of   fondness and told him he was past that time of life which could make   her fear he would boast of a ladys favour then turned away her head   with a very wellacted confusion which favoured the escape of the   aged escalus this adventure was matter of great pleasantry to   isabella and her spouse and they had enjoyed it two days before   escalus could recollect himself enough to form the following letter       madam      what happened the other day gives me a lively image of the     inconsistency of human passions and inclinations we pursue what we     are denied and place our affections on what is absent tho we     neglected it when present as long as you refused my love your     refusal did so strongly excite my passion that i had not once the     leisure to think of recalling my reason to aid me against the design     upon your virtue but when that virtue began to comply in my favour     my reason made an effort over my love and let me see the baseness     of my behaviour in attempting a woman of honour i own to you it     was not without the most violent struggle that i gained this victory     over my self nay i will confess my shame and acknowledge i could     not have prevailed but by flight however madam i beg that you     will believe a moments weakness has not destroyed the esteem i had     for you which was confirmed by so many years of obstinate virtue     you have reason to rejoice that this did not happen within the     observation of one of the young fellows who would have exposed your     weakness and gloried in his own brutish inclinations     i am madam     your most devoted humble servant     isabella with the help of her husband returned the following answer       sir      i cannot but account my self a very happy woman in having a man     for a lover that can write so well and give so good a turn to a     disappointment another excellence you have above all other     pretenders i ever heard of on occasions where the most reasonable     men lose all their reason you have yours most powerful we are each     of us to thank our genius that the passion of one abated in     proportion as that of the other grew violent does it not yet come     into your head to imagine that i knew my compliance was the     greatest cruelty i could be guilty of towards you in return for     your long and faithful passion i must let you know that you are old     enough to become a little more gravity but if you will leave me and     coquet it any where else may your mistress yield

i have neither spared the ladies out of complaisance nor the men out of partiality but notwithstanding the great integrity with which i have acted in this particular i find my self taxed with an inclination to favour my own half of the species whether it be that the women afford a more fruitful field for speculation or whether they run more in my head than the men i cannot tell but i shall set down the charge as it is laid against me in the following letter     mr spectator    i always make one among a company of young females who peruse your   speculations every morning i am at present commissioned by our whole   assembly to let you know that we fear you are a little enclined to   be partial towards your own sex we must however acknowledge with all   due gratitude that in some cases you have given us our revenge on the   men and done us justice we could not easily have forgiven you   several strokes in the dissection of the coquets heart if you had   not much about the same time made a sacrifice to us of a beaus   scull    you may however sir please to remember that long since you   attacked our hoods and commodes in such manner as to use your own   expression made very many of us ashamed to shew our heads we must   therefore beg leave to represent to you that we are in hopes if you   would please to make a due enquiry the men in all ages would be found   to have been little less whimsical in adorning that part than our   selves the different forms of their wiggs together with the various   cocks of their hats all flatter us in this opinion    i had an humble servant last summer who the first time he declared   himself was in a fullbottomd wigg but the day after to my no   small surprize he accosted me in a thin natural one i received him   at this our second interview as a perfect stranger but was extreamly   confounded when his speech discovered who he was i resolved   therefore to fix his face in my memory for the future but as i was   walking in the park the same evening he appeared to me in one of   those wiggs that i think you call a nightcap which had altered him   more effectually than before he afterwards played a couple of black   riding wiggs upon me with the same success and in short assumed a   new face almost every day in the first month of his courtship    i observed afterwards that the variety of cocks into which he   moulded his hat had not a little contributed to his impositions upon   me    yet as if all these ways were not sufficient to distinguish their   heads you must doubtless sir have observed that great numbers of   young fellows have for several months last past taken upon them to   wear feathers    we hope therefore that these may with as much justice be called   indian princes as you have styled a woman in a coloured hood an   indian queen and that you will in due time take these airy   gentlemen into consideration    we the more earnestly beg that you would put a stop to this practice   since it has already lost us one of the most agreeable members of our   society who after having refused several good estates and two   titles was lured from us last week by a mixed feather    i am ordered to present you the respects of our whole company and   am sir   your very humble servant   dorinda    note the person wearing the feather tho our friend took him for an   officer in the guards has proved to be an arrant linnendraper     i am not now at leisure to give my opinion upon the hat and feather however to wipe off the present imputation and gratifie my female correspondent i shall here print a letter which i lately received from a man of mode who seems to have a very extraordinary genius in his way     sir   i presume i need not inform you that among men of dress it is a   common phrase to say mr such an one has struck a bold stroke by   which we understand that he is the first man who has had courage   enough to lead up a fashion accordingly when our taylors take   measure of us they always demand whether we will have a plain suit   or strike a bold stroke   think i may without vanity say that i have   struck some of the boldest and most successful strokes of any man in   great britain i was the first that struck the long pocket about two   years since i was likewise the author of the frosted button which   when i saw the town came readily into being resolved to strike while   the iron was hot i produced much about the same time the scallop   flap the knotted cravat and made a fair push for the silverclocked   stocking    a few months after i brought up the modish jacket or the coat with   close sleeves i struck this at first in a plain doily but that   failing i struck it a second time in blue camlet and repeated the   stroke in several kinds of cloth till at last it took effect there   are two or three young fellows at the other end of the town who have   always their eye upon me and answer me stroke for stroke i was once   so unwary as to mention my fancy in relation to the newfashioned   surtout before one of these gentlemen who was disingenuous enough to   steal my thought and by that means prevented my intended stroke    i have a design this spring to make very considerable innovations in   the wastcoat and have already begun with a coup dessai upon the   sleeves which has succeeded very well    i must further inform you if you will promise to encourage or at   least to connive at me that it is my design to strike such a stroke   the beginning of the next month as shall surprise the whole town    i do not think it prudent to acquaint you with all the particulars of   my intended dress but will only tell you as a sample of it that i   shall very speedily appear at whites in a cherrycoloured hat i took   this hint from the ladies hoods which i look upon as the boldest   stroke that sex has struck for these hundred years last past    i am sir    your most obedient most humble servant    will sprightly   i have not time at present to make any reflections on this letter but must not however omit that having shewn it to will honeycomb he desires to be acquainted with the gentleman who writ it  x    footnote   only an

lecto   eumenides stravere torum    ovid       mr spectator    you have given many hints in your papers to the disadvantage of   persons of your own sex who lay plots upon women among other hard   words you have published the term malecoquets and been very severe   upon such as give themselves the liberty of a little dalliance of   heart and playing fast and loose between love and indifference till   perhaps an easie young girl is reduced to sighs dreams and tears and   languishes away her life for a careless coxcomb who looks astonished   and wonders at such an effect from what in him was all but common   civility thus you have treated the men who are irresolute in   marriage but if you design to be impartial pray be so honest as to   print the information i now give you of a certain set of women who   never coquet for the matter but with an high hand marry whom they   please to whom they please as for my part i should not have   concerned my self with them but that i understand i am pitched upon   by them to be married against my will to one i never saw in my   life it has been my misfortune sir very innocently to rejoice in a   plentiful fortune of which i am master to bespeak a fine chariot to   give direction for two or three handsome snuffboxes and as many   suits of fine cloaths but before any of these were ready i heard   reports of my being to be married to two or three different young   women upon my taking notice of it to a young gentleman who is often   in my company he told me smiling i was in the inquisition you may   believe i was not a little startled at what he meant and more so when   he asked me if i had bespoke any thing of late that was fine i told   him several upon which he produced a description of my person from   the tradesmen whom i had employed and told me that they had certainly   informed against me mr spectator whatever the world may think of   me i am more coxcomb than fool and i grew very inquisitive upon this   head not a little pleased with the novelty my friend told me there   were a certain set of women of fashion whereof the number of six made   a committee who sat thrice a week under the title of the inquisition   on maids and batchelors it seems whenever there comes such an   unthinking gay thing as my self to town he must want all manner of   necessaries or be put into the inquisition by the first tradesman he   employs they have constant intelligence with caneshops perfumers   toymen coachmakers and chinahouses from these several places   these undertakers for marriages have as constant and regular   correspondence as the funeralmen have with vintners and   apothecaries all batchelors are under their immediate inspection and   my friend produced to me a report given into their board wherein an   old unkle of mine who came to town with me and my self were   inserted and we stood thus the unkle smoaky rotten poor the   nephew raw but no fool sound at present very rich my information   did not end here but my friends advices are so good that he could   shew me a copy of the letter sent to the young lady who is to have me   which i enclose to you        madam     this is to let you know that you are to be married to a beau that     comes out on thursday six in the evening be at the park you cannot     but know a virgin fop they have a mind to look saucy but are out     of countenance the board has denied him to several good families i     wish you joy     corinna   what makes my correspondents case the more deplorable is that as i find by the report from my censor of marriages the friend he speaks of is employed by the inquisition to take him in as the phrase is after all that is told him he has information only of one woman that is laid for him and that the wrong one for the ladycommissioners have devoted him to another than the person against whom they have employed their agent his friend to alarm him the plot is laid so well about this young gentleman that he has no friend to retire to no place to appear in or part of the kingdom to fly into but he must fall into the notice and be subject to the power of the inquisition they have their emissaries and substitutes in all parts of this united kingdom the first step they usually take is to find from a correspondence by their messengers and whisperers with some domestick of the batchelor who is to be hunted into the toils they have laid for him what are his manners his familiarities his good qualities or vices not as the good in him is a recommendation or the ill a diminution but as they affect or contribute to the main enquiry what estate he has in him when this point is well reported to the board they can take in a wild roaring foxhunter as easily as a soft gentle young fop of the town the way is to make all places uneasie to him but the scenes in which they have allotted him to act his brother huntsmen bottle companions his fraternity of fops shall be brought into the conspiracy against him then this matter is not laid in so barefaced a manner before him as to have it intimated mrs suchaone would make him a very proper wife but by the force of their correspondence they shall make it as mr waller said of the marriage of the dwarfs as impracticable to have any woman besides her they design him as it would have been in adam to have refused eve the man named by the commission for mrs suchaone shall neither be in fashion nor dare ever to appear in company should he attempt to evade their determination  the female sex wholly govern domestick life and by this means when they think fit they can sow dissentions between the dearest friends nay make father and son irreconcilable enemies in spite of all the ties of gratitude on one part and the duty of protection to be paid on the other the ladies of the inquisition understand this perfectly well and where love is not a motive to a mans chusing one whom they allot they can with very much art insinuate stories to the disadvantage of his honesty or courage till the creature is too much dispirited to bear up against a general ill reception which he every where meets with and in due time falls into their appointed wedlock for shelter i have a long letter bearing date the fourth instant which gives me a large account of the policies of this court and find there is now before them a very refractory person who has escaped all their machinations for two years last past but they have prevented two successive matches which were of his own inclination the one by a report that his mistress was to be married and the very day appointed weddingclothes bought and all things ready for her being given to another the second time by insinuating to all his mistresss friends and acquaintance that he had been false to several other women and the like the poor man is now reduced to profess he designs to lead a single life but the inquisition gives out to all his acquaintance that nothing is intended but the gentlemans own welfare and happiness when this is urged he talks still more humbly and protests he aims only at a life without pain or reproach pleasure honour or riches are things for which he has no taste but notwithstanding all this and what else he may defend himself with as that the lady is too old or too young of a suitable humour or the quite contrary and that it is impossible they can ever do other than wrangle from june to january every body tells him all this is spleen and he must have a wife while all the members of the inquisition are unanimous in a certain woman for him and they think they all together are better able to judge than he or any other private person whatsoever     temple march           sir   your speculation this day on the subject of idleness has employed me   ever since i read it in sorrowful reflections on my having loitered   away the term or rather the vacation of ten years in this place and   unhappily suffered a good chamber and study to lie idle as long my   books except those i have taken to sleep upon have been totally   neglected and my lord coke and other venerable authors were never so   slighted in their lives i spent most of the day at a neighbouring   coffeehouse where we have what i may call a lazy club we generally   come in nightgowns with our stockings about our heels and sometimes   but one on our salutation at entrance is a yawn and a stretch and   then without more ceremony we take our place at the lolling table   where our discourse is what i fear you would not read out therefore   shall not insert but i assure you sir i heartily lament this loss   of time and am now resolved if possible with double diligence to   retrieve it being effectually awakened by the arguments of mr slack   out of the senseless stupidity that has so long possessed me and to   demonstrate that penitence accompanies my confession and constancy my   resolutions i have locked my door for a year and desire you would

homer and virgil will easily pardon the length of my discourse upon milton the paradise lost is looked upon by the best judges as the greatest production or at least the noblest work of genius in our language and therefore deserves to be set before an english reader in its full beauty for this reason tho i have endeavoured to give a general idea of its graces and imperfections in my six first papers i thought my self obliged to bestow one upon every book in particular the three first books i have already dispatched and am now entering upon the fourth i need not acquaint my reader that there are multitudes of beauties in this great author especially in the descriptive parts of his poem which i have not touched upon it being my intention to point out those only which appear to me the most exquisite or those which are not so obvious to ordinary readers every one that has read the criticks who have written upon the odyssey the iliad and the aeneid knows very well that though they agree in their opinions of the great beauties in those poems they have nevertheless each of them discovered several masterstrokes which have escaped the observation of the rest in the same manner i question not but any writer who shall treat of this subject after me may find several beauties in milton which i have not taken notice of i must likewise observe that as the greatest masters of critical learning differ among one another as to some particular points in an epic poem i have not bound my self scrupulously to the rules which any one of them has laid down upon that art but have taken the liberty sometimes to join with one and sometimes with another and sometimes to differ from all of them when i have thought that the reason of the thing was on my side  we may consider the beauties of the fourth book under three heads in the first are those pictures of stilllife which we meet with in the description of eden paradise adams bower c in the next are the machines which comprehend the speeches and behaviour of the good and bad angels in the last is the conduct of adam and eve who are the principal actors in the poem  in the description of paradise the poet has observed aristotles rule of lavishing all the ornaments of diction on the weak unactive parts of the fable which are not supported by the beauty of sentiments and characters   accordingly the reader may observe that the expressions are more florid and elaborate in these descriptions than in most other parts of the poem i must further add that tho the drawings of gardens rivers rainbows and the like dead pieces of nature are justly censured in an heroic poem when they run out into an unnecessary length the description of paradise would have been faulty had not the poet been very particular in it not only as it is the scene of the principal action but as it is requisite to give us an idea of that happiness from which our first parents fell the plan of it is wonderfully beautiful and formed upon the short sketch which we have of it in holy writ miltons exuberance of imagination has poured forth such a redundancy of ornaments on this seat of happiness and innocence that it would be endless to point out each particular  i must not quit this head without further observing that there is scarce a speech of adam or eve in the whole poem wherein the sentiments and allusions are not taken from this their delightful habitation the reader during their whole course of action always finds himself in the walks of paradise in short as the criticks have remarked that in those poems wherein shepherds are actors the thoughts ought always to take a tincture from the woods fields and rivers so we may observe that our first parents seldom lose sight of their happy station in any thing they speak or do and if the reader will give me leave to use the expression that their thoughts are always paradisiacal  we are in the next place to consider the machines of the fourth book satan being now within prospect of eden and looking round upon the glories of the creation is filled with sentiments different from those which he discovered whilst he was in hell the place inspires him with thoughts more adapted to it he reflects upon the happy condition from which he fell and breaks forth into a speech that is softned with several transient touches of remorse and selfaccusation but at length he confirms himself in impenitence and in his design of drawing man into his own state of guilt and misery this conflict of passions is raised with a great deal of art as the opening of his speech to the sun is very bold and noble    o thou that with surpassing glory crownd   lookst from thy sole dominion like the god   of this new world at whose sight all the stars   hide their diminishd heads to thee i call   but with no friendly voice and add thy name   o sun to tell thee how i hate thy beams   that bring to my remembrance from what state   i fell how glorious once above thy sphere  this speech is i think the finest that is ascribed to satan in the whole poem the evil spirit afterwards proceeds to make his discoveries concerning our first parents and to learn after what manner they may be best attacked his bounding over the walls of paradise his sitting in the shape of a cormorant upon the tree of life which stood in the center of it and overtopped all the other trees of the garden his alighting among the herd of animals which are so beautifully represented as playing about adam and eve together with his transforming himself into different shapes in order to hear their conversation are circumstances that give an agreeable surprize to the reader and are devised with great art to connect that series of adventures in which the poet has engaged this   artificer of fraud  the thought of satans transformation into a cormorant and placing himself on the tree of life seems raised upon that passage in the iliad where two deities are described as perching on the top of an oak in the shape of vulturs  his planting himself at the ear of eve under the form   of a toad in order to produce vain dreams and imaginations is a circumstance of the same nature as his starting up in his own form is wonderfully fine both in the literal description and in the moral which is concealed under it his answer upon his being discovered and demanded to give an account of himself is   conformable to the pride and intrepidity of his character    know ye not then said satan filld with scorn   know ye not me ye knew me once no mate   for you there sitting where you durst not soar   not to know me argues your selves unknown   the lowest of your throng  zephons rebuke with the influence it had on satan is exquisitely graceful and moral satan is afterwards led away to gabriel the chief of the guardian angels who kept watch in paradise his disdainful behaviour on this occasion is so remarkable a beauty that the most ordinary reader cannot but take notice of it gabriels discovering his approach at a distance is drawn with great strength and liveliness of imagination    o friends i hear the tread of nimble feet   hasting this way and now by glimps discern   ithuriel and zephon through the shade   and with them comes a third of regal port   but faded splendor wan who by his gait   and fierce demeanor seems the prince of hell   not likely to part hence without contest   stand firm for in his look defiance lours  the conference between gabriel and satan abounds with sentiments proper for the occasion and suitable to the persons of the two speakers satan cloathing himself with terror when he prepares for the combat is truly sublime and at least equal to homers description of discord celebrated by longinus or to that of fame in virgil who are both represented with their feet standing upon the earth and their heads reaching above the clouds    while thus he spake th angelic squadron bright   turnd fiery red sharpning in mooned horns   their phalanx and began to hem him round   with ported spears c   on the other side satan alarmd   collecting all his might dilated stood   like teneriff or atlas unremovd   his stature reached the sky and on his crest   sat horror plumd  i must here take notice   that milton is every where full of hints and sometimes literal translations taken from the greatest of the greek and latin poets but this i may reserve for a discourse by it self because i would not break the thread of these speculations that are designed for english readers with such reflections as would be of no use but to the learned  i must however observe in this place that the breaking off the combat between gabriel and satan by the hanging out of the golden scales in heaven is a refinement upon homers thought who tells us that before the battle between hector and achilles jupiter weighed the event of it in a pair of scales the reader may see the whole passage in the   nd iliad  virgil before the last decisive combat describes jupiter in the same manner as weighing the fates of turnus and æneas milton though he fetched this beautiful circumstance from the iliad and æneid does not only insert it as a poetical embellishment like the authors abovementioned but makes an artful use of it for the proper carrying on of his fable and for the breaking off the combat between the two warriors who were upon the point of engaging to this we may further add that milton is the more justified in this passage as we find the same noble allegory in holy writ where a wicked prince some few hours before he was assaulted and slain is said to have been weighed in the scales and to have been found wanting  i must here take notice under the head of the machines that uriels gliding down to the earth upon a sunbeam with the poets device to make him descend as well in his return to the sun as in his coming from it is a prettiness that might have been admired in a little fanciful poet but seems below the genius of milton the description of the host of armed angels walking their nightly round in paradise is of another spirit    so saying on he led his radiant files   dazling the moon  as that account of the hymns which our first parents used to hear them sing in these their midnight walks is altogether divine and inexpressibly amusing to the imagination  we are in the last place to consider the parts which adam and eve act in the fourth book the description of them as they first appeared to satan is exquisitely drawn and sufficient to make the fallen angel gaze upon them with all that astonishment and those emotions of envy in which he is represented    two of far nobler shape erect and tall   godlike erect with native honour clad   in naked majesty seemd lords of all   and worthy seemd for in their looks divine   the image of their glorious maker shon   truth wisdom sanctitude severe and pure   severe but in true filial freedom placd   for contemplation he and valour formd   for softness she and sweet attractive grace   he for god only she for god in him   his fair large front and eye sublime declard   absolute rule and hyacinthin locks   round from his parted forelock manly hung   clustring but not beneath his shoulders broad   she as a veil down to her slender waste   her unadorned golden tresses wore   dissheveld but in wanton ringlets wavd   so passd they naked on nor shund the sight   of god or angel for they thought no ill   so hand in hand they passed the loveliest pair   that ever since in loves embraces met  there is a fine spirit of poetry in the lines which follow wherein they are described as sitting on a bed of flowers by the side of a fountain amidst a mixed assembly of animals  the speeches of these two first lovers flow equally from passion and sincerity the professions they make to one another are full of warmth but at the same time founded on truth in a word they are the gallantries of paradise   when adam first of men   sole partner and sole part of all these joys   dearer thy self than all   but let us ever praise him and extol   his bounty following our delightful task   to prune these growing plants and tend these flowrs   which were it toilsome yet with thee were sweet    to whom thus eve replyd o thou for whom   and from whom i was formd flesh of thy flesh   and without whom am to no end my guide   and head what thou hast said is just and right   for we to him indeed all praises owe   and daily thanks i chiefly who enjoy   so far the happier lot enjoying thee   preeminent by so much odds while thou   like consort to thy self canst no where find c  the remaining part of eves speech in which she gives an account of her self upon her first creation and the manner in which she was brought to adam is i think as beautiful a passage as any in milton or perhaps in any other poet whatsoever these passages are all worked off with so much art that they are capable of pleasing the most delicate reader without offending the most severe    that day i oft remember when from sleep c  a poet of less judgment and invention than this great author would have found it very difficult to have filled these   tender parts of the poem with sentiments proper for a state of innocence to have described the warmth of love and the professions of it without artifice or hyperbole to have made the man speak the most endearing things without descending from his natural dignity and the woman receiving them without departing from the modesty of her character in a word to adjust the prerogatives of wisdom and beauty and make each appear to the other in its proper force and loveliness this mutual subordination of the two sexes is wonderfully kept up in the whole poem as particularly in the speech of eve i have before mentioned and upon the conclusion of it in the following lines    so spake our general mother and with eyes   of conjugal attraction unreproved   and meek surrender half embracing leand   on our first father half her swelling breast   naked met his under the flowing gold   of her loose tresses hid he in delight   both of her beauty and submissive charms   smild with superior love  the poet adds that the devil turned away with envy at the sight of so much happiness  we have another view of our first parents in their evening discourses which is full of pleasing images and sentiments suitable to their condition and characters the speech of eve in particular is dressed up in such a soft and natural turn of words and sentiments as cannot be sufficiently admired  i shall close my reflections upon this book with observing the masterly transition which the poet makes to their evening worship in the following lines    thus at their shady lodge arrivd both stood   both turnd and under open sky adord   the god that made both sky air earth and heaven   which they beheld the moons resplendent globe   and starry pole thou also madst the night   maker omnipotent and thou the day c  most of the modern heroick poets have imitated the ancients in beginning a speech without premising that the person said thus or thus but as it is easie to imitate the ancients in the omission of two or three words it requires judgment to do it in such a manner as they shall not be missed and that the speech may begin naturally without them there is a fine instance of this kind out of homer in the twenty third chapter of longinus  l    footnote   from this date to the end of the series the saturday papers upon milton exceed the usual length of a spectator essay that they may not occupy more than the single

extraordinary circumstances it is a very good one if it be true but as for the following relation i should be glad were i sure it were false it is told with such simplicity and there are so many artless touches of distress in it that i fear it comes too much from the heart     mr spectator some years ago it happened that i lived in the same   house with a young gentleman of merit with whose good qualities i was   so much taken as to make it my endeavour to shew as many as i was   able in my self familiar converse improved general civilities into an   unfeigned passion on both sides he watched an opportunity to declare   himself to me and i who could not expect a man of so great an estate   as his received his addresses in such terms as gave him no reason to   believe i was displeased by them tho i did nothing to make him think   me more easy than was decent his father was a very hard worldly man   and proud so that there was no reason to believe he would easily be   brought to think there was any thing in any womans person or   character that could ballance the disadvantage of an unequal fortune   in the mean time the son continued his application to me and omitted   no occasion of demonstrating the most disinterested passion imaginable   to me and in plain direct terms offerd to marry me privately and   keep it so till he should be so happy as to gain his fathers   approbation or become possessed of his estate i passionately loved   him and you will believe i did not deny such a one what was my   interest also to grant however i was not so young as not to take the   precaution of carrying with me a faithful servant who had been also   my mothers maid to be present at the ceremony when that was over i   demanded a certificate signed by the minister my husband and the   servant i just now spoke of after our nuptials we conversed together   very familiarly in the same house but the restraints we were   generally under and the interviews we had being stolen and   interrupted made our behaviour to each other have rather the   impatient fondness which is visible in lovers than the regular and   gratified affection which is to be observed in man and wife this   observation made the father very anxious for his son and press him to   a match he had in his eye for him to relieve my husband from this   importunity and conceal the secret of our marriage which i had   reason to know would not be long in my power in town it was resolved   that i should retire into a remote place in the country and converse   under feigned names by letter we long continued this way of commerce   and i with my needle a few books and reading over and over my   husbands letters passed my time in a resigned expectation of better   days be pleased to take notice that within four months after i left   my husband i was delivered of a daughter who died within few hours   after her birth this accident and the retired manner of life i led   gave criminal hopes to a neighbouring brute of a country gentleman   whose folly was the source of all my affliction this rustick is one   of those rich clowns who supply the want of all manner of breeding by   the neglect of it and with noisy mirth half understanding and ample   fortune force themselves upon persons and things without any sense   of time and place the poor ignorant people where i lay conceald and   now passed for a widow wondered i could be so shy and strange as   they called it to the squire and were bribed by him to admit him   whenever he thought fit i happened to be sitting in a little parlour   which belonged to my own part of the house and musing over one of the   fondest of my husbands letters in which i always kept the   certificate of my marriage when this rude fellow came in and with   the nauseous familiarity of such unbred brutes snatched the papers   out of my hand i was immediately under so great a concern that i   threw my self at his feet and begged of him to return them he with   the same odious pretence to freedom and gaiety swore he would read   them i grew more importunate he more curious till at last with an   indignation arising from a passion i then first discovered in him he   threw the papers into the fire swearing that since he was not to read   them the man who writ them should never be so happy as to have me   read them over again it is insignificant to tell you my tears and   reproaches made the boisterous calf leave the room ashamed and out of   countenance when i had leisure to ruminate on this accident with more   than ordinary sorrow however such was then my confidence in my   husband that i writ to him the misfortune and desired another paper   of the same kind he deferred writing two or three posts and at last   answered me in general that he could not then send me what i asked   for but when he could find a proper conveyance i should be sure to   have it from this time his letters were more cold every day than the   other and as he grew indifferent i grew jealous this has at last   brought me to town where i find both the witnesses of my marriage   dead and that my husband after three months cohabitation has buried   a young lady whom he married in obedience to his father in a word he   shuns and disowns me should i come to the house and confront him the   father would join in supporting him against me though he believed my   story should i talk it to the world what reparation can i expect for   an injury i cannot make out i believe he means to bring me through   necessity to resign my pretentions to him for some provision for my   life but i will die first pray bid him remember what he said and   how he was charmed when he laughed at the heedless discovery i often   made of my self let him remember how awkward he was in my dissembled   indifference towards him before company ask him how i who could   never conceal my love for him at his own request can part with him   for ever oh mr

mistaken by many of my readers i did not design so much to expose vice as idleness and aimed at those persons who pass away their time rather in trifle and impertinence than in crimes and immoralities

indifferent in themselves and blameable only as they proceed from creatures endowd with reason  my following correspondent who calls her self clarinda is such a journalist as i require she seems by her letter to be placed in a modish state of indifference between vice and virtue and to be susceptible of either were there proper pains taken with her had her journal been filled with gallantries or such occurrences as had shewn her wholly divested of her natural innocence notwithstanding it might have been more pleasing to the generality of readers i should not have published it but as it is

it   is but a justice we all owe the learned world to furnish you with such   assistances as may promote that useful work for this reason i could   not forbear communicating to you some imperfect informations of a set   of men if you will allow them a place in that species of being who   have lately erected themselves into a nocturnal fraternity under the   title of the mohock club a name borrowed it seems from a sort of   cannibals in india who subsist by plundering and devouring all the   nations about them the president is styled emperor of the mohocks   and his arms are a turkish crescent which his imperial majesty bears   at present in a very extraordinary manner engraven upon his forehead   agreeable to their name the avowed design of their institution is   mischief and upon this foundation all their rules and orders are   framed an outrageous ambition of doing all possible hurt to their   fellowcreatures is the great cement of their assembly and the only   qualification required in the members in order to exert this   principle in its full strength and perfection they take care to drink   themselves to a pitch that is beyond the possibility of attending to   any motions of reason and humanity then make a general sally and   attack all that are so unfortunate as to walk the streets through   which they patrole some are knockd down others stabbd others cut

  another consist in the various kinds of barbarities which they   execute upon their prisoners some are celebrated for a happy   dexterity in tipping the lion upon them which is performed by   squeezing the nose flat to the face and boring out the eyes with   their fingers others are called the dancingmasters and teach their   scholars to cut capers by running swords thro their legs a new   invention whether originally french i cannot tell a third sort are   the tumblers whose office it is to set women on their heads and   commit certain indecencies or rather barbarities on the limbs which   they expose but these i forbear to mention because they cant but be   very shocking to the reader as well as the spectator in this manner   they carry on a war against mankind and by the standing maxims of   their policy are to enter into no alliances but one and that is   offensive and defensive with all bawdyhouses in general of which   they have declared themselves protectors and guarantees      i must own sir these are only broken incoherent memoirs of this   wonderful society but they are the best i have been yet able to   procure for being but of late establishment it is

senseless scandalous project such will   probably stand corrected by your reproofs especially if you inform   them that it is not courage for half a score fellows mad with wine   and lust to set upon

his mistress the young lady was one it seems who had long before conceived a favourable opinion of him and was still in hopes that he would some time or other make his advances as he was one day talking with her in company of her two sisters the conversation happening to turn upon love each of the young ladies was by way of raillery  recommending a wife to him when to the no small surprize of her who languished for him in secret he told them with a more than ordinary seriousness that his heart had been long engaged to one whose name he thought himself obliged in honour to conceal but that he could shew her picture in the lid of his snuffbox the young lady who found herself the most sensibly touched by this confession took the first opportunity that offered of snatching his box out of his hand he seemed desirous of recovering it but finding her resolved to look into the lid begged her that if she should happen to know the person she would not reveal her name upon carrying it to the window she was very agreeably surprized to find there was nothing within the lid but a little lookingglass in which after she had viewd her own face with more pleasure than she had ever done before she returned the box with a smile telling him she could not but admire at his choice  will fancying that his story took immediately fell into a dissertation on the usefulness of lookingglasses and applying himself to me asked if there were any looking glasses in the times of the greeks and romans for that he had often observed in the translations of poems out of those languages that people generally talked of seeing themselves in wells fountains lakes and rivers nay says he i remember mr dryden in his ovid tells us of a swingeing fellow called polypheme that made use of the sea for his lookingglass and could never dress himself to advantage but in a calm  my friend will to shew us the whole compass of his learning upon this subject further informed us that there were still several nations in the world so very barbarous as not to have any lookingglasses among them and that he had lately read a voyage to the southsea in which it is said that the ladies of chili always dress their heads over a bason of water  i am the more particular in my account of wills last nights lecture on these natural mirrors as it seems to bear some relation to the following letter which i received the day before     sir    i have read your last saturdays observations on the fourth book of   milton with great satisfaction and am particularly pleased with the   hidden moral which you have taken notice of in several parts of the   poem the design of this letter is to desire your thoughts whether   there may not also be some moral couched under that place in the same   book where the poet lets us know that the first woman immediately   after her creation ran to a lookingglass and became so enamoured of   her own face that she had never removed to view any of the other   works of nature had not she been led off to a man if you think fit   to set down the whole passage from milton your readers will be able   to judge for themselves and the quotation will not a little   contribute to the filling up of your paper   your humble servant   r t   the last consideration urged by my querist is so strong that i cannot forbear closing with it the passage he alludes to is part of eves speech to adam and one of the most beautiful passages in the whole poem    that day i oft remember when from sleep   i first awaked and found my self repos d   under a shade of flowrs much wondering where   and what i was whence thither brought and how   not distant far from thence a murmuring sound   of waters issud from a cave and spread   into a liquid plain then stood unmoved   pure as th expanse of heavn i thither went   with unexperienced thought and laid me down   on the green bank to look into the clear   smooth lake that to me seemed another sky   as i bent down to look just opposite   a shape within the watry gleam appeared   bending to look on me i started back   it started back but pleasd i soon returned   pleasd it returnd as soon with answering looks   of sympathy and love there i had fix d   mine eyes till now and pined with vain desire   had not a voice thus warnd me what thou seest   what there thou seest fair creature is thy self   with thee it came and goes but follow me   and i will bring thee where no shadow stays   thy coming and thy soft embraces he   whose image thou art him thou shalt enjoy   inseparably thine to him shalt bear   multitudes like thy self and thence be calld   mother of human race what could i do   but follow streight invisibly thus led   till i espyd thee fair indeed and tall   under a platan yet methought less fair   less winning soft less amiably mild   than that smooth watry image back i turnd   thou following crydst aloud return fair eve   whom flyst thou whom thou flyst of him thou art   his flesh his bone to give thee being i

state of my case by which you will see that the matter complained   of is a common grievance both to city and country    i am a country gentleman of between five and six thousand a year it   is my misfortune to have a very fine park and an only daughter upon   which account i have been so plagud with deerstealers and fops that   for these four years past i have scarce enjoyd a moments rest i   look upon my self to be in a state of war and am forcd to keep as   constant watch in my seat as a governour would do that commanded a   town on the frontier of an enemys country i have indeed pretty well   securd my park having for this purpose provided my self of four   keepers who are lefthanded and handle a quarterstaff beyond any   other fellow in the country and for the guard of my house besides a   band of pensionermatrons and an old maiden relation whom i keep on   constant duty i have blunderbusses always charged and foxgins   planted in private places about my garden of which i have given   frequent notice in the neighbourhood yet so it is that in spite of   all my care i shall every now and then have a saucy rascal ride by   reconnoitring as i think you call it under my windows as sprucely   drest as if he were going to a ball i am aware of this way of   attacking a mistress on horseback having heard that it is a common   practice in spain and have therefore taken care to remove my daughter   from the roadside of the house and to lodge her next the garden but   to cut short my story what can a man do after all i durst not stand   for member of parliament last election for fear of some ill   consequence from my being off of my post what i would therefore   desire of you is to promote a project i have set on foot and upon   which i have writ to some of my friends and that is that care may be   taken to secure our daughters by law as well as our deer and that   some honest gentleman of a publick spirit would move for leave to   bring in a bill for the

let   him know that if he knocks at the door he will be carryd to the   parlour fire and i will come down soon after and give him an   opportunity to break his mind   i am sir   your humble servant

the natural causes of longing in women or put me out of fear   that my wife will one time or other be delivered of something as   monstrous as any thing that has yet appeared to the world for they   say the child is to bear a resemblance of what was desird by the   mother i have been marryd upwards of six years have had four   children and my wife is now big with the fifth the expences she has   put me to in procuring what she has longed for during her pregnancy   with them would not only have handsomely defrayd the charges of the   month but of their education too her fancy being so exorbitant for   the first year or two as not to confine it self to the usual objects   of eatables and drinkables but running out after equipage and   furniture and the like extravagancies to trouble you only with a few   of them when she was with child of tom my eldest son she came home   one day just fainting and told me she had been visiting a relation   whose husband had made her a present of a chariot and a stately pair   of horses and that she was positive she could not breathe a week   longer unless she took the air in the fellow to it of her own within   that time this rather than lose an heir i readily complyd with   then the furniture of her best room must be instantly changed or she   should mark the child with some of the frightful figures in the   oldfashiond tapestry well the upholsterer was called and her   longing savd that bout when she went with molly she had fixd her   mind upon a new set of plate and as much china as would have   furnished an india shop these also i chearfully granted for fear of   being father to an indian pagod hitherto i found her demands rose   upon every concession and had she gone on i had been ruined but by   good fortune with her third which was peggy the height of her   imagination came down to the corner of a venison pasty and brought   her once even upon her knees to gnaw off the ears of a pig from the   spit the gratifications of her palate were easily preferred to those   of her vanity and sometimes a partridge or a quail a wheatear or   the pestle of a lark were chearfully purchased nay i could be   contented tho i were to feed her with green pease in april or   cherries in may but with the babe she now goes she is turned girl   again and fallen to eating of chalk pretending twill make the   childs skin white and nothing will serve her but i must bear her   company to prevent its having a shade of my brown in this however i   have venturd to deny her no longer ago than yesterday as we were   coming to town she saw a parcel of crows so heartily at breakfast   upon a piece of horseflesh that she had an invincible desire to   partake with them and to my infinite surprize begged the coachman   to cut her off a slice as if twere for himself which the fellow did   and as soon as she came home she fell to it with such an appetite   that she seemed rather to devour than eat it what her next sally will   be i cannot guess but in the mean time my request to you is that if   there be any way to come at these wild unaccountable rovings of   imagination by reason and argument youd speedily afford us your   assistance this exceeds the grievance of pinmoney and i think in   every settlement there ought to be a clause inserted that the father   should be answerable for the longings of his daughter but i

told in the foregoing book how the evil spirit practised upon eve as she lay asleep in order to inspire her with thoughts of vanity pride and ambition the author who shews a wonderful art throughout his whole poem in preparing the reader for the several occurrences that arise in it founds upon the abovementiond circumstance the first part of the fifth book adam upon his awaking finds eve still asleep with an unusual discomposure in her looks the posture in which he regards her is describd with a tenderness not to be expressd as the whisper with which he awakens her is the softest that ever was conveyd to a lovers ear    his wonder was to find unwakend eve   with tresses discomposd and glowing cheek   as through unquiet rest he on his side   leaning halfraisd with looks of cordial love   hung over her enamourd and beheld   beauty which whether waking or asleep   shot forth peculiar graces then with voice   mild as when zephyrus on flora breathes   her hand soft touching whisperd thus awake   my fairest my espousd my latest found   heavns last best gift my ever new delight   awake the morning shines and the fresh field   calls us we lose the prime to mark how spring   our tended plants how blows the citron grove   what drops the myrrh and what the balmy reed   how nature paints her colours how the bee   sits on the bloom extracting liquid sweets    such whispering wakd her but with startled eye   on adam whom embracing thus she spake    o sole in whom my thoughts find all repose   my glory my perfection glad i see   thy face and morn returnd  i cannot but take notice that milton in the conferences between adam and eve had his eye very frequently upon the book of canticles in which there is a noble spirit of eastern poetry and very often not unlike what we meet with in homer who is generally placed near the age of solomon i think there is no question but the poet in the preceding speech rememberd those two passages which are spoken on the like occasion and filld with the same pleasing images of nature    my beloved spake and said unto me rise up my love my fair one and   come away for lo the winter is past the rain is over and gone the   flowers appear on the earth the time of the singing of birds is come   and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land the figtree putteth   forth her green figs and the vines with the tender grape give a good   smell arise my love my fairone and come away    come my beloved let us go forth into the field let us get up early   to the vineyards let us see if the vine flourish whether the tender   grape appear and the pomegranates bud forth  his preferring the garden of eden to that   where the sapient king   held dalliance with his fair egyptian spouse  shews that the poet had this delightful scene in his mind  eves dream is full of those high conceits engendring pride which we are told the devil endeavourd to instill into her of this kind is that part of it where she fancies herself awakend by adam in the following beautiful lines    why sleepst thou eve now is the pleasant time   the cool the silent save where silence yields   to the nightwarbling bird that now awake   tunes sweetest his lovelabourd song now reigns   full orbd the moon and with more pleasing   light   shadowy sets off the face of things in vain   if none regard heavn wakes with all his eyes   whom to behold but thee natures desire   in whose sight all things joy with ravishment   attracted by thy beauty still to gaze  an injudicious poet would have made adam talk thro the whole work in such sentiments as these but flattery and falshood are not the courtship of miltons adam and could not be heard by eve in her state of innocence excepting only in a dream producd on purpose to taint her imagination other vain sentiments of the same kind in this relation of her dream will be obvious to every reader tho the catastrophe of the poem is finely presagd on this occasion the particulars of it are so artfully shadowd that they do not anticipate the story which follows in the ninth book i shall only add that tho the vision it self is founded upon truth the circumstances of it are full of that wildness and inconsistency which are natural to a dream adam conformable to his superior character for wisdom instructs and comforts eve upon this occasion    so cheard he his fair spouse and she was cheard   but silently a gentle tear let fall   from either eye and wiped them with her hair   two other precious drops that ready stood   each in their chrystal sluice he ere they fell   kissd as the gracious sign of sweet remorse   and pious awe that feard to have offended  the morning hymn is written in imitation of one of those psalms where in the overflowings of gratitude and praise the psalmist calls not only upon the angels but upon the most conspicuous parts of the inanimate creation to join with him in extolling their common maker invocations of this nature fill the mind with glorious ideas of gods works and awaken that divine enthusiasm which is so natural to devotion but if this calling upon the dead parts of nature is at all times a proper kind of worship it was in a particular manner suitable to our first parents who had the creation fresh upon their minds and had not seen the various dispensations of providence nor consequently could be acquainted with those many topicks of praise which might afford matter to the devotions of their posterity i need not remark the beautiful spirit of poetry which runs through this whole hymn nor the holiness of that resolution with which it concludes  having already mentioned those speeches which are assigned to the persons in this poem i proceed to the description which the poet gives   of raphael his departure from before the throne and the flight through the choirs of angels is finely imaged as milton every where fills his poem with circumstances that are marvellous and astonishing he describes the gate of heaven as framed after such a manner that it opened of it self upon the approach of the angel who was to pass through it    till at the gate   of heavn arrivd the gate selfopend wide   on golden hinges turning as by work   divine the sovereign architect had framed  the poet here seems to have regarded two or three passages in the   th iliad as that in particular where speaking of vulcan homer says that he had made twenty tripodes running on golden wheels which upon occasion might go of themselves to the assembly of the gods and when there was no more use for them return again after the same manner scaliger has rallied homer very severely upon this point as m dacier has endeavoured to defend it i will not pretend to determine whether in this particular of homer the marvellous does not lose sight of the probable as the miraculous workmanship of miltons gates is not so extraordinary as this of the tripodes so i am persuaded he would not have mentioned it had not he been supported in it by a passage in the scripture which speaks of wheels in heaven that had life in them and moved of themselves or stood still in conformity with the cherubims whom they accompanied  there is no question but milton had this circumstance in his thoughts because in the following book he describes the chariot of the messiah with living wheels according to the plan in ezekiels vision   forth rushd with whirlwind sound   the chariot of paternal deity   flashing thick flames wheel within wheel undrawn   itself instinct with spirit  i question not but bossu and the two daciers who are for vindicating every thing that is censured in homer by something parallel in holy writ would have been very well pleased had they thought of confronting vulcans tripodes with ezekiels wheels  raphaels descent to the earth with the figure of his person is represented in very lively colours several of the french italian and english poets have given a loose to their imaginations in the description of angels but i do not remember to have met with any so finely drawn and so conformable to the notions which are given of them in scripture as this in milton after having set him forth in all his heavenly plumage and represented him as alighting upon the earth the poet concludes his description with a circumstance which is altogether new and imagined with the greatest strength of fancy   like maias son he stood   and shook his plumes that heavnly fragrance filld   the circuit wide  raphaels reception by the guardian angels his passing through the wilderness of sweets his distant appearance to adam have all the graces that poetry is capable of bestowing the author afterwards gives us a particular description of eve in her domestick employments    so saying with dispatchful looks in haste   she turns on hospitable thoughts intent   what choice to chuse for delicacy best   what order so contrived as not to mix   tastes not well joind inelegant but bring   taste after taste upheld with kindliest change   bestirs her then c  though in this and other parts of the same book the subject is only the housewifry of our first parent it is set off with so many pleasing images and strong expressions as make it none of the least agreeable parts in this divine work  the natural majesty of adam and at the same time his submissive behaviour to the superior being who had vouchsafed to be his guest the solemn hail which the angel bestows upon the mother of mankind with the figure of eve ministring at the table are circumstances which deserve to be admired  raphaels behaviour is every way suitable to the dignity of his nature and to that character of a sociable spirit with which the author has so judiciously introduced him he had received instructions to converse with adam as one friend converses with another and to warn him of the enemy who was contriving his destruction accordingly he is represented as sitting down at table with adam and eating of the fruits of paradise the occasion naturally leads him to his discourse on the food of angels after having thus entered into conversation with man upon more indifferent subjects he warns him of his obedience and makes natural transition to the history of that fallen angel who was employd in the circumvention of our first parents  had i followed monsieur bossus method in my first paper of milton i should have dated the action of paradise lost from the beginning of raphaels speech in this book as he supposes the action of the æneid to begin in the second book of that poem i could allege many reasons for my drawing the action of the æneid rather from its immediate beginning in the first book than from its remote beginning in the second and shew why i have considered the sacking of troy as an episode according to the common acceptation of that word but as this would be a dry unentertaining piece of criticism and perhaps unnecessary to those who have read my first paper i shall not enlarge upon it whichever of the notions be true the unity of miltons action is preserved according to either of them whether we consider the fall of man in its immediate beginning as proceeding from the resolutions taken in the infernal council or in its more remote beginning as proceeding from the first revolt of the angels in heaven the occasion which milton assigns for this revolt as it is founded on hints in holy writ and on the opinion of some great writers so it was the most proper that the poet could have made use of  the revolt in heaven is described with great force of imagination and a fine variety of circumstances the learned reader cannot

this particular place wherein he has likewise the authority of scripture to justifie him the part of abdiel who was the only spirit that in this infinite host of angels preserved his allegiance to his maker exhibits to us a noble moral of religious singularity the zeal of the seraphim breaks forth in a becoming warmth of sentiments and expressions as the character which is given us of him denotes that generous scorn and intrepidity which attends heroic virtue the author doubtless designed it as a pattern to those who live among mankind in their present state of degeneracy and corruption    so

true author of the letter to mrs margaret clark part of which i did myself the honour to publish in a former paper i must confess i do not naturally affect critical learning but finding my self not so much regarded as i am apt to flatter my self i may deserve from some professed patrons of learning i could not but do my self the justice to shew i am not a stranger to such erudition as they smile upon if i were duly encouraged however this only to let the world see what i could do and shall not give my reader any more of this kind if he will forgive the ostentation i shew at present     march

followed the form and spelling i have been   credibly informed that mr william bullock the famous comedian is   the descendant of this gabriel who begot mr william bullocks great   grandfather on the

spectator    as i believe this is the first complaint that ever was made to you of   this nature so you are the first person i ever could prevail upon my   self to lay it before when i tell you i have a healthy vigorous   constitution a plentiful estate no inordinate desires and am   married to a virtuous lovely woman who neither wants wit nor   goodnature and by whom i have a numerous offspring to perpetuate my   family you will naturally conclude me a happy man but   notwithstanding these promising appearances i am so far from it that   the prospect of being ruind and undone by a sort of extravagance   which of late years is in a less degree crept into every fashionable   family deprives me of all the comforts of my life and renders me the   most anxious miserable man on earth my wife who was the only child   and darling care of an indulgent mother employd her early years in   learning all those accomplishments we generally understand by good   breeding and polite education she sings dances plays on the lute   and harpsicord paints prettily is a perfect mistress of the french   tongue and has made a considerable progress in italian she is   besides excellently skilld in all domestick sciences as preserving   pickling pastry making wines of fruits of our own growth   embroydering and needleworks of every kind hitherto you will be apt   to think there is very little cause of complaint but suspend your   opinion till i have further explaind my self and then i make no   question you will come over to mine you are not to imagine i find   fault that she either possesses or takes delight in the exercise of   those qualifications i just now mentiond tis the immoderate   fondness she has to them that i lament and that what is only designd   for the innocent amusement and recreation of life is become the whole   business and study of hers the six months we are in town for the   year is equally divided between that and the country from almost   break of day till noon the whole morning is laid out in practising   with her several masters and to make up the losses occasiond by her   absence in summer every day in the week their attendance is requird   and as they all are people eminent in their professions their skill   and time must be recompensed accordingly so how far these articles   extend i leave you to judge limning one would think is no   expensive diversion but as she manages the matter tis a very   considerable addition to her disbursements which you will easily   believe when you know she paints fans for all her female   acquaintance and draws all her relations pictures in miniature the   first must be mounted by no body but colmar and the other set by no   body but charles mather what follows is still much worse than the   former for as i told you she is a great artist at her needle tis   incredible what sums she expends in embroidery for besides what is   appropriated to her personal use as mantuas petticoats stomachers   handkerchiefs purses pincushions and working aprons she keeps   four french protestants continually employd in making divers pieces   of superfluous furniture as quilts toilets hangings for closets   beds windowcurtains easy chairs and tabourets nor have i any   hopes of ever reclaiming her from this extravagance while she   obstinately persists in thinking it a notable piece of good   housewifry because they are made at home and she has had some share   in the performance there would be no end of relating to you the   particulars of the annual charge in furnishing her storeroom with a   profusion of pickles and preserves for she is not contented with   having every thing unless it be done every way in which she consults   an hereditary book of receipts for her female ancestors have been   always famd for good housewifry one of whom is made immortal by   giving her name to an eyewater and two sorts of puddings i cannot   undertake to recite all her medicinal preparations as salves   cerecloths powders confects cordials ratafia persico   orangeflower and cherrybrandy together with innumerable sorts of   simple waters but there is nothing i lay so much to heart as that   detestable catalogue of counterfeit wines which derive their names   from the fruits herbs or trees of whose juices they are chiefly   compounded they are loathsome to the taste and pernicious to the   health and as they seldom survive the year and then are thrown away   under a false pretence of frugality i may affirm they stand me in   more than if i entertaind all our visiters with the best burgundy and   champaign coffee chocolate green imperial peco and boheatea   seem to be trifles but when the proper appurtenances of the teatable   are added they swell the account higher than one would imagine i   cannot conclude without doing her justice in one article where her   frugality is so remarkable i must not deny her the merit of it and   that is in relation to her children who are all confind both boys   and girls to one large room in the remotest part of the house with   bolts on the doors and bars to the windows under the care and tuition   of an old woman who had been dry nurse to her grandmother this is   their residence all the year round and as they are never allowd to   appear she prudently thinks it needless to be at any expence in   apparel or learning her eldest daughter to this day would have   neither read nor writ if it had not been for the butler who being   the son of a country attorney has taught her such a hand as is   generally used for engrossing bills in chancery by this time i have   sufficiently tired your patience with my domestick grievances which i   hope you will agree could not well be containd in a narrower compass   when you consider what a paradox i undertook to maintain in the   beginning of my epistle and which manifestly appears to be but too   melancholy a truth and now i heartily wish the relation i have given   of my misfortunes may be of use and benefit to the publick by the   example i have set before them the truly virtuous wives may learn to   avoid those errors which have so unhappily misled mine and which are   visibly these three first in mistaking the proper objects of her   esteem and fixing her affections upon such things as are only the   trappings and decorations of her sex secondly in not distinguishing   what becomes the different stages of life and lastly the abuse and   corruption of some excellent qualities which if circumscribd within   just bounds would have been the blessing and prosperity of her   family but by a vicious extreme are like to be the bane and   destruction of it   l                                               no                   tuesday march                         addison      ire tamen restat numa quo devenit et ancus    hor    my friend sir roger de coverley told me tother night that he had been reading my paper upon westminster abby in which says he there are a great many ingenious fancies he told me at the same time that he observed i had promised another paper upon the tombs and that he should be glad to go and see them with me not having visited them since he had read history i could not at first imagine how this came into the knights head till i recollected that he had been very busy all last summer upon bakers chronicle which he has quoted several times in his disputes with sir andrew freeport since his last coming to town accordingly i promised to call upon him the next morning that we might go together to the abby  i found the knight under his butlers hands who always shaves him he was no sooner dressed than he called for a glass of the widow truebys water which he told me he always drank before he went abroad he recommended me to a dram of it at the same time with so much heartiness that i could not forbear drinking it as soon as i had got it down i found it very unpalatable upon which the knight observing that i had made several wry faces told me that he knew i should not like it at first but that it was the best thing in the world against the stone or gravel  i could have wished indeed that he had acquainted me with the virtues of it sooner but it was too late to complain and i knew what he had done was out of goodwill sir roger told me further that he looked upon it to be very good for a man whilst he staid in town to keep off infection and that he got together a quantity of it upon the first news of the sickness being at dautzick when of a sudden turning short to one of his servants who stood behind him he bid him call a   hackney coach and take care it was an elderly man that drove it  he then resumed his discourse upon mrs truebys water telling me that the widow trueby was one who did more good than all the doctors and apothecaries in the county that she distilled every poppy that grew within five miles of her that she distributed her water gratis among all sorts of people to which the knight added that she had a very great jointure and that the whole country would fain have it a match between him and her and truly says sir roger if i had not been engaged perhaps i could not have done better  his discourse was broken off by his mans telling him he had called a coach upon our going to it after having cast his eye upon the wheels he asked the coachman if his axeltree was good upon the fellows telling him he would warrant it the knight turned to me told me he looked like an honest man and went in without further ceremony  we had not gone far when sir roger popping out his head called the coachman down from his box and upon his presenting himself at the window asked him if he smoaked as i was considering what this would end in he bid him stop by the way at any good tobacconists and take in a roll of their best virginia nothing material happened in the remaining part of our journey till we were set down at the westend of the abby  as we went up the body of the church the knight pointed at the trophies upon one of the new monuments and cryd out a brave man i warrant him passing afterwards by sir cloudsly shovel he flung his hand that way and cryd sir cloudsly shovel a very gallant man as we stood before busbys tomb the knight utterd himself again after the same manner dr busby a great man he whippd my grandfather a very great man i should have gone to him myself if i had not been a blockhead a very great man  we were immediately conducted into the little chappel on the right hand sir roger planting himself at our historians elbow was very attentive to every thing he said particularly to the account he gave us of the lord who had cut off the king of moroccos head among several other figures he was very well pleased to see the statesman cecil upon his knees and concluding them all to be great men was conducted to the figure which represents that martyr to good housewifry who died by the prick of a needle upon our interpreters telling us that she was a maid of honour to queen elizabeth the knight was very inquisitive into her name and family and after having regarded her finger for some time i wonder says he that sir richard baker has said nothing of her in his chronicle  we were then conveyd to the two coronationchairs where my old friend after having heard that the stone underneath the most ancient of them which was brought from scotland was called jacobs pillar sat himself down in the chair and looking like the figure of an old gothick king asked our interpreter what authority they had to say that jacob had ever been in scotland the fellow instead of returning him an answer told him that he hoped his honour would pay his forfeit i could observe sir roger a little ruffled upon being thus trepanned but our guide not insisting upon his demand the knight soon recovered his good humour and whispered in my ear that if will wimble were with us and saw those two chairs it would go hard but he would get a tobaccostopper out of one or tother of them  sir roger in the next place laid his hand upon edward the thirds sword and leaning upon the pummel of it gave us the whole history of the black prince concluding that in sir richard bakers opinion edward the third was one of the greatest princes that ever sate upon the english throne  we were then shewn edward the confessors tomb upon which sir roger acquainted us that he was the first who touched for the evil and afterwards henry the fourths upon which he shook his head and told us there was fine reading in the casualties in that reign  our conductor then pointed to that monument where there is the figure of one of our english kings without an head and upon giving us to know that the head which was of beaten silver had been stolen away several years since some whig ill warrant you says sir roger you ought to lock up your kings better they will carry off the body too if you dont take care  the glorious names of henry the fifth and queen elizabeth gave the knight great opportunities of shining and of doing justice to sir richard baker who as our knight observed with some surprize had a great many kings in him whose monuments he had not seen in the abby  for my own part i could not but be pleased to see the knight shew such an honest passion for the glory of his country and such a respectful gratitude to the memory of its princes  i must not omit that the benevolence of my good old friend which flows out towards every one he converses with made him very kind to our interpreter whom he looked upon as an extraordinary man for which reason he shook him by the hand at parting telling him that he should be very glad to see him at his lodgings in norfolkbuildings and talk over these matters with him more at leisure  l    footnote  an

considerate correspondents both under twenty years of age are very good arguments of the necessity of taking into consideration the many incidents which affect the education of youth      sir   i have long expected that in the course of your observations upon   the several parts of human life you would one time or other fall upon   a subject which since you have not i take the liberty to recommend   to you what i mean is the patronage of young modest men to such as   are able to countenance and introduce them into the world for want of   such assistances a youth of merit languishes in obscurity or poverty   when his circumstances are low and runs into riot and excess when his   fortunes are plentiful i cannot make my self better understood than   by sending you an history of my self which i shall desire you to   insert in your paper it being the only way i have of expressing my   gratitude for the highest obligations imaginable    i am the son of a merchant of the city of london who by many losses   was reduced from a very luxuriant trade and credit to very narrow   circumstances in comparison to that his former abundance this took   away the vigour of his mind and all manner of attention to a fortune   which he now thought desperate insomuch that he died without a will   having before buried my mother in the midst of his other misfortunes   i was sixteen years of age when i lost my father and an estate of   £ 00 a year came into my possession without friend or guardian to   instruct me in the management or enjoyment of it the natural   consequence of this was though i wanted no director and soon had   fellows who found me out for a smart young gentleman and led me into   all the debaucheries of which i was capable that my companions and i   could not well be supplied without my running in debt which i did   very frankly till i was arrested and conveyed with a guard strong   enough for the most desperate assassine to a bayliffs house where i   lay four days surrounded with very merry but not very agreeable   company as soon as i had extricated my self from this shameful   confinement i reflected upon it with so much horror that i deserted   all my old acquaintance and took chambers in an inn of court with a   resolution to study the law with all possible application but i   trifled away a whole year in looking over a thousand intricacies   without friend to apply to in any case of doubt so that i only lived   there among men as little children are sent to school before they are   capable of improvement only to be out of harms way in the midst of   this state of suspence not knowing how to dispose of my self i was   sought for by a relation of mine who upon observing a good   inclination in me used me with great familiarity and carried me to   his seat in the country when i came there he introduced me to all   the good company in the county and the great obligation i have to him   for this kind notice and residence with him ever since has made so   strong an impression upon me that he has an authority of a father   over me founded upon the love of a brother i have a good study of   books a good stable of horses always at my command and tho i am not   now quite eighteen years of age familiar converse on his part and a   strong inclination to exert my self on mine have had an effect upon   me that makes me acceptable wherever i go thus mr spectator by   this gentlemans favour and patronage it is my own fault if i am not   wiser and richer every day i live i speak this as well by subscribing   the initial letters of my name to thank him as to incite others to an   imitation of his virtue it would be a worthy work to shew what great   charities are to be done without expence and how many noble actions   are lost out of inadvertency in persons capable of performing them   if they were put in mind of it if a gentleman of figure in a county   would make his family a pattern of sobriety good sense and breeding   and would kindly endeavour to influence the education and growing   prospects of the younger gentry about him i am apt to believe it   would save him a great deal of stale beer on a publick occasion and   render him the leader of his country from their gratitude to him   instead of being a slave to their riots and tumults in order to be   made their representative the same thing might be recommended to all   who have made any progress in any parts of knowledge or arrived at   any degree in a profession others may gain preferments and fortunes   from their patrons but i have i hope receivd from mine good habits   and virtues i repeat to you sir my request to print this in return   for all the evil an helpless orphan shall ever escape and all the   good he shall receive in this

  have been at the latin school four years i dont know i ever playd   truant   or neglected any task my master set me in my life i   think on what i read in school as i go home at noon and night and so   intently that i have often gone half a mile out of my way not   minding whither i went our maid tells me she often hears me talk   latin in my sleep and i dream two or three nights in the week i am   reading juvenal and homer my master seems as well pleased with my   performances as any boys in the same class i think if i know my own   mind i would chuse rather to be a scholar than a prince without   learning i have a very good   affectionate father but tho very   rich yet so mighty near that he thinks much of the charges of my   education he often tells me he believes my schooling will ruin him   that i cost him godknows what in books i tremble to tell him i want   one i am forced to keep my pocketmony and lay it out for a book   now and then that he dont know of he has orderd my master to buy   no more books for me but says he will buy them himself i asked him   for horace tother day and he told me in a passion he did not   believe i was fit for it but only my master had a mind to make him   think i had got a great way in my learning i am sometimes a month   behind other boys in getting the books my master gives orders for all   the boys in the school but i have the classick authors in usum   delphini gilt and letterd on the back my father is often reckoning   up how long i have been at school and tells me he fears i do little   good my fathers carriage so discourages me that he makes me grow   dull and melancholy my master wonders what is the matter with me i   am afraid to tell him for he is a man that loves to encourage   learning and would be apt to chide my father and not knowing my   fathers temper may make him worse sir if you have any love for   learning i beg you would give me some instructions in this case and   persuade parents to encourage their children when they find them   diligent and desirous of learning i have heard some parents say they   would do any thing for their children if they would but mind their   learning i

their beards than we do without them for my part says he when i am walking in my gallery in the country and see my ancestors who many of them died before they were of my age i cannot forbear regarding them as so many old patriarchs and at the same time looking upon myself as an idle smockfacd young fellow i love to see your abrahams your isaacs and your jacobs as we have them in old pieces of tapestry with beards below their girdles that cover half the hangings the knight added if i would recommend beards in one of my papers and endeavour to restore human faces to their ancient dignity that upon a months warning he would undertake to lead up the fashion himself in a pair of whiskers  i smiled at my friends fancy but after we parted could not forbear reflecting on the metamorphoses our faces have undergone in this particular  the beard conformable to the notion of my friend sir roger was for many ages lookd upon as the type of wisdom lucian more than once rallies the philosophers of his time who endeavourd to rival one another in beard and represents a learned man who stood for a professorship in philosophy as unqualifyd for it by the shortness of his beard  ælian in his account of zoilus the pretended critick who wrote against homer and plato and thought himself wiser than all who had gone before him tells us that this zoilus had a very long beard that hung down upon his breast but no hair upon his head which he always kept close shaved regarding it seems the hairs of his head as so many suckers which if they had been sufferd to grow might have drawn away the nourishment from his chin and by that means have starved his beard  i have read somewhere that one of the popes refusd to accept an edition of a saints works which were presented to him because the saint in his effigies before the book was drawn without a beard  we see by these instances what homage the world has formerly paid to beards and that a barber was not then allowd to make those depredations on the faces of the learned which have been permitted him of later years  accordingly several wise nations have been so extremely jealous of the least ruffle offerd to their beard that they seem to have fixed the point of honour principally in that part the spaniards were wonderfully tender in this particular  don quevedo in his third vision on the last judgment has carryd the humour very far when he tells us that one of his vainglorious countrymen after having receivd sentence was taken into custody by a couple of evil spirits but that his guides happening to disorder his mustachoes they were forced to recompose them with a pair of curlingirons before they could get him to file off  if we look into the history of our own nation we shall find that the beard flourishd in the saxon heptarchy but was very much discouragd under the norman line it shot out however from time to time in several reigns under different shapes the last effort it made seems to have been in queen marys days as the curious reader may find if he pleases to peruse the figures of cardinal poole and bishop gardiner tho at the same time i think it may be questiond if zeal against popery has not induced our protestant painters to extend the beards of these two persecutors beyond their natural dimensions in order to make them appear the more terrible  i find but few beards worth taking notice of in the reign of king james the first  during the civil wars there appeared one which makes too great a figure in story to be passed over in silence i mean that of the redoubted hudibras an account of which butler has transmitted to posterity in the following lines    his tawny beard was th equal grace   both of his wisdom and his face   in cut and dye so like a tyle   a sudden view it would beguile   the upper part thereof was whey   the nether orange mixt with grey  the whisker continud for some time among us after the expiration of beards but this is a subject which i shall not here enter upon having discussed it at large in a distinct treatise which i keep by me in manuscript upon the mustachoe  if my friend sir rogers project of introducing beards should take effect i fear the luxury of the present age would make it a very expensive fashion there is no question but the beaux would soon provide themselves with false ones of the lightest colours and the most immoderate lengths a fair beard of the tapestrysize sir roger seems to approve could not come under twenty guineas the famous golden beard of æsculapius would hardly be more valuable than one made in the extravagance of the fashion  besides we are not certain that the ladies would not come into the mode when they take the air on horseback they already appear in hats and feathers coats and perriwigs and i see no reason why we should not suppose that they would have their ridingbeards on the same occasion  i may give the moral of this discourse in another paper  x

have given us some account   of that worthy society of brutes the mohocks wherein you have   particularly specifyd the ingenious performance of the liontippers   the dancingmasters and the tumblers but as you acknowledge you had   not then a perfect history of the whole club you might very easily   omit one of the most notable species of it the sweaters which may be   reckond a sort of dancingmasters too it is it seems the custom for   half a dozen or more of these welldisposd savages as soon as   they have inclosd the person upon whom they design the favour of a   sweat to whip out their swords and holding them parallel to the   horizon they describe a sort of magick circle round about him with   the points as soon as this piece of conjuration is performd and the   patient without doubt already beginning to wax warm to forward the   operation that member of the circle towards whom he is so rude as to   turn his back first runs his sword directly into that part of the   patient wherein schoolboys are punished and as it is very natural   to imagine this will soon make him tack about to some other point   every gentleman does himself the same justice as often as he receives   the affront after this jig has gone two or three times round and the   patient is thought to have sweat sufficiently he is very handsomly   rubbd down by some attendants who carry with them instruments for   that purpose and so discharged this relation i had from a friend of   mine who has lately been under this discipline he tells me he had   the honour to dance before the emperor himself not without the   applause and acclamations both of his imperial majesty and the whole   ring tho i dare say neither i or any of his acquaintance ever   dreamt he would have merited any reputation by his activity    i can assure you mr spec i was very near being qualifyd to have   given you a faithful and painful account of this walking bagnio if i   may so call it my self for going the other night along fleetstreet   and having out of curiosity just enterd into discourse with a   wandring female who was travelling the same way a couple of fellows   advanced towards us drew their swords and cry out to each other a   sweat a sweat whereupon suspecting they were some of the ringleaders   of the bagnio i also drew my sword and demanded a parly but finding   none would be granted me and perceiving others behind them filing off   with great diligence to take me in flank i began to sweat for fear of   being forced to it but very luckily betaking my self to a pair of   heels which i had good reason to believe would do me justice i   instantly got possession of a very snug corner in a neighbouring alley   that lay in my rear which post i maintaind for above half an hour   with great firmness and resolution tho not letting this success so   far overcome me as to make me unmindful of the circumspection that   was necessary to be observd upon my advancing again towards the   street by which prudence and good management i made a handsome and   orderly retreat having sufferd no other damage in this action than   the loss of my baggage and the dislocation of one of my shoeheels   which last i am just now informd is in a fair way of recovery these   sweaters by what i can learn from my friend and by as near a view as   i was able to take of them my self seem to me to have at present but   a rude kind of discipline amongst them it is probable if you would   take a little pains with them they might be brought into better   order but ill leave this to your own discretion and will only add   that if you think it worth while to insert this by way of caution to   those who have a mind to preserve their skins whole from this sort of   cupping and tell them at the same time the hazard of treating with   nightwalkers you will perhaps oblige others as well as    your very humble servant    jack lightfoot    ps my friend will have me acquaint you that though he would not   willingly detract from the merit of that extraordinary strokesman   mr sprightly yet it is his real opinion that some of those fellows   who are employd as rubbers to this newfashioned bagnio have struck   as bold strokes as ever he did in his life    i had sent this four and twenty hours sooner if i had not had the   misfortune of being in a great doubt about the orthography of the word   bagnio i consulted several dictionaries but found no relief at last   having recourse both to the bagnio in newgatestreet and to that in   chancery lane and finding the original manuscripts upon the   signposts of each to agree literally with my own spelling i returned   home full of satisfaction in order to dispatch this epistle      mr spectator   as you have taken most of the

entering upon the sixth book of paradise lost in which the poet describes the battel of angels having raised his readers expectation and prepared him for it by several passages in the preceding books i omitted quoting these passages in my observations on the former books having purposely reserved them for the opening of this the subject of which gave occasion to them the authors imagination was so inflamd with this great scene of action that wherever he speaks of it he rises if possible above himself thus where he mentions satan in the beginning of his poem   him the almighty power   hurld headlong flaming from th ethereal sky   with hideous ruin and combustion down   to bottomless perdition there to dwell   in adamantine chains and penal fire   who durst defy th omnipotent to arms  we have likewise several noble hints of it in the infernal conference    o prince o chief of many throned powers   that led th imbatteld seraphim to war   too well i see and rue the dire event   that with sad overthrow and foul defeat   hath lost us heavn and all this mighty host   in horrible destruction laid thus low   but see i the angry victor has recalled   his ministers of vengeance and pursuit   back to the gates of heavn the sulphurous hail   shot after us in storm overblown hath laid   the fiery surge that from the precipice   of heaven receivd us falling and the thunder   winged with red lightning and impetuous rage   perhaps hath spent his shafts and ceases now   to bellow through the vast and boundless deep  there are several other very sublime images on the same subject in the first book as also in the second    what when we fled amain pursued and strook   with heavns afflicting thunder and besought   the deep to shelter us this hell then seemd   a refuge from those wounds  in short the poet never mentions anything of this battel but in such images of greatness and terror as are suitable to the subject among several others i cannot forbear quoting that passage where the power who is described as presiding over the chaos speaks in the third book    thus satan and him thus the anarch old   with faultring speech and visage incomposd   answerd i know thee stranger who thou art   that mighty leading angel who of late   made head against heavens king tho overthrown   i saw and heard for such a numerous host   fled not in silence through the frighted deep   with ruin upon ruin rout on rout   confusion worse confounded and heavns gates   pourd out by millions her victorious bands   pursuing  it requird great pregnancy of invention and strength of imagination to fill this battel with such circumstances as should raise and astonish the mind of the reader and at the same time an exactness of judgment to avoid every thing that might appear light or trivial those who look into homer are surprized to find his battels still rising one above another and improving in horrour to the conclusion of the iliad miltons fight of angels is wrought up with the same beauty it is usherd in with such signs of wrath as are suitable to omnipotence incensed the first engagement is carryd on under a cope of fire occasiond by the flights of innumerable burning darts and arrows which are discharged from either host the second onset is still more terrible as it is filled with those artificial thunders which seem to make the victory doubtful and produce a kind of consternation even in the good angels this is followd by the tearing up of mountains and promontories till in the last place the messiah comes forth in the fulness of majesty and terror the pomp of his appearance amidst the roarings of his thunders the flashes of his lightnings and the noise of his chariotwheels is described with the utmost flights of human imagination  there is nothing in the first and last days engagement which does not appear natural and agreeable enough to the ideas most readers would conceive of a fight between two armies of angels  the second days engagement is apt to startle an imagination which has not been raised and qualifyd for such a description by the reading of the ancient poets and of homer in particular it was certainly a very bold thought in our author to ascribe the first use of artillery to the rebel angels but as such a pernicious invention may be well supposed to have proceeded from such authors so it entered very properly into the thoughts of that being who is all along describd as aspiring to the majesty of his maker such engines were the only instruments he could have made use of to imitate those thunders that in all poetry both sacred and profane are represented as the arms of the almighty the tearing up the hills was not altogether so daring a thought as the former we are in some measure prepared for such an incident by the description of the giants war which we meet with among the ancient poets what still made this circumstance the more proper for the poets use is the opinion of many learned men that the fable of the giants war which makes so great a noise in antiquity and gave birth to the sublimest description in hesiods works was l an allegory founded upon this very tradition of a fight between the good and bad angels  it may perhaps be worth while to consider with what judgment milton in this narration has avoided every thing that is mean and trivial in the descriptions of the latin and greek poets and at the same time improved every great hint which he met with in their works upon this subject homer in that passage which longinus has celebrated for its sublimeness and which virgil and ovid have copyd after him tells us that the giants threw ossa upon olympus and pelion upon ossa he adds an epithet to pelion greek einosíphullon which very much swells the idea by bringing up to the readers imagination all the woods that grew upon it there is further a great beauty in his singling out by name these three remarkable mountains so well known to the greeks this last is such a beauty as the scene of miltons war could not possibly furnish him with claudian in his fragment upon the giants war has given full scope to that wildness of imagination which was natural to him he tells us that the giants tore up whole islands by the roots and threw them at the gods he describes one of them in particular taking up lemnos in his arms and whirling it to the skies with all vulcans shop in the midst of it another tears up mount ida with the river enipeus which ran down the sides of it but the poet not content to describe him with this mountain upon his shoulders tells us that the river flowd down his back as he held it up in that posture it is visible to every judicious reader that such ideas savour more of burlesque than of the sublime they proceed from a wantonness of imagination and rather divert the mind than astonish it milton has taken every thing that is sublime in these several passages and composes out of them the following great image    from their foundations loosning to and fro   they pluckd the seated hills with all their land   rocks waters woods and by the shaggy tops   uplifting bore them in their hands  we have the full majesty of homer in this short description improvd by the imagination of claudian without its puerilities i need not point out the description of the fallen angels seeing the promontories hanging over their heads in such a dreadful manner with the other numberless beauties in this book which are so conspicuous that they cannot escape the notice of the most ordinary reader  there are indeed so many wonderful strokes of poetry in this book and such a variety of sublime ideas that it would have been impossible to have given them a place within the bounds of this paper besides that i find it in a great measure done to my hand at the end of my lord roscommons essay on translated poetry i shall refer my reader thither for some of the master strokes in the sixth book of paradise lost tho at the same time there are many others which that noble author has not taken notice of  milton notwithstanding the sublime genius he was master of has in this book drawn to his assistance all the helps he could meet with among the ancient poets the sword of michael which makes so great a   havock among the bad angels was given him we are told out of the armory of god   but the sword   of michael from the armory of god   was given him tempered so that neither keen   nor solid might resist that edge it met   the sword of satan with steep force to smite   descending and in half cut sheer  this passage is a copy of that in virgil wherein the poet tells us that the sword of æneas which was given him by a deity broke into pieces the sword of turnus which came from a mortal forge as the moral in this place is divine so by the way we may observe that the bestowing on a man who is favoured by heaven such an allegorical weapon is very conformable to the old eastern way of thinking not only homer has made use of it but we find the jewish hero in the book of maccabees who had fought the battels of the chosen people with so much glory and success receiving in his dream a sword from the hand of the prophet jeremiah the following passage wherein satan is described as wounded by the sword of michael is in imitation of homer    the griding sword with discontinuous wound   passed through him butt the ethereal substance closed   not long divisible and from the gash   a stream of nectarous humour issuing flowed   sanguine such as celestial spirits may bleed   and all his armour stained  homer tells us in the same manner that upon diomedes wounding the gods there flowd from the wound an ichor or pure kind of blood which was not bred from mortal viands and that tho the pain was exquisitely great the wound soon closed up and healed in those beings who are vested with immortality  i question not but milton in his description of his furious moloch flying from the battel and bellowing with the wound he had received had his eye on mars in the iliad who upon his being wounded is represented as retiring out of the fight and making an outcry louder than that of a whole army when it begins the charge homer adds that the greeks and trojans who were engaged in a general battel were terrifyd on each side with the bellowing of this wounded deity the reader will easily observe how milton has kept all the horrour of this image without running into the ridicule of it   where the might of gabriel fought   and with fierce ensigns piercd the deep array   of moloch furious king who him defyd   and at his chariotwheels to drag him bound   threatend nor from the holy one of heavn   refrained his tongue blasphemous but anon   down cloven to the waste with shattered arms   and uncouth pain fled bellowing  milton has likewise raised his description in this book with many images taken out of the poetical parts of scripture the messiahs chariot as i have before taken notice is formed upon a vision of ezekiel who as grotius observes has very much in him of homers spirit in the poetical parts of his prophecy  the following lines in that glorious commission which is given the messiah to extirpate the host of rebel angels is drawn from a sublime passage in the psalms    go then thou mightiest in thy fathers might   ascend my chariot guide the rapid wheels   that shake heavns basis bring forth all my war   my bow my thunder my almighty arms   gird on thy sword on thy puissant thigh  the reader will easily discover many other strokes of the same nature  there is no question but milton had heated his imagination with the fight of the gods in homer before he enterd upon this engagement of the angels homer there gives us a scene of men heroes and gods mixd together in battel mars animates the contending armies and lifts up his voice in such a manner that it is heard distinctly amidst all the shouts and confusion of the fight jupiter at the same time thunders over their heads while neptune raises such a tempest that the whole field of battel and all the tops of the mountains shake about them the poet tells us that pluto himself whose habitation was in the very center of the earth was so affrighted at the shock that he leapt from his throne homer afterwards describes vulcan as pouring down a storm of fire upon the river xanthus and minerva as throwing a rock at mars who he tells us coverd seven acres in his fall  as homer has introduced into his battel of the gods every thing that is great and terrible in nature milton has filled his fight of good and bad angels with all the like circumstances of horrour the shout of armies the rattling of brazen chariots the hurling of rocks and mountains the earthquake the fire the thunder are all of them employd to lift up the readers imagination and give him a suitable idea of so great an action with what art has the poet represented the whole body of the earth trembling even before it was created    all heaven resounded and had earth been then   all earth had to its center shook  in how sublime and just a manner does he afterwards describe the whole heaven shaking under the wheels of the messiahs chariot with that exception to the throne of god   under his burning wheels   the stedfast empyrean shook throughout   all but the throne it self of god  notwithstanding the messiah appears clothed with so much terrour and majesty the poet has still found means to make his readers conceive an idea of him beyond what he himself was able to describe    yet half his strength he put not forth but checkt   his thunder in mid volley for he meant   not to destroy but root them out of heaven  in a word miltons genius which was so great in it self and so strengthened by all the helps of learning appears in this book every way equal to his subject which was the most sublime that could enter into the thoughts of a poet as he knew all the arts of affecting the mind he knew it was necessary to give   it certain restingplaces and opportunities of recovering it self from time to time he has therefore with great address interspersed several speeches reflections similitudes and the like reliefs to diversify his narration and ease the attention of the   reader that he might come fresh to his great action and by such a contrast of ideas have a more lively taste of the nobler parts of his description  l    footnote   is

whole lives a light impression of a thing which at first fell into contempt with us for want of consideration the real use of a certain qualification which the wiser part of mankind look upon as at best an indifferent thing and generally a frivolous circumstance shews the ill consequence of such prepossessions what i mean is the art skill accomplishment or whatever you will call it of dancing i knew a gentleman of great abilities who bewaild the want of this part of his education to the end of a very honourable life he observd that there was not occasion for the common use of great talents that they are but seldom in demand and that these very great talents were often renderd useless to a man for want of small attainments a good mein a becoming motion gesture and aspect is natural to some men but even these would be highly more graceful in their carriage if what they do from the force of nature were confirmd and heightned from the force of reason to one who has not at all considered it to mention the force of reason on such a subject will appear fantastical but when you have a little attended to it an assembly of men will have quite another view and they will tell you it is evident from plain and infallible rules why this man with those beautiful features and well fashiond person is not so agreeable as he who sits by him without any of those advantages when we read we do it without any exerted act of memory that presents the shape of the letters but habit makes us do it mechanically without staying like children to recollect and join those letters a man who has not had the regard of his gesture in any part of his education will find himself unable to act with freedom before new company as a child that is but now learning would be to read without hesitation it is for the advancement of the pleasure we receive in being agreeable to each other in ordinary life that one would wish dancing were generally understood as conducive as it really is to a proper deportment in matters that appear the most remote from it a man of learning and sense is distinguished from others as he is such tho he never runs upon points too difficult for the rest of the world in like manner the reaching out of the arm and the most ordinary motion discovers whether a man ever learnt to know what is the true harmony and composure of his limbs and countenance whoever has seen booth in the character of pyrrhus march to his throne to receive orestes is convinced that majestick and great conceptions are expressed in the very step but perhaps tho no other man could perform that incident as well as he does he himself would do it with a yet greater elevation were he a dancer this is so dangerous a subject to treat with gravity that i shall not at present enter into it any further but the author of the following letter   has treated it in the essay he speaks of in such a manner that i am beholden to him for a resolution that i will never hereafter think meanly of any thing till i have heard what they who have another opinion of it have to say in its defence     mr spectator   since there are scarce any of the arts or sciences that have not been   recommended to the world by the pens of some of the professors   masters or lovers of them whereby the usefulness excellence and   benefit arising from them both as to the speculative and practical   part have been made publick to the great advantage and improvement   of such arts and sciences why should dancing an art celebrated by   the ancients in so extraordinary a manner be totally neglected by the   moderns and left destitute of any pen to recommend its various   excellencies and substantial merit to mankind    the low ebb to which dancing is now fallen is altogether owing to   this silence the art is esteemd only as an amusing trifle it lies   altogether uncultivated and is unhappily fallen under the imputation   of illiterate and mechanick and as terence in one of his prologues   complains of the ropedancers drawing all the spectators from his   play so may we well say that capering and tumbling is now preferred   to and supplies the place of just and regular dancing on our   theatres it is therefore in my opinion high time that some one   should come in to its assistance and relieve it from the many gross   and growing errors that have crept into it and overcast its real   beauties and to set dancing in its true light would shew the   usefulness and elegancy of it with the pleasure and instruction   producd from it and also lay down some fundamental rules that might   so tend to the improvement of its professors and information of the   spectators that the first might be the better enabled to perform and   the latter renderd more capable of judging what is if there be any   thing valuable in this art    to encourage therefore some ingenious pen capable of so generous an   undertaking and in some measure to relieve dancing from the   disadvantages it at present lies under i who teach to dance have   attempted a small treatise as an essay towards an history of dancing   in which i have enquired into its antiquity original and use and   shewn what esteem the ancients had for it i have likewise considered   the nature and perfection of all its several parts and how beneficial   and delightful it is both as a qualification and an exercise and   endeavoured to answer all objections that have been maliciously raisd   against it i have proceeded to give an account of the particular   dances of the greeks and romans whether religious warlike or civil   and taken particular notice of that part of dancing relating to the   ancient stage and in which the pantomimes had so great a share nor   have i been wanting in giving an historical account of some particular   masters excellent in that surprising art after which i have advanced   some observations on the modern dancing both as to the stage and   that part of it so absolutely necessary for the qualification of   gentlemen and ladies and have concluded with some short remarks on   the origin and progress of the character by which dances are writ   down and communicated to one master from another if some great   genius after this would arise and advance this art to that perfection   it seems capable of receiving what might not be expected from it for   if we consider the origin of arts and sciences we shall find that   some of them took rise from beginnings so mean and unpromising that   it is very wonderful to think that ever such surprizing structures   should have been raised upon such ordinary foundations but what   cannot a great genius effect who would have thought that the   clangorous noise of a smiths hammers should have given the first rise   to musick yet macrobius in his second book relates that pythagoras   in passing by a smiths shop found that the sounds proceeding from   the hammers were either more grave or acute according to the   different weights of the hammers the philosopher to improve this   hint suspends different weights by strings of the same bigness and   found in like manner that the sounds answered to the weights this   being discoverd he finds out those numbers which producd sounds   that were consonants as that two strings of the same substance and   tension the one being double the length of the other give that   interval which is called diapason or an eighth the same was also   effected from two strings of the same length and size the one having   four times the tension of the other by these steps from so mean a   beginning did this great man reduce what was only before noise to   one of the most delightful sciences by marrying it to the   mathematicks and by that means caused it to be one of the most   abstract and demonstrative of sciences who knows therefore but   motion whether decorous or representative may not as it seems   highly probable it may be taken into consideration by some person   capable of reducing it into a regular science tho not so   demonstrative as that proceeding from sounds yet sufficient to   entitle it to a place among the magnifyd arts    now mr spectator as you have declared

last met together at the club told me that he had a great mind to see the new tragedy   with me assuring me at the same time that he had not been at a play these twenty years the last i saw said sir roger was the committee which i should not have gone to neither had not i been told beforehand that it was a good churchofengland comedy   he then proceeded to enquire of me who this distrest mother was and upon hearing that she was hectors widow he told me that her husband was a brave man and that when he was a schoolboy he had read his life at the end of the dictionary my friend asked me in the next place if there would not be some danger in coming home late in case the mohocks should be abroad i assure you says he i thought i had fallen into their hands last night for i observed two or three lusty black men that followd me half way up fleetstreet and mended their pace behind me in proportion as i put on to get away from them you must know continud the knight with a smile i fancied they had a mind to hunt me for i remember an honest gentleman in my neighbourhood who was served such a trick in king charles the seconds time for which reason he has not ventured himself in town ever since i might have shown them very good sport had this been their design for as i am an old foxhunter i should have turned and dodgd and have playd them a thousand tricks they had never seen in their lives before sir roger added that if these gentlemen had any such intention they did not succeed very well in it for i threw them out says he at the end of norfolk street where i doubled the corner and got shelter in my lodgings before they could imagine what was become of me however says the knight if captain sentry will make one with us tomorrow night and if you will both of you call upon me about four aclock that we may be at the house before it is full i will have my own coach in readiness to attend you for john tells me he has got the forewheels mended  the captain who did not fail to meet me there at the appointed hour bid sir roger fear nothing for that he had put on the same sword which he made use of at the battel of steenkirk sir rogers servants and among the rest my old friend the butler had i found provided themselves with good oaken plants to attend their master upon this occasion when he had placed him in his coach with my self at his lefthand the captain before him and his butler at the head of his footmen in the rear we convoyd him in safety to the playhouse where after having marched up the entry in good order the captain and i went in with him and seated him betwixt us in the pit as soon as the house was full and the candles lighted my old friend stood up and looked about him with that pleasure which a mind seasoned with humanity naturally feels in its self at the sight of a multitude of people who seem pleased with one another and partake of the same common entertainment i could not but fancy to myself as the old man stood up in the middle of the pit that he made a very proper center to a tragick audience upon the entring of pyrrhus the knight told me that he did not believe the king of france himself had a better strut i was indeed very attentive to my old friends remarks because i looked upon them as a piece of natural criticism and was well pleased to hear him at the conclusion of almost every scene telling me that he could not imagine how the play would end one while he appeared much concerned for andromache and a little while after as much for hermione and was extremely puzzled to think what would become of pyrrhus  when sir roger saw andromaches obstinate refusal to her lovers importunities he whisperd me in the ear that he was sure she would never have him to which he added with a more than ordinary vehemence you cant imagine sir what tis to have to do with a widow upon pyrrhus his threatning afterwards to leave her the knight shook his head and muttered to himself ay do if you can this part dwelt so much upon my friends imagination that at the close of the third act as i was thinking of something else he whispered in my ear these widows sir are the most perverse creatures in the world but pray says he you that are a critick is this play according to your dramatick rules as you call them should your people in tragedy always talk to be understood why there is not a single sentence in this play that i do not know the meaning of  the fourth act very luckily begun before i had time to give the old gentleman an answer well says the knight sitting down with great satisfaction i suppose we are now to see hectors ghost he then renewed his attention and from time to time fell a praising the widow he made indeed a little mistake as to one of her pages whom at his first entering he took for astyanax but he quickly set himself right in that particular though at the same time he owned he should have been very glad to have seen the little boy who says he must needs be a very fine child by the account that is given of him upon hermiones going off with a menace to pyrrhus the audience gave a loud clap to which sir roger added on my word a notable young baggage  as there was a very remarkable silence and stillness in the audience during the whole action it was natural for them to take the opportunity of these intervals between the acts to express their opinion of the players and of their respective parts sir roger hearing a cluster of them praise orestes struck in with them and told them that he thought his friend pylades was a very sensible man as they were afterwards applauding pyrrhus sir roger put in a second time and let me tell you says he though he speaks but little i like the old fellow in whiskers as well as any of them captain sentry seeing two or three waggs who sat near us lean with an attentive ear towards sir roger and fearing lest they should smoke the knight pluckd him by the elbow and whisperd something in his ear that lasted till the opening of the fifth act the knight was wonderfully attentive to the account which orestes gives of pyrrhus his death and at the conclusion of it told me it was such a bloody piece of work that he was glad it was not done upon the stage seeing afterwards orestes in his raving fit he grew more than ordinary serious and took occasion to moralize in his way upon an evil conscience adding that orestes in his madness looked as if he saw something  as we were the first that came into the house so we were the last that went out of it being resolved to have a clear passage for our old friend whom we did not care to venture among the justling of the crowd sir roger went out fully satisfied with his entertainment and we guarded him to his lodgings in the same manner that we brought him to the playhouse being highly pleased for my own part not only with the performance of the excellent piece which had been presented but with the satisfaction which it had given to the good old man  l    footnote   this is a fourth

unpardonable insolence and regarded as a reversing the decrees of   nature i am a young man i confess yet i honour the grey head as   much as any one however when in company with old men i hear them   speak obscurely or reason preposterously into which absurdities   prejudice pride or interest will sometimes throw the wisest i   count it no crime to rectifie their reasoning unless conscience must   truckle to ceremony and truth fall a sacrifice to complaisance the   strongest arguments are enervated and the brightest evidence   disappears before those tremendous reasonings and dazling discoveries   of venerable old age you are young giddyheaded fellows you have not   yet had experience of the world thus we young folks find our ambition   crampd and our laziness indulged since while young we have little   room to display our selves and when old the weakness of nature must   pass for strength of sense and we hope that hoary heads will raise us   above the attacks of contradiction

hor    i have lately received a third letter from the gentleman who has already given the publick two essays upon education as his thoughts seem to be very just and new upon this subject i shall communicate them to the reader      sir    if i had not been hindered by some extraordinary business i should   have sent you sooner my further thoughts upon education you may   please to remember that in my last letter i endeavoured to give the   best reasons that could be urged in favour of a private or publick   education upon the whole it may perhaps be thought that i seemed   rather enclined to the latter though at the same time i confessed   that virtue which ought to be our first and principal care was more   usually acquired in the former    i intend therefore in this letter to offer at methods by which i   conceive boys might be made to improve in virtue as they advance in   letters    i know that in most of our public schools vice is punished and   discouraged whenever it is found out but this is far from being   sufficient unless our youth are at the same time taught to form a   right judgment of things and to know what is properly virtue    to this end whenever they read the lives and actions of such men as   have been famous in their generation it should not be thought enough   to make them barely understand so many greek or latin sentences but   they should be asked their opinion of such an action or saying and   obliged to give their reasons why they take it to be good or bad by   this means they would insensibly arrive at proper notions of courage   temperance honour and justice    there must be great care taken how the example of any particular   person is recommended to them in gross instead of which they ought   to be taught wherein such a man though great in some respects was   weak and faulty in others for want of this caution a boy is often so   dazzled with the lustre of a great character that he confounds its   beauties with its blemishes and looks even upon the faulty parts of   it with an eye of admiration    i have often wondered how alexander who was naturally of a generous   and merciful disposition came to be guilty of so barbarous an action   as that of dragging the governour of a town after his chariot i know   this is generally ascribed to his passion for homer but i lately met   with a passage in plutarch which if i am not very much mistaken   still gives us a clearer light into the motives of this action   plutarch tells us that alexander in his youth had a master named   lysimachus who tho he was a man destitute of all politeness   ingratiated himself both with philip and his pupil and became the   second man at court by calling the king peleus the prince achilles   and himself phoenix it is no wonder if alexander having been thus   used not only to admire but to personate achilles should think it   glorious to imitate him in this piece of cruelty and extravagance    to carry this thought yet further i shall submit it to your   consideration whether instead of a theme or copy of verses which are   the usual exercises as they are called in the schoolphrase it   would not be more proper that a boy should be tasked once or twice a   week to write down his opinion of such persons and things as occur to   him in his reading that he should descant upon the actions of turnus   and æneas shew wherein they excelled or were defective censure or   approve any particular action observe how it might have been carried   to a greater degree of perfection and how it exceeded or fell short   of another he might at the same time mark what was moral in any   speech and how far it agreed with the character of the person   speaking this exercise would soon strengthen his judgment in what is   blameable or praiseworthy and give him an early seasoning of   morality    next to those examples which may be met with in books i very much   approve horaces way of setting before youth the infamous or   honourable characters of their contemporaries that poet tells us   this was the method his father made use of to incline him to any   particular virtue or give him an aversion to any particular vice if   says horace my father advised me to live within bounds and be   contented with the fortune he should leave me do not you see says   he the miserable condition of burr and the son of albus let the   misfortunes of those two wretches teach you to avoid luxury and   extravagance if he would inspire me with an abhorrence to debauchery   do not says he make your self like sectanus when you may be happy   in the enjoyment of lawful pleasures how scandalous says he is the   character of trebonius who was lately caught in bed with another   mans wife to illustrate the force of this method the poet adds   that as a headstrong patient who will not at first follow his   physicians prescriptions grows orderly when he hears that his   neighbours die all about him so youth is often frighted from vice by   hearing the ill report it brings upon others    xenophons schools of equity in his life of cyrus the great are   sufficiently famous he tells us that the persian children went to   school and employed their time as diligently in learning the   principles of justice and sobriety as the youth in other countries   did to acquire the most difficult arts and sciences their governors   spent most part of the day in hearing their mutual accusations one   against the other whether for violence cheating slander or   ingratitude and taught them how to give judgment against those who   were found to be any ways guilty of these crimes i omit the story of   the long and short coat for which cyrus himself was punished as a   case equally known with any in littleton    the method which apuleius tells us the indian gymnosophists took to   educate their disciples is still more curious and remarkable his   words are as follow when their dinner is ready before it is served   up the masters enquire of every particular scholar how he has   employed his time since sunrising some of them answer that having   been chosen as arbiters between two persons they have composed their   differences and made them friends some that they have been   executing the orders of their parents and others that they have   either found out something new by their own application or learnt it   from the instruction of their fellows but if there happens to be any   one among them who cannot make it appear that he has employed the   morning to advantage he is immediately excluded from the company and   obliged to work while the rest are at dinner    it is not impossible that from these several ways of producing   virtue in the minds of boys some general method might be invented   what i would endeavour to inculcate is that our youth cannot be too   soon taught the principles of virtue seeing the first impressions   which are made on the mind are always the strongest    the archbishop of cambray makes telemachus say that though he was   young in years he was old in the art of knowing how to keep both his   own and his friends secrets when my father says the prince went to   the siege of troy he took me on his knees and after having embraced   and blessed me as he was surrounded by the nobles of ithaca o my   friends says he into your hands i commit the education of my son if   ever you lovd his father shew it in your care towards him but above   all do not omit to form him just sincere and faithful in keeping a   secret these words of my father says telemachus were continually   repeated to me by his friends in his absence who made no scruple of   communicating to me in their uneasiness to see my mother surrounded   with lovers and the measures they designed to take on that occasion   he adds that he was so ravished at being thus treated like a man and   at the confidence reposed in him that he never once abused it nor   could all the insinuations of his fathers rivals ever get him to   betray what was committed to him under the seal of secrecy    there is hardly any virtue which a lad might not thus learn by   practice and example    i have heard of a good man who used at certain times to give his   scholars six pence apiece that they might tell him the next day how   they had employd it the third part was always to be laid out in   charity and every boy was blamed or commended as he could make it   appear that he had chosen a fit object    in short nothing is more wanting to our publick schools than that   the masters of them should use the same care in fashioning the manners   of their scholars as in forming their tongues to the learned   languages whereever the former is omitted i cannot help agreeing   with mr locke that a man must have a very strange value for words   when preferring the languages of the greeks and romans to that which   made them such brave men he can think it worth while to hazard the   innocence and virtue of his son for a little greek and latin    as the subject of this essay is of the highest importance and what i   do not remember to have yet seen treated by any author i have sent   you what occurrd to me on it from my own observation or reading and   which you may either suppress or publish as you think fit    i am sir yours c   x

pleads an old excuse i have read somewhere of being dull with design and the gentleman who writ the epilogue   has to my knowledge so much of greater moment to value himself upon that he will easily forgive me for publishing the exceptions made against gayety at the end of serious entertainments in the following letter i should be more unwilling to pardon him than any body a practice which cannot have any ill consequence but from the abilities of the person who is guilty of it     mr spectator    i had the happiness the other night of sitting very near you and your   worthy friend sir roger at the acting of the new tragedy which you   have in a late paper or two so justly recommended i was highly   pleased with the advantageous situation fortune had given me in   placing me so near two gentlemen from one of which i was sure to hear   such reflections on the several incidents of the play as pure nature   suggested and from the other such as flowed from the exactest art and   judgment tho i must confess that my curiosity led me so much to   observe the knights reflections that i was not so well at leisure to   improve my self by yours nature i found playd her part in the   knight pretty well till at the last concluding lines she entirely   forsook him you must know sir that it is always my custom when i   have been well entertained at a new tragedy to make my retreat before   the facetious epilogue enters not but that those pieces are often   very well writ but having paid down my half crown and made a fair   purchase of as much of the pleasing melancholy as the poets art can   afford me or my own nature admit of i am willing to carry some of it   home with me and cant endure to be at once trickd out of all tho   by the wittiest dexterity in the world however i kept my seat   tother night in hopes of finding my own sentiments of this matter   favourd by your friends when to my great surprize i found the   knight entering with equal pleasure into both parts and as much   satisfied with mrs oldfields gaiety as he had been before with   andromaches greatness whether this were no other than an effect of   the knights peculiar humanity pleasd to find at last that after   all the tragical doings every thing was safe and well i dont know   but for my own part i must confess i was so dissatisfied that i was   sorry the poet had saved andromache and could heartily have wished   that he had left her stonedead upon the stage for you cannot   imagine mr spectator the mischief she was reservd to do me i   found my soul during the action gradually workd up to the highest   pitch and felt the exalted passion which all generous minds conceive   at the sight of virtue in distress the impression believe me sir   was so strong upon me that i am persuaded if i had been let alone in   it i could at an extremity have ventured to defend your self and sir   roger against half a score of the fiercest mohocks but the ludicrous   epilogue in the close extinguishd all my ardour and made me look   upon all such noble atchievements as downright silly and romantick   what the rest of the audience felt i cant so well tell for my self   i must declare that at the end of the play i found my soul uniform   and all of a piece but at the end of the epilogue it was so jumbled   together and divided between jest and earnest that if you will   forgive me an extravagant fancy i will here set it down i could not   but fancy if my soul had at that moment quitted my body and   descended to the poetical shades in the posture it was then in what a   strange figure it would have made among them they would not have   known what to have made of my motley spectre half comick and half   tragick all over resembling a ridiculous face that at the same time   laughs on one side and cries o tother the only defence i think i   have ever heard made for this as it seems to me most unnatural tack   of the comick tail to the tragick head is this that the minds of the   audience must be refreshed and gentlemen and ladies not sent away to   their own homes with too dismal and melancholy thoughts about them   for who knows the consequence of this we are much obliged indeed to   the poets for the great tenderness they express for the safety of our   persons and heartily thank them for it but if that be all pray   good sir assure them that we are none of us like to come to any   great harm and that let them do their best we shall in all   probability live out the length of our days and frequent the theatres   more than ever what makes me more desirous to have some reformation   of this matter is because of an ill consequence or two attending it   for a great many of our churchmusicians being related to the theatre   they have in imitation of these epilogues introduced in their   farewell voluntaries a sort of musick quite foreign to the design of   churchservices to the great prejudice of welldisposed people those   fingering gentlemen should be informed that they ought to suit their   airs to the place and business and that the musician is obliged to   keep to the text as much as the preacher for want of this i have   found by experience a great deal of mischief for when the preacher   has often with great piety and art enough handled his subject and   the judicious clark has with utmost diligence culled out two staves   proper to the discourse and i have found in my self and in the rest   of the pew good thoughts and dispositions they have been all in a   moment dissipated by a merry jigg from the organloft one knows not   what further ill effects the epilogues i have been speaking of may in   time produce but this i am credibly informed of that paul lorrain    has resolvd upon a very sudden reformation in his tragical   dramas and that at the next monthly performance he designs instead   of a penitential psalm to dismiss his audience with an excellent new   ballad of his own composing pray sir do what you can to put

book like a troubled ocean represents greatness in confusion the seventh affects the imagination like the ocean in a calm and fills the mind of the reader without producing in it any thing like tumult or agitation  the critick above mentioned among the rules which he lays down for succeeding in the sublime way of writing proposes to his reader that he should imitate the most celebrated authors who have gone before him and been engaged in works of the same nature   as in particular that if he writes on a poetical subject he should consider how homer would have spoken on such an occasion by this means one great genius often catches the flame from another and writes in his spirit without copying servilely after him there are a thousand shining passages in virgil which have been lighted up by homer  milton tho his own natural strength of genius was capable of furnishing out a perfect work has doubtless very much raised and ennobled his conceptions by such an imitation as that which longinus has recommended  in this book which gives us an account of the six days works the poet received but very few assistances from heathen writers who were strangers to the wonders of creation but as there are many glorious strokes of poetry upon this subject in holy writ the author has numberless allusions to them through the whole course of this book the great critick i have before mentioned though an heathen has taken notice of the sublime manner in which the lawgiver of the jews has describd the creation in the first chapter of genesis   and there are many other passages in scripture which rise up to the same majesty where this subject is touched upon milton has shewn his judgment very remarkably in making use of such of these as were proper for his poem and in duly qualifying those high strains of eastern poetry which were suited to readers whose imaginations were set to an higher pitch than those of colder climates  adams speech to the angel wherein he desires an account of what had passed within the regions of nature before the creation is very great and solemn the following lines in which he tells him that the day is not too far spent for him to enter upon such a subject are exquisite in their kind    and the great light of day yet wants to run   much of his race though steep suspense in heavn   held by thy voice thy potent voice he hears   and longer will delay to hear thee tell   his generation c  the angels encouraging our first parents in a modest pursuit after knowledge with the causes which he assigns for the creation of the world are very just and beautiful the messiah by whom as we are told in scripture the worlds were made comes forth in the power of his father surrounded with an host of angels and cloathed with such a majesty as becomes his entring upon a work which according to our conceptions appears   the utmost exertion of omnipotence what a beautiful description has our author raised upon that hint in one of the prophets and behold there came four chariots out from between two mountains and the mountains were mountains of brass      about his chariot numberless were pour   cherub and seraph potentates and thrones   and virtues winged spirits and chariots wingd   from th armoury of gold where stand of old   myriads between two brazen mountains lodgd   against a solemn day harnessd at hand   celestial equipage and now came forth   spontaneous for within them spirit livd   attendant on their lord heavn opend wide   her everduring gates harmonious sound   on golden hinges moving  i have before taken notice of these chariots of god and of these gates of heaven and shall here only add that homer gives us the same idea of the latter as opening of themselves tho he afterwards takes off from it by telling us that the hours first of all removed those prodigious heaps of clouds which lay as a barrier before them  i do not know any thing in the whole poem more sublime than the description which follows where the messiah is  represented at the head of his angels as looking down into the chaos calming its confusion riding into the midst of it and drawing the first outline of the creation    on heavenly ground they stood and from the shore   they viewd the vast immeasurable abyss   outrageous as a sea dark wasteful wild   up from the bottom turned by furious winds   and surging waves as mountains to assault   heavens height and with the center mix the pole    silence ye troubled waves and thou deep peace   said then th omnific word your discord end    nor staid but on the wings of cherubim   uplifted in paternal glory rode   far into chaos and the world unborn   for chaos heard his voice him all his train   followd in bright procession to behold   creation and the wonders of his might   then staid the fervid wheels and in his hand   he took the golden compasses prepard   in gods eternal store to circumscribe   this universe and all created things   one foot he centerd and the other turnd   round through the vast profundity obscure   and said thus far extend thus far thy bounds   this be thy just circumference o world  the thought of the golden compasses is conceived altogether in homers spirit and is a very noble incident in this wonderful description homer when he speaks of the gods ascribes to them several arms and instruments with the same greatness of imagination let the reader only peruse the description of minervas ægis or buckler in the fifth book with her spear which would overturn whole squadrons and her helmet that was sufficient to cover an army drawn out of an hundred cities the golden compasses in the abovementioned passage appear a very natural instrument in the hand of him whom plato somewhere calls the divine geometrician as poetry delights in cloathing abstracted ideas in allegories and sensible images we find a magnificent description of the creation formd after the same manner in one of the prophets wherein he describes the almighty architect as measuring the waters in the hollow of his hand meting out the heavens with his span comprehending the dust of the earth in a measure weighing the mountains in scales and the hills in a balance another of them describing the supreme being in this great work of creation represents him as laying the foundations of the earth and stretching a line upon it and in another place as garnishing the heavens stretching out the north over the empty place and hanging the earth upon nothing this last noble thought milton has expressd in the following verse    and earth selfballancd on her center hung  the beauties of description in this book lie so very thick that it is impossible to enumerate them in this paper the poet has employd on them the whole energy of our tongue the several great scenes of the creation rise up to view one after another in such a manner that the reader seems present at this wonderful work and to assist among the choirs of angels who are the spectators of it how glorious is the conclusion of the first day   thus was the first day evn and morn   nor past uncelebrated nor unsung   by the celestial quires when orient light   exhaling first from darkness they beheld   birthday of heavn and earth with joy and shout   the hollow universal orb they filld  we have the same elevation of thought in the third day when the mountains were brought forth and the deep was made    immediately the mountains huge appear   emergent and their broad bare backs upheave   into the clouds their tops ascend the sky   so high as heavd the tumid hills so low   down sunk a hollow bottom broad and deep   capacious bed of waters  we have also the rising of the whole vegetable world described in this days work which is filled with all the graces that other poets have lavishd on their descriptions of the spring and leads the readers imagination into a theatre equally surprising and beautiful  the several glories of the heavns make their appearance on the fourth day    first in his east the glorious lamp was seen   regent of day and all th horizon round   invested with bright rays jocund to round   his longitude through heavns high road the gray   dawn and the pleiades before him danced   shedding sweet influence less bright the moon   but opposite in leveld west was set   his mirror with full face borrowing her light   from him for other lights she needed none   in that aspect and still that distance keeps   till night then in the east her turn she shines   revolvd on heavns great axle and her reign   with thousand lesser lights dividual holds   with thousand thousand stars that then appeard   spangling the hemisphere  one would wonder how the poet could be so concise in his description of the six days works as to comprehend them within the bounds of an episode and at the same time so particular as to give us a lively idea of them this is still more remarkable in his account of the fifth and sixth days in which he has drawn out to our view the whole animal creation from the reptil to the behemoth as the lion and the leviathan are two of the noblest productions in the   world of living creatures the reader will find a most exquisite spirit of poetry in the account which our author gives us of them the sixth day concludes with the formation of man upon which the angel takes occasion as he did after the battel in heaven to remind adam of his obedience which was the principal design of this his visit  the poet afterwards represents the messiah returning into heaven and taking a survey of his great work there is something inexpressibly sublime in this part of the poem where the author describes that great period of time filled with so many glorious circumstances when the heavens and earth were finished when the messiah ascended up in triumph thro the everlasting gates when he looked down with pleasure upon his new creation when every part of nature seemd to rejoice in its existence when the morningstars sang together and all the sons of god shouted for joy    so evn and morn accomplished the sixth day   yet not till the creator from his work   desisting tho unwearied up returnd   up to the heavn of heavns his high abode   thence to behold this new created world   th addition of his empire how it shewed   in prospect from his throne how good how fair   answering his great idea up he rode   followd with acclamation and

returnd   magnificent his six days work a world  i cannot conclude this book upon the creation without mentioning a poem which has lately appeared under that title   the work was undertaken with so good an intention and is executed with so great a mastery that it deserves to be looked upon as one of the most useful and noble productions in our english verse the reader cannot but be pleased to find the depths of philosophy enlivened with all the charms of poetry and to see so great a strength of reason amidst so beautiful a redundancy of the imagination the author has shewn us that design in all the works of nature which necessarily leads us to the knowledge of its first cause in short he has illustrated by numberless and incontestable instances that divine wisdom which the son of sirach has so nobly ascribed to the supreme being in his formation of the world when he tells us that he created her and saw her and numbered her and poured her out upon all his works   l    footnote

of posterity this work is not an epic but described on its title page as a philosophical poem demonstrating the existence and providence of a god it argues in blank verse in the first two of its seven books the existence of a deity from evidences of design in the structure and qualities of earth and sea in the celestial bodies and the air in the next three books it argues against objections raised by atheists atomists and fatalists in the sixth book proceeds with evidences of design taking the structure of mans body for its theme and in the next which is the last book treats in the same way of

highest instance of a noble mind to bear great qualities without discovering in a mans behaviour any consciousness that he is superior to the rest of the world or to say it otherwise it is the duty of a great person so to demean himself as that whatever endowments he may have he may appear to value himself upon no qualities but such as any man may arrive at he ought to think no man valuable but for his publick spirit justice and integrity and all other endowments to be esteemed only as they contribute to the exerting those virtues such a man if he is wise or valiant knows it is of no consideration to other men that he is so but as he employs those high talents for their use and service he who affects the applauses and addresses of a multitude or assumes to himself a preeminence upon any other consideration must soon turn admiration into contempt it is certain that there can be no merit in any man who is not conscious of it but the sense that it is valuable only according to the application of it makes that superiority amiable which would otherwise be invidious in this light it is considered as a thing in which every man bears a share it annexes the ideas of dignity power and fame in an agreeable and familiar manner to him who is possessor of it and all men who are strangers to him are naturally incited to indulge a curiosity in beholding the person behaviour feature and shape of him in whose character perhaps each man had formed something in common with himself whether such or any other are the causes all men have a yearning   curiosity to behold a man of heroick worth and i have had many letters from all parts of this kingdom that request i would give them an exact account of the stature the mein the aspect of the prince   who lately visited england and has done such wonders for the liberty of europe it would puzzle the most curious to form to himself the sort of man my several correspondents expect to hear of by the action mentioned when they desire a description of him there is always something that concerns themselves and growing out of their own circumstances in all their enquiries a friend of mine in wales beseeches me to be very exact in my account of that wonderful man who had marched an army and all its baggage over the alps and if possible to learn whether the peasant who shewd him the way and is drawn in the map be yet living a gentleman from the university who is deeply intent on the study of humanity desires me to be as particular if i had opportunity in observing the whole interview between his highness and our late general thus do mens fancies work according to their several educations and circumstances but all pay a respect mixed with admiration to this illustrious character i have waited for his arrival in holland before i would let my correspondents know that i have not been so uncurious a spectator as not to have seen prince eugene it would be very difficult as i said just now to answer every expectation of those who have writ to me on that head nor is it possible for me to find words to let one know what an artful glance there is in his countenance who surprized cremona how daring he appears who forced the trenches of turin but in general i can say that he who beholds him will easily expect from him any thing that is to be imagined or executed by the wit or force of man the prince is of that stature which makes a man most easily become all parts of exercise has height to be graceful on occasions of state and ceremony and no less adapted for agility and dispatch his aspect is erect and composd his eye lively and thoughtful yet rather vigilant than sparkling his action and address the most easy imaginable and his behaviour in an assembly peculiarly graceful in a certain art of mixing insensibly with the rest and becoming one of the company instead of receiving the courtship of it the shape of his person and composure of his limbs are remarkably exact and beautiful there is in his look something sublime which does not seem to arise from his quality or character but the innate disposition of his mind it is apparent that he suffers the presence of much company instead of taking delight in it and he appeared in publick while with us rather to return goodwill or satisfy curiosity than to gratify any taste he himself had of being popular as his thoughts are never tumultuous in danger they are as little discomposed on occasions of pomp and magnificence a great soul is affected in either case no further than in considering the properest methods to extricate it self from them if this hero has the strong incentives to uncommon enterprizes that were remarkable in alexander he prosecutes and enjoys the fame of them with the justness propriety and good sense of cæsar it is easy to observe in him a mind as capable of being entertained with contemplation as enterprize a mind ready for great exploits but not impatient for occasions to exert itself the prince has wisdom and valour in as high perfection as man can enjoy it which noble faculties in conjunction banish all vainglory ostentation ambition and all other vices which might intrude upon his mind to make it unequal these habits and qualities of soul and body render this personage so extraordinary that he appears to have nothing in him but what every man should have in him the exertion of his very self abstracted from the circumstances in which fortune has placed him thus were you to see prince eugene and were told he was a private gentleman you would say he is a man of modesty and merit should you be told that was prince eugene he would be diminished no otherwise than that part of your distant admiration would turn into familiar goodwill this i thought fit to entertain my reader with

relation to the new epilogue he cannot take it amiss if i now publish another which i have just received from a gentleman who does not agree with him in his sentiments upon that matter      sir    i am amazed to find an epilogue attacked in your last fridays paper   which has been so generally applauded by the town and receivd such   honours as were never before given to any in an english theatre    the audience would not permit mrs oldfield to go off the stage the   first night till she had repeated it twice the second night the   noise of ancoras was as loud as before and she was again obliged to   speak it twice the third night it was still called for a second time   and in short contrary to all other epilogues which are dropt after   the third representation of the play this has already been repeated   nine times    i must own i am the more surprized to find this censure in opposition   to the whole town in a paper which has hitherto been famous for the   candour of its criticisms    i can by no means allow your melancholy correspondent that the new   epilogue is unnatural because it is gay if i had a mind to be   learned i could tell him that the prologue and epilogue were real   parts of the ancient tragedy but every one knows that on the british   stage they are distinct performances by themselves pieces entirely   detached from the play and no way essential to it    the moment the play ends mrs oldfield is no more andromache but   mrs oldfield and tho the poet had left andromache stonedead upon   the stage as your ingenious correspondent phrases it mrs oldfield   might still have spoke a merry epilogue we have an instance of this   in a tragedy   where there is not only a death but a martyrdom st   catherine was there personated by nell gwin she lies stone dead upon   the stage but upon those gentlemens offering to remove her body   whose business it is to carry off the slain in our english tragedies   she breaks out into that abrupt beginning of what was a very   ludicrous but at the same time thought a very good epilogue      hold are you mad you damnd confounded dog     i am to rise and speak the epilogue    this diverting manner was always practised by mr dryden who if he   was not the best writer of tragedies in his time was allowed by every   one to have the happiest turn for a prologue or an epilogue the   epilogues to cleomenes don sebastian the duke of guise aurengzebe   and love triumphant are all precedents of this nature    i might further justify this practice by that excellent epilogue which   was spoken a few years since after the tragedy of phædra and   hippolitus with a great many others in which the authors have   endeavourd to make the audience merry if they have not all succeeded   so well as the writer of this they have however shewn that it was not   for want of goodwill    i must further observe that the gaiety of it may be still the more   proper as it is at the end of a french play since every one knows   that nation who are generally esteemd to have as polite a taste as   any in europe always close their tragick entertainments with what   they call a petite piece which is purposely designd to raise mirth   and send away the audience well pleased the same person who has   supported the chief character in the tragedy very often plays the   principal part in the petite piece so that i have my self seen at   paris orestes and lubin acted the same night by the same man    tragicomedy indeed you have your self in a former speculation found   fault with very justly because it breaks the tide of the passions   while they are yet flowing but this is nothing at all to the present   case where they have already had their full course    as the new epilogue is written conformable to the practice of our best   poets so it is not such an one which as the duke of buckingham says   in his rehearsal might serve for any other play but wholly rises out   of the occurrences of the piece it was composed for    the only reason your mournful correspondent gives against this   facetious epilogue as he calls it is that he has mind to go home   melancholy i wish the gentleman may not be more grave than wise for   my own part i must confess i think it very sufficient to have the   anguish of a fictitious piece remain upon me while it is representing   but i love to be sent home to bed in a good humour if physibulus is   however resolvd to be inconsolable and not to have his tears dried   up he need only continue his old custom and when he has had his half   crowns worth of sorrow slink out before the epilogue begins    it is pleasant enough to hear this tragical genius complaining of the   great mischief andromache had done him what was that why she made   him laugh the poor gentlemans sufferings put me in mind of   harlequins case who was tickled to death he tells us soon after   thro a small mistake of sorrow for rage that during the whole action   he was so very sorry that he thinks he could have attackd half a   score of the fiercest mohocks in the excess of his grief i cannot but   look upon it as an happy accident that a man who is so bloodyminded   in his affliction was diverted from this fit of outragious   melancholy the valour of this gentleman in his distress brings to   ones memory the knight of the sorrowful countenance who lays about   him at such an unmerciful rate in an old romance i shall readily   grant him that his soul as he himself says would have made a very   ridiculous figure had it quitted the body and descended to the   poetical shades in such an encounter    as to his conceit of tacking a tragic head with a comic tail in order   to refresh the audience it is such a piece of jargon that i dont   know what to make of it    the elegant writer makes a very sudden transition from the playhouse   to the church and from thence to the gallows    as for what relates to the church he is of opinion that these   epilogues have given occasion to those merry jiggs from the organloft   which have dissipated those good thoughts and dispositions he has   found in himself and the rest of the pew upon the singing of two   staves culld out by the judicious and diligent clark    he fetches his next thought from tyburn and seems very apprehensive   lest there should happen any innovations in the tragedies of his   friend paul lorrain    in the mean time sir this gloomy writer who is so mightily   scandalizd at a gay epilogue after a serious play speaking of the   fate of those unhappy wretches who are condemned to suffer an   ignominious death by the justice of our laws endeavours to make the   reader merry on so improper an occasion by those poor burlesque   expressions of

that of   december the  th with great delight the amiable grief of asteria for   the absence of her husband it threw me into a great deal of   reflection i cannot say but this arose very much from the   circumstances of my own life who am a soldier and expect every day   to receive orders which will oblige me to leave behind me a wife that   is very dear to me and that very deservedly she is at present i am   sure no way below your asteria for conjugal affection but i see the   behaviour of some women so little suited to the circumstances wherein   my wife and i shall soon be that it is with a reluctance i never knew   before i am going to my duty what puts me to present pain is the   example of a young lady whose story you shall have as well as i can   give it you hortensius an officer of good rank in her majestys   service happend in a certain part of england to be brought to a   countrygentlemans house where he was receivd with that more than   ordinary welcome with which men of domestick lives entertain such few   soldiers whom a military life from the variety of adventures has not   renderd overbearing but humane easy and agreeable hortensius   stayd here some time and had easy access at all hours as well as   unavoidable conversation at some parts of the day with the beautiful   sylvana the gentlemans daughter people who live in cities are   wonderfully struck with every little country abode they see when they   take the air and tis natural to fancy they could live in every neat   cottage by which they pass much happier than in their present   circumstances the turbulent way of life which hortensius was used to   made him reflect with much satisfaction on all the advantages of a   sweet retreat one day and among the rest youll think it not   improbable it might enter into his thought that such a woman as   sylvana would consummate the happiness the world is so debauched with   mean considerations that hortensius knew it would be receivd as an   act of generosity if he asked for a woman of the highest merit   without further questions of a parent who had nothing to add to her   personal qualifications the wedding was celebrated at her fathers   house when that was over the generous husband did not proportion his   provision for her to the circumstances of her fortune but considered   his wife as his darling his pride and his vanity or rather that it   was in the woman he had chosen that a man of sense could shew pride or   vanity with an excuse and therefore adorned her with rich habits and   valuable jewels he did not however omit to admonish her that he did   his very utmost in this that it was an ostentation he could not but   be guilty of to a woman he had so much pleasure in desiring her to   consider it as such and begged of her also to take these matters   rightly and believe the gems the gowns the laces would still become   her better if her air and behaviour was such that it might appear   she dressed thus rather in compliance to his humour that way than out   of any value she her self had for the trifles to this lesson too   hard for woman hortensius added that she must be sure to stay with   her friends in the country till his return as soon as hortensius   departed sylvana saw in her lookingglass that the love he conceivd   for her was wholly owing to the accident of seeing her and she is   convinced it was only her misfortune the rest of mankind had not   beheld her or men of much greater quality and merit had contended for   one so genteel tho bred in obscurity so very witty tho never   acquainted with court or town she therefore resolved not to hide so   much excellence from the world but without any regard to the absence   of the most generous man alive she is now the gayest lady about this   town and has shut out the thoughts of her husband by a constant   retinue of the vainest young fellows this age has produced to   entertain whom she squanders away all hortensius is able to supply   her with tho that supply is purchased with no less difficulty than   the hazard of his life    now mr spectator would it not be a work becoming your office to   treat this criminal as she deserves you should give it the severest   reflections you can you should tell women that they are more   accountable for behaviour in absence than after death the dead are   not dishonourd by their levities the living may return and be   laughd at by empty fops who will not fail to turn into ridicule the   good man who is so unseasonable as to be still alive and come and   spoil good company    i am sir   your most obedient humble servant   all strictness of behaviour is so unmercifully laughd at in our age that the other much worse extreme is the more common folly but let any woman consider which of the two offences an husband would the more easily forgive that of being less entertaining than she could to please company or raising the desires of the whole room to his disadvantage and she will easily be able to form her conduct we have indeed carryd womens characters too much into publick life and you shall see them nowadays affect a sort of fame but i cannot help venturing to disoblige them for their service by telling them that the utmost of a womans character is contained in domestick life she is blameable or praiseworthy according as her carriage affects the house of her father or her husband all she has to do in this world is containd within the duties of a daughter a sister a wife and a mother all these may be well performed tho a lady should not be the very finest woman at an opera or an assembly they are likewise consistent with a moderate share of wit a plain dress and a modest air but when the very brains of the sex are turned and they place their ambition on circumstances wherein to excel is no addition to what is truly commendable where can this end but as it frequently does in their placing all their industry pleasure and ambition on things which will naturally make the gratifications of life last at best no longer than youth and good fortune and when we consider the least ill consequence it can be no less than looking on their own condition as

all the little learning he has picked up told us yesterday at the club that he thought there might be a great deal said for the transmigration of souls and that the eastern parts of the world believed in that doctrine to this day sir paul rycaut   says he gives us an account of several welldisposed mahometans that purchase the freedom of any little bird they see confined to a cage and think they merit as much by it as we should do here by ransoming any of our countrymen from their captivity at algiers you must know says will the reason is because they consider every animal as a brother or sister in disguise and therefore think themselves obliged to extend their charity to them tho under such mean circumstances theyll tell you says will that the soul of a man when he dies immediately passes into the body of another man or of some brute which he resembled in his humour or his fortune when he was one of us  as i was wondring what this profusion of learning would end in will told us that jack freelove who was a fellow of whim made love to one of those ladies who throw away all their fondness on   parrots monkeys and lapdogs upon going to pay her a visit one morning he writ a very pretty epistle upon this hint jack says he was conducted into the parlour where he diverted himself for some time with her favourite monkey which was chained in one of the windows till at length observing a pen and ink lie by him he writ the following letter to his mistress in the person of the monkey and upon her not coming down so soon as he expected left it in the window and went about his business  the lady soon after coming into the parlour and seeing her monkey look upon a paper with great earnestness took it up and to this day is in some doubt says will whether it was written by jack or the monkey    madam   not having the gift of speech i have a long time waited in vain for   an opportunity of making myself known to you and having at present   the conveniences of pen ink and paper by me i gladly take the   occasion of giving you my history in writing which i could not do by   word of mouth you must know madam that about a thousand years ago i   was an indian brachman and versed in all those mysterious secrets   which your european philosopher called pythagoras is said to have   learned from our fraternity i had so ingratiated my self by my great   skill in the occult sciences with a daemon whom i used to converse   with that he promised to grant me whatever i should ask of him i   desired that my soul might never pass into the body of a brute   creature but this he told me was not in his power to grant me i then   beggd that into whatever creature i should chance to transmigrate i   might still retain my memory and be conscious that i was the same   person who lived in different animals this he told me was within his   power and accordingly promised on the word of a daemon that he would   grant me what i desired from that time forth i lived so very   unblameably that i was made president of a college of brachmans an   office which i discharged with great integrity till the day of my   death i was then shuffled into another human body and acted my part   so very well in it that i became first minister to a prince who   reigned upon the banks of the ganges i here lived in great honour for   several years but by degrees lost all the innocence of the brachman   being obliged to rifle and oppress the people to enrich my sovereign   till at length i became so odious that my master to recover his   credit with his subjects shot me thro the heart with an arrow as i   was one day addressing my self to him at the head of his army    upon my next remove i found my self in the woods under the shape of a   jackcall and soon listed my self in the service of a lion i used to   yelp near his den about midnight which was his time of rouzing and   seeking after his prey he always followed me in the rear and when i   had run down a fat buck a wild goat or an hare after he had feasted   very plentifully upon it himself would now and then throw me a bone   that was but half picked for my encouragement but upon my being   unsuccessful in two or three chaces he gave me such a confounded   gripe in his anger that i died of it    in my next transmigration i was again set upon two legs and became an   indian taxgatherer but having been guilty of great extravagances   and being marryd to an expensive jade of a wife i ran so cursedly in   debt that i durst not shew my head i could no sooner step out of my   house but i was arrested by some body or other that lay in wait for   me as i venturd abroad one night in the dusk of the evening i was   taken up and hurryd into a dungeon where i died a few months after    my soul then enterd into a flyingfish and in that state led a most   melancholy life for the space of six years several fishes of prey   pursued me when i was in the water and if i betook my self to my   wings it was ten to one but i had a flock of birds aiming at me as i   was one day flying amidst a fleet of english ships i observed a huge   seagull whetting his bill and hovering just over my head upon my   dipping into the water to avoid him i fell into the mouth of a   monstrous shark that swallowd me down in an instant    i was some years afterwards to my great surprize an eminent banker   in lombardstreet and remembring how i had formerly suffered for want   of money became so very sordid and avaritious that the whole town   cried shame of me i was a miserable little old fellow to look upon   for i had in a manner starved my self and was nothing but skin and   bone when i died    i was afterwards very much troubled and amazed to find my self   dwindled into an emmet i was heartily concerned to make so   insignificant a figure and did not know but some time or other i   might be reduced to a mite if i did not mend my manners i therefore   applied my self with great diligence to the offices that were allotted   me and was generally lookd upon as the notablest ant in the whole   molehill i was at last picked up as i was groaning under a burden   by an unlucky cocksparrow that lived in the neighbourhood and had   before made great depredations upon our commonwealth    i then betterd my condition a little and lived a whole summer in the   shape of a bee but being tired with the painful and penurious life i   had undergone in my two last transmigrations i fell into the other   extream and turned drone as i one day headed a party to plunder an   hive we were received so warmly by the swarm which defended it that   we were most of us left dead upon the spot    i might tell you of many other transmigrations which i went thro how   i was a townrake and afterwards did penance in a bay gelding for ten   years as also how i was a taylor a shrimp and a tomtit in the   last of these my shapes i was shot in the christmas holidays by a   young jackanapes who would needs try his new gun upon me    but i shall pass over these and other several stages of life to   remind you of the young beau who made love to you about six years   since you may remember madam how he masked and danced and sung   and playd a thousand tricks to gain you and how he was at last   carryd off by a cold that he got under your window one night in a   serenade i was that unfortunate young fellow whom you were then so   cruel to not long after my shifting that unlucky body i found myself   upon a hill in æthiopia where i lived in my present grotesque shape   till i was caught by a servant of the english factory and sent over   into great britain i need not inform you how i came into your hands   you see madam this is not the first time that you have had me in a   chain i am however very happy in this my captivity as you often   bestow on me those kisses and caresses which i would have given the   world for when i was a man i hope this discovery of my person will   not tend to my disadvantage but that you will still continue your   accustomed favours to   your most devoted   humble servant   pugg    ps i would advise your little shockdog to keep out of my way for   as i look upon him to be the most formidable of my rivals i may   chance one time or other to give him such a snap as he wont like  l    footnote   sir paul rycaut the son of a london merchant after an

 ambition or the many whimsical ways men fall into to distinguish   themselves among their acquaintance such observations well pursued   would make a pretty history of low life i my self am got into a great   reputation which arose as most extraordinary occurrences in a mans   life seem to do from a mere accident i was some days ago   unfortunately engaged among a set of gentlemen who esteem a man   according to the quantity of food he throws down at a meal now i who   am ever for distinguishing my self according to the notions of   superiority which the rest of the company entertain ate so   immoderately for their applause as had like to have cost me my life   what added to my misfortune was that having naturally a good stomach   and having lived soberly for some time my body was as well prepared   for this contention as if it had been by appointment i had quickly   vanquished every glutton in company but one who was such a prodigy in   his way and withal so very merry during the whole entertainment that   he insensibly betrayed me to continue his competitor which in a   little time concluded in a compleat victory over my rival after   which by way of insult i ate a considerable proportion beyond what   the spectators thought me obliged in honour to do the effect however   of this engagement has made me resolve never to eat more for renown   and i have pursuant to this resolution compounded three wagers i had   depending on the strength of my stomach which happened very luckily   because it was stipulated in our articles either to play or pay how a   man of common sense could be thus engaged is hard to determine but   the occasion of this is to desire you to inform several gluttons of   my acquaintance who look on me with envy that they had best moderate   their ambition in time lest infamy or death attend their success i   forgot to tell you sir with what unspeakable pleasure i received the   acclamations and applause of the whole board when i had almost eat my   antagonist into convulsions it was then that i returned his mirth   upon him with such success as he was hardly able to swallow though   prompted by a desire of fame and a passionate fondness for   distinction i had not endeavoured to excel so far had not the   company been so loud in their approbation of my victory i dont   question but the same thirst after glory has often caused a man to   drink quarts without taking breath and prompted men to many other   difficult enterprizes which if otherwise pursued might turn very   much to a mans advantage this ambition of mine was indeed   extravagantly pursued however i cant help observing that you hardly   ever see a man commended for a good stomach but he immediately falls   to eating more tho he had before dined as well to confirm the   person that commended him in his good opinion of him as to convince   any other at the table who may have been unattentive enough not to   have done justice to his character   i am sir   your most humble servant   epicure mammon      mr spectator    i have writ to you three or four times to desire you would take   notice of an impertinent custom the women the fine women have lately   fallen into of taking snuff   this silly trick is attended with   such a coquet air in some ladies and such a sedate masculine one in   others that i cannot tell which most to complain of but they are to   me equally disagreeable mrs saunter is so impatient of being without   it that she takes it as often as she does salt at meals and as she   affects a wonderful ease and negligence in all her manner an upper   lip mixed with snuff and the sauce is what is presented to the   observation of all who have the honour to eat with her the pretty   creature her neice does all she can to be as disagreeable as her aunt   and if she is not as offensive to the eye she is quite as much to the   ear and makes up all she wants in a confident air by a nauseous   rattle of the nose when the snuff is delivered and the fingers make   the stops and closes on the nostrils this perhaps is not a very   courtly image in speaking of ladies that is very true but where   arises the offence is it in those who commit or those who observe   it as for my part i have been so extremely disgusted with this   filthy physick hanging on the lip that the most agreeable   conversation or person has not been able to make up for it as to   those who take it for no other end but to give themselves occasion for   pretty action or to fill up little intervals of discourse i can bear   with them but then they must not use it when another is speaking who   ought to be heard with too much respect to admit of offering at that   time from hand to hand the snuffbox but flavilla is so far taken   with her behaviour in this kind that she pulls out her box which is   indeed full of good brazile in the middle of the sermon and to shew   she has the audacity of a wellbred woman she offers it the men as   well as the women who sit near her but since by this time all the   world knows she has a fine hand i am in hopes she may give her self   no further trouble in this matter on sunday was sennight when they   came about for the offering she gave her charity with a very good   air but at the same time asked the churchwarden if he would take a   pinch pray sir think of these things in time and you will oblige    sir    your most humble servant  t    footnote   charles lillie the perfumer from whose shop at the corner of beaufort buildings the original spectators were distributed left behind him a book of receipts and observations the british perfumer snuff manufacturer and colourmans guide of which the ms was sold with his business but which remained unpublished until      he opens his part iii on snuffs with an account of the origin of snufftaking in england the practice being one that had become fashionable in his day and only about eight years before the appearance of the spectator it dates from sir george rookes expedition against cadiz in   0  before that time snufftaking in england was confined to a few luxurious foreigners and english who had travelled abroad they took their snuff with pipes of the size of quills out of small spring boxes the pipes let out a very small quantity upon the back of the hand and this was snuffed up the nostrils with the intention of producing a sneeze which says lillie i need not say forms now no part of the design or rather fashion of snufftaking least of all in the ladies who took part in this method of snuffing defiance at the public enemy when the fleet after the failure of its enterprize against cadiz proceeded to cut off the french ships in vigobay on the way it plundered port st mary and adjacent places where among other merchandize seizure was made of several thousand barrels and casks each containing four tin canisters of snuffs of the best growth and finest spanish manufacture at vigo among the merchandize taken from the shipping there destroyed were prodigious quantities of gross snuff from the havannah in bales bags and scrows untanned buffalo hides used with the hairyside inwards for making packages which were designed for manufacture in different parts of spain altogether fifty tons of snuff were brought home as part of the prize of the officers and sailors of the fleet of the coarse snuff called vigo snuff the sailors among whom it was shared sold waggonloads at portsmouth plymouth and chatham for not more than threepence or fourpence a pound the greater part of it was bought up by spanish jews to their own very considerable profit the fine snuffs taken at port st mary and divided among the officers were sold by some of them at once for a small price while others held their stocks and as the snuff so taken became popular and gave a patriotic impulse to the introduction of a fashion which had hitherto been almost confined to foreigners they got very high prices for it this accounts for the fact that the ladies too had added the use of the perfumed snuffbox to their other fashionable accomplishments                                               no                  saturday april

angels and the creation of the world have in them those qualifications which the criticks judge requisite to an episode they are nearly related to the principal action and have a just connexion with the fable  the eighth book opens with a beautiful description of the impression which this discourse of the archangel made on our first parents adam afterwards by a very natural curiosity enquires concerning the motions of those celestial bodies which make the most glorious appearance among the six days works the poet here with a great deal of art represents eve as withdrawing from this part of their conversation to amusements more suitable to her sex he well knew that the episode in this book which is filled with adams account of his passion and esteem for eve would have been improper for her hearing and has therefore devised very just and beautiful reasons for her retiring    so spake our sire and by his countenance seemd   entring on studious thoughts abstruse which eve   perceiving where she sat retired in sight   with lowliness majestick from her seat   and grace that won who saw to wish her stay   rose and went forth among her fruits and flowers   to visit how they prosperd bud and bloom   her nursery they at her coming sprung   and touchd by her fair tendance gladlier grew   yet went she not as not with such discourse   delighted or not capable her ear   of what was high such pleasure she reserved   adam relating she sole auditress   her husband the relater she preferrd   before the angel and of him to ask   chose rather he she knew would intermix   grateful digressions and solve high dispute   with conjugal caresses from his lip   not words alone pleasd her o when meet now   such pairs in love and mutual honour joind  the angels returning a doubtful answer to adams enquiries was not only proper for the moral reason which the poet assigns but because it would have been highly absurd to have given the sanction of an archangel to any particular system of philosophy the chief points in the ptolemaick and copernican hypothesis are described with great conciseness and perspicuity and at the same time dressed in very pleasing and poetical images  adam to detain the angel enters afterwards upon his own history and relates to him the circumstances in which he found himself upon his creation as also his conversation with his maker and his first meeting with eve there is no part of the poem more apt to raise the attention of the reader than this discourse of our great ancestor as nothing can be more surprizing and delightful to us than to hear the sentiments that arose in the first man while he was yet new and fresh from the hands of his creator the poet has interwoven every thing which is delivered upon this subject in holy writ with so many beautiful imaginations of his own that nothing can be conceived more just and natural than this whole episode as our author knew this subject could not but be agreeable to his reader he would not throw it into the relation of the six days works but reserved it for a distinct episode that he might have an opportunity of expatiating upon it more at large before i enter on this part of the poem i cannot but take notice of two shining passages in the dialogue between adam and the angel the first is that wherein our ancestor gives an account of the pleasure he took in conversing with him which contains a very noble moral    for while i sit with thee i seem in heavn   and sweeter thy discourse is to my ear   than fruits of palmtree pleasantest to thirst   and hunger both from labour at the hour   of sweet repast they satiate and soon fill   tho pleasant but thy words with grace divine   imbud bring to their sweetness no satiety  the other i shall mention is that in which the angel gives a reason why he should be glad to hear the story adam was about to relate    for i that day was absent as befel   bound on a voyage uncouth and obscure   far on excursion towards the gates of hell   squard in full legion such command we had   to see that none thence issued forth a spy   or enemy while god was in his work   lest he incensd at such eruption bold   destruction with creation might have mixd  there is no question but our poet drew the image in what follows from that in virgils sixth book where æneas and the sibyl stand before the adamantine gates which are there described as shut upon the place of torments and listen to the groans the clank of chains and the noise of iron whips that were heard in those regions of pain and sorrow   fast we found fast shut   the dismal gates and barricadod strong   but long ere our approaching heard within   noise other than the sound of dance or song   torment and loud lament and furious rage  adam then proceeds to give an account of his condition and sentiments immediately after his creation how agreeably does he represent the posture in which he found himself the beautiful landskip that surrounded him and the gladness of heart which grew up in him on that occasion   as new waked from soundest sleep   soft on the flowry herb i found me laid   in balmy sweat which with his beams the sun   soon dried and on the reaking moisture fed   streight towards heavn my wondring eyes i turnd   and gazed awhile the ample sky till raisd   by quick instinctive motion up i sprung   as thitherward endeavouring and upright   stood on my feet about me round i saw   hill dale and shady woods and sunny plains   and liquid lapse of murmuring streams by these   creatures that livd and movd and walked or flew   birds on the branches warbling all things smild   with fragrance and with joy my heart oerflowd  adam is afterwards describd as surprized at his own existence and taking a survey of himself and of all the works of nature he likewise is represented as discovering by the light of reason that he and every thing about him must have been the effect of some being infinitely good and powerful and that this being had a right to his worship and adoration his first address to the sun and to those parts of the creation which made the most distinguished figure is very natural and amusing to the imagination   thou sun said i fair light   and thou enlightend earth so fresh and gay   ye hills and dales ye rivers woods and plains   and ye that live and move fair creatures tell   tell if you saw how came i thus how here  his next sentiment when upon his first going to sleep he fancies himself losing his existence and falling away into nothing can never be sufficiently admired his dream in which he still preserves the consciousness of his existence together with his removal into the garden which was prepared for his reception are also circumstances finely imagined and grounded upon what is delivered in sacred story  these and the like wonderful incidents in this part of the work have in them all the beauties of novelty at the same time that they have all the graces of nature they are such as none but a great genius could have thought of tho upon the perusal of them they seem to rise of themselves from the subject of which he treats in a word tho they are natural they are not obvious which is the true character of all fine writing  the impression which the interdiction of the tree of life left in the mind of our first parent is describd with great strength and judgment as the image of the several beasts and birds passing in review before him is very beautiful and lively   each bird and beast behold   approaching two and two these cowring low   with blandishment each bird stoopd on his wing   i namd them as they passd  adam in the next place describes a conference which he held with his maker upon the subject of solitude the poet here represents the supreme being as making an essay of his own work and putting to the tryal that reasoning faculty with which he had endued his creature adam urges in this divine colloquy the impossibility of his being happy tho he was the inhabitant of paradise and lord of the whole creation without the conversation and society of some rational creature who should partake those blessings with him this dialogue which is supported chiefly by the beauty of the thoughts without other poetical ornaments is as fine a part as any in the whole poem the more the reader examines the justness and delicacy of its sentiments the more he will find himself pleased with it the poet has wonderfully preserved the character of majesty and condescension in the creator and at the same time that of humility and adoration in the creature as particularly in the following lines    thus i presumptuous and the vision bright   as with a smile more brighttied thus replyd c   i with leave of speech implord   and humble deprecation thus reply d   let not my words offend thee heavnly power   my maker be propitious while i speak c  adam then proceeds to give an account of his second sleep and of the dream in which he beheld the formation of eve the new passion that was awakend in him at the sight of her is touchd very finely    under his forming hands a creature grew   manlike but different sex so lovely fair   that what seemd fair in all the world seemed now   mean or in her summd up in her contained   and in her looks which from that time infused   sweetness info my heart unfelt before   and into all things from her air inspired   the spirit of love and amorous delight  adams distress upon losing sight of this beautiful phantom with his exclamations of joy and gratitude at the discovery of a real creature who resembled the apparition which had been presented to him in his dream the approaches he makes to her and his manner of courtship are all laid together in a most exquisite propriety of sentiments  tho this part of the poem is workd up with great warmth and spirit the love which is described in it is every way suitable to a state of innocence if the reader compares the description which adam here gives of his leading eve to the nuptial bower with that which mr dryden has made on the same occasion in a scene of his fall of man he will be sensible of the great care which milton took to avoid all thoughts on so delicate a subject that might be offensive to religion or goodmanners the sentiments are chaste but not cold and convey to the mind ideas of the most transporting passion and of the greatest purity what a noble mixture of rapture and innocence has the author joind together in the reflection which adam makes on the pleasures of love compared to those of sense    thus have i told thee all my state and brought   my story to the sum of earthly bliss   which i enjoy and must confess to find   in all things else delight indeed but such   as usd or not works in the mind no change   nor vehement desire these delicacies   i mean of taste sight smell herbs fruits and flowers   walks and the melody of birds but here   far otherwise transported i behold   transported touch here passion first i felt

all   greatness of mind and nobleness their seat   build in her loveliest and create an awe   about her as a guard angelick placd  these sentiments of love in our first parent gave the angel such an insight into humane nature that he seems apprehensive of the evils which might befall the species in general as well as adam in particular from the excess of this passion he therefore fortifies him against it by timely admonitions which very artfully prepare the mind of the reader for the occurrences of the next book where the weakness of which adam here gives such distant discoveries brings about that fatal event which is the subject of the poem his discourse which follows the gentle rebuke he received from the angel shews that his love however violent it might appear was still founded in reason and consequently not improper for paradise    neither her outside form so fair nor aught   in procreation common to all kinds   tho higher of the genial bed by far   and with mysterious reverence i deem   so much delights me as those graceful acts   those thousand decencies that daily flow   from all her words and actions mixt with love   and sweet compliance which declare unfeignd

a certain dignity and greatness suitable to the father of mankind in his state of innocence  l                                        no                      monday april                        steele

  when we consider the offices of humane life there is methinks something in what we ordinarily call generosity which when carefully examined seems to flow rather from a loose and unguarded temper than an honest and liberal mind for this reason it is absolutely necessary that all liberality should have for its basis and support frugality by this means the beneficent spirit works in a man from the convictions of reason not from the impulses of passion the generous man in the ordinary acceptation without respect to the demands of his own family will soon find upon the foot of his account that he has sacrificed to fools knaves flatterers or the deservedly unhappy all the opportunities of affording any future assistance where it ought to be let him therefore reflect that if to bestow be in it self laudable should not a man take care to secure ability to do things praiseworthy as long as he lives or could there be a more cruel piece of raillery upon a man who should have reducd his fortune below the capacity of acting according to his natural temper than to say of him that gentleman was generous my beloved author therefore has in the sentence on the top of my paper turned his eye with a certain satiety from beholding the addresses to the people by largesses and publick entertainments which he asserts to be in general vicious and are always to be regulated according to the circumstances of time and a mans own fortune a constant benignity in commerce with the rest of the world which ought to run through all a mans actions has effects more useful to those whom you oblige and less ostentatious in your self he turns his recommendation of this virtue in commercial life and according to him a citizen who is frank in his kindnesses and abhors severity in his demands he who in buying selling lending doing acts of good neighbourhood is just and easy he who appears naturally averse to disputes and above the sense of little sufferings bears a nobler character and does much more good to mankind than any other mans fortune without commerce can possibly support for the citizen above all other men has opportunities of arriving at that highest fruit of wealth to be liberal without the least expence of a mans own fortune it is not to be denied but such a practice is liable to hazard but this therefore adds to the obligation that among traders he who obliges is as much concerned to keep the favour a secret as he who receives it the unhappy distinctions among us in england are so great that to celebrate the intercourse of commercial friendship with which i am daily made acquainted would be to raise the virtuous man so many enemies of the contrary party i am obliged to conceal all i know of tom the bounteous who lends at the ordinary interest to give men of less fortune opportunities of making greater advantages he conceals under a rough air and distant behaviour a bleeding compassion and womanish tenderness this is governed by the most exact circumspection that there is no industry wanting in the person whom he is to serve and that he is guilty of no improper expences this i know of tom but who dare say it of so known a tory the same care i was forced to use some time ago in the report of anothers virtue and said fifty instead of a hundred because the man i pointed at was a whig actions of this kind are popular without being invidious for every man of ordinary circumstances looks upon a man who has this known benignity in his nature as a person ready to be his friend upon such terms as he ought to expect it and the wealthy who may envy such a character can do no injury to its interests but by the imitation of it in which the good citizens will rejoice to be rivalled i know not how to form to myself a greater idea of humane life than in what is the practice of some wealthy men whom i could name that make no step to the improvement of their own fortunes wherein they do not also advance those of other men who would languish in poverty without that munificence in a nation where there are so many publick funds to be supported i know not whether he can be called a good subject who does not imbark some part of his fortune with the state to whose vigilance he owes the security of the whole this certainly is an immediate way of laying an obligation upon many and extending his benignity the furthest a man can possibly who is not engaged in commerce but he who trades besides giving the state some part of this sort of credit he gives his banker may in all the occurrences of his life have his eye upon removing want from the door of the industrious and defending the unhappy upright man from bankruptcy without this benignity pride or vengeance will precipitate a man to chuse the receipt of half his demands from one whom he has undone rather than the whole from one to whom he has shewn mercy this benignity is essential to the character of a fair trader and any man who designs to enjoy his wealth with honour and selfsatisfaction nay it would not be hard to maintain that the practice of supporting good and industrious men would carry a man further even to his profit than indulging the propensity of serving and obliging the fortunate my author argues on this subject in order to incline mens minds to those who want them most after this manner we must always consider the nature of things and govern our selves accordingly the wealthy man when he has repaid you is upon a ballance with you but the person whom you favourd with a loan if he be a good man will think himself in your debt after he has paid you the wealthy and the conspicuous are not obliged by the benefit you do them they think they conferred a benefit when they receive one your good offices are always suspected and it is with them the same thing to expect their favour as to receive it but the man below you who knows in the good you have done him you respected himself more than his circumstances does not act like an obliged man only to him from whom he has received a benefit but also to all who are capable of doing him one and whatever little offices he can do for you he is so far from magnifying it that he will labour to extenuate it in all his actions and expressions moreover the regard to what you do to a great man at best is taken notice of no further than by himself or his family but what you do to a man of an humble fortune provided always that he is a good and a modest man raises the affections towards you of all men of that character of which there are many in the whole city  there is nothing gains a reputation to a preacher so much as his own practice i am therefore casting about what act of benignity is in the power of a spectator alas that lies but in a very narrow compass and i think the most immediate under my patronage are either players or such whose circumstances bear an affinity with theirs all therefore i am able to do at this time of this kind is to tell the town that on friday the   th of this instant april there will be performd in yorkbuildings a consort of vocal and instrumental musick for the benefit of mr edward keen the father of twenty children and that this day the haughty george powell hopes all the goodnaturd part of the town will favour him whom they applauded in alexander timon lear and orestes with their company this night when he hazards all his heroick glory for their approbation in the humbler condition of honest jack falstaffe  t                                        no                 tuesday april                          budgell      quis furor ô cives quæ tanta licentia ferri    lucan    i do not question but my country readers have been very much surprized at the several accounts they have met with in our publick papers of that species of men among us lately known by the name of mohocks i find the opinions of the learned as to their origin and designs are altogether various insomuch that very many begin to doubt whether indeed there were ever any such society of men the terror which spread it self over the whole nation some years since on account of the irish is still fresh in most peoples memories tho it afterwards appeared there was not the least ground for that general consternation  the late panick fear was in the opinion of many deep and penetrating persons of the same nature these will have it that the mohocks are like those spectres and apparitions which frighten several towns and villages in her majestys dominions tho they were never seen by any of the inhabitants others are apt to think that these mohocks are a kind of bullbeggars first invented by prudent married men and masters of families in order to deter their wives and daughters from taking the air at unseasonable hours and that when they tell them the mohocks will catch them it is a caution of the same nature with that of our forefathers when they bid their children have a care of rawhead and bloodybones  for my own part i am afraid there was too much reason for that great alarm the whole city has been in upon this occasion tho at the same time i must own that i am in some doubt whether the following pieces are genuine and authentick and the more so because i am not fully satisfied that the name by which the emperor subscribes himself is altogether conformable to the indian orthography  i shall only further inform my readers that it was some

passes among my   part of the world who are tho i say it without controversy the   most accomplished and best bred of the town give me leave to tell   you that i am extremely discomposed when i hear scandal and am an   utter enemy to all manner of detraction and think it the greatest   meanness that people of distinction can be guilty of however it is   hardly possible to come into company where you do not find them   pulling one another to pieces and that from no other provocation but   that of hearing any one commended merit both as to wit and beauty   is become no other than the possession of a few trifling peoples   favour which you cannot possibly arrive at if you have really any   thing in you that is deserving what they would bring to pass is to   make all good and evil consist in report and with whispers calumnies   and impertinencies to have the conduct of those reports by this   means innocents are blasted upon their first appearance in town and   there is nothing more required to make a young woman the object of   envy and hatred than to deserve love and admiration this abominable   endeavour to suppress or lessen every thing that is praiseworthy is   as frequent among the men as the women if i can remember what passed   at a visit last night it will serve as an instance that the sexes are   equally inclined to defamation with equal malice with equal   impotence jack triplett came into my lady airys about eight of the   clock you know the manner we sit at a visit and i need not describe   the circle but mr triplett came in introduced by two tapers   supported by a spruce servant whose hair is under a cap till my   ladys candles are all lighted up and the hour of ceremony begins i   say jack triplett came in and singing for he is really good   company every feature charming creaturehe went on it is a most   unreasonable thing that people cannot go peaceably to see their   friends but these murderers are let loose such a shape such an air

think her she is   extremely belyd if she is the novice she appears she was last week   at a ball till two in the morning mr triplett knows whether he was   the happy man that took care of her home butthis was followed by   some particular exception that each woman in the room made to some   peculiar grace or advantage so that mr triplett was beaten from one   limb and feature to another till he was forced to resign the whole   woman in the end i took notice triplett recorded all this malice in   his heart and saw in his countenance and a certain waggish shrug   that he designd to repeat the conversation i therefore let the   discourse die and soon after took an occasion to commend a certain   gentleman of my acquaintance for a person of singular modesty   courage integrity and withal as a man of an entertaining   conversation to which advantages he had a shape and manner peculiarly   graceful mr triplett who is a womans man seemd to hear me with   patience enough commend the qualities of his mind he never heard   indeed but that he was a very honest man and no fool but for a fine   gentleman he must ask pardon upon no other foundation than this mr   triplett took occasion to give the gentlemans pedigree by what   methods some part of the estate was acquired how much it was beholden   to a marriage for the present circumstances of it after all he could   see nothing but a common man in his person his breeding or   understanding    thus mr spectator this impertinent humour of diminishing every one   who is produced in conversation to their advantage runs thro the   world and i am i confess so fearful of the force of ill tongues   that i have begged of all those who are my wellwishers never to   commend me for it will but bring my frailties into examination and i   had rather be unobserved than conspicuous for disputed perfections i   am confident a thousand young people who would have been ornaments to   society have from fear of scandal never dared to exert themselves   in the polite arts of life their lives have passed away in an odious   rusticity in spite of great advantages of person genius and fortune   there is a vicious terror of being blamed in some wellinclind   people and a wicked pleasure in suppressing them in others both   which i recommend to your spectatorial wisdom to animadvert upon and   if you can be successful in it i need not say how much you will   deserve of the town but new toasts will owe to you their beauty and   new wits their fame i am   sir   your most obedient   humble servant   mary   t

   lucan    i am very much pleased with a consolatory letter of phalaris to one who had lost a son that was a young man of great merit the thought with which he comforts the afflicted father is to the best of my memory as follows that he should consider death had set a kind of seal upon his sons character and placed him out of the reach of vice and infamy that while he livd he was still within the possibility of falling away from virtue and losing the fame of which he was possessed death only closes a mans reputation and determines it as good or bad  this among other motives may be one reason why we are naturally averse to the launching out into a mans praise till his head is laid in the dust whilst he is capable of changing we may be forced to retract our opinions he may forfeit the esteem we have conceived of him and some time or other appear to us under a different light from what he does at present in short as the life of any man cannot be calld happy or unhappy so neither can it be pronounced vicious or virtuous before the conclusion of it  it was upon this consideration that epaminondas being asked whether chabrias iphicrates or he himself deserved most to be esteemed you must first see us die said he before that question can be answered    as there is not a more melancholy consideration to a good man than his being obnoxious to such a change so there is nothing more glorious than to keep up an uniformity in his actions and preserve the beauty of his character to the last  the end of a mans life is often compared to the winding up of a wellwritten play where the principal persons still act in character whatever the fate is which they undergo there is scarce a great person in the grecian or roman history whose death has not been remarked upon by some writer or other and censured or applauded according to the genius or principles of the person who has descanted on it monsieur de st evremont is very particular in setting forth the constancy and courage of petronius arbiter during his last moments and thinks he discovers in them a greater firmness of mind and resolution than in the death of seneca cato or socrates there is no question but this polite authors affectation of appearing singular in his remarks and making discoveries which had escaped the observation of others threw him into this course of reflection it was petroniuss merit that he died in the same gaiety of temper in which he lived but as his life was altogether loose and dissolute the indifference which he showed at the close of it is to be looked upon as a piece of natural carelessness and levity rather than fortitude the resolution of socrates proceeded from very different motives the consciousness of a wellspent life and the prospect of a happy eternity if the ingenious author above mentioned was so pleased with gaiety of humour in a dying man he might have found a much nobler instance of it in our countryman sir thomas more  this great and learned man was famous for enlivening his ordinary discourses with wit and pleasantry and as erasmus tells him in an epistle dedicatory acted in all parts of life like a second democritus  he died upon a point of religion and is respected as a martyr by that side for which he sufferd the innocent mirth which had been so conspicuous in his life did not forsake him to the last he maintaind the same chearfulness of heart upon the scaffold which he used to shew at his table and upon laying his head on the block gave instances of that goodhumour with which he had always entertained his friends in the most ordinary occurrences his death was of a piece with his life there was nothing in it new forced or affected he did not look upon the severing of his head from his body as a circumstance that ought to produce any change in the disposition of his mind and as he died under a fixed and settled hope of immortality he thought any unusual degree of sorrow and concern improper on such an occasion as had nothing in it which could deject or terrify him  there is no great danger of imitation from this example mens natural fears will be a sufficient guard against it i shall only observe that what was philosophy in this extraordinary man would be frenzy in one who does not resemble him as well in the chearfulness of his temper as in the sanctity of his life and manners  i shall conclude this paper with the instance of a person who seems to me to have shewn more intrepidity and greatness of soul in his dying moments than what we meet with among any of the most celebrated greeks and romans i met with this instance in the history of the revolutions in portugal written by the abbot de vertot    when don sebastian king of portugal had invaded the territories of muly moluc emperor of morocco in order to dethrone him and set his crown upon the head of his nephew moluc was wearing away with a distemper which he himself knew was incurable however he prepared for the reception of so formidable an enemy he was indeed so far spent with his sickness that he did not expect to live out the whole day when the last decisive battel was given but knowing the fatal consequences that would happen to his children and people in case he should die before he put an end to that war he commanded his principal officers that if he died during the engagement they should conceal his death from the army and that they should ride up to the litter in which his corpse was carried under pretence of receiving orders from him as usual before the battel begun he was carried through all the ranks of his army in an open litter as they stood drawn up in array encouraging them to fight valiantly in defence of their religion and country finding afterwards the battel to go against him tho he was very near his last agonies he threw himself out of his litter rallied his army and led them on to the charge which afterwards ended in a compleat victory on the side of the moors he had no sooner brought his men to the engagement but finding himself utterly spent he was again replaced in his litter where laying his finger on his mouth to enjoin secrecy to his officers who stood about him he died a few moments

last night at the club and produced a letter from ipswich which his correspondent desired him to communicate to his friend the spectator it contained an account of an engagement between a french privateer commanded by one dominick pottiere and a little vessel of that place laden with corn the master whereof as i remember was one goodwin the englishman  defended himself with incredible bravery and beat off the french after having been boarded three or four times the enemy still came on with greater fury and hoped by his number of men to carry the prize till at last the englishman finding himself sink apace and ready to perish struck but the effect which this singular gallantry had upon the captain of the privateer was no other than an unmanly desire of vengeance for the loss he had sustained in his several attacks he told the ipswich man in a speakingtrumpet that he would not take him aboard and that he stayed to see him sink the englishman at the same time observed a disorder in the vessel which he rightly judged to proceed from the disdain which the ships crew had of their captains inhumanity with this hope he went into his boat and approached the enemy he was taken in by the sailors in spite of their commander but though they received him against his command they treated him when he was in the ship in the manner he directed pottiere caused his men to hold goodwin while he beat him with a stick till he fainted with loss of blood and rage of heart after which he ordered him into irons without allowing him any food but such as one or two of the men stole to him under peril of the like usage after having kept him several days overwhelmed with the misery of stench hunger and soreness he brought him into calais the governour of the place was soon acquainted with all that had passed dismissed pottiere from his charge with ignominy and gave goodwin all the relief which a man of honour would bestow upon an enemy barbarously treated to recover the imputation of cruelty upon his prince and country  when mr sentrey had read his letter full of many other circumstances which aggravate the barbarity he fell into a sort of criticism upon magnanimity and courage and argued that they were inseparable and that courage without regard to justice and humanity was no other than the fierceness of a wild beast a good and truly bold spirit continued he is ever actuated by reason and a sense of honour and duty the affectation of such a spirit exerts it self in an impudent aspect an overbearing confidence and a certain negligence of giving offence this is visible in all the cocking youths you see about this town who are noisy in assemblies unawed by the presence of wise and virtuous men in a word insensible of all the honours and decencies of human life a shameless fellow takes advantage of merit clothed with modesty and magnanimity and in the eyes of little people appears sprightly and agreeable while the man of resolution and true gallantry is overlooked and disregarded if not despised there is a propriety in all things and i believe what you scholars call just and sublime in opposition to turgid and bombast expression may give you an idea of what i mean when i say modesty is the certain indication of a great spirit and impudence the affectation of it he that writes with judgment and never rises into improper warmths manifests the true force of genius in like manner he who is quiet and equal in all his behaviour is supported in that deportment by what we may call true courage alas it is not so easy a thing to be a brave man as the unthinking part of mankind imagine to dare is not all that there is in it the privateer we were just now talking of had boldness enough to attack his enemy but not greatness of mind enough to admire the same quality exerted by that enemy in defending himself thus his base and little mind was wholly taken up in the sordid regard to the prize of which he failed and the damage done to his own vessel and therefore he used an honest man who defended his own from him in the manner as he would a thief that should rob him  he was equally disappointed and had not spirit enough to consider that one case would be laudable and the other criminal malice rancour hatred vengeance are what tear the breasts of mean men in fight but fame glory conquests desires of opportunities to pardon and oblige their opposers are what glow in the minds of the gallant the captain ended his discourse with a specimen of his booklearning and gave us to understand that he had read a french author on the subject of justness in point of gallantry i love said mr sentrey a critick who mixes the rules of life with annotations upon writers my author added he in his discourse upon epick poem takes occasion to speak of the same quality of courage drawn in the two different characters of turnus and æneas he makes courage the chief and greatest ornament of turnus but in æneas there are many others which outshine it amongst the rest that of piety turnus is therefore all along painted by the poet full of ostentation his language haughty and vain glorious as placing his honour in the manifestation of his valour æneas speaks little is slow to action and shows only a sort of defensive courage if equipage and address make turnus appear more couragious than æneas conduct and success prove æneas more valiant than turnus  t                                        no                  saturday april                         addison      in te omnis domus inclinata recumbit    virg    if we look into the three great heroick poems which have appeared in the world we may observe that they are built upon very slight foundations homer lived near  00 years after the trojan war and as the writing of history was not then in use among the greeks we may very well suppose that the tradition of achilles and ulysses had brought down but very few particulars to his knowledge though there is no question but he has wrought into his two poems such of their remarkable adventures as were still talked of among his contemporaries  the story of æneas on which virgil founded his poem was likewise very bare of circumstances and by that means afforded him an opportunity of embellishing it with fiction and giving a full range to his own invention we find however that he has interwoven in the course of his fable the principal particulars which were generally believed among the romans of æneas his voyage and settlement in italy the reader may find an abridgment of the whole story as collected out of the ancient historians and as it was received among the romans in dionysius halicarnasseus    since none of the criticks have considerd virgils fable with relation to this history of æneas it may not perhaps be amiss to examine it in this light so far as regards my present purpose whoever looks into the abridgment above mentioned will find that the character of æneas is filled with piety to the gods and a superstitious observation of prodigies oracles and predictions virgil has not only preserved this character in the person of æneas but has given a place in his poem to those particular prophecies which he found recorded of him in history and tradition the poet took the matters of fact as they came down to him and circumstanced them after his own manner to make them appear the more natural agreeable or surprizing i believe very many readers have been shocked at that ludicrous prophecy which one of the harpyes pronounces to the trojans in the third book namely that before they had built their intended city they should be reduced by hunger to eat their very tables but when they hear that this was one of the circumstances that had been transmitted to the romans in the history of æneas they will think the poet did very well in taking notice of it the historian above mentioned acquaints us a prophetess had foretold æneas that he should take his voyage westward till his companions should eat their tables and that accordingly upon his landing in italy as they were eating their flesh upon cakes of bread for want of other conveniences they afterwards fed on the cakes themselves upon which one of the company said merrily we are eating our tables they immediately took the hint says the historian and concluded the prophecy to be fulfilled as virgil did not think it proper to omit so material a particular in the history of æneas it may be worth while to consider with how much judgment he has qualified it and taken off every thing that might have appeared improper for a passage in an heroick poem the prophetess who foretells it is an hungry harpy as the person who discovers it is young ascanius      heus etiam mensas consumimus inquit inlus  such an observation which is beautiful in the mouth of a boy would have been ridiculous from any other of the company i am apt to think that the changing of the trojan fleet into waternymphs which is the most violent machine in the whole æneid and has given offence to several criticks may be accounted for the same way virgil himself before he begins that relation premises that what he was going to tell appeared incredible but that it was justified by tradition what further confirms me that this change of the fleet was a celebrated circumstance in the history of æneas is that ovid has given place to the same metamorphosis in his account of the heathen mythology  none of the criticks i have met with having considered the fable of the æneid in this light and taken notice how the tradition on which it was founded authorizes those parts in it which appear the most exceptionable i hope the length of this reflection will not make it unacceptable to the curious part of my readers  the history which was the basis of miltons poem is still shorter than either that of the iliad or æneid the poet has likewise taken care to insert every circumstance of it in the body of his fable the ninth book which we are here to consider is raised upon that brief account in scripture wherein we are told that the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field that he tempted the woman to eat of the forbidden fruit that she was overcome by this temptation and that adam followed her example from these few particulars milton has formed one of the most entertaining fables that invention ever produced he has disposed of these several circumstances among so many beautiful and natural fictions of his own that his whole story looks only like a comment upon sacred writ or rather seems to be a full and compleat relation of what the other is only an epitome i have insisted the longer on this consideration as i look upon the disposition and contrivance of the fable to be the principal beauty of the ninth book which has more story in it and is fuller of incidents than any other in the whole poem satans traversing the globe and still keeping within the shadow of the night as fearing to be discovered by the angel of the sun who had before detected him is one of those beautiful imaginations with which he introduces this his second series of adventures having examined the nature of every creature and found out one which was the most proper for his purpose he again returns to paradise and to avoid discovery sinks by night with a river that ran under the garden and rises up again through a fountain that issued   from it by the tree of life the poet who as we have before taken notice speaks as little as possible in his own person and after the example of homer fills every part of his work with manners and characters introduces a soliloquy of this infernal agent who was thus restless in the destruction of man he is then describd as gliding through the garden under the resemblance of a mist in order to find out that creature in which he designd to tempt our first parents this description has something in it very poetical and surprizing    so saying through each thicket dank or dry   like a black mist low creeping he held on   his midnight search where soonest he might find   the serpent him fast sleeping soon he found   in labyrinth of many a round selfrolld   his head the midst well stord with subtle wiles  the author afterwards gives us a description of the morning which is wonderfully suitable to a divine poem and peculiar to that first season of nature he represents the earth before it was curst as a great altar breathing out its incense from all parts and sending up a pleasant savour to the nostrils of its creator to which he adds a noble idea of adam and eve as offering their morning worship and filling up the universal consort of praise and adoration    now when as sacred light began to dawn   in eden on the humid flowers that breathed   their morning incense when all things that breathe   from th earths great altar send up silent praise   to the creator and his nostrils fill   with grateful smell forth came the human pair   and joind their vocal worship to the choir   of creatures wanting voice  the dispute which follows between our two first parents is represented with great art it proceeds   from a difference of judgment not of passion and is managed with reason not with heat it is such a dispute as we may suppose might have happened in paradise had man continued happy and innocent there is a great delicacy in the moralities which are interspersed in adams discourse and which the most ordinary reader cannot but take notice of that force of love which the father of mankind so finely describes in the eighth book and which is inserted in my last saturdays paper shews it self here in many fine instances as in those fond regards he cast towards eve at her parting from him    her long with ardent look his eye pursued   delighted but desiring more her stay   oft he to her his charge of quick return   repeated she to him as oft engaged   to be returnd by noon amid the bower  in his impatience and amusement during her absence   adam the while   waiting desirous her return had wove   of choicest flowers a garland to adorn   her tresses and her rural labours crown   as reapers oft are wont their harvest queen   great joy he promised to his thoughts and new   solace in her return so long delayd  but particularly in that passionate speech where seeing her irrecoverably lost he resolves to perish with her rather than to live without her   some cursed fraud   or enemy hath beguild thee yet unknown   and me with thee hath ruind for with thee   certain my resolution is to die   how can i live without thee how forego   thy sweet converse and love so dearly joind   to live again in these wild woods forlorn   should god create another eve and i   another rib afford yet loss of thee   would never from my heart no no i feel   the link of nature draw me flesh of flesh   bone of my bone thou art and from thy state   mine never shall be parted bliss or woe  the beginning of this speech and the preparation to it are animated with the same spirit as the conclusion which i have here quoted  the several wiles which are put in practice by the tempter when he found eve separated from her husband the many pleasing images of nature which are intermixd in this part of the story with its gradual and regular progress to the fatal catastrophe are so very remarkable that it would be superfluous to point out their respective beauties  i have avoided mentioning any particular similitudes in my remarks on this great work because i have given a general account of them in my paper on the first book there is one however in this part of the poem which i shall here quote as it is not only very beautiful but the closest of any in the whole poem i mean that where the serpent is describ as rolling forward in all his pride animated by the evil spirit and conducting eve to her destruction while adam was at too great a distance from her to give her his assistance these several particulars are all of them wrought into the following similitude   hope elevates and joy   brightens his crest as when a wandering fire   compact of unctuous vapour which the night   condenses and the cold invirons round   kindled through agitation to a flame   which oft they say some evil spirit attends   hovering and blazing with delusive light   misleads th amazd nightwanderer from his way   to bogs and mires and oft through pond or pool   there swallowed up and lost from succour far  that secret intoxication of pleasure with all those transient flushings of guilt and joy which the poet represents in our first parents upon their eating the forbidden fruit to those   flaggings of spirits damps of sorrow and mutual accusations which succeed it are conceivd with a wonderful imagination and described in very natural sentiments  when dido in the fourth æneid yielded to that fatal temptation which ruined her virgil tells us the earth trembled the heavens were filled with flashes of lightning and the nymphs howled upon the mountaintops milton in the same poetical spirit has described all nature as disturbed upon eves eating the forbidden fruit    so saying her rash hand in evil hour   forth reaching to the fruit she pluckt she eat   earth felt the wound and nature from her seat   sighing through all her works gave signs of woe   that all was lost  upon adams falling into the same guilt the whole creation appears a second time in convulsions   he scrupled not to eat   against his better knowledge not deceivs   but fondly overcome with female charm   earth trembled from her entrails as again   in pangs and nature gave a second groan   sky lowred and muttering thunder some sad drops   wept at compleating of the mortal sin  as all nature sufferd by the guilt of our first parents these symptoms of trouble and consternation are wonderfully imagined not only as prodigies but as marks of her sympathizing in the fall of man  adams converse with eve after having eaten the forbidden fruit is an exact copy of that between jupiter and juno in the fourteenth iliad juno there approaches jupiter with the girdle which she had received from venus upon which he tells her that she appeared more charming and desirable than she   done before even when their loves were at the highest the poet afterwards describes them as reposing on a summet of mount ida which produced under them a bed of flowers the lotos the crocus and the hyacinth and concludes his description with their falling asleep  let the reader compare this with the following passage in milton which begins with adams speech to eve    for never did thy beauty since the day   i saw thee first and wedded thee adornd   with all perfections so enflame my sense   with ardor to enjoy thee fairer now   than ever bounty of this virtuous tree   so said he and forbore not glance or toy   of amorous intent well understood   of eve whose eye darted contagious fire   her hand he seizd and to a shady bank   thick overhead with verdant roof embowerd   he led her nothing loth flowrs were the couch   pansies and violets and asphodel   and hyacinth earths freshest softest lap   there they their fill of love and loves disport   took largely of their mutual guilt the seal   the solace of their sin till dewy sleep   oppressd them  as no poet seems ever to have studied homer more or to have more resembled him in the greatness of genius than milton i think i should have given but a very imperfect account of his beauties if i had not observed the most remarkable passages which look like parallels in these two great authors i might in the course of these criticisms have taken notice of many particular lines and expressions which are translated from the greek poet but as i thought this would have appeared too minute and overcurious i have purposely omitted them the greater incidents however are not only set off by being shewn in the same light with several of the same nature in homer but by that means may be also guarded against the cavils of the tasteless or ignorant    footnote   in the first book of his roman antiquities    footnote   dionysius says that the prophecy was either as some write

a loss for matter to start discourse as well as unable to fall in with the talk he generally meets with will takes notice that there is now an evil under the sun which he supposes to be entirely new because not mentioned by any satyrist or moralist in any age men said he grow knaves sooner than they ever did since the creation of the world before if you read the tragedies of the last age you find the artful men and persons of intrigue are advanced very far in years and beyond the pleasures and sallies of youth but now will observes that the young have taken in the vices of the aged and you shall have a man of five and twenty crafty false and intriguing not ashamed to overreach cozen and beguile my friend adds that till about the latter end of king charless reign there was not a rascal of any eminence under forty in the places of resort for conversation you now hear nothing but what relates to the improving mens fortunes without regard to the methods toward it this is so fashionable that young men form themselves upon a certain neglect of every thing that is candid simple and worthy of true esteem and affect being yet worse than they are by acknowledging in their general turn of mind and discourse that they have not any remaining value for true honour and honesty preferring the capacity of being artful to gain their ends to the merit of despising those ends when they come in competition with their honesty all this is due to the very silly pride that generally prevails of being valued for the ability of carrying their point in a word from the opinion that shallow and inexperienced people entertain of the shortlivd force of cunning but i shall before i enter upon the various faces which folly coverd with artifice puts on to impose upon the unthinking produce a great authority   for asserting that nothing but truth and ingenuity has any lasting good effect even upon a mans fortune and interest  truth and reality have all the advantages of appearance and many more if the shew of any thing be good for any thing i am sure sincerity is better for why does any man dissemble or seem to be that which he is not but because he thinks it good to have such a quality as he pretends to for to counterfeit and dissemble is to put on the appearance of some real excellency now the best way in the world for a man to seem to be any thing is really to be what he would seem to be besides that it is many times as troublesome to make good the pretence of a good quality as to have it and if a man have it not it is ten to one but he is discoverd to want it and then all his pains and labour to seem to have it is lost there is something unnatural in painting which a skillful eye will easily discern from native beauty and complexion  it is hard to personate and act a part long for where truth is not at the bottom nature will always be endeavouring to return and will peep out and betray her self one time or other therefore if any man think it convenient to seem good let him be so indeed and then his goodness will appear to every bodys satisfaction so that upon all accounts sincerity is true wisdom particularly as to the affairs of this world integrity hath many advantages over all the fine and artificial ways of dissimulation and deceit it is much the plainer and easier much the safer and more secure way of dealing in the world it has less of trouble and difficulty of entanglement and perplexity of danger and hazard in it it is the shortest and nearest way to our end carrying us thither in a straight line and will hold out and last longest the arts of deceit and cunning do continually grow weaker and less effectual and serviceable to them that use them whereas integrity gains strength by use and the more and longer any man practiseth it the greater service it does him by confirming his reputation and encouraging those with whom he hath to do to repose the greatest trust and confidence in him which is an unspeakable advantage in the business and affairs of life  truth is always consistent with it self and needs nothing to help it out it is always near at hand and sits upon our lips and is ready to drop out before we are aware whereas a lye is troublesome and sets a mans invention upon the rack and one trick needs a great many more to make it good it is like building upon a false foundation which continually stands in need of props to shoar it up and proves at last more chargeable than to have raised a substantial building at first upon a true and solid foundation for sincerity is firm and substantial and there is nothing hollow and unsound in it and because it is plain and open fears no discovery of which the crafty man is always in danger and when he thinks he walks in the dark all his pretences are so transparent that he that runs may read them he is the last man that finds himself to be found out and whilst he takes it for granted that he makes fools of others he renders himself ridiculous  add to all this that sincerity is the most compendious wisdom and an excellent instrument for the speedy dispatch of business it creates confidence in those we have to deal with saves the labour of many enquiries and brings things to an issue in few words it is like travelling in a plain beaten road which commonly brings a man sooner to his journeys end than byways in which men often lose themselves in a word whatsoever convenience may be thought to be in falshood and dissimulation it is soon over but the inconvenience of it is perpetual because it brings a man under an everlasting jealousie and suspicion so that he is not believed when he speaks truth nor trusted when perhaps he means honestly when a man hath once forfeited the reputation of his integrity he is set fast and nothing will then serve his turn neither truth nor falshood  and i have often thought that god hath in his great wisdom hid from men of false and dishonest minds the wonderful advantages of truth and integrity to the prosperity even of our worldly affairs these men are so blinded by their covetousness and ambition that they cannot look beyond a present advantage nor forbear to seize upon it tho by ways never so indirect they cannot see so far as to the remote consequences of a steady integrity and the vast benefit and advantages which it will bring a man at last were but this sort of men wise and clearsighted enough to discern this they would be honest out of very knavery not out of any love to honesty and virtue but with a crafty design to promote and advance more effectually their own interests and therefore the justice of the divine providence hath hid this truest point of wisdom from their eyes that bad men might not be upon equal terms with the just and upright and serve their own wicked designs by honest and lawful means  indeed if a man were only to deal in the world for a day and should never have occasion to converse more with mankind never more need their good opinion or good word it were then no great matter speaking as to the concernments of this world if a man spent his reputation all at once and ventured it at one throw but if he be to continue in the world and would have the advantage of conversation whilst he is in it let him make use of truth and sincerity in all his words and actions for nothing but this will last and hold out to the end all other arts will fail but truth and integrity will carry a man through and bear him out to the last  t    footnote   archbishop tilotsons sermons vol ii sermon i folio edition italics in first issue

his thoughts upon education has just sent me the following letter     sir    i take the liberty to send you a fourth letter upon the education of   youth in my last i gave you my thoughts about some particular tasks   which i conceivd it might not be amiss to use with their usual   exercises in order to give them an early seasoning of virtue i shall   in this propose some others which i fancy might contribute to give   them a right turn for the world and enable them to make their way in   it    the design of learning is as i take it either to render a man an   agreeable companion to himself and teach him to support solitude with   pleasure or if he is not born to an estate to supply that defect   and furnish him with the means of acquiring one a person who applies   himself to learning with the first of these views may be said to study   for ornament as he who proposes to himself the second properly   studies for use the one does it to raise himself a fortune the other   to set off that which he is already possessed of but as far the   greater part of mankind are included in the latter class i shall only   propose some methods at present for the service of such who expect to   advance themselves in the world by their learning in order to which   i shall premise that many more estates have been acquird by little   accomplishments than by extraordinary ones those qualities which make   the greatest figure in the eye of the world not being always the most   useful in themselves or the most advantageous to their owners    the posts which require men of shining and uncommon parts to discharge   them are so very few that many a great genius goes out of the world   without ever having had an opportunity to exert it self whereas   persons of ordinary endowments meet with occasions fitted to their   parts and capacities every day in the common occurrences of life    i am acquainted with two persons who were formerly schoolfellows    and have been good friends ever since one of them was not only   thought an impenetrable blockhead at school but still maintaind his   reputation at the university the other was the pride of his master   and the most celebrated person in the college of which he was a   member the man of genius is at present buried in a country parsonage   of eightscore pounds a year while the other with the bare abilities   of a common scrivener has got an estate of above an hundred thousand   pounds    i fancy from what i have said it will almost appear a doubtful case   to many a wealthy citizen whether or no he ought to wish his son   should be a great genius but this i am sure of that nothing is more   absurd than to give a lad the education of one whom nature has not   favourd with any particular marks of distinction    the fault therefore of our grammarschools is that every boy is   pushed on to works of genius whereas it would be far more   advantageous for the greatest part of them to be taught such little   practical arts and sciences as do not require any great share of parts   to be master of them and yet may come often into play during the   course of a mans life    such are all the parts of practical geometry i have known a man   contract a friendship with a minister of state upon cutting a dial in   his window and remember a clergyman who got one of the best benefices   in the west of england by setting a country gentlemans affairs in   some method and giving him an exact survey of his estate    while i am upon this subject i cannot forbear mentioning a   particular which is of use in every station of life and which   methinks every master should teach his scholars i mean the writing of   english letters to this end instead of perplexing them with latin   epistles themes and verses there might be a punctual correspondence   established between two boys who might act in any imaginary parts of   business or be allowd sometimes to give a range to their own fancies   and communicate to each other whatever trifles they thought fit   provided neither of them ever faild at the appointed time to answer   his correspondents letter    i believe i may venture to affirm that the generality of boys would   find themselves more advantaged by this custom when they come to be   men than by all the greek and latin their masters can teach them in   seven or eight years    the want of it is very visible in many learned persons who while   they are admiring the styles of demosthenes or cicero want phrases to   express themselves on the most common occasions i have seen a letter   from one of these latin orators which would have been deservedly   laughd at by a common attorney    under this head of writing i cannot omit accounts and shorthand   which are learned with little pains and very properly come into the   number of such arts as i have been here recommending    you must doubtless sir observe that i have hitherto chiefly insisted   upon these things for such boys as do not appear to have any thing   extraordinary in their natural talents and consequently are not   qualified for the finer parts of learning yet i believe i might carry   this matter still further and venture to assert that a lad of genius   has sometimes occasion for these little acquirements to be as it were   the forerunners of his parts and to introduce him   into the   world    history is full of examples of persons who tho they have had the   largest abilities have been obliged to insinuate themselves into the   favour of great men by these trivial accomplishments as the compleat   gentleman in some of our modern comedies makes his first advances to   his mistress under the disguise of a painter or a dancingmaster    the difference is that in a lad of genius these are only so many   accomplishments which in another are essentials the one diverts   himself with them the other works at them in short i look upon a   great genius with these little additions in the same light as i   regard the grand signior who is obliged by an express command in the   alcoran to learn and practise some handycraft trade tho i need not   have gone for my instance farther than germany where several emperors   have voluntarily done the same thing leopold the last   worked in   wood and i have heard there are several handycraft works of his   making to be seen at vienna so neatly turned that the best joiner in   europe might safely own them without any disgrace to his profession    i would not be thought by any thing i have said to be against   improving a boys genius to the utmost pitch it can be carried what i   would endeavour to shew in this essay is that there may be methods   taken to make learning advantageous even to the meanest capacities    i am sir yours c   x    footnote

your discourses describd most sorts of women in   their distinct and proper classes as the ape the coquet and many   others but i think you have never yet said anything of a devotée a   devotée is one of those who disparage religion by their indiscreet and   unseasonable introduction of the mention of virtue on all occasions   she professes she is what nobody ought to doubt she is and betrays   the labour she is put to to be what she ought to be with chearfulness   and alacrity she lives in the world and denies her self none of the   diversions of it with a constant declaration how insipid all things   in it are to her she is never her self but at church there she   displays her virtue and is so fervent in her devotions that i have   frequently seen her pray her self out of breath while other young   ladies in the house are dancing or playing at questions and commands   she reads aloud in her closet she says all love is ridiculous except   it be celestial but she speaks of the passion of one mortal to   another with too much bitterness for one that had no jealousy mixed   with her contempt of it if at any time she sees a man warm in his   addresses to his mistress she will lift up her eyes to heaven and   cry what nonsense is that fool talking will the bell never ring for   prayers we have an eminent lady of this stamp in our country who   pretends to amusements very much above the rest of her sex she never   carries a white shockdog with bells under her arm nor a squirrel or   dormouse in her pocket but always an abridgd piece of morality to   steal out when she is sure of being observd when she went to the   famous assrace which i must confess was but an odd diversion to be   encouraged by people of rank and figure it was not like other   ladies to hear those poor animals bray nor to see fellows run naked   or to hear country squires in bob wigs and white girdles make love at   the side of a coach and cry madam this is dainty weather thus she   described the diversion for she went only to pray heartily that no   body might be hurt in the crowd and to see if the poor fellows face   which was distorted with grinning might any way be brought to it self   again she never chats over her tea but covers her face and is   supposed in an ejaculation before she tastes a sup this   ostentatious behaviour is such an offence to true sanctity that it   disparages it and makes virtue not only unamiable but also   ridiculous the sacred writings are full of reflections which abhor   this kind of conduct and a devotée is so far from promoting goodness   that she deters others by her example folly and vanity in one of   these ladies is like vice in a clergyman it does not only debase   him but makes the inconsiderate part of the world think the worse of   religion    i am sir    your humble servant    hotspur      mr spectator    xenophon in his short account of the spartan commonwealth     speaking of the behavior of their young men in the

a bride when put to bed   upon her weddingnight this virtue which is always joind to   magnanimity had such an influence upon their courage that in battel   an enemy could not look them in the face

motions of humanity rising in me towards the persons whom i had severely treated that i threw it into the fire without ever finishing it i have been angry enough to make several little epigrams and lampoons and after having admired them a day or two have likewise committed them to the flames these i look upon as so many sacrifices to humanity and have receivd much greater satisfaction from the suppressing such performances than i could have done from any reputation they might have procurd me or from any mortification they might have given my enemies in case i had made them publick if a man has any talent in writing it shews a good mind to forbear answering calumnies and reproaches in the same spirit of bitterness with which they are offered but when a man has been at some pains in making suitable returns to an enemy and has the instruments of revenge in his hands to let drop his wrath and stifle his resentments seems to have something in it great and heroical there is a particular merit in such a way of forgiving an enemy and the more violent and unprovoked the offence has been the greater still is the merit of him who thus forgives it  i never met with a consideration that is more finely spun and what has better pleased me than one in epictetus   which places an enemy in a new light and gives us a view of him altogether different from that in which we are used to regard him the sense of it is as follows does a man reproach thee for being proud or illnatured envious or conceited ignorant or detracting consider with thy self whether his reproaches are true if they are not consider that thou art not the person whom he reproaches but that he reviles an imaginary being and perhaps loves what thou really art tho he hates what thou appearest to be if his reproaches are true if thou art the envious illnaturd man he takes thee for give thy self another turn become mild affable and obliging and his reproaches of thee naturally cease his reproaches may indeed continue but thou art no longer the person whom he reproaches  i often apply this rule to my self and when i hear of a satyrical speech or writing that is aimed at me i examine my own heart whether i deserve it or not if i bring in a verdict against my self i endeavour to rectify my conduct for the future in those particulars which have drawn the censure upon me but if the whole invective be grounded upon a falsehood i trouble my self no further about it and look upon my name at the head of it to signify no more than one of those fictitious names made use of by an author to introduce an imaginary character why should a man be sensible of the sting of a reproach who is a stranger to the guilt that is implied in it or subject himself to the penalty when he knows he has never committed the crime this is a piece of fortitude which every one owes to his own innocence and without which it is impossible for a man of any merit or figure to live at peace with himself in a country that abounds with wit and liberty  the famous monsieur balzac in a letter to the chancellor of france   who had prevented the publication of a book against him has the following words which are a likely picture of the greatness of mind so visible in the works of that author if it was a new thing it may be i should not be displeased with the suppression of the first libel that should abuse me but since there are enough of em to make a small library i am secretly pleased to see the number increased and take delight in raising a heap of stones that envy has cast at me without doing me any harm  the author here alludes to those monuments of the eastern nations which were mountains of stones raised upon the dead body by travellers that used to cast every one his stone upon it as they passed by it is certain that no monument is so glorious as one which is thus raised by the hands of envy for my part i admire an author for such a temper of mind as enables him to bear an undeserved reproach without resentment more than for all the wit of any the finest satirical reply  thus far i thought necessary to explain my self in relation to those who have animadverted on this paper and to shew the reasons why i have not thought fit to return them any formal answer i must further add that the work would have been of very little use to the publick had it been filled with personal reflections and debates for which reason i have never once turned out of my way to observe those little cavils which have been made against it by envy or ignorance the common fry of scriblers who have no other way of being taken notice of but by attacking what has gaind some reputation in the world would have furnished me with business enough had they found me disposd to enter the lists with them  i shall conclude with the fable of boccalinis traveller who was so pesterd with the noise of grasshoppers in his ears that he alighted from his horse in great wrath to kill them all this says the author was troubling himself to no manner of purpose had he pursued his journey without taking notice of them the troublesome insects would have died of themselves in a very few weeks and he would have suffered nothing from them  l    footnote      quenquam nulla venenata littera mista joco est  ovid   footnote   enchiridion cap    and      footnote   letters and remains trans by sir r

owing to pride and a secret affectation of a certain selfexistence that the noblest motive for action that ever was proposed to man is not acknowledged the glory and happiness of their being the heart is treacherous to it self and we do not let our reflections go deep enough to receive religion as the most honourable incentive to good and worthy actions it is our natural weakness to flatter our selves into a belief that if we search into our inmost thoughts we find our selves wholly disinterested and divested of any views arising from selflove and vainglory but however spirits of superficial greatness may disdain at first sight to do any thing but from a noble impulse in themselves without any future regards in this or another being upon stricter enquiry they will find to act worthily and expect to be rewarded only in another world is as heroick a pitch of virtue as human nature can arrive at if the tenour of our actions have any other motive than the desire to be pleasing in the eye of the deity it will necessarily follow that we must be more than men if we are not too much exalted in prosperity and depressed in adversity but the christian world has a leader the contemplation of whose life and sufferings must administer comfort in affliction while the sense of his power and omnipotence must give them humiliation in prosperity  it is owing to the forbidding and unlovely constraint with which men of low conceptions act when they think they conform themselves to religion as well as to the more odious conduct of hypocrites that the word christian does not carry with it at first view all that is great worthy friendly generous and heroick the man who suspends his hopes of the reward of worthy actions till after death who can bestow unseen who can overlook hatred do good to his slanderer who can never be angry at his friend never revengeful to his enemy is certainly formed for the benefit of society yet these are so far from heroick virtues that they are but the ordinary duties of a christian  when a man with a steddy faith looks back on the great catastrophe of this day with what bleeding emotions of heart must he contemplate the life and sufferings of his deliverer when his agonies occur to him how will he weep to reflect that he has often forgot them for the glance of a wanton for the applause of a vain world for an heap of fleeting past pleasures which are at present asking sorrows  how pleasing is the contemplation of the lowly steps our almighty leader took in conducting us to his heavenly mansions in plain and apt parable   similitude and allegory our great master enforced the doctrine of our salvation but they of his acquaintance instead of receiving what they could not oppose were offended at the presumption of being wiser than they   they could not raise their little ideas above the consideration of him in those circumstances familiar to them or conceive that he who appeard not more terrible or pompous should have any thing more exalted than themselves he in that place therefore would not longer ineffectually exert a power which was incapable of conquering the prepossession of their narrow and mean conceptions  multitudes followd him and brought him the dumb the blind the sick and maimd whom when their creator had touchd with a second life they saw spoke leapd and ran in affection to him and admiration of his actions the crowd could not leave him but waited near him till they were almost as faint and helpless as others they brought for succour he had compassion on them and by a miracle supplied their necessities   oh the ecstatic entertainment when they could behold their food immediately increase to the distributers hand and see their god in person feeding and refreshing his creatures oh envied happiness but why do i say envied as if our god   did not still preside over our temperate meals chearful hours and innocent conversations  but tho the sacred story is every where full of miracles not inferior to this and tho in the midst of those acts of divinity he never gave the least hint of a design to become a secular prince yet had not hitherto the apostles themselves any other than hopes of worldly power preferment riches and pomp for peter upon an accident of ambition among the apostles hearing his master explain that his kingdom was not of this world was so scandalizd   that he whom he had so long followd should suffer the ignominy shame and death which he foretold that he took him aside and said be it far from thee lord this shall not be unto thee for which he suffered a severe reprehension from his master as having in his view the glory of man rather than that of god  the great change of things began to draw near when the lord of nature thought fit as a saviour and deliverer to make his publick entry into jerusalem with more than the power and joy but none of the ostentation and pomp of a triumph he came humble meek and lowly with an unfelt new ecstasy multitudes strewed his way with garments and olivebranches crying with loud gladness and acclamation hosannah to the son of david blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord at this great kings accession to his throne men were not ennobled but savd crimes were not remitted but sins forgiven he did not bestow medals honours favours but health joy sight speech the first object the blind ever saw was the author of sight while the lame ran before and the dumb repeated the hosannah thus attended he entered into his own house the sacred temple and by his divine authority expelld traders and worldlings that profaned it and thus did he for a time use a great and despotic power to let unbelievers understand that twas not want of but superiority to all worldly dominion that made him not exert it but is this then the saviour is this the deliverer shall this obscure nazarene command israel and sit on the throne of david   their proud and disdainful hearts which were petrified   with the love and pride of this world were impregnable to the reception of so mean a benefactor and were now enough exasperated with benefits to conspire his death our lord was sensible of their design and prepared his disciples for it by recounting to em now more distinctly what should befal him but peter with an ungrounded resolution and in a flush of temper made a sanguine protestation that tho all men were offended in him yet would not he be offended it was a great article of our saviours business in the world to bring us to a sense of our inability without gods assistance to do any thing great or good he therefore told peter who thought so well of his courage and fidelity that they would both fail him and even he should deny him thrice that very night  but what heart can conceive what tongue utter the sequel who is that yonder buffeted mockd and spurnd whom do they drag like a felon whither do they carry my lord my king my saviour and my god and will he die to expiate those very

in the whole poem the author upon the winding up of his action introduces all those who had any concern in it and shews with great beauty the influence which it had upon each of them it is like the last act of a wellwritten tragedy in which all who had a part in it are generally drawn up before the audience and represented under those circumstances in which the determination of the action places them  i shall therefore consider this book under four heads in relation to the celestial the infernal the human and the imaginary persons who have their respective parts allotted in it  to begin with the celestial persons the guardian angels of paradise are described as returning to heaven upon the fall of man in order to approve their vigilance their arrival their manner of reception with the sorrow which appeard in themselves and in those spirits who are said to rejoice at the conversion of a sinner are very finely laid together in the following lines    up into heaven from paradise in haste   th angelick guards ascended mute and sad   for man for of his state by this they knew   much wondering how the subtle fiend had stoln   entrance unseen soon as th unwelcome news   from earth arrivd at heavengate displeased   all were who heard dim sadness did not spare   that time celestial visages yet mixt   with pity violated not their bliss   about the newarrivd in multitudes   th ethereal people ran to hear and know   how all befel they towrds the throne supreme   accountable made haste to make appear   with righteous plea their utmost vigilance   and easily approved when the most high   eternal father from his secret cloud   amidst in thunder utterd thus his voice  the same divine person who in the foregoing parts of this poem interceded for our first parents before their fall overthrew the rebel angels and created the world is now represented as descending to paradise and pronouncing sentence upon the three offenders the cool of the evening being a circumstance with which holy writ introduces this great scene it is poetically described by our author who has also kept religiously to the form of words in which the three several sentences were passed upon adam eve and the serpent he has rather chosen to neglect the numerousness of his verse than to deviate from those speeches which are recorded on this great occasion the guilt and confusion of our first parents standing naked before their judge is touched with great beauty upon the arrival of sin and death into the works of the creation the almighty is again introduced as speaking to his angels that surrounded him    see with what heat these dogs of hell advance   to waste and havock yonder world which i   so fair and good created c  the following passage is formed upon that glorious image in holy writ which compares the voice of an innumerable host of angels uttering hallelujahs to the voice of mighty thunderings or of many waters    he ended and the heavenly audience loud   sung hallelujah as the sound of seas   through multitude that sung just are thy ways   righteous are thy decrees in all thy works   who can extenuate thee  tho the author in the whole course of his poem and particularly in the book we are now examining has infinite allusions to places of scripture i have only taken notice in my remarks of such as are of a poetical nature and which are woven with great beauty into the body of this fable of this kind is that passage in the present book where describing sin and death as marching thro the works of nature he adds   behind her death   close following pace for pace not mounted yet   on his pale horse  which alludes to that passage in scripture so wonderfully poetical and terrifying to the imagination and i lookd and behold a pale horse and his name that sat on him was death and hell followed with him and power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth to kill with sword and with hunger and with sickness and with the beasts of the earth   under this first head of celestial persons we must likewise take notice of the command which the angels receivd to produce the several changes in nature and sully the beauty of the creation accordingly they are represented as infecting the stars and planets with malignant influences weakning the light of the sun bringing down the winter into the milder regions of nature planting winds and storms in several quarters of the sky storing the clouds with thunder and in short perverting the whole frame of the universe to the condition of its criminal inhabitants as this is a noble incident in the poem the following lines in which we see the angels heaving up the earth and placing it in a different posture to the sun from what it had before the fall of man is conceived with that sublime imagination which was so peculiar to this great author    some say he bid his angels turn ascanse   the poles of earth twice ten degrees and more   from the suns axle they with labour pushd   oblique the centrick globe  we are in the second place to consider the infernal agents under the view which milton has given us of them in this book it is observed by those who would set forth the greatness of virgils plan that he conducts his reader thro all the parts of the earth which were discoverd in his time asia africk and europe are the several scenes of his fable the plan of miltons poem is of an infinitely greater extent and fills the mind with many more astonishing circumstances satan having surrounded the earth seven times departs at length from paradise we then see him steering his course among the constellations and after having traversed the whole creation pursuing his voyage thro the chaos and entring into his own infernal dominions  his first appearance in the assembly of fallen angels is workd up with circumstances which give a delightful surprize to the reader but there is no incident in the whole poem which does this more than the transformation of the whole audience that follows the account their leader gives them of his expedition the gradual change of satan himself is describd after ovids manner and may vie with any of those celebrated transformations which are lookd upon as the most beautiful parts in that poets works milton never fails of improving his own hints and bestowing the last finishing touches to every incident which is admitted into his poem the unexpected hiss which rises in this episode the dimensions and bulk of satan so much superior to those of the infernal spirits who lay under the same transformation with the annual change which they are supposed to suffer are instances of this kind the beauty of the diction is very remarkable in this whole episode as i have observed in the sixth paper of these remarks the great judgment with which it was contrived  the parts of adam and eve or the human persons come next under our consideration miltons art is no where more shewn than in his conducting the parts of these our first parents the representation he gives of them without falsifying the story is wonderfully contrivd to influence the reader with pity and compassion towards them tho adam involves the whole species in misery his crime proceeds from a weakness which every man is inclined to pardon and commiserate as it seems rather the frailty of human nature than of the person who offended every one is apt to excuse a fault which he himself might have fallen into it was the excess of love for eve that ruind adam and his posterity i need not add that the author is justifyd in this particular by many of the fathers and the most orthodox writers milton has by this means filled a great part of his poem with that kind of writing which the french criticks call the tender and which is in a particular manner engaging to all sorts of readers  adam and eve in the book we are now considering are likewise drawn with such sentiments as do not only interest the reader in their afflictions but raise in him the most melting passions of humanity and commiseration when adam sees the several changes in nature produced about him he appears in a disorder of mind suitable to one who had forfeited both his innocence and his happiness he is filled with horrour remorse despair in the anguish of his heart he expostulates with his creator for having given him an unasked existence    did i request thee maker from my clay   to mould me man did i sollicite thee   from darkness to promote me or here place   in this delicious garden as my will   concurrd not to my being twere but right   and equal to reduce me to my dust   desirous to resign and render back   all i received  he immediately after recovers from his presumption owns his doom to be just and begs that the death which is threatned him may be inflicted on him   why delays   his hand to execute what his decree   fixd on this day why do i overlive   why am i mockd with death and lengthened out   to deathless pain how gladly would i meet   mortality my sentence and be earth   insensible how glad would lay me down   as in my mothers lap there should i rest   and sleep secure his dreadful voice no more   would thunder in my ears no fear of worse   to me and to my offspring would torment me   with cruel expectation  this whole speech is full of the like emotion and varied with all those sentiments which we may suppose natural to a mind so broken and disturbd i must not omit that generous concern which our first father shews in it for his posterity and which is so proper to affect the reader   hide me from the face   of god whom to behold was then my heighth   of happiness yet well if here would end   the misery i deserved it and would bear   my own deservings but this will not serve   all that i eat or drink or shall beget   is propagated curse o voice once heard   delightfully increase and multiply   now death to hear   in me all   posterity stands curst fair patrimony   that i must leave ye sons o were i able   to waste it all my self and leave you none   so disinherited how would you bless   me now your curse ah why should all mankind   for one mans fault thus guiltless be condemnd   if guiltless but from me what can proceed   but all corrupt  who can afterwards behold the father of mankind extended upon the earth uttering his midnight complaints bewailing his existence and wishing for death without sympathizing with him in his distress    thus adam to himself lamented loud   thro the still night not now as ere man fell   wholesome and cool and mild but with black air   accompanied with damps and dreadful gloom   which to his evil conscience represented   all things with double terror on the ground   outstretched he lay on the cold ground and oft   cursd his creation death as oft accusd   of tardy execution  the part of eve in this book is no less passionate and apt to sway the reader in her favour she is represented with great tenderness as approaching adam but is spurn d from him with a spirit of upbraiding and indignation conformable to the nature of man whose passions had now gained the dominion over him the following passage wherein she is described as renewing her addresses to him with the whole speech that follows it have something in them exquisitely moving and pathetick    he added not and from her turned but eve   not so repulst with tears that ceasd not flowing   and tresses all disorderd at his feet   fell humble and embracing them besought   his peace and thus proceeding in her plaint     forsake me not thus adam witness heavn   what love sincere and reverence in my heart   i bear thee and unweeting have offended   unhappily deceived thy suppliant   i beg and clasp thy knees bereave me not   whereon i live thy gentle looks thy aid   thy counsel in this uttermost distress   my only strength and stay forlorn of thee   whither shall i betake me where subsist   while yet we live scarce one short hour perhaps   between us two let there be peace c  adams reconcilement to her is workd up in the same spirit of tenderness eve afterwards proposes to her husband in the blindness of her despair that to prevent their guilt from descending upon posterity they should resolve to live childless or if that could not be done they should seek their own deaths by violent methods as those sentiments naturally engage the reader to regard the mother of mankind with more than ordinary commiseration they likewise contain a very fine moral the resolution of dying to end our miseries does not shew such a degree of magnanimity as a resolution to bear them and submit to the dispensations of providence our author has therefore with great delicacy represented eve as entertaining this thought and adam as disapproving it  we are in the last place to consider the imaginary persons or death and sin   who act a large part in this book such beautiful extended allegories are certainly some of the finest compositions of genius but as i have before observed are not agreeable to the nature of an heroick poem this of sin and death is very exquisite in its kind if not considered as a part of such a work the truths contained in it are so clear and open that i shall not lose time in explaining them but shall only observe that a reader who knows the strength of the english tongue will be amazed to think how the poet could find such apt words and phrases to describe the actions of those two imaginary persons and particularly in that part where death is exhibited as forming a bridge over the chaos a work suitable to the genius of milton  since the subject i am upon gives me an opportunity of speaking more at large of such shadowy and imaginary persons as may be introduced into heroick poems i shall beg leave to explain my self in a matter which is curious in its kind and which none of the criticks have treated of it is certain homer and virgil are full of imaginary persons who are very beautiful in poetry when they are just shewn without being engaged in any series of action homer indeed represents sleep as a person and ascribes a short part to him in his iliad   but we must consider that tho we now regard such a person as entirely shadowy and unsubstantial the heathens made statues of him placed him in their temples and looked upon him as a real deity when homer makes use of other such allegorical persons it is only in short expressions which convey an ordinary thought to the mind in the most pleasing manner and may rather be looked upon as poetical phrases than allegorical descriptions instead of telling us that men naturally fly when they are terrified he introduces the persons of flight and fear who he tells us are inseparable companions instead of saying that the time was come when apollo ought to have received his recompence he tells us that the hours brought him his reward instead of describing the effects which minervas ægis produced in battel he tells us that the brims of it were encompassed by terror rout discord fury pursuit massacre and death in the same figure of speaking he represents victory as following diomedes discord as the mother of funerals and mourning venus as dressed by the graces bellona as wearing terror and consternation like a garment i might give several other instances out of homer as well as a great many out of virgil milton has likewise very often made use of the same way of speaking as where he tells us that victory sat on the right hand of the messiah when he marched forth against the rebel angels that at the rising of the sun the hours unbarrd the gates of light that discord was the daughter of sin of the same nature are those expressions where describing the singing of the nightingale he adds silence was pleased and upon the messiahs bidding peace to the chaos confusion heard his voice i might add innumerable instances of our poets writing in this beautiful figure it is plain that these i have mentioned in which persons of an imaginary nature are introduced are such short allegories as are not designed to be taken in the literal sense but only to convey particular circumstances to the reader after an unusual and entertaining manner but when such persons are introduced as principal actors and engaged in a series of adventures they take too much upon them and are by no means proper for an heroick poem which ought to appear credible in its principal parts i cannot forbear therefore thinking that sin and death are as improper agents in a work of this nature as strength and necessity in one of the tragedies of eschylus who represented those two persons nailing down prometheus to a rock   for which he has been justly censured by the greatest criticks i do not know any imaginary person made use of in a more sublime manner of thinking than that in one of the prophets who describing god as descending from heaven and visiting the sins of mankind adds that dreadful circumstance before him went the pestilence   it is certain this imaginary person might have been described in all her purple spots the fever might have marched before her pain might have stood at her right hand phrenzy on her left and death in her rear she might have been introduced as gliding down from the tail of a comet or darted upon the earth in a flash of lightning she might have tainted the atmosphere with her breath the very glaring of her eyes might have scattered infection but i believe every reader will think that in such sublime writings the mentioning of her as it is done in scripture has something in it more just as well as great than all that the most fanciful poet could have bestowed upon her in the richness of his imagination  l    footnote      reddere personæ scit convenientia cuique  hor   footnote   revelation vi     footnote

opportunity on that occasion to expatiate upon so fine a piece of antiquity among other things i remember he gave me his opinion which he drew from the ornaments of the work that this was the floor of a room dedicated to mirth and concord viewing this work made my fancy run over the many gay expressions i had read in ancient authors which contained invitations to lay aside care and anxiety and give a loose to that pleasing forgetfulness wherein men put off their characters of business and enjoy their very selves these hours were usually passed in rooms adorned for that purpose and set out in such a manner as the objects all around the company gladdened their hearts which joined to the cheerful looks of wellchosen and agreeable friends gave new vigour to the airy produced the latent fire of the modest and gave grace to the slow humour of the reserved a judicious mixture of such company crowned with chaplets of flowers and the whole apartment glittering with gay lights cheared with a profusion of roses artificial falls of water and intervals of soft notes to songs of love and wine suspended the cares of human life and made a festival of mutual kindness such parties of pleasure as these and the reports of the agreeable passages in their jollities have in all ages awakened the dull part of mankind to pretend to mirth and goodhumour without capacity for such entertainments for if i may be allowed to say so there are an hundred men fit for any employment to one who is capable of passing a night in the company of the first taste without shocking any member of the society overrating his own part of the conversation but equally receiving and contributing to the pleasure of the whole company when one considers such collections of companions in past times and such as one might name in the present age with how much spleen must a man needs reflect upon the aukward gayety of those who affect the frolick with an ill grace i have a letter from a correspondent of mine who desires me to admonish all loud mischievous airy dull companions that they are mistaken in what they call a frolick irregularity in its self is not what creates pleasure and mirth but to see a man who knows what rule and decency are descend from them agreeably in our company is what denominates him a pleasant companion instead of that you find many whose mirth consists only in doing things which do not become them with a secret consciousness that all the world know they know better to this is always added something mischievous to themselves or others i have heard of some very merry fellows among whom the frolick was started and passed by a great majority that every man should immediately draw a tooth after which they have gone in a body and smoaked a cobler the same company at another night has each man burned his cravat and one perhaps whose estate would bear it has thrown a long wigg and laced hat into the same fire   thus they have jested themselves stark naked and ran into the streets and frighted women very successfully there is no inhabitant of any standing in coventgarden but can tell you a hundred good humours where people have come off with little bloodshed and yet scowered all the witty hours of the night i know a gentleman that has several wounds in the head by watch poles and has been thrice run through the body to carry on a good jest he is very old for a man of so much goodhumour but to this day he is seldom merry but he has occasion to be valiant at the same time but by the favour of these gentlemen i am humbly of opinion that a man may be a very witty man and never offend one statute of this kingdom not excepting even that of stabbing  the writers of plays have what they call unity of time and place to give a justness to their representation and it would not be amiss if all who pretend to be companions would confine their action to the place of meeting for a frolick carried farther may be better performed by other animals than men it is not to rid much ground or do much mischief that should denominate a pleasant fellow but that is truly frolick which is the play of the mind and consists of various and unforced sallies of imagination festivity of spirit is a very uncommon talent and must proceed from an assemblage of agreeable qualities in the same person there are some few whom i think peculiarly happy in it but it is a talent one cannot name in a man especially when one considers that it is never very graceful but where it is regarded by him who possesses it in the second place the best man that i know of for heightening the revelgayety of a company is estcourt  whose jovial humour diffuses itself from the highest person at an entertainment to the meanest waiter merry tales accompanied with apt gestures and lively representations of circumstances and persons beguile the gravest mind into a consent to be as humourous as himself add to this that when a man is in his good grace he has a mimickry that does not debase the person he represents but which taking from the gravity of the character adds to the agreeableness of it this pleasant fellow gives one some idea of the ancient pantomime who is said to have given the audience in dumbshow an exact idea of any character or passion or an intelligible relation of any publick occurrence with no other expression than that of his looks and gestures if all who have been obliged to these talents in estcourt will be at love for love tomorrow night they will but pay him what they owe him at so easy a rate as being present at a play which no body would omit

night i observd that my friend sir roger contrary to his usual custom sat very silent and instead of minding what was said by the company was whistling to himself in a very thoughtful mood and playing with a cork i joggd sir andrew freeport who sat between us and as we were both observing him we saw the knight shake his head and heard him say to himself a foolish woman i cant believe it sir andrew gave him a gentle pat upon the shoulder and offered to lay him a bottle of wine that he was thinking of the widow my old friend started and recovering out of his brown study told sir andrew that once in his life he had been in the right in short after some little hesitation sir roger told us in the fulness of his heart that he had just received a letter from his steward which acquainted him that his old rival and antagonist in the county sir david dundrum had been making a visit to the widow however says sir roger i can never think that shell have a man thats half a year older than i am and a

all knew he was turned of threescore you may easily guess continued will that i have not lived so long in the world without having had some thoughts of settling in it as the phrase is to tell you truly i have several times tried my fortune that way though i cant much boast of my success  i made my first addresses to a young lady in the country but when i thought things were pretty well drawing to a conclusion her father happening to hear that i had formerly boarded with a surgeon the old put forbid me his house and within a fortnight after married his daughter to a foxhunter in the neighbourhood  i made my next applications to a widow and attacked her so briskly that i thought myself within a fortnight of her as i waited upon her one morning she told me that she intended to keep her readymoney and jointure in her own hand and desired me to call upon her attorney in lyonsinn who would adjust with me what it was proper for me to add to it i was so rebuffed by this overture that i never enquired either for her or her attorney afterwards  a few months after i addressed my self to a young lady who was an only daughter and of a good family i danced with her at several balls squeezd her by the hand said soft things to her and in short made no doubt of her heart and though my fortune was not equal to hers i was in hopes that her fond father would not deny her the man she had fixed her affections upon but as i went one day to the house in order to break the matter to him i found the whole family in confusion and heard to my unspeakable surprize that miss jenny was that very morning run away with the butler  i then courted a second widow and am at a loss to this day how i came to miss her for she had often commended my person and behaviour her maid indeed told me one day that her mistress had said she never saw a gentleman with such a spindle pair of legs as mr honeycomb  after this i laid siege to four heiresses successively and being a handsome young dog in those days quickly made a breach in their hearts but i dont know how it came to pass tho i seldom failed of getting the daughters consent i could never in my life get the old people on my side  i could give you an account of a thousand other unsuccessful attempts particularly of one which i made some years since upon an old woman whom i had certainly borne away with flying colours if her relations had not come pouring in to her assistance from all parts of england nay i believe i should have got her at last had not she been carried off by an hard frost  as wills transitions are extremely quick he turnd from sir roger and applying himself to me told me there was a passage in the book i had considered last saturday which deserved to be writ in letters of gold and taking out a

not unsuitable since if silence of our poverty is a recommendation still more commendable is his modesty who conceals it by a decent dress     mr spectator    there is an evil under the sun which has not yet come within your   speculation and is the censure disesteem and contempt which some   young fellows meet with from particular persons for the reasonable   methods they take to avoid them in general this is by appearing in a   better dress than may seem to a relation regularly consistent with a   small fortune and therefore may occasion a judgment of a suitable   extravagance in other particulars but the disadvantage with which the   man of narrow circumstances acts and speaks is so feelingly set forth   in a little book called the christian hero   that the appearing to   be otherwise is not only pardonable but necessary every one knows the   hurry of conclusions that are made in contempt of a person that   appears to be calamitous which makes it very excusable to prepare   ones self for the company of those that are of a superior quality and   fortune by appearing to be in a better condition than one is so far   as such appearance shall not make us really of worse    it is a justice due to the character of one who suffers hard   reflections from any particular person upon this account that such   persons would enquire into his manner of spending his time of which   tho no further information can be had than that he remains so many   hours in his chamber yet if this is cleared to imagine that a   reasonable creature wrung with a narrow fortune does not make the best   use of this retirement would be a conclusion extremely uncharitable   from what has or will be said i hope no consequence can be extorted   implying that i would have any young fellow spend more time than the   common leisure which his studies require or more money than his   fortune or allowance may admit of in the pursuit of an acquaintance   with his betters for as to his time the gross of that ought to be   sacred to more substantial acquisitions for each irrevocable moment   of which he ought to believe he stands religiously accountable and as   to his dress i shall engage myself no further than in the modest   defence of two plain suits a year for being perfectly satisfied in   eutrapeluss contrivance of making a mohock of a man by presenting   him with lacd and embroiderd suits i would by no means be thought   to controvert that conceit by insinuating the advantages of foppery   it is an assertion which admits of much proof that a stranger of   tolerable sense dressd like a gentleman will be better received by   those of quality above him than one of much better parts whose dress   is regulated by the rigid notions of frugality a mans appearance   falls within the censure of every one that sees him his parts and   learning very few are judges of and even upon these few they cant   at first be well intruded for policy and good breeding will counsel   him to be reservd among strangers and to support himself only by the   common spirit of conversation indeed among the injudicious the words   delicacy idiom fine images structure of periods genius fire and   the rest made use of with a frugal and comely gravity will maintain   the figure of immense reading and depth of criticism    all gentlemen of fortune at least the young and middleaged are apt   to pride themselves a little too much upon their dress and   consequently to value others in some measure upon the same   consideration with what confusion is a man of figure obliged to   return the civilities of the hat to a person whose air and attire   hardly entitle him to it for whom nevertheless the other has a   particular esteem tho he is ashamed to have it challenged in so   publick a manner it must be allowed that any young fellow that   affects to dress and appear genteelly might with artificial   management save ten pound a year as instead of fine holland he might   mourn in sackcloth and in other particulars be proportionably shabby   but of what great service would this sum be to avert any misfortune   whilst it would leave him deserted by the little good acquaintance he   has and prevent his gaining any other as the appearance of an easy   fortune is necessary towards making one i dont know but it might be   of advantage sometimes to throw into ones discourse certain   exclamations about bankstock and to shew a marvellous surprize upon   its fall as well as the most affected triumph upon its rise the   veneration and respect which the practice of all ages has preserved to   appearances without doubt suggested to our tradesmen that wise and   politick custom to apply and recommend themselves to the publick by   all those decorations upon their signposts and houses which the most   eminent hands in the neighbourhood can furnish them with what can be   more attractive to a man of letters than that immense erudition of   all ages and languages which a skilful bookseller in conjunction with   a painter shall image upon his column and the extremities of his   shop the same spirit of maintaining a handsome appearance reigns   among the grave and solid apprentices of the law here i could be   particularly dull in proving   the word apprentice to be   significant of a barrister and you may easily distinguish who has   most lately made his pretensions to business by the whitest and most   ornamental frame of his window if indeed the chamber is a   groundroom and has rails before it the finery is of necessity more   extended and the pomp of business better maintaind and what can be   a greater indication of the dignity of dress than that burdensome   finery which is the regular habit of our judges nobles and bishops   with which upon certain days we see them incumbered and though it may   be said this is awful and necessary for the dignity of the state yet   the wisest of them have been remarkable before

protinus omnis   contremuit domus    virg    i have lately received the following letter from a country gentleman     mr spectator    the night before i left london i went to see a play called the   humorous lieutenant   upon the rising of the curtain i was very   much surprized with the great consort of catcalls which was exhibited   that evening and began to think with myself that i had made a   mistake and gone to a musickmeeting instead of the playhouse it   appeared indeed a little odd to me to see so many persons of quality   of both sexes assembled together at a kind of catterwawling for i   cannot look upon that performance to have been any thing better   whatever the musicians themselves might think of it as i had no   acquaintance in the house to ask questions of and was forced to go   out of town early the next morning i could not learn the secret of   this matter what i would therefore desire of you is to give some   account of this strange instrument which i found the company called a   catcall and particularly to let me know whether it be a piece of   musick lately come from italy for my own part to be free with you i   would rather hear an english fiddle though i durst not shew my   dislike whilst i was in the playhouse it being my chance to sit the   very next man to one of the performers i am sir    your most affectionate friend   and servant   john shallow esq   in compliance with esquire shallows request i design this paper as a dissertation upon the catcall in order to make myself a master of the subject i purchased one the beginning of last week though not without great difficulty being informd at two or three toyshops that the players had lately bought them all up i have since consulted many learned antiquaries in relation to its original and find them very much divided among themselves upon that particular a fellow of the royal society who is my good friend and a great proficient in the mathematical part of musick concludes from the simplicity of its make and the uniformity of its sound that the catcall is older than any of the inventions of jubal he observes very well that musical instruments took their first rise from the notes of birds and other melodious animals and what says he was more natural than for the first ages of mankind to imitate the voice of a cat that lived under the same roof with them he added that the cat had contributed more to harmony than any other animal as we are not only beholden to her for this windinstrument but for our string musick in general  another virtuoso of my acquaintance will not allow the catcall to be older than thespis and is apt to think it appeared in the world soon after the antient comedy for which reason it has still a place in our dramatick entertainments nor must i here omit what a very curious gentleman who is lately returned from his travels has more than once assured me namely that there was lately dug up at rome the statue of momus who holds an instrument in his righthand very much resembling our modern catcall  there are others who ascribe this invention to orpheus and look upon the catcall to be one of those instruments which that famous musician made use of to draw the beasts about him it is certain that the roasting of a cat does not call together a greater audience of that species than this instrument if dexterously played upon in proper time and place  but notwithstanding these various and learned conjectures i cannot forbear thinking that the catcall is originally a piece of english musick its resemblance to the voice of some of our british songsters as well as the use of it which is peculiar to our nation confirms me in this opinion it has at least received great improvements among us whether we consider the instrument it self or those several quavers and graces which are thrown into the playing of it every one might be sensible of this who heard that remarkable overgrown catcall which was placed in the center of the pit and presided over all the rest at the   celebrated performance lately exhibited in drurylane  having said thus much concerning the original of the catcall we are in the next place to consider the use of it the catcall exerts it self to most advantage in the british theatre it very much improves the sound of nonsense and often goes along with the voice of the actor who pronounces it as the violin or harpsichord accompanies the italian recitativo  it has often supplied the place of the antient chorus in the works of mrin short a bad poet has as great an antipathy to a catcall as many people have to a real cat  mr collier in his ingenious essay upon musick   has the following passage    i believe tis possible to invent an instrument that shall have a   quite contrary effect to those martial ones now in use an instrument   that shall sink the spirits and shake the nerves and curdle the   blood and inspire despair and cowardice and consternation at a   surprizing rate tis probable the roaring of lions the warbling of   cats and scritchowls together with a mixture of the howling of dogs   judiciously imitated and compounded might go a great way in this   invention whether such antimusick as this might not be of service in   a camp i shall leave to the military men to consider  what this learned gentleman supposes in speculation i have known actually verified in practice the catcall has struck a damp into generals and frighted heroes off the stage at the first sound of it i have seen a crowned head tremble and a princess fall into fits the humorous lieutenant himself could not stand it nay i am told that even almanzor looked like a mouse and trembled at the voice of this terrifying instrument  as it is of a dramatick nature and peculiarly appropriated to the stage i can by no means approve the thought of that angry lover who after an unsuccessful pursuit of some years took leave of his mistress in a serenade of catcalls  i must conclude this paper with the account i have lately received of an ingenious artist who has long studied this instrument and is very well versed in all the rules of the drama he teaches to play on it by book and to express by it the whole art of criticism he has his base and his treble catcall the former for tragedy the latter for comedy only in tragycomedies they may both play together in consort he has a particular squeak to denote the violation of each of the unities and has different sounds to shew whether he aims at the poet or the player in short he teaches the smutnote the fustiannote the stupidnote and has composed a kind of air that may serve as an acttune to an incorrigible play and which takes in the whole compass of the catcall  l      footnote   by beaumont and fletcher   footnote   that   footnote

parents send to one certain doctor in town   they   can have no advice for him under a guinea when poisons are thus   cheap and medicines thus dear how can you be negligent in inspecting   what we eat

who had saved the life of a citizen how much more   does the world owe to those who prevent the death of multitudes as   these men deserve well of your office so such as act to the detriment   of our health you ought to represent to themselves and their   fellowsubjects in the colours which they deserve to wear i think it   would be for the publick good that all who vend wines should be under

conceived that it can be   brought in chancemedley or manslaughter upon proof that it shall   appear wine joined to wine or right herefordshire poured into port o   port but his selling it for one thing knowing it to be another must   justly bear the foresaid guilt of wilful murder for that he the said   vintner did an unlawful act willingly in the false mixture and is   therefore with equity

i improved in my study but   became unpleasant in conversation by conversing generally with the   dead i grew almost unfit for the society of the living so by a long   confinement i contracted an ungainly aversion to conversation and   ever discoursed with pain to my self and little entertainment to   others at last i was in some measure made sensible of my failing and   the mortification of never being spoke to or speaking unless the   discourse ran upon books put me upon forcing my self amongst men i   immediately affected the politest company by the frequent use of   which i hoped to wear off the rust i had contracted but by an uncouth   imitation of men used to act in publick i got no further than to   discover i had a mind to appear a finer thing than i really was    such i was and such was my condition when i became an ardent lover   and passionate admirer of the beauteous belinda then it was that i   really began to improve this passion changed all my fears and   diffidences in my general behaviour to the sole concern of pleasing   her i had not now to study the action of a gentleman but love   possessing all my thoughts made me truly be the thing i had a mind to   appear my thoughts grew free and generous and the ambition to be   agreeable to her i admired produced in my carriage a faint similitude   of that disengaged manner of my belinda the way we are in at present   is that she sees my passion and sees i at present forbear speaking   of it through prudential regards this respect to her she returns with   much civility and makes my value for her as little a misfortune to   me as is consistent with discretion she sings very charmingly and   is readier to do so at my request because she knows i love her she   will dance with me rather than another for the same reason my   fortune must alter from what it is before i can speak my heart to   her and her circumstances are not considerable enough to make up for   the narrowness of mine but i write to you now only to give you the   character of belinda as a woman that has address enough to   demonstrate a gratitude to her lover without giving him hopes of   success in his passion belinda has from a great wit governed by as   great prudence and both adorned with innocence the happiness of   always being ready to discover her real thoughts she has many of us   who now are her admirers but her treatment of us is so just and   proportioned to our merit towards her and what we are in our selves   that i protest to you i have neither jealousy nor hatred toward my   rivals such is her goodness and the acknowledgment of every man who   admires her that he thinks he ought to believe she will take him who   best deserves her i will not say that this peace among us is not   owing to selflove which prompts each to think himself the best   deserver i think there is something uncommon and worthy of imitation   in this ladys character if you will please to print my letter you   will

ubique   luctus ubique pavor et plurima mortis   imago    virg    milton has shewn a wonderful art in describing that variety of passions which arise in our first parents upon the breach of the commandment that had been given them we see them gradually passing from the triumph of their guilt thro remorse shame despair contrition prayer and hope to a perfect and compleat repentance at the end of the tenth book they are represented as prostrating themselves upon the ground and watering the earth with their tears to which the poet joins this beautiful circumstance that they offerd up their penitential prayers on the very place where their judge appeared to them when he pronounced their sentence   they forthwith to the place   repairing where he judgd them prostrate fell   before him reverent and both confessd   humbly their faults and pardon beggd with tears   watering the ground  there is a beauty of the same kind in a tragedy of sophocles where oedipus after having put out his own eyes instead of breaking his neck from the palacebattlements which furnishes so elegant an entertainment for our english audience desires that he may be conducted to mount cithoeron in order to end his life in that very place where he was exposed in his infancy and where he should then have died had the will of his parents been executed  as the author never fails to give a poetical turn to his sentiments he describes in the beginning of this book the acceptance which these their prayers met with in a short allegory formd upon that beautiful passage in holy writ and another angel came and stood at the altar having a golden censer and there was given unto him much incense that he should offer it with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne and the smoak of the incense which came with the prayers of the saints ascended up before god   to heavn their prayers   flew up nor missd the way by envious winds   blown vagabond or frustrate in they passd   dimensionless through heavnly doors then clad   with incense where the golden altar fumed   by their great intercessor came in sight   before the fathers throne  we have the same thought expressed a second time in the intercession of the messiah which is conceived in very emphatick sentiments and expressions  among the poetical parts of scripture which milton has so finely wrought into this part of his narration i must not omit that wherein ezekiel speaking of the angels who appeared to him in a vision adds that every one had four faces and that their whole bodies and their backs and their hands and their wings were full of eyes round about   the cohort bright   of watchful cherubims four faces each   had like a double janus all their shape   spangled with eyes  the assembling of all the angels of heaven to hear the solemn decree passed upon man is represented in very lively ideas the almighty is here describd as remembring mercy in the midst of judgment and commanding michael to deliver his message in the mildest terms lest the spirit of man which was already broken with the sense of his guilt and misery should fail before him   yet lest they faint   at the sad sentence rigorously urgd   for i behold them softned and with tears   bewailing their excess all terror hide  the conference of adam and eve is full of moving sentiments upon their going abroad after the melancholy night which they had passed together they discover the lion and the eagle pursuing each of them their prey towards the eastern gates of paradise there is a double beauty in this incident not only as it presents great and just omens which are always agreeable in poetry but as it expresses that enmity which was now produced in the animal creation the poet to shew the like changes in nature as well as to grace his fable with a noble prodigy represents the sun in an eclipse this particular incident has likewise a fine effect upon the imagination of the reader in regard to what follows for at the same time that the sun is under an eclipse a bright cloud descends in the western quarter of the heavens filled with an host of angels and more luminous than the sun it self the whole theatre of nature is darkned that this glorious machine may appear in all its lustre and magnificence   why in the east   darkness ere days midcourse and morning light   more orient in that western cloud that draws   oer the blue firmament a radiant white   and slow descends with something heavnly fraught     he errd not for by this the heavenly bands   down from a sky of jasper lighted now   in paradise and on a hill made halt   a glorious apparition  i need not observe how properly this author who always suits his parts to the actors whom he introduces has employed michael in the expulsion of our first parents from paradise the archangel on this occasion neither appears in his proper shape nor in that familiar manner with which raphael the sociable spirit entertained the father of mankind before the fall his person his port and behaviour are suitable to a spirit of the highest rank and exquisitely describd in the following passage   th archangel soon drew nigh   not in his shape celestial but as man   clad to meet man over his lucid arms   a military vest of purple flowd   livelier than meliboean or the grain   of sarra worn by kings and heroes old   in time of truce iris had dipt the wooff   his starry helm unbuckled shewd him prime   in manhood where youth ended by his side   as in a glistring zodiack hung the sword   satans dire dread and in his hand the spear   adam bowd low he kingly from his state   inclined not but his coming thus declared  eves complaint upon hearing that she was to be removed from the garden of paradise is wonderfully beautiful the sentiments are not only proper to the subject but have something in them particularly soft and womanish    must i then leave thee paradise thus leave   thee native soil these happy walks and shades   fit haunt of gods where i had hope to spend   quiet though sad the respite of that day   that must be mortal to us both o flowrs   that never will in other climate grow   my early visitation and my last   at even which i bred up with tender hand   from the first opening bud and gave you names   who now shall rear you to the sun or rank   your tribes and water from th ambrosial fount   thee lastly nuptial bower by me adornd   with what to sight or smell was sweet from thee   how shall i part and whither wander down   into a lower world to this obscure   and wild how shall we breathe in other air   less pure accustomd to immortal fruits  adams speech abounds with thoughts which are equally moving but of a more masculine and elevated turn nothing can be conceived more sublime and poetical than the following passage in it    this most afflicts me that departing hence   as from his face i shall be hid deprived   his blessed countnance here i could frequent   with worship place by place where he vouchsafd   presence divine and to my sons relate   on this mount he appeard under this tree   stood visible among these pines his voice   i heard here with him at this fountain talkd   so many grateful altars i would rear   of grassy turf and pile up every stone   of lustre from the brook in memory   or monument to ages and thereon   offer sweetsmelling gums and fruits and flowers   in yonder nether worldwhere shall i seek   his bright appearances or footsteps trace   for though i fled him angry yet recalled   to life prolonged and promised race i now   gladly behold though but his utmost skirts   of glory and far off his steps adore  the angel afterwards leads adam to the highest mount of paradise and lays before him a whole hemisphere as a proper stage for those visions which were to be represented on it i have before observed how the plan of miltons poem is in many particulars greater than that of the iliad or æneid virgils hero in the last of these poems is entertained with a sight of all those who are to descend from him but though that episode is justly admired as one of the noblest designs in the whole æneid every onemust allow that this of milton is of a much higher nature adams vision is not confined to any particular tribe of mankind but extends to the whole species  in this great review which adam takes of all his sons and daughters the first objects he is presented with exhibit to him the story of cain and abel which is drawn together with much closeness and propriety of expression that curiosity and natural horror which arises in adam at the sight of the first dying man is touched with great beauty    but have i now seen death is this the way   i must return to native dust o sight   of terror foul and ugly to behold   horrid to think how horrible to feel  the second vision sets before him the image of death in a great variety of appearances the angel to give him a general idea of those effects which his guilt had brought upon his posterity places before him a large hospital or lazarhouse filled with persons lying under all kinds of mortal diseases how finely has the poet told us that the sick persons languished under lingering and incurable distempers by an apt and judicious use of such imaginary beings as those i mentioned in my last saturdays paper    dire was the tossing deep the groans despair   tended the sick busy from couch to couch   and over them triumphant death his dart   shook but delayed to strike though oft invoked   with vows as their chief good and final hope  the passion which likewise rises in adam on this occasion is very natural    sight so deform what heart of rock could long   dryeyed behold adam could not but wept   tho not of woman born compassion quelld   his best of man and gave him up to tears  the discourse between the angel and adam which follows abounds with noble morals  as there is nothing more delightful in poetry than a contrast and opposition of incidents the author after this melancholy prospect of death and sickness raises up a scene of mirth love and jollity the secret pleasure that steals into adams heart as he is intent upon this vision is imagined with great delicacy i must not omit the description of the loose female troop who seduced the sons of god as they are called in scripture    for that fair female troop thou sawst that seemed   of goddesses so blithe so smooth so gay   yet empty of all good wherein consists   womans domestick honour and chief praise   bred only and compleated to the taste   of lustful appetence to sing to dance   to dress and troule the tongue and roll the eye   to these that sober race of men whose lives   religious titled them the sons of god   shall yield up all their virtue all their fame   ignobly to the trains and to the smiles   of those fair atheists  the next vision is of a quite contrary nature and filled with the horrors of war adam at the sight of it melts into tears and breaks out in that passionate speech   o what are these   deaths ministers not men who thus deal death   inhumanly to men and multiply   ten thousandfold the sin of him who slew   his brother for of whom such massacre   make they but of their brethren men of men  milton to keep up an agreeable variety in his visions after having raised in the mind of his reader the several ideas of terror which are conformable to the description of war passes on to those softer images of triumphs and festivals in that vision of lewdness and luxury which ushers in the flood  as it is visible that the poet had his eye upon ovids account of the universal deluge the reader may observe with how much judgment he has avoided every thing that is redundant or puerile in the latin poet we do not here see the wolf swimming among the sheep nor any of those wanton imaginations which seneca found fault with   as unbecoming the   great catastrophe of nature if our poet has imitated that verse in which ovid tells us that there was nothing but sea and that this sea had no shore to it he has not set the thought in such a light as to incur the censure which criticks have passed upon it the latter part of that verse in ovid is idle and superfluous but just and beautiful in milton    jamque mare et tellus nullum discrimen habebant   nil nisi pontus erat deerant quoque littora ponto    ovid     sea coverd sea   sea without shore    milton  in milton the former part of the description does not forestall the latter how much more great and solemn on this occasion is that which follows in our english poet   and in their palaces   where luxury late reignd seamonsters whelpd   and stabled  than that in ovid where we are told that the seacalfs lay in those places where the goats were used to browze the reader may find several other parallel passages in the latin and english description of the deluge wherein our poet has visibly the advantage the skys being overcharged with clouds the descending of the rains the rising of the seas and the appearance of the rainbow are such descriptions as every one must take notice of the circumstance relating to paradise is so finely imagined and suitable to the opinions of many learned authors that i cannot forbear giving it a place in this paper   then shall this mount   of paradise by might of waves be movd   out of his place pushed by the horned flood   with all his verdure spoild and trees adrift   down the great river to the opning gulf   and there take root an island salt and bare   the haunt of seals and orcs and seamews clang  the transition which the poet makes from the vision of the deluge to the concern it occasioned in adam is exquisitely graceful and copied after virgil though the first thought it introduces is rather in the spirit of ovid    how didst thou grieve then adam to behold   the end of all thy offspring end so sad   depopulation thee another flood   of tears and sorrow a flood thee also drowned   and sunk thee as thy sons till gently reard   by th angel on thy feet thou stoodst at last   tho comfortless as when a father mourns   his children all in view destroyed at once  i have been the more particular in my quotations out of the eleventh book of paradise lost because it is not generally reckoned among the most shining books of this poem for which reason the reader might be apt to overlook those many passages in it which deserve our admiration the eleventh and twelfth are indeed built upon that single circumstance of the removal of our first parents from paradise but tho this is not in itself so great a subject as that in most of the foregoing books it is extended and diversified with so many surprising incidents and pleasing episodes that these two last books can by no means be looked upon as unequal parts of this divine poem i must further add that had not milton represented our first parents as driven out of paradise his fall of man would not have been compleat and consequently his action would have been imperfect  l    footnote   nat quaest bk iii §     footnote    this                                               no                       monday april                     steele      navibus

to this   trouble she is a widow to whom the indulgence of a tender husband   has entrusted the management of a very great fortune and a son about   sixteen both which she is extremely fond of the boy has parts of the   middle size neither shining nor despicable and has passed the common   exercises of his years with tolerable advantage but is withal what   you would call a forward youth by the help of this last   qualification which serves as a varnish to all the rest he is   enabled to make the best use of his learning and display it at full   length upon all occasions last summer he distinguished himself two or   three times very remarkably by puzzling the vicar before an assembly   of most of the ladies in the neighbourhood and from such weighty   considerations as these as it too often unfortunately falls out the   mother is become invincibly persuaded that her son is a great scholar   and that to chain him down to the ordinary methods of education with   others of his age would be to cramp his faculties and do an   irreparable injury to his wonderful capacity    i happened to visit at the house last week and missing the young   gentleman at the teatable where he seldom fails to officiate could   not upon so extraordinary a circumstance avoid inquiring after him my   lady told me he was gone out with her woman in order to make some   preparations for their equipage for that she intended very speedily   to carry him to travel the oddness of the expression shockd me a   little however i soon recovered my self enough to let her know that   all i was willing to understand by it was that she designed this   summer to shew her son his estate in a distant county in which he has   never yet been but she soon took care to rob me of that agreeable   mistake and let me into the whole affair she enlarged upon young   masters prodigious improvements and his comprehensive knowledge of   all booklearning concluding that it was now high time he should be   made acquainted with men and things that she had resolved he should   make the tour of france and italy but could not bear to have him out   of her sight and therefore intended to go along with him    i was going to rally her for so extravagant a resolution but found my   self not in fit humour to meddle with a subject that demanded the most   soft and delicate touch imaginable i was afraid of dropping something   that might seem to bear hard either upon the sons abilities or the   mothers discretion being sensible that in both these cases tho   supported with all the powers of reason i should instead of gaining   her ladyship over to my opinion only expose my self to her disesteem   i therefore immediately determined to refer the whole matter to the   spectator    when i came to reflect at night as my custom is upon the occurrences   of the day i could not but believe that this humour of carrying a boy   to travel in his mothers lap and that upon pretence of learning men   and things is a case of an extraordinary nature and carries on it a   particular stamp of folly i did not remember to have met with its   parallel within the compass of my observation tho i could call to   mind some not extremely unlike it from hence my thoughts took   occasion to ramble into the general notion of travelling as it is now   made a part of education nothing is more frequent than to take a lad   from grammar and taw and under the tuition of some poor scholar who   is willing to be banished for thirty pounds a year and a little   victuals send him crying and snivelling into foreign countries thus   he spends his time as children do at puppetshows and with much the   same advantage in staring and gaping at an amazing variety of strange   things strange indeed to one who is not prepared to comprehend the   reasons and meaning of them whilst he should be laying the solid   foundations of knowledge in his mind and furnishing it with just   rules to direct his future progress in life under some skilful master   of the art of instruction    can there be a more astonishing thought in nature than to consider   how men should fall into so palpable a mistake it is a large field   and may very well exercise a sprightly genius but i dont remember   you have yet taken a turn in it i wish sir you would make people   understand that travel is really the last step to be taken in the   institution of youth and to set out with it is to begin where they   should end    certainly the true end of visiting foreign parts is to look into   their customs and policies and observe in what particulars they excel   or come short of our own to unlearn some odd peculiarities in our   manners and wear off such awkward stiffnesses and affectations in our   behaviour as may possibly have been contracted from constantly   associating with one nation of men by a more free general and mixed   conversation but how can any of these advantages be attained by one   who is a mere stranger to the custom sand policies of his native   country and has not yet fixed in his mind the first principles of   manners and behaviour to endeavour it is to build a gawdy structure   without any foundation or if i may be allowd the expression to   work a rich embroidery upon a cobweb    another end of travelling which deserves to be considerd is the   improving our taste of the best authors of antiquity by seeing the   places where they lived and of which they wrote to compare the   natural face of the country with the descriptions they have given us   and observe how well the picture agrees with the original this must   certainly be a most charming exercise to the mind that is rightly   turned for it besides that it may in a good measure be made   subservient to morality if the person is capable of drawing just   conclusions concerning the uncertainty of human things from the   ruinous alterations time and barbarity have brought upon so many   palaces cities and whole countries which make the most illustrious   figures in history and this hint may be not a little improved by   examining every spot of ground that we find celebrated as the scene of   some famous action or retaining any footsteps of a cato cicero or   brutus or some such great virtuous man a nearer view of any such   particular tho really little and trifling in it self may serve the   more powerfully to warm a generous mind to an emulation of their   virtues and a greater ardency of ambition to imitate their bright   examples if it comes duly temperd and prepard for the impression

the month of may which infuses a kindly warmth into the earth and all its inhabitants the marchioness of s who was one of the company told him that though she would promise to be chaste in every month besides she could not engage for her self in may as the beginning therefore of this month is now very near i design this paper for a caveat to the fair sex and publish it before april is quite out that if any of them should be caught tripping they may not pretend they had not timely notice  i am induced to this being persuaded the abovementioned observation is as well calculated for our climate as for that of france and that some of our british ladies are of the same constitution with the french marchioness  i shall leave it among physicians to determine what may be the cause of such an anniversary inclination whether or no it is that the spirits after having been as it were frozen and congealed by winter are now turned loose and set a rambling or that the gay prospects of fields and meadows with the courtship of the birds in every bush naturally unbend the mind and soften it to pleasure or that as some have imagined a woman is prompted by a kind of instinct to throw herself on a bed of flowers and not to let those beautiful couches which nature has provided lie useless however it be the effects of this month on the lower part of the sex who act without disguise are   very visible it is at this time that we see the young wenches in a country parish dancing round a maypole which one of our learned antiquaries supposes to be a relique of a certain pagan worship that i do not think fit to mention  it is likewise on the first day of this month that we see the ruddy milkmaid exerting her self in a most sprightly manner under a pyramid of silvertankards and like the virgin tarpeia oppressd by the costly ornaments which her benefactors lay upon her  i need not mention the ceremony of the green gown which is also peculiar to this gay season  the same periodical lovefit spreads through the whole sex as mr dryden well observes in his description of this merry month    for thee sweet month the groves green livries wear   if not the first the fairest of the year   for thee the graces lead the dancing hours   and natures ready pencil paints the flowrs   the sprightly may commands our youth to keep   the vigils of her night and breaks their sleep   each gentle breast with kindly warmth she moves   inspires new flames revives extinguishd loves    accordingly among the works of the great masters in painting who have drawn this genial season of the year we often observe cupids confused with zephirs flying up and down promiscuously in several parts of the picture i cannot but add from my own experience that about this time of the year loveletters come up to me in great numbers from all quarters of the nation  i receivd an epistle in particular by the last post from a yorkshire gentleman who makes heavy complaints of one zelinda whom it seems he has courted unsuccessfully these three years past he tells me that he designs to try her this may and if he does not carry his point he will never think of her more  having thus fairly admonished the female sex and laid before them the dangers they are exposed to in this critical month i shall in the next place lay down some rules and directions for their better avoiding those calentures which are so very frequent in this season  in the first place i would advise them never to venture abroad in the fields but in the company of a parent a guardian or some other sober discreet person i have before shewn how apt they are to trip in a flowry meadow and shall further observe to them that proserpine was out a maying when she met with that fatal adventure to which milton alludes when he mentions   that fair field   of enna where proserpine gathering flowers   herself a fairer flower by gloomy dis   was gathered   since i am got into quotations i shall conclude this head with virgils advice to young people while they are gathering wild strawberries and nosegays that they should have a care of the snake in the grass  in the second place i cannot but approve those prescriptions which our astrological physicians give in their almanacks for this month such as are a spare and simple diet with the moderate use of phlebotomy  under this head of abstinence i shall also advise my fair readers to be in a particular manner careful how they meddle with romances chocolate novels and the like inflamers which i look upon as very dangerous to be made use of during this great carnival of nature  as i have often declared that i have nothing more at heart than the honour of my dear countrywomen i would beg them to consider whenever their resolutions begin to fail them that there are but one and thirty days of this soft season and that if they can but weather out this one month the rest of the year will be easy to them as for that part of the fairsex who stay in town i would advise them to be particularly cautious how they give themselves up to their most innocent entertainments if they cannot forbear the playhouse i would recommend tragedy to them rather than comedy and should think the puppetshow much safer for them than the opera all the while the sun is in gemini  the reader will observe that this paper is written for the use of those ladies who think it worth while to war against nature in the cause of honour as for that abandond crew who do not think virtue worth contending for but give up their reputation at the first summons such warnings and

æstiva recreatur aura   dulce ridentem lalagen amabo   dulce loquentem    hor    there are such wild inconsistencies in the thoughts of a man in love that i have often reflected there can be no reason for allowing him more liberty than others possessed with frenzy but that his distemper has no malevolence in it to any mortal that devotion to his mistress kindles in his mind a general tenderness which exerts it self towards every object as well as his fairone when this passion is represented by writers it is common with them to endeavour at certain quaintnesses and turns of imagination which are apparently the work of a mind at ease but the men of true taste can easily distinguish the exertion of a mind which overflows with tender sentiments and the labour of one which is only describing distress in performances of this kind the most absurd of all things is to be witty every sentiment must grow out of the occasion and be suitable to the circumstances of the character where this rule is transgressed the humble servant in all the fine things he says is but shewing his mistress how well he can dress instead of saying how well he loves lace and drapery is as much a man as wit and turn is passion     mr spectator    the following verses are a translation of a lapland lovesong which i   met with in scheffers history of that country   i was agreeably   surprized to find a spirit of tenderness and poetry in a region which   i never suspected for delicacy in hotter climates tho altogether   uncivilized i had not wonderd if i had found some sweet wild notes   among the natives where they live in groves of oranges and hear the   melody of birds about them but a lapland lyric breathing sentiments   of love and poetry not unworthy old greece or rome a regular ode   from a climate pinched with frost and cursed with darkness so great a   part of the year where tis amazing that the poor natives should get   food or be tempted to propagate their species this i confess

sentiments without adding or diminishing and   pretend to no greater praise from my translation than they who smooth   and clean the furs of that country which have suffered by carriage   the numbers in the original are as loose and unequal as those in   which the british ladies sport their pindaricks and perhaps the   fairest of them might not think it a disagreeable present from a   lover but i have ventured to bind it in stricter measures as being   more proper for our tongue tho perhaps wilder graces may better suit   the genius of the laponian language    it will be necessary to imagine

wears   them and some to hangerson that frequents the house daily who   comes dressed out in them this sir is a very mortifying sight to   me who am a little necessitous for cloaths and loves to appear what   i am and causes an uneasiness so that i cant serve with that   chearfulness as formerly which my mistress takes notice of and calls   envy and illtemper at seeing others preferred before me my mistress   has a younger sister lives in the house with her that is some   thousands below her in estate who is continually heaping her favours   on her maid so that she can appear every sunday for the first   quarter in a fresh suit of cloaths of her mistresss giving with all   other things suitable all this i see without envying but not without   wishing my mistress would a little consider what a discouragement it   is to me to have my perquisites divided between fawners and jobbers   which others enjoy intire to themselves i have spoke to my mistress   but to little purpose i have desired to be discharged for indeed i   fret my self to nothing but that she answers with silence i beg   sir your direction what to do for i am fully resolved to follow your   counsel who am   your

publick from these my speculations and which were i to speak after the manner of logicians i would distinguish into the material and the formal by the latter i understand those advantages which my readers receive as their minds are either improvd or delighted by these my daily labours but having already several times descanted on my endeavours in this light i shall at present wholly confine my self to the consideration of the former by the word material i mean those benefits which arise to the publick from these my speculations as they consume a considerable quantity of our paper manufacture employ our artisans in printing and find business for great numbers of indigent persons  our papermanufacture takes into it several mean materials which could be put to no other use and affords work for several hands in the collecting of them which are incapable of any other employment those poor retailers whom we see so busy in every street deliver in their respective gleanings to the merchant the merchant carries them in loads to the papermill where they pass thro a fresh set of hands and give life to another trade those who have mills on their estates by this means considerably raise their rents and the whole nation is in a great measure supplyd with a manufacture for which formerly she was obliged to her neighbours  the materials are no sooner wrought into paper but they are distributed among the presses where they again set innumerable artists at work and furnish business to another mystery from hence accordingly as they are staind with news or politicks they fly thro the town in postmen postboys dailycourants reviews medleys and examiners men women and children contend who shall be the first bearers of them and get their daily sustenance by spreading them in short when i trace in my mind a bundle of rags to a quire of spectators i find so many hands employd in every step they take thro their whole progress that while i am writing a spectator i fancy my self providing bread for a multitude  if i do not take care to obviate some of my witty readers they will be apt to tell me that my paper after it is thus printed and published is still beneficial to the publick on several occasions i must confess i have lighted my pipe with my own works for this twelvemonth past my landlady often sends up her little daughter to desire some of my old spectators and has frequently told me that the paper they are printed on is the best in the world to wrap spice in they likewise make a good foundation for a mutton pye as i have more than once

the politest nations of europe have endeavoured to vie with one another for the reputation of the finest printing absolute governments as well as republicks have encouraged an art which seems to be the noblest and most beneficial that was ever invented among the sons of men the present king of france in his pursuits after glory has particularly distinguished himself by the promoting of this useful art insomuch that several books have been printed in the louvre at his own expence upon which he sets so great a value that he considers them as the noblest presents he can make to foreign

years last past has made our own nation as glorious upon this account as for its late triumphs and conquests the new edition which is given us of cæsars commentaries has already been taken notice of

judicious writers this age has produced the beauty of the paper of the character and of the several cuts with which this noble work is illustrated makes it the finest book that i have ever seen and is a true instance of the english genius which tho it does not come the first into any art generally carries it to greater heights than any other country in the world i am particularly glad that this author comes from a british printinghouse in so great a magnificence as he is the first who has given us any tolerable account of our country  my illiterate readers if any such there are will be surprized to hear me talk of learning as the glory of a nation and of printing as an art that gains a reputation to a people among whom it flourishes when mens thoughts are taken up with avarice and ambition they cannot look upon any thing as great or valuable which does not bring with it an extraordinary power or interest to the person who is concerned in it but as i shall never sink this paper

shall translate the following letter written to an eminent french gentleman in this town from paris which gives us the exit of an heroine who is a pattern of patience and generosity     paris april            sir    it is so many years since you left your native country that i am to   tell you the characters of your nearest relations as much as if you   were an utter stranger to them the occasion of this is to give you an   account of the death of madam de villacerfe whose departure out of   this life i know not whether a man of your philosophy will call   unfortunate or not since it was attended with some circumstances as   much to be desired as to be lamented she was her whole life happy in   an uninterrupted health and was always honoured for an evenness of   temper and greatness of mind on the  0th instant that lady was taken   with an indisposition which confined her to her chamber but was such   as was too slight to make her take a sick bed and yet too grievous to   admit of any satisfaction in being out of it it is notoriously known   that some years ago monsieur festeau one of the most considerable   surgeons in paris was desperately in love with this lady her quality   placed her above any application to her on the account of his passion   but as a woman always has some regard to the person whom she believes   to be her real admirer she now took it in her head upon advice of   her physicians to lose some of her blood to send for monsieur festeau   on that occasion i happened to be there at that time and my near   relation gave me the privilege to be present as soon as her arm was   stripped bare and he began to press it in order to raise the vein   his colour changed and i observed him seized with a sudden tremor   which made me take the liberty to speak of it to my cousin with some   apprehension she smiled and said she knew mr festeau had no   inclination to do her injury he seemed to recover himself and   smiling also proceeded in his work immediately after the operation he   cried out that he was the most unfortunate of all men for that he   had opend an artery instead of a vein it is as impossible to express   the artists distraction as the patients composure i will not dwell   on little circumstances but go on to inform you that within three   days time it was thought necessary to take off her arm she was so far   from using festeau as it would be natural to one of a lower spirit to   treat him that she would not let him be absent from any consultation   about her present condition and on every occasion asked whether he   was satisfyd in the measures that were taken about her before this   last operation she ordered her will to be drawn and after having been   about a quarter of an hour alone she bid the surgeons of whom poor   festeau was one go on in their work i know not how to give you the   terms of art but there appeared such symptoms after the amputation of   her arm that it was visible she could not live four and twenty hours   her behaviour was so magnanimous throughout this whole affair that i   was particularly curious in taking notice of what passed as her fate   approached nearer and nearer and took notes of what she said to all   about her particularly word for word what she spoke to mr festeau   which was as follows      sir you give me inexpressible sorrow for the anguish with which i     see you overwhelmed i am removed to all intents and purposes from     the interests of human life therefore i am to begin to think like     one wholly unconcerned in it i do not consider you as one by whose     error i have lost my life no you are my benefactor as you have     hastend my entrance into a happy immortality this is my sense of     this accident but the world in which you live may have thoughts of     it to your disadvantage i have therefore taken care to provide for     you in my will and have placed you above what you have to fear from     their illnature    while this excellent woman spoke these words festeau looked as if he   received a condemnation to die instead of a pension for his life   madam de villacerfe lived till eight of the clock the next night   and tho she must have laboured under the most exquisite torments she   possessed her mind with so wonderful a patience that one may rather   say she ceased to breathe than she died at that hour you who had not   the happiness to be personally known to this lady have nothing but to   rejoyce in the honour you had of being related to so great merit but   we who have lost her conversation cannot so easily resign our own   happiness by reflection upon hers   i am sir   your affectionate kinsman   and most obedient humble servant   paul regnaud   there hardly can be a greater instance of an heroick mind than the unprejudiced manner in which this lady weighed this misfortune the regard of life itself could not make her overlook the contrition of the unhappy man whose more than ordinary concern for her was all his guilt it would certainly be of singular use to human society to have an exact account of this ladys ordinary conduct which was crowned by so uncommon magnanimity such greatness was not to be acquired in her last article nor is it to be doubted but it was a constant practice of all that is praiseworthy which made her capable of beholding death not as the dissolution but consummation of her life  t                                        no                 saturday may                         addison      segnius irritant animos demissa per aures   quam quæ sunt oculis subjecta fidelibus    hor    milton after having represented in vision the history of mankind to the first great period of nature dispatches the remaining part of it in narration he has devised a very handsome reason for the angels proceeding with adam after this manner though doubtless the true reason was the difficulty which the poet would have found to have shadowed out so mixed and complicated a story in visible objects i could wish however that the author had done it whatever pains it might have cost him to give my opinion freely i think that the exhibiting part of the history of mankind in vision and part in narrative is as if an historypainter should put in colours one half of his subject and write down the remaining part of it if miltons poem flags any where it is in this narration where in some places the author has been so attentive to his divinity that he has neglected his poetry the narration however rises very happily on several occasions where the subject is capable of poetical ornaments as particularly in the confusion which he describes among the builders of babel and in his short sketch of the plagues of egypt the storm of hail and fire with the darkness that overspread the land for three days are described with great strength the beautiful passage which follows is raised upon noble hints in scripture   thus with ten wounds   the riverdragon tamed at length submits   to let his sojourners depart and oft   humbles his stubborn heart but still as ice   more hardend after thaw till in his rage   pursuing whom he late dismissed the sea   swallows him with his host but them lets pass   as on dry land between two chrystal walls   awd by the rod of moses so to stand   divided  the riverdragon is an allusion to the crocodile which inhabits the nile from whence egypt derives her plenty this allusion is taken from that sublime passage in ezekiel thus saith the lord god behold i am against thee pharaoh king of egypt the great dragon that lieth in the midst of his rivers which hath said my river is mine own and i have made it for my self milton has given us another very noble and poetical image in the same description which is copied almost word for word out of the history of moses    all night he will pursue but his approach   darkness defends between till morning watch   then through the fiery pillar and the cloud   god looking forth will trouble all his host   and craze their chariot wheels when by command   moses once more his potent rod extends   over the sea the sea his rod obeys   on their embattelld ranks the waves return   and overwhelm their war  as the principal design of this episode was to give adam an idea of the holy person who was to reinstate human nature in that happiness and perfection from which it had fallen the poet confines himself to the line of abraham from whence the messiah was to descend the angel is described as seeing the patriarch actually travelling towards the land of promise which gives a particular liveliness to this part of the narration    i see him but thou canst not with what faith   he leaves his gods his friends his native soil   ur of chaldæa passing now the ford   to haran after him a cumbrous train   of herds and flocks and numerous servitude   not wandring poor but trusting all his wealth   with god who calld him in a land unknown   canaan he now attains i see his tents   pitchd about sechem and the neighbouring plain   of moreh there by promise he receives   gifts to his progeny of all that land   from hamath northward to the desart south   things by their names i call though yet unnamed  as virgils vision in the sixth æneid probably gave milton the hint of this whole episode the last line is a translation of that verse where anchises mentions the names of places which they were to bear hereafter    hæc tum nomina erunt nunc sunt sine nomine terræ  the poet has very finely represented the joy and gladness of heart which rises in adam upon his discovery of the messiah as he sees his day at a distance through types and shadows he rejoices in it but when he finds the redemption of man compleated and paradise again renewed he breaks forth in rapture and transport    o goodness infinite goodness immense   that all this good of evil shall produce c  i have hinted in my sixth paper on milton that an heroick poem according to the opinion of the best criticks ought to end happily and leave the mind of the reader after having conducted it through many doubts and fears sorrows and disquietudes in a state of tranquility and satisfaction miltons fable which had so many other qualifications to recommend it was deficient in this particular it is here therefore that the poet has shewn a most exquisite judgment as well as the finest invention by finding out a method to supply this natural defect in his subject accordingly he leaves the adversary of mankind in the last view which he gives us of him under the lowest state of mortification and disappointment we see him chewing ashes grovelling in the dust and loaden with supernumerary pains and torments on the contrary our two first parents are comforted by dreams and visions cheared with promises of salvation and in a manner raised to a greater happiness than that which they had forfeited in short satan is represented miserable in the height of his triumphs and adam triumphant in the height of misery  miltons poem ends very nobly the last speeches of adam and the archangel are full of moral and instructive sentiments the sleep that fell upon eve and the effects it had in quieting the disorders of her mind produces the same kind of consolation in the reader who cannot peruse the last beautiful speech which is ascribed to the mother of mankind without a secret pleasure and satisfaction    whence thou returnst and whither wentst i know   for god is also in sleep and dreams advise   which he hath sent propitious some great good   presaging since with sorrow and hearts distress   wearied i fell asleep but now lead on   in me is no delay with thee to go   is to stay here without thee here to stay   is to go hence unwilling thou to me   art all things under heavn all places thou   who for my wilful crime art banishd hence   this farther consolation yet secure   i carry hence though all by me is lost   such favour i unworthy am vouchsafed   by me the promised seed shall all restore  the following lines which conclude the poem rise in a most glorious blaze of poetical images and expressions  heliodorus in his æthiopicks acquaints us that the motion of the gods differs from that of mortals as the former do not stir their feet nor proceed step by step but slide oer the surface of the earth by an uniform swimming of the whole body the reader may observe with how poetical a description milton has attributed the same kind of motion to the angels who were to take possession of paradise    so spake our mother eve and adam heard   well pleasd but answered not for now too nigh   th archangel stood and from the other hill   to their fixd station all in bright array   the cherubim descended on the ground   gliding meteorous as evening mist   risn from a river oer the marish glides   and gathers ground fast at the labrers heel   homeward returning high in front advanced   the brandishd sword of god before them blazd   fierce as a comet  the author helped his invention in the following passage by reflecting on the behaviour of the angel who in holy writ has the conduct of lot and his family the circumstances drawn from that relation are very gracefully made use of on this occasion    in either hand the hastning angel caught   our lingring parents and to th eastern gate   led them direct and down the cliff as fast   to the subjected plain then disappeard   they looking back c  the scene   which our first parents are surprized with upon their looking back on paradise wonderfully strikes the readers imagination as nothing can be more natural than the tears they shed on that occasion    they looking back all th eastern side beheld   of paradise so late their happy seat   wavd over by that flaming brand the gate   with dreadful faces throngd and fiery arms   some natural tears they dropped but wiped them soon   the world was all before them where to chuse   their place of rest and providence their guide  if i might presume to offer at the smallest alteration in this divine work i should think the poem would end better with the passage here quoted than with the two verses which follow    they hand in hand with wandering steps and slow   through eden took their solitary way  these two verses though they have their beauty fall very much below the foregoing passage and renew in the mind of the reader that anguish which was pretty well laid by that consideration    the world was all before them where to chuse   their place of rest and providence their guide  the number of books in paradise lost is equal to those of the æneid our author in his first edition had divided his poem into ten books but afterwards broke the seventh and the eleventh each of them into two different books by the help of some small additions  this second division was made with great judgment as any one may see who will be at the pains of examining it it was not done for the sake of such a chimerical beauty as that of resembling virgil in this particular but for the more just and regular disposition of this great work  those who have read bossu and many of the criticks who have written since his time will not pardon me if i do not find out the particular moral which is inculcated in paradise lost  though i can by no means think with the last mentioned french author that an epick writer first of all pitches upon a certain moral as the groundwork and foundation of his poem and afterwards finds out a story to it  i am however of opinion that no just heroick poem ever was or can be made from whence one great moral may not be deduced that which reigns in milton is the most universal and most useful that can be imagined it is in short this that obedience to the will of god makes men happy and that disobedience makes them miserable  this is visibly the moral of the principal fable which turns upon adam and eve who continued in paradise while they kept the command that was given them and were driven out of it as soon as they had transgressed  this is likewise the moral of the principal episode which shews us how an innumerable multitude of angels fell from their state of bliss and were cast into hell upon their disobedience  besides this great moral which may be looked upon as the soul of the fable there are an infinity of undermorals which are to be drawn from the several parts of the poem and which makes this work more useful and instructive than any other poem in any language  those who have criticized on the odyssey the iliad and æneid have taken a great deal of pains to fix the number of months and days contained in the action of each of those poems if any one thinks it worth his while to examine this particular in milton he will find that from adams first appearance in the fourth book to his expulsion from paradise in the twelfth the author reckons ten days as for that part of the action which is described in the three first books as it does not pass within the regions of nature i have before observed that it is not subject to any calculations of time  i have now finished my observations on a work which does an honour to the english nation i have taken a general view of it under these four heads the fable the characters the sentiments and the language and made each of them the subject of a particular paper i have in the next place spoken of the censures which our author may incur under each of these heads which i have confined to two papers though i might have enlarged the number if i had been disposed to dwell on so ungrateful a subject i believe however that the severest reader will not find any little fault in heroick poetry which this author has fallen into that does not come under one of those heads among which i have distributed his several blemishes after having thus treated at large of paradise lost i could not think it sufficient to have celebrated this poem in the whole without descending to particulars i have therefore bestowed a paper upon each book and endeavoured not only to prove   that the poem is beautiful in general but to point out its particular beauties and to determine wherein they consist i have endeavoured to shew how some passages are beautiful by being sublime others by being soft others by being natural which of them are recommended by the passion which by the moral which by the sentiment and which by the expression i have likewise endeavoured to shew how the genius of the poet shines by a happy invention a distant allusion or a judicious imitation how he has copied or improved homer or virgil and raised his own imaginations by the use which he has made of several poetical passages in scripture i might have inserted also several passages of tasso which our author has   imitated but as i do not look upon tasso to be a sufficient voucher i would not perplex my reader with such quotations as might do more honour to the italian than the english poet in short i have endeavoured to particularize those innumerable kinds of beauty which it would be tedious to recapitulate but which are essential to poetry and which may be met with in the works of this great author had i thought at my first engaging in this design that it would have led me to so great a length i believe i should never have entered upon it but the kind reception which it has met with among those whose judgments i have a value for as well as the uncommon demands which my bookseller tells me have been made for these particular discourses give me no reason to repent of the pains i have been at in composing them  l    footnote

of my fair readers as well as very gay and wellreceived persons of the other sex are extremely perplexed at the latin sentences at the head of my speculations i do not know whether i ought not to indulge them with translations of each of them however i have today taken down from the top of the stage in drurylane a bit of latin which often stands in their view and signifies that the whole world acts the player it is certain that if we look all round us and behold the different employments of mankind you hardly see one who is not as the player is in an assumed character the lawyer who is vehement and loud in a cause wherein he knows he has not the truth of the question on his side is a player as to the personated part but incomparably meaner than he as to the prostitution of himself for hire because the pleaders falshood introduces injustice the player feigns for no other end but to divert or instruct you the divine whose passions transport him to say any thing with any view but promoting the interests of true piety and religion is a player with a still greater imputation of guilt in proportion to his depreciating a character more sacred consider all the different pursuits and employments of men and you will find half their actions tend to nothing else but disguise and imposture and all that is done which proceeds not from a mans very self is the action of a player for this reason it is that i make so frequent mention of the stage it is with me a matter of the highest consideration what parts are well or ill performed what passions or sentiments are indulged or cultivated and consequently what manners and customs are transfused from the stage to the world which reciprocally imitate each other as the writers of epick poems introduce shadowy persons and represent vices and virtues under the characters of men and women so i who am a spectator in the world may perhaps sometimes make use of the names of the actors on the stage to represent or admonish those who transact affairs in the world when i am commending wilks for representing the tenderness of a husband and a father in mackbeth the contrition of a reformed prodigal in harry the fourth the

may see him do this evening    as it is certain that a stage ought to be wholly suppressed or judiciously encouraged while there is one in the nation men turned for regular pleasure cannot employ their thoughts more usefully for the diversion of mankind than by convincing them that it is in themselves to raise this entertainment to the greatest height it would be a great improvement as well as embellishment to the theatre if dancing were more regarded and taught to all the actors one who has the advantage of such an agreeable girlish person as mrs bicknell joined with her capacity of

laudas quod se sapientibus unus   ridebat    juv    i shall communicate to my reader the following letter for the entertainment of this day     sir    you know very well that our nation is more famous for that sort of men   who are called whims and humourists than any other country in the   world for which reason it is observed that our english comedy excells   that of all other nations in the novelty and variety of its   characters    among those innumerable setts of whims which our country produces   there are none whom i have regarded with more curiosity than those who   have invented any particular kind of diversion for the entertainment   of themselves or their friends my letter shall single out those who   take delight in sorting a company that has something of burlesque and   ridicule in its appearance i shall make my self understood by the   following example one of the wits of the last age who was a man of a   good estate   thought he never laid out his money better than in a   jest as he was one year at the bath observing that in the great   confluence of fine people there were several among them with long   chins a part of the visage by which he himself was very much   distinguished he invited to dinner half a score of these remarkable   persons who had their mouths in the middle of their faces they had no   sooner placed themselves about the table but they began to stare upon   one another not being able to imagine what had brought them together   our english proverb says      tis merry in the hall     when beards wag all    it proved so in the assembly i am now speaking of who seeing so many   peaks of faces agitated with eating drinking and discourse and   observing all the chins that were present meeting together very often   over the center of the table every one grew sensible of the jest and   came into it with so much goodhumour that they lived in strict   friendship and alliance from that day forward    the same gentleman some time after packed together a set of oglers as   he called them consisting of such as had an unlucky cast in their   eyes his diversion on this occasion was to see the cross bows   mistaken signs and wrong connivances that passed amidst so many   broken and refracted rays of sight    the third feast which this merry gentleman exhibited was to the   stammerers whom he got together in a sufficient body to fill his   table he had ordered one of his servants who was placed behind a   skreen to write down their tabletalk which was very easie to be   done without the help of shorthand it appears by the notes which   were taken that tho their conversation never fell there were not   above twenty words spoken during the first course that upon serving   up the second one of the company was a quarter of an hour in telling   them that the ducklins and asparagus   were very good and that   another took up the same time in declaring himself of the same   opinion this jest did not however go off so well as the former for   one of the guests being a brave man and fuller of resentment than he   knew how to express went out of the room and sent the facetious   inviter a challenge in writing which though it was afterwards droppd   by the interposition of friends put a stop to these ludicrous   entertainments    now sir i dare say you will agree with me that as there is no moral   in these jests they ought to be discouraged and looked upon rather   as pieces of unluckiness than wit however as it is natural for one   man to refine upon the thought of another and impossible for any   single person how great soever his parts may be to invent an art   and bring it to its utmost perfection i shall here give you an   account of an honest gentleman of my acquaintance who upon hearing the   character of the wit above mentioned has himself assumed it and   endeavoured to convert it to the benefit of mankind he invited half a   dozen of his friends one day to dinner who were each of them famous   for inserting several redundant phrases in their discourse as dy   hear me dye see that is and so sir each of the guests making   frequent use of his particular elegance appeared so ridiculous to his   neighbour that he could not but reflect upon himself as appearing   equally ridiculous to the rest of the company by this means before   they had sat long together every one talking with the greatest   circumspection and carefully avoiding his favourite expletive the   conversation was cleared of its redundancies and had a greater   quantity of sense tho less of sound in it    the same wellmeaning gentleman took occasion at another time to   bring together such of his friends as were addicted to a foolish   habitual custom of swearing in order to shew the absurdity of the   practice he had recourse to the invention above mentioned having   placed an amanuensis in a private part of the room after the second   bottle when men open their minds without reserve my honest friend   began to take notice of the many sonorous but unnecessary words that   had passed in his house since their sitting down at table and how   much good conversation they had lost by giving way to such superfluous   phrases what a tax says he would they have raised for the poor had   we put the laws in execution upon one another every one of them took   this gentle reproof in good part upon which he told them that   knowing their conversation would have no secrets in it he had ordered   it to be taken down in writing and for the humour sake would read it   to them if they pleased there were ten sheets of it which might   have been reduced to two had there not been those abominable   interpolations i have before mentioned upon the reading of it in cold   blood it looked rather like a conference of fiends than of men in   short every one trembled at himself upon hearing calmly what he had   pronounced amidst the heat and inadvertency of discourse    i shall only mention another occasion wherein he made use of the same   invention to cure a different kind of men who are the pests of all   polite conversation and murder time as much as either of the two   former though they do it more innocently i mean that dull generation   of storytellers my friend got together about half a dozen of his   acquaintance who were infected with this strange malady the first   day one of them sitting down entered upon the siege of namur which   lasted till four aclock their time of parting the second day a   northbritain took possession of the discourse which it was   impossible to get out of his hands so long as the company staid   together the third day was engrossed after the same manner by a story   of the same length they at last began to reflect upon this barbarous   way of treating one another and by this means awakened out of that   lethargy with which each of them had been seized for several years    as you have somewhere declared that extraordinary and uncommon   characters of mankind are the game which you delight in and as i look   upon you to be the greatest sportsman or if you please the nimrod   among this species of writers i thought this discovery would not be

assemble at a   puppetshow on the other side of the garden i had at the same time a   very great disesteem for mr powell and his little thoughtless   commonwealth as if they had enticed the gentry into those wandrings   but let that be as it will i now am convinced of the honest   intentions of the said mr powell and company and send this to   acquaint you that he has given all the profits which shall arise   tomorrow night by his play to the use of the poor charitychildren of   this parish i have been informed sir that in holland all persons   who set up any show or act any stageplay be the actors either of   wood and wire or flesh and blood are obliged to pay out of their   gain such a proportion to the honest and industrious poor in the   neighbourhood by this means they make diversion and pleasure pay a   tax to labour and industry i have been told also that all the time   of lent in roman catholick countries the persons of condition   administred to the necessities of the poor and attended the beds of   lazars and diseased persons our protestant ladies and gentlemen are   so much to seek for proper ways of passing time that they are obliged   to punchinello for knowing what to do with themselves since the case   is so i desire only you would intreat our people of quality who are   not to be interrupted in their pleasure to think of the practice of   any moral duty that they would at least fine for their sins and give   something to these poor children a little out of their luxury and   superfluity would attone in some measure for the wanton use of the   rest of their fortunes it would not methinks be amiss if the   ladies who haunt the cloysters and passages of the playhouse were   upon every offence obliged to pay to this excellent institution of   schools of charity this method would make offenders themselves do   service to the publick but in the mean time i desire you would   publish this voluntary reparation which mr powell does our parish   for the noise he has made in it by the constant rattling of coaches   drums trumpets triumphs and battels the destruction of troy   adorned with highland dances are to make up the entertainment of all   who are so well disposed as not to forbear a light entertainment for   no other reason but that it is to do a good action   i am sir   your most humble servant   ralph bellfry    i am credibly informed that all the insinuations which a certain   writer made against mr powell at the bath are false and groundless      mr spectator    my employment which is that of a broker leading me often into   taverns about the exchange has given me occasion to observe a certain   enormity which i shall here submit to your animadversion in three or   four of these taverns i have at different times taken notice of a   precise set of people with grave countenances short wiggs black   cloaths or dark camlet trimmd with black and mourning gloves and   hatbands who meet on certain days at each tavern successively and   keep a sort of moving club having often met with their faces and   observed a certain slinking way in their dropping in one after   another i had the curiosity to enquire into their characters being   the rather moved to it by their agreeing in the singularity of their   dress and i find upon due examination they are a knot of   parishclarks who have taken a fancy to one another and perhaps   settle the bills of mortality over their halfpints i have so great a   value and veneration for any who have but even an assenting amen in   the service of religion that i am afraid lest these persons should   incur some scandal by this practice and would therefore have them   without raillery advised to send the florence and pullets home to   their own houses and not pretend to live as well as the overseers of   the poor   i am sir   your most humble servant   humphry transfer     may      mr spectator    i was last wednesday night at a tavern in the city among a set of men   who call themselves the lawyers club you must know sir this club   consists only of attorneys and at this meeting every one proposes the   cause he has then in hand to the board upon which each member gives   his judgment according to the experience he has met with if it   happens that any one puts a case of which they have had no precedent   it is noted down by their clerk will goosequill who registers all   their proceedings that one of them may go the next day with it to a   counsel this indeed is commendable and ought to be the principal end   of their meeting but had you been there to have heard them relate   their methods of managing a cause their manner of drawing out their   bills and in short their arguments upon the several ways of abusing   their clients with the applause that is given to him who has done it   most artfully you would before now have given your remarks on them   they are so conscious that their discourses ought to be kept secret   that they are very cautious of admitting any person who is not of   their profession when any who are not of the law are let in the   person who introduces him says he is a very honest gentleman and he   is taken in as their cant is to pay costs i am admitted upon the   recommendation of one of their principals as a very honest   goodnatured fellow that will never be in a plot and only desires to   drink his bottle and smoke his pipe you have formerly remarked upon   several sorts of clubs and as the tendency of this is only to   increase fraud and deceit i hope you will please to take notice of it   i am with respect   your humble servant   h r   t                                               no                  thursday may                          budgell      fallit enim vitium specie virtutis et umbra    juv      mr locke in his treatise of human understanding has spent two chapters upon the abuse of words   the first and most palpable abuse of words he says is when they are used without clear and distinct ideas the second when we are so inconstant and unsteady in the application of them that we sometimes use them to signify one idea sometimes another he adds that the result of our contemplations and reasonings while we have no precise ideas fixed to our words must needs be very confused and absurd to avoid this inconvenience more especially in moral discourses where the same word should constantly be used in the same sense he earnestly recommends the use of definitions a definition says he is the only way whereby the precise meaning of moral words can be known he therefore accuses those of great negligence who discourse of moral things with the least obscurity in the terms they make use of since upon the forementioned ground he does not scruple to say that he thinks morality is capable of demonstration as well as the mathematicks  i know no two words that have been more abused by the different and wrong interpretations which are put upon them than those two modesty and assurance to say such an one is a modest man sometimes indeed passes for a good character but at present is very often used to signify a sheepish awkard fellow who has neither goodbreeding politeness nor any knowledge of the world  again a man of assurance tho at first it only denoted a person of a free and open carriage is now very usually applied to a profligate wretch who can break through all the rules of decency and morality without a blush  i shall endeavour therefore in this essay to restore these words to their true meaning to prevent the idea of modesty from being confounded with that of sheepishness and to hinder impudence from passing for assurance  if i was put to define modesty i would call it the reflection of an ingenuous mind either when a man has committed an action for which he censures himself or fancies that he is exposed to the censure of others  for this reason a man truly modest is as much so when he is alone as in company and as subject to a blush in his closet as when the eyes of multitudes are upon him  i do not remember to have met with any instance of modesty with which i am so well pleased as that celebrated one of the young prince whose father being a tributary king to the romans had several complaints laid against him before the senate as a tyrant and oppressor of his subjects the prince went to rome to defend his father but coming into the senate and hearing a multitude of crimes proved upon him was so oppressed when it came to his turn to speak that he was unable to utter a word the story tells us that the fathers were more moved at this instance of modesty and ingenuity than they could have been by the most pathetick oration and in short pardoned the guilty father for this early promise of virtue in the son  i take assurance to be the faculty of possessing a mans self or of saying and doing indifferent things without any uneasiness or emotion in the mind that which generally gives a man assurance is a moderate knowledge of the world but above all a mind fixed and determined in it self to do nothing against the rules of honour and decency an open and assured behaviour is the natural consequence of such a resolution a man thus armed if his words or actions are at any time misinterpreted retires within himself and from the consciousness of his own integrity assumes force enough to despise the little censures of ignorance or malice  every one ought to cherish and encourage in himself the modesty and assurance i have here mentioned  a man without assurance is liable to be made uneasy by the folly or illnature of every one he converses with a man without modesty is lost to all sense of honour and virtue  it is more than probable that the prince abovementioned possessed both these qualifications in a very eminent degree without assurance he would never have undertaken to speak before the most august assembly in the world without modesty he would have pleaded the cause he had taken upon him tho it had appeared ever so scandalous  from what has been said it is plain that modesty and assurance are both amiable and may very well meet in the same person when they are thus mixed and blended together they compose what we endeavour to express when we say a modest assurance by which we understand the just mean between bashfulness and impudence  i shall conclude with observing that as the same man may be both modest and assured so it is also possible for the same person to be both impudent and bashful  we have frequent instances of this odd kind of mixture in people of depraved minds and mean education who tho they are not able to meet a mans eyes or pronounce a sentence without confusion can voluntarily commit the greatest villanies or most indecent actions  such a person seems to have made a resolution to do ill even in spite of himself and in defiance of all those checks and restraints his temper and complection seem to have laid in his way  upon the whole i would endeavour to establish this maxim that the practice of virtue is the most proper method to give a man a becoming assurance in his words and actions guilt always seeks to shelter it self in one of the extreams and is sometimes attended with both  x    footnote      strabonem   appellat pætumm pater et pullum male parvus   si cui filius est ut abortivus fuit olim   sisyphus

superesset agendum    luc    there is a fault which tho common wants a name it is the very contrary to procrastination as we lose the present hour by delaying from day to day to execute what we ought to do immediately so most of us take occasion to sit still and throw away the time in our possession by retrospect on what is past imagining we have already acquitted our selves and established our characters in the sight of mankind but when we thus put a value upon our selves for what we have already done any further than to explain our selves in order to assist our future conduct that will give us an overweening opinion of our merit to the prejudice of our present industry the great rule methinks should be to manage the instant in which we stand with fortitude equanimity and moderation according to mens respective circumstances if our past actions reproach us they cannot be attoned for by our own severe reflections so effectually as by a contrary behaviour if they are praiseworthy the memory of them is of no use but to act suitably to them thus a good present behaviour is an implicit repentance for any miscarriage in what is past but present slackness will not make up for past activity time has swallowed up all that we contemporaries did yesterday as irrevocably as it has the actions of the antediluvians but we are again awake and what shall we do today today which passes while we are yet speaking shall we remember the folly of last night or resolve upon the exercise of virtue tomorrow last night is certainly gone and tomorrow may never arrive this instant make use of can you oblige any man of honour and virtue do it immediately can you visit a sick friend will it revive him to see you enter and suspend your own ease and pleasure to comfort his weakness and hear the impertinencies of a wretch in pain dont stay to take coach but be gone your mistress will bring sorrow and your bottle madness go to neithersuch virtues and diversions as these are mentioned because they occur to all men but every man is sufficiently convinced that to suspend the use of the present moment and resolve better for the future only is an unpardonable folly what i attempted to consider was the mischief of setting such a value upon what is past as to think we have done enough let a man have filled all the offices of life with the highest dignity till yesterday and begin to live only to himself today he must expect he will in the effects upon his reputation be considered as the man who died yesterday the man who distinguishes himself from the rest stands in a press of people those before him intercept his progress and those behind him if he does not urge on will tread him down cæsar of whom it was said that he thought nothing done while there was anything left for him to do went on in performing the greatest exploits without assuming to himself a privilege of taking rest upon the foundation of the merit of his former actions it was the manner of that glorious captain to write down what scenes he passed through but it was rather to keep his affairs in method and capable of a clear review in case they should be examined by others than that he built a renown upon any thing which was past i shall produce two fragments of his to demonstrate that it was his rule of life to support himself rather by what he should perform than what he had done already in the tablet which he wore about him the same year in which he obtained the battel of pharsalia there were found these loose notes for his own conduct it is supposed by the circumstances they alluded to that they might be set down the evening of the same night     my part is now but begun and my glory must be sustained by the use i   make of this victory otherwise my loss will be greater than that of   pompey our personal reputation will rise or fall as we bear our   respective fortunes all my private enemies among the prisoners shall   be spared i will forget this in order to obtain such another day   trebutius is ashamed to see me i will go to his tent and be   reconciled in private give all the men of honour who take part with   me the terms i offered before the battel let them owe this to their   friends who have been long in my interests power is weakened by the   full use of it but extended by moderation galbinius is proud and   will be servile in his present fortune let him wait send for   stertinius he is modest and his virtue is worth gaining i have   cooled my heart with reflection and am fit to rejoice with the army   tomorrow he is a popular general who can expose himself like a   private man during a battel but he is more popular who can rejoice   but like a private man after a victory  what is particularly proper for the example of all who pretend to industry in the pursuit of honour and virtue is that this hero was more than ordinarily sollicitous about his reputation when a common mind would have thought it self in security and given it self a loose to joy and triumph but though this is a very great instance of his temper i must confess i am more taken with his reflections when he retired to his closet in some disturbance upon the repeated ill omens of calphurnias dream the night before his death the literal translation of that fragment shall conclude this paper    be it so then   if i am to die tomorrow that is what i am to do   tomorrow it will

with misfortunes and rising above them is an object on which the gods themselves may look down with delight   i shall therefore set before my reader a scene of this kind of distress in private life for the speculation of this day  an eminent citizen who had lived in good fashion and credit was by a train of accidents and by an unavoidable perplexity in his affairs reduced to a low condition there is a modesty usually attending faultless poverty which made him rather chuse to reduce his manner of living to his present circumstances than sollicit his friends in order to support the shew of an estate when the substance was gone his wife who was a woman of sense and virtue behaved her self on this occasion with uncommon decency and never appeard so amiable in his eyes as now instead of upbraiding him with the ample fortune she had brought or the many great offers she had refused for his sake she redoubled all the instances of her affection while her husband was continually pouring out his heart to her in complaints that he had ruined the best woman in the world he sometimes came home at a time when she did not expect him and surprizd her in tears which she endeavourd to conceal and always put on an air of chearfulness to receive him to lessen their expence their eldest daughter whom i shall call amanda was sent into the country to the house of an honest farmer who had married a servant of the family this young woman was apprehensive of the ruin which was approaching and had privately engaged a friend in the neighbourhood to give her an account of what passed from time to time in her fathers affairs amanda was in the bloom of her youth and beauty when the lord of the manor who often called in at the farmers house as he followd his country sports fell passionately in love with her he was a man of great generosity but from a loose education had contracted a hearty aversion to marriage he therefore entertained a design upon amandas virtue which at present he thought fit to keep private the innocent creature who never suspected his intentions was pleased with his person and having observed his growing passion for her hoped by so advantageous a match she might quickly be in a capacity of supporting her impoverishd relations one day as he called to see her he found her in tears over a letter she had just receivd from her friend which gave an account that her father had lately been stripped of every thing by an execution the lover who with some difficulty found out the cause of her grief took this occasion to make her a proposal it is impossible to express amandas confusion when she found his pretensions were not honourable she was now deserted of all her hopes and had no power to speak but rushing from him in the utmost disturbance locked her self up in her chamber he immediately dispatched a messenger to her father with the following letter     sir     i have heard of your misfortune and have offerd your daughter if    she will live with me to settle on her four hundred pounds a year    and to lay down the sum for which you are now distressed i will be    so ingenuous as to tell you that i do not intend marriage but if you    are wise you will use your authority with her not to be too nice    when she has an opportunity of saving you and your family and of    making her self happy    i am c  this letter came to the hands of amandas mother she opend and read it with great surprize and concern she did not think it proper to explain her self to the messenger but desiring him to call again the next morning she wrote to her daughter as follows    dearest child    your father and i have just now receivd a letter from a gentleman who   pretends love to you with a proposal that insults our misfortunes   and would throw us to a lower degree of misery than any thing which is   come upon us how could this barbarous man think that the tenderest   of parents would be tempted to supply their wants by giving up the   best of children to infamy and ruin it is a mean and cruel artifice   to make this proposal at a time when he thinks our necessities must   compel us to any thing but we will not eat the bread of shame and   therefore we charge thee not to think of us but to avoid the snare   which is laid for thy virtue beware of pitying us it is not so bad   as you have perhaps been told all things will yet be well and i   shall write my child better news    i have been interrupted i know not how i was moved to say things   would mend as i was going on i was startled by a noise of one that   knocked at the door and hath brought us an unexpected supply of a   debt which had long been owing oh i will now tell thee all it is   some days i have lived almost without support having conveyd what   little money i could raise to your poor fatherthou wilt weep to   think where he is yet be assured he will be soon at liberty that   cruel letter would have broke his heart but i have concealed it from   him i have no companion at present besides little fanny who stands   watching my looks as i write and is crying for her sister she says   she is sure you are not well having discoverd that my present   trouble is about you but do not think i would thus repeat my sorrows   to grieve thee no it is to intreat thee not to make them   insupportable by adding what would be worse than all let us bear   chearfully an affliction which we have not brought on our selves and   remember there is a power who can better deliver us out of it than by   the loss of thy innocence heaven preserve my dear child    affectionate mother   the messenger notwithstanding he promised to deliver this letter to amanda carryd it first to his master who he imagined would be glad to have an opportunity of giving it into her hands himself his master was impatient to know the success of his proposal and therefore broke open the letter privately to see the contents he was not a little moved at so true a picture of virtue in distress but at the same time was infinitely surprized to find his offers rejected however he resolved not to suppress the letter but carefully sealed it up again and carried it to amanda all his endeavours to see her were in vain till she was assured he brought a letter from her mother he would not part with it but upon condition that she should read it without leaving the room while she was perusing it he fixed his eyes on her face with the deepest attention her concern gave a new softness to her beauty and when she burst into tears he could no longer refrain from bearing a part of her sorrow and telling her that he too had read the letter and was resolvd to make reparation for having been the occasion of it my reader will not be displeased to see this second epistle which he now wrote to amandas mother     madam    i am full of shame and will never forgive my self if i have not your   pardon for what i lately wrote it was far from my intention to add   trouble to the afflicted nor could any thing but my being a stranger   to you have betrayd me into a fault for which if i live i shall   endeavour to make you amends as a son you cannot be unhappy while   amanda is your daughter nor shall be if any thing can prevent it   which is in the power of madam    your most obedient   humble servant   this letter he sent by his steward and soon after went up to town himself to compleat the generous act he had now resolved on by his friendship and assistance amandas father was quickly in a condition of retrieving his perplexd affairs to conclude he marryd amanda and enjoyd the double satisfaction of having restored a worthy family to their former prosperity and of making himself happy by an alliance to their virtues    footnote   see note on p     footnote

that the officer you some time ago appointed as   inspector of signs has not done his duty so well as to give you an   account of very many strange occurrences in the publick streets which   are worthy of but have escaped your notice among all the oddnesses   which i have ever met with that which i am now telling you of gave me   most delight you must have observed that all the criers in the street   attract the attention of the passengers and of the inhabitants in the   several parts by something very particular in their tone it self in   the dwelling upon a note or else making themselves wholly   unintelligible by a scream the person i am so delighted with has   nothing to sell but very gravely receives the bounty of the people   for no other merit but the homage they pay to his manner of signifying   to them that he wants a subsidy you must sure have heard speak of   an old man who walks about the city and that part of the suburbs   which lies beyond the tower performing the office of a daywatchman   followed by a goose which bears the bob of his ditty and confirms   what he says with a quack quack i gave little heed to the mention of   this known circumstance till being the other day in those quarters   i passed by a decrepit old fellow with a pole in his hand who just   then was bawling out half an hour after one aclock and immediately   a dirty goose behind him made her response quack quack i could not   forbear attending this grave procession for the length of half a   street with no small amazement to find the whole place so familiarly   acquainted with a melancholy midnight voice at noonday giving them   the hour and exhorting them of the departure of time with a bounce   at their doors while i was full of this novelty i went into a   friends house and told him how i was diverted with their whimsical   monitor and his equipage my friend gave me the history and   interrupted my commendation of the man by telling me the livelihood   of these two animals is purchased rather by the good parts of the   goose than of the leader for it seems the peripatetick who walked   before her was a watchman in that neighbourhood and the goose of her   self by frequent hearing his tone out of her natural vigilance not   only observed but answerd it very regularly from time to time the   watchman was so affected with it that he bought her and has taken   her in partner only altering their hours of duty from night to day   the town has come into it and they live very comfortably this is the   matter of fact now i desire you who are a profound philosopher to   consider this alliance of instinct and reason your speculation may   turn very naturally upon the force the superior part of mankind may   have upon the spirits of such as like this watchman may be very near   the standard of geese and you may add to this practical observation   how in all ages and times the world has been carryd away by odd   unaccountable things which one would think would pass upon no   creature which had reason and under the symbol of this goose you   may enter into the manner and method of leading creatures with their   eyes open thro thick and thin for they know not what they know not   why    all which is humbly submitted to your spectatorial wisdom by   sir   your most humble servant   michael gander      mr spectator    i have for several years had under my care the government and   education of young ladies which trust i have endeavourd to discharge   with due regard to their several capacities and fortunes i have left   nothing undone to imprint in every one of them an humble courteous   mind accompanied with a graceful becoming mein and have made them   pretty much acquainted with the houshold part of familyaffairs but   still i find there is something very much wanting in the air of my   ladies different from what i observe in those that are esteemed your   fine bred women now sir i must own to you i never suffered my   girls to learn to dance but since i have read your discourse of   dancing where you have described the beauty and spirit there is in   regular motion i own my self your convert and resolve for the future   to give my young ladies that accomplishment but upon imparting my   design to their parents i have been made very uneasy for some time   because several of them have declared that if i did not make use of   the master they recommended they would take away their children   there was colonel jumpers lady a colonel of the trainbands that   has a great interest in her parish she recommends mr trott for the   prettiest master in town that no man teaches a  jigg like him that   she has seen him rise six or seven capers together with the greatest   ease imaginable and that his scholars twist themselves more ways than   the scholars of any master in town besides there is madam prim an   aldermans lady recommends a master of her own name but she declares   he is not of their family yet a very extraordinary man in his way   for besides a very soft air he has in dancing he gives them a   particular behaviour at a teatable and in presenting their   snuffbox to twirl flip or flirt a fan and how to place patches to   the best advantage either for fat or lean long or oval faces for my   lady says there is more in these things than the world imagines but i   must confess the major part of those i am concernd with leave it to   me i desire therefore according to the inclosed direction you would   send your correspondent who has writ to you on that subject to my   house if proper application this way can give innocence new charms   and make virtue legible in the countenance i shall spare no charge to   make my scholars in their very features and limbs bear witness how   careful i have been in the other parts of their education    i am sir   your most humble servant   rachael watchful  t

the most ignorant and barbarous a thousand imaginary distresses and poetical complaints it makes a footman talk like oroondates and converts a brutal rustick into a gentle swain the most ordinary plebeian or mechanick in love bleeds and pines away with a certain elegance and tenderness of sentiments which this passion naturally inspires  these inward languishings of a mind infected with this softness have given birth to a phrase which is made use of by all the melting tribe from the highest to the lowest i mean that of dying for love  romances which owe their very being to this passion are full of these metaphorical deaths heroes and heroines knights squires and damsels are all of them in a dying condition there is the same kind of mortality in our modern tragedies where every one gasps faints bleeds and dies many of the poets to describe the execution which is done by this passion represent the fair sex as basilisks that destroy with their eyes but i think mr cowley has with greater justness of thought compared a beautiful woman to a porcupine that sends an arrow from every part    i have often thought that there is no way so effectual for the cure of this general infirmity as a mans reflecting upon the motives that produce it when the passion proceeds from the sense of any virtue or perfection in the person beloved i would by no means discourage it but if a man considers that all his heavy complaints of wounds and deaths rise from some little affectations of coquetry which are improved into charms by his own fond imagination the very laying before himself the cause of his distemper may be sufficient to effect the cure of it  it is in this view that i have looked over the several bundles of letters which i have received from dying people and composed out of them the following bill of mortality which i shall lay before my reader without any further preface as hoping that it may be useful to him in discovering those several places where

pers    i have often wondered at that illnaturd position which has been sometimes maintained in the schools and is comprizd in an old latin verse namely that a mans knowledge is worth nothing if he communicates what he knows to any one besides   there is certainly no more sensible pleasure to a goodnaturd man than if he can by any means gratify or inform the mind of another i might add that this virtue naturally carries its own reward along with it since it is almost impossible it should be exercised without the improvement of the person who practices it the reading of books and the daily occurrences of life are continually furnishing us with matter for thought and reflection it is extremely natural for us to desire to see such our thoughts put into the dress of words without which indeed we can scarce have a clear and distinct idea of them our selves when they are thus clothed in expressions nothing so truly shews us whether they are just or false as those effects which they produce in the minds of others  i am apt to flatter my self that in the course of these my speculations i have treated of several subjects and laid down many such rules for the conduct of a mans life which my readers were either wholly ignorant of before or which at least those few who were acquainted with them looked upon as so many secrets they have found out for the conduct of themselves but were resolved never to have made publick  i am the more confirmed in this opinion from my having received several letters wherein i am censurd for having prostituted learning to the embraces of the vulgar and made her as one of my correspondents phrases it a common strumpet i am charged by another with laying open the arcana or secrets of prudence to the eyes of every reader  the narrow spirit which appears in the letters of these my correspondents is the less surprizing as it has shewn itself in all ages there is still extant an epistle written by alexander the great to his tutor aristotle upon that philosophers publishing some part of his writings in which the prince complains of his having made known to all the world those secrets in learning which he had before communicated to him in private lectures concluding that he had rather excel the rest of mankind in knowledge than in power    luisa de padilla a lady of great learning and countess of aranda was in like manner angry with the famous gratian   upon his publishing his treatise of the discrete wherein she fancied that he had laid open those maxims to common readers which ought only to have been reserved for the knowledge of the great  these objections are thought by many of so much weight that they often defend the abovementiond authors by affirming they have affected such an obscurity in their style and manner of writing that tho every one may read their works there will be but very few who can comprehend their meaning  persius the latin satirist affected obscurity for another reason with which however mr cowley is so offended that writing to one of his friends you says he tell me that you do not know whether persius be a good poet or no because you cannot understand him for which very reason i affirm that he is not so  however this art of writing unintelligibly has been very much improved and followd by several of the moderns who observing the general inclination of mankind to dive into a secret and the reputation many have acquired by concealing their meaning under obscure terms and phrases resolve that they may be still more abstruse to write without any meaning at all this art as it is at present practised by many eminent authors consists in throwing so many words at a venture into different periods and leaving the curious reader to find out the meaning of them  the egyptians who made

should much rather be compared to an ordinary lamp which consumes and wastes it self for the benefit of every passenger  i shall conclude this paper with the story of rosicruciuss sepulchre i suppose i need not inform my readers that this man was the founder of the rosicrusian sect and that his disciples still pretend to new discoveries which they are never to communicate to the rest of mankind    a certain person having occasion to dig somewhat deep in the ground where this philosopher lay interd met with a small door having a wall on each side of it his curiosity and the hopes of finding some hidden treasure soon prompted him to force open the door he was immediately surprizd by a sudden blaze of light and discoverd a very fair vault at the upper end of it was a statue of a man in armour sitting by a table and leaning on his left arm he held a truncheon in his right hand and had a lamp burning before him the man had no sooner set one foot within the vault than the statue erecting it self from its leaning posture stood bolt upright and upon the fellows advancing another step lifted up the truncheon in his right hand the man still venturd a third step when the statue with a furious blow broke the lamp into a thousand pieces and left his guest in a sudden darkness  upon the report of this adventure the country people soon came with lights to the sepulchre and discovered that the statue which was made of brass was nothing more than a piece of clockwork that the floor of the vault was all loose and underlaid with several springs which upon any mans entering naturally produced that which had happend  rosicrucius says his disciples made use of this method to shew the world that he had reinvented the everburning lamps of the ancients tho he was resolvd no one should reap any

   thursday may           sir    the character you have in the world of being the ladys philosopher   and the pretty advice i have seen you give to others in your papers   make me address my self to you in this abrupt manner and to desire   your opinion what in this age a woman may call a lover i have lately   had a gentleman that i thought made pretensions to me insomuch that   most of my friends took notice of it and thought we were really   married which i did not take much pains to undeceive them and   especially a young gentlewoman of my particular acquaintance which was   then in the country she coming to town and seeing our intimacy so   great she gave her self the liberty of taking me to task concerning   it i ingenuously told her we were not married but i did not know   what might the event she soon got acquainted with the gentleman and   was pleased to take upon her to examine him about it now whether a   new face had made a greater conquest than the old ill leave you to   judge but i am informd that he utterly denyd all pretensions to   courtship but withal professd a sincere friendship for me but   whether marriages are proposd by way of friendship or not is what i   desire to know and what i may really call a lover there are so many   who talk in a language fit only for that character and yet guard   themselves against speaking in direct terms to the point that it is   impossible to distinguish between courtship and conversation i hope   you will do me justice both upon my lover and my friend if they   provoke me further in the mean time i carry it with so equal a   behaviour that the nymph and the swain too are mighty at a loss each   believes i who know them both well think my self revenged in their   love to one another which creates an irreconcileable jealousy if all   comes right again you shall hear further from    sir   your most obedient servant   mirtilla     april            mr spectator    your observations on persons that have behaved themselves irreverently   at church i doubt not have had a good effect on some that have read   them but there is another fault which has hitherto escaped your   notice i mean of such persons as are very zealous and punctual to   perform an ejaculation that is only preparatory to the service of the   church and yet neglect to join in the service it self there is an   instance of this in a friend of will honeycombs who sits opposite   to me he seldom comes in till the prayers are about half over and   when he has enterd his seat instead of joining with the   congregation he devoutly holds his hat before his face for three or   four moments then bows to all his acquaintance sits down takes a   pinch of snuff if it be evening service perhaps a nap and spends   the remaining time in surveying the congregation now sir what i   would desire is that you will animadvert a little on this   gentlemans practice in my opinion this gentlemans devotion   capinhand is only a compliance to the custom of the place and goes   no further than a little ecclesiastical goodbreeding if you will not   pretend to tell us the motives that bring such triflers to solemn   assemblies yet let me desire that you will give this letter a place   in your paper and i shall remain    sir   your obliged humble servant   j s     may the  th    mr spectator    the conversation at a club of which i am a member last night falling   upon vanity and the desire of being admired put me in mind of   relating how agreeably i was entertained at my own door last thursday   by a clean freshcolourd girl under the most elegant and the best   furnished milkpail i had ever observed i was glad of such an   opportunity of seeing the behaviour of a coquet in low life and how   she received the extraordinary notice that was taken of her which i   found had affected every muscle of her face in the same manner as it   does the feature of a firstrate toast at a play or in an assembly   this hint of mine made the discourse turn upon the sense of pleasure   which ended in a general resolution that the milkmaid enjoys her   vanity as exquisitely as the woman of quality i think it would not be   an improper subject for you to examine this frailty and trace it to   all conditions of life which is recommended to you as an occasion of   obliging many of your readers among the rest    your most humble servant   t b     sir    coming last week into a coffeehouse not far from the exchange with my   basket under my arm a jew of considerable note as i am informed   takes half a dozen oranges of me and at the same time slides a guinea   into my hand i made him a curtsy and went my way he followd me   and finding i was going about my business he came up with me and   told me plainly that he gave me the guinea with no other intent but   to purchase my person for an hour did you so sir says i you gave   it me then to make me be wicked ill keep it to make me honest   however not to be in the least ungrateful i promise you ill lay it   out in a couple of rings and wear them for your sake i am so just   sir besides as to give every body that asks how i came by my rings   this

lætitiâ moriture deli    hor    i have always preferred chearfulness to mirth the latter i consider as an act the former as an habit of the mind mirth is short and transient chearfulness fixed and permanent those are often raised into the greatest transports of mirth who are subject to the greatest depressions of melancholy on the contrary chearfulness tho it does not give the mind such an exquisite gladness prevents us from falling into any depths of sorrow mirth is like a flash of lightning that breaks thro a gloom of clouds and glitters for a moment chearfulness keeps up a kind of daylight in the mind and fills it with a steady and perpetual serenity  men of austere principles look upon mirth as too wanton and dissolute for a state of probation and as filled with a certain triumph and insolence of heart that is inconsistent with a life which is every moment obnoxious to the greatest dangers writers of this complexion have observed that the sacred person who was the great pattern of perfection was never seen to laugh  chearfulness of mind is not liable to any of these exceptions it is of a serious and composed nature it does not throw the mind into a condition improper for the present state of humanity and is very conspicuous in the characters of those who are looked upon as the greatest philosophers among the heathens as well as among those who have been deservedly esteemed as saints and holy men among christians  if we consider chearfulness in three lights with regard to our selves to those we converse with and to the great author of our being it will not a little recommend it self on each of these accounts the man who is possessed of this excellent frame of mind is not only easy in his thoughts but a perfect master of all the powers and faculties of his soul his imagination is always clear and his judgment undisturbed his temper is even and unruffled whether in action or in solitude he comes with a relish to all those goods which nature has provided for him tastes all the pleasures of the creation which are poured about him and does not feel the full weight of those accidental evils which may befal him  if we consider him in relation to the persons whom he converses with it naturally produces love and goodwill towards him a chearful mind is not only disposed to be affable and obliging but raises the same good humour in those who come within its influence a man finds himself pleased he does not know why with the chearfulness of his companion it is like a sudden sunshine that awakens a secret delight in the mind without her attending to it the heart rejoices of its own accord and naturally flows out into friendship and benevolence towards the person who has so kindly an effect upon it  when i consider this chearful state of mind in its third relation i cannot but look upon it as a constant habitual gratitude to the great author of nature an inward chearfulness is an implicit praise and thanksgiving to providence under all its dispensations it is a kind of acquiescence in the state wherein we are placed and a secret approbation of the divine will in his conduct towards man  there are but two things which in my opinion can reasonably deprive us of this chearfulness of heart the first of these is the sense of guilt a man who lives in a state of vice and impenitence can have no title to that evenness and tranquillity of mind which is the health of the soul and the natural effect of virtue and innocence chearfulness in an ill man deserves a harder name than language can furnish us with and is many degrees beyond what we commonly call folly or madness  atheism by which i mean a disbelief of a supreme being and consequently of a future state under whatsoever titles it shelters it self may likewise very reasonably deprive a man of this chearfulness of temper there is something so particularly gloomy and offensive to human nature in the prospect of nonexistence that i cannot but wonder with many excellent writers how it is possible for a man to outlive the expectation of it for my own part i think the being of a god is so little to be doubted that it is almost the only truth we are sure of and such a truth as we meet with in every object in every occurrence and in every thought if we look into the characters of this tribe of infidels we generally find they are made up of pride spleen and cavil it is indeed no wonder that men who are uneasy to themselves should be so to the rest of the world and how is it possible for a man to be otherwise than uneasy in himself who is in danger every moment of losing his entire existence and dropping into nothing  the vicious man and atheist have therefore no pretence to chearfulness and would act very unreasonably should they endeavour after it it is impossible for any one to live in goodhumour and enjoy his present existence who is apprehensive either of torment or of annihilation of being miserable or of not being at all  after having mentiond these two great principles which are destructive of chearfulness in their own nature as well as in right reason i cannot think of any other that ought to banish this happy temper from a virtuous mind pain and sickness shame and reproach poverty and old age nay death it self considering the shortness of their duration and the advantage we may reap from them do not deserve the name of evils a good mind may bear up under them with fortitude with indolence and with chearfulness of heart the tossing of a tempest does not discompose him which he is sure will bring him to a joyful harbour  a man who uses his best endeavours to live according to the dictates of virtue and right reason has two perpetual sources of chearfulness in the consideration of his own nature and of that being on whom he has a dependance if he looks into himself he cannot but rejoice in that existence which is so lately bestowed upon him and which after millions of ages will be still new and still in its beginning how many  selfcongratulations naturally arise in the mind when it reflects on this its entrance into eternity when it takes a view of those improveable faculties which in a few years and even at its first setting out have made so considerable a progress and which will be still receiving an increase of perfection and consequently an increase of happiness the consciousness of such a being spreads a perpetual diffusion of joy through the soul of a virtuous man and makes him look upon himself every moment as more happy than he knows how to conceive  the second source of chearfulness to a good mind is its consideration of that being on whom we have our dependance and in whom though we behold him as yet but in the first faint discoveries of his perfections we see every thing that we can imagine as great glorious or amiable we find our selves every where upheld by his goodness and surrounded with an immensity of love and mercy in short we depend upon a being whose power qualifies him to make us happy by an infinity of means whose goodness and truth engage him to make those happy who desire it of him and whose unchangeableness will secure us in this happiness to all eternity  such considerations which every one should perpetually cherish in his thoughts will banish from us all that secret heaviness of heart which unthinking men are subject to when they lie under no real affliction all that anguish which we may feel from any evil that actually oppresses us to which i may likewise add those little cracklings of mirth and folly that are apter to betray virtue than support it and establish in us such an even and chearful temper as makes us pleasing to our selves to those with whom we converse and to him whom we were made to please  i                                               no                      monday may                         steele      habes confitentem reum    tull    i ought not to have neglected a request of one of my correspondents so long as i have but i dare say i have given him time to add practice to profession he sent me some time ago a bottle or two of excellent wine to drink the health of a gentleman who had by the pennypost advertised him of an egregious error in his conduct my correspondent received the obligation from an unknown hand with the candour which is natural to an ingenuous mind and promises a contrary behaviour in that point for the future he will offend his monitor with no more errors of that kind but thanks him for his benevolence this frank carriage makes me reflect upon the amiable atonement a man makes in an ingenuous acknowledgment of a fault all such miscarriages as flow from inadvertency are more than repaid by it for reason though not concerned in the injury employs all its force in the atonement he that says he did not design to disoblige you in such an action does as much as if he should tell you that tho the circumstance which displeased was never in his thoughts he has that respect for you that he is unsatisfied till it is wholly out of yours it must be confessed that when an acknowledgment of offence is made out of poorness of spirit and not conviction of heart the circumstance is quite different but in the case of my correspondent where both the notice is taken and the return made in private the affair begins and ends with the highest grace on each side to make the acknowledgment of a fault in the highest manner graceful it is lucky when the circumstances of the offender place him above any ill consequences from the resentment of the person offended a dauphin of france upon a review of the army and a command of the king to alter the posture of it by a march of one of the wings gave an improper order to an officer at the head of a brigade who told his highness he presumed he had not received the last orders which were to move a contrary way the prince instead of taking the admonition which was delivered in a manner that accounted for his error with safety to his understanding shaked a cane at the officer and with the return of opprobrious language persisted in his own orders the whole matter came necessarily before the king who commanded his son on foot to lay his right hand on the gentlemans stirrup as he sat on horseback in sight of the whole army and ask his pardon when the prince touched his stirrup and was going to speak the officer with an incredible agility threw himself on the earth and kissed his feet  the body is very little concerned in the pleasures or sufferings of souls truly great and the reparation when an honour was designed this soldier appeared as much too great to be borne by his gratitude as the injury was intolerable to his resentment  when we turn our thoughts from these extraordinary occurrences in common life we see an ingenuous kind of behaviour not only make up for faults committed but in a manner expiate them in the very commission thus many things wherein a man has pressed too far he implicitly excuses by owning this is a trespass youll pardon my confidence i am sensible i have no pretension to this favour and the like but commend me to those gay fellows about town who are directly impudent and make up for it no otherwise than by calling themselves such and exulting in it but this sort of carriage which prompts a man against rules to urge what he has a mind to is pardonable only when you sue for another when you are confident in preference of your self to others of equal merit every man that loves virtue and modesty ought in defence of those qualities to oppose you but without considering the morality of the thing let us at this time behold only the natural consequence of candour when we speak of ourselves  the spectator writes often in an elegant often in an argumentative and often in a sublime style with equal success but how would it hurt the reputed author of that paper to own that of the most beautiful pieces under his title he is barely the publisher there is nothing but what a man really performs can be an honour to him what he takes more than he ought in the eye of the world he loses in the conviction of his own heart and a man must lose his consciousness that is his very self before he can rejoice in any falshood without inward mortification  who has not seen a very criminal at the bar when his counsel and friends have done all that they could for him in vain prevail upon the whole assembly to pity him and his judge to recommend his case to the mercy of the throne without offering any thing new in his defence but that he whom before we wished convicted became so out of his own mouth and took upon himself all the shame and sorrow we were just before preparing for him the great opposition to this kind of candour arises from the unjust idea people ordinarily have of what we call an high spirit it is far from greatness of spirit to persist in the wrong in any thing nor is it a diminution of greatness of spirit to have been in the wrong perfection is not the attribute of man therefore he is not degraded by the acknowledgment of an imperfection but it is the work of little minds to imitate the fortitude of great spirits on worthy occasions by obstinacy in the wrong this obstinacy prevails so far upon them that they make it extend to the defence of faults in their very servants it would swell this paper to too great a length should i insert all the quarrels and debates which are now on foot in this town where one party and in some cases both is sensible of being on the faulty side and have not spirit enough to acknowledge it among the ladies the case is very common for there are very few of them who know that it is to maintain a true and high spirit to throw away from it all which it self disapproves and to scorn so pitiful a shame as that which disables the heart from acquiring a liberality of affections and sentiments the candid mind by acknowledging and discarding its faults has reason and truth for the foundation of all its passions and desires and consequently is happy and simple the disingenuous spirit by indulgence of one unacknowledged error is intangled with an afterlife of guilt sorrow and perplexity  t                                               no                      tuesday may  0                     addison      criminibus debent hortos    hor    as i was sitting in my chamber and thinking on a subject for my next spectator i heard two or three irregular bounces at my landladys door and upon the opening of it a loud chearful voice enquiring whether the philosopher was at home the child who went to the door answered very innocently that he did not lodge there i immediately recollected that it was my good friend sir rogers voice and that i had promised to go with him on the water to springgarden in case it proved a good evening the knight put me in mind of my promise from the bottom of the staircase but told me that if i was speculating he would stay below till i had done upon my coming down i found all the children of the family got about my old friend and my landlady herself who is a notable prating gossip engaged in a conference with him being mightily pleased with his stroaking her little boy upon the head and bidding him be a good child and mind his book  we were no sooner come to the temple stairs but we were surrounded with a crowd of watermen offering us their respective services sir roger after having looked about him very attentively spied one with a woodenleg and immediately gave him orders to get his boat ready as we were walking towards it you must know says sir roger i never make use of any body to row me that has not either lost a leg or an arm i would rather bate him a few strokes of his oar than not employ an honest man that has been wounded in the queens service if i was a lord or a bishop and kept a barge i would not put a fellow in my livery that had not a woodenleg  my old friend after having seated himself and trimmed the boat with his coachman who being a very sober man always serves for ballast on these occasions we made the best of our way for foxhall sir roger obliged the waterman to give us the history of his right leg and hearing that he had left it at la hogue   with many particulars which passed in that glorious action the knight in the triumph of his heart made several reflections on the greatness of the british nation as that one englishman could beat three frenchmen that we could never be in danger of popery so long as we took care of our fleet that the thames was the noblest river in europe that london bridge was a greater piece of work than any of the seven wonders of the world with many other honest prejudices which naturally cleave to the heart of a true englishman  after some short pause the old knight turning about his head twice or thrice to take a survey of this great metropolis bid me observe how thick the city was set with churches and that there was scarce a single steeple on this side templebar a most heathenish sight says sir roger there is no religion at this end of the town the fifty new churches will very much mend the prospect but churchwork is slow churchwork is slow  i do not remember i have any where mentioned in sir rogers character his custom of saluting every body that passes by him with a goodmorrow or a goodnight this the old man does out of the overflowings of his humanity though at the same time it renders him so popular among all his country neighbours that it is thought to have gone a good way in making him once or twice knight of the shire he cannot forbear this exercise of benevolence even in town when he meets with any one in his morning or evening walk it broke from him to several boats that passed by us upon the water but to the knights great surprize as he gave the goodnight to two or three young fellows a little before our landing one of them instead of returning the civility asked us what queer old put we had in the boat and whether he was not ashamed to go a wenching at his years with a great deal of the like thamesribaldry sir roger seemd a little shocked at first but at length assuming a face of magistracy told us that if he were a middlesex justice he would make such vagrants know that her majestys subjects were no more to be abused by water than by land  we were now arrived at springgarden which is exquisitely pleasant at this time of year when i considered the fragrancy of the walks and bowers with the choirs of birds that sung upon the trees and the loose tribe of people that walked under their shades i could not but look upon the place as a kind of mahometan paradise sir roger told me it put him in mind of a little coppice by his house in the country which his chaplain used to call an aviary of nightingales you must understand says the knight there is nothing in the world that pleases a man in love so much as your nightingale ah mr spectator the many moonlight nights that i have walked by my self and thought on the widow by the musek of the nightingales he here fetched a deep sigh and was falling into a fit of musing when a masque who came behind him gave him a gentle tap upon the shoulder and asked him if he would drink a bottle of mead with her but the knight being startled at so unexpected a familiarity and displeased to be interrupted in his thoughts of the widow told her she was a wanton baggage and bid her go about her business  we concluded our walk with a glass of burtonale and a slice of hungbeef when we had done eating our selves the knight called a waiter to him and bid him carry the remainder to the waterman that had but one leg i perceived the fellow stared upon him at the oddness of the message and was going to be saucy upon which i ratified the knights commands with a peremptory look  as we were going out of the garden my old friend thinking himself obliged as a member of the quorum to animadvert upon the morals of the place told the mistress of the house who sat at the bar that he should be a better customer to her garden if there were more nightingales and fewer strumpets

asserted that christianity left us where it found us as to our civil rights the present entertainment shall consist only of a sentence out of the postboy and the said preface of the lord of st asaph i

these following reasons    first from the observations i have been able to make for these many   years last past upon our publick affairs and from the natural   tendency of several principles and practices that have of late been   studiously revived and from what has followed thereupon i could not   help both fearing and presaging that these nations would some time or   other if ever we should have an enterprising prince upon the throne   of more ambition than virtue justice and true honour fall into the   way of all other nations and lose their liberty    nor could i help foreseeing to whose charge a great deal of this   dreadful mischief whenever it should happen would be laid whether   justly or unjustly was not my business to determine but i resolved   for my own particular part to deliver my self as well as i could   from the reproaches and the curses of posterity by publickly   declaring to all the world that although in the constant course of my   ministry i have never failed on proper occasions to recommend   urge and insist upon the loving honouring and the reverencing the   princes person and holding it according to the laws inviolable and   sacred and paying all obedience and submission to the laws though   never so hard and inconvenient to private people yet did i never   think my self at liberty or authorized to tell the people that   either christ st peter or st paul or any other holy writer had   by any doctrine delivered by them subverted the laws and   constitutions of the country in which they lived or put them in a   worse condition with respect to their civil liberties than they   would have been had they not been christians i ever thought it a most   impious blasphemy against that holy religion to father any thing upon   it that might encourage tyranny oppression or injustice in a prince   or that easily tended to make a free and happy people slaves and   miserable no people may make themselves as wretched as they will   but let not god be called into that wicked party when force and   violence and hard necessity have brought the yoak of servitude upon a   peoples neck religion will supply them with a patient and submissive   spirit under it till they can innocently shake it off but certainly   religion never puts it on this always was and this at present is my   judgment of these matters and i would be transmitted to posterity   for the little share of time such names as mine can live under the   character of one who lovd his country and would be thought a good   englishman as well as a good clergyman    this character i thought would be transmitted by the following   sermons which were made for and preached in a private audience when   i could think of nothing else but doing my duty on the occasions that   were then offered by gods providence without any manner of design of   making them publick and for that reason i give them now as they were   then delivered by which i hope to satisfie those people who have   objected a change of principles to me as if i were not now the same   man i formerly was i never had but one opinion of these matters and   that i think is so reasonable and wellgrounded that i believe i   never can have any other another reason of my publishing these   sermons at this time is that i have a mind to do my self some   honour by doing what honour i could to the memory of two most   excellent princes and who have very highly deserved at the hands of   all the people of these dominions who have any true value for the   protestant religion and the constitution of the english government   of which they were the great deliverers and defenders i have lived to   see their illustrious names very rudely handled and the great   benefits they did this nation treated slightly and contemptuously i   have lived to see our deliverance from arbitrary power and popery   traduced and vilified by some who formerly thought it was their   greatest merit and made it part of their boast and glory to have had   a little hand and share in bringing it about and others who without   it must have livd in exile poverty and misery meanly disclaiming   it and using ill the glorious instruments thereof who could expect   such a requital of such merit i have i own it an ambition of   exempting my self from the number of unthankful people and as i loved   and honoured those great princes living and lamented over them when   dead so i would gladly raise them up a monument of praise as lasting   as any thing of mine can be and i chuse to do it at this time when   it is so unfashionable a thing to speak honourably of them    the sermon that was preached upon the duke of gloucesters death was   printed quickly after and is now because the subject was so   suitable joind to the others the loss of that most promising and   hopeful prince was at that time i saw unspeakably great and many   accidents since have convinced us that it could not have been   overvalued that precious life had it pleased god to have prolonged   it the usual space had saved us many fears and jealousies and dark   distrusts and prevented many alarms that have long kept us and will   keep us still waking and uneasy nothing remained to comfort and   support us under this heavy stroke but the necessity it brought the   king and nation under of settling the succession in the house of   hannover and giving it an hereditary right by act of parliament as   long as it continues protestant so much good did god in his merciful   providence produce from a misfortune which we could never otherwise   have sufficiently deplored    the fourth sermon was preached upon the queens accession to the   throne and the first year in which that day was solemnly observed   for by some accident or other it had been overlookd the year   before and every one will see without the date of it that it was   preached very early in this reign since i was able only to promise   and presage its future glories and successes from the good   appearances of things and the happy turn our affairs began to take   and could not then count up the victories and triumphs that for seven   years after made it in the prophets language a name and a praise   among all the people of the earth never did seven such years together   pass over the head of any english monarch nor cover it with so much   honour the crown and sceptre seemed to be the queens least   ornaments those other princes wore in common with her and her great   personal virtues were the same before and since but such was the fame   of her administration of affairs at home such was the reputation of   her wisdom and felicity in chusing ministers and such was then   esteemed their faithfulness and zeal their diligence and great   abilities in executing her commands to such a height of military   glory did her great general and her armies carry the british name   abroad such was the harmony and concord betwixt her and her allies   and such was the blessing of god upon all her counsels and   undertakings that i am as sure as history can make me no prince of   ours was ever yet so prosperous and successful so beloved esteemed   and honoured by their subjects and their friends nor near so   formidable to their enemies we were as all the world imagined then   just entring on the ways that promised to lead to such a peace as   would have answered all the prayers of our religious queen the care   and vigilance of a most able ministry the payments of a willing and   obedient people as well as all the glorious toils and hazards of the   soldiery when god for our sins permitted the spirit of discord to   go forth and by troubling sore the camp the city and the country   and oh that it had altogether spared the places sacred to his   worship to spoil for a time this beautiful and pleasing prospect   and give us in its stead i know not whatour enemies will tell   the rest with pleasure it will become me better to pray to god to   restore us to the power of obtaining such a peace as will be to his   glory the safety honour and the welfare of the queen and her   dominions and the general satisfaction

which i shall throw my observations together without any set form that i may avoid repeating what has been often said on this subject  friendship is a strong and habitual inclination in two persons to promote the good and happiness of one another tho the pleasures and advantages of friendship have been largely celebrated by the best moral writers and are considered by all as great ingredients of human happiness we very rarely meet with the practice of this virtue in the world  every man is ready to give in a long catalogue of those virtues and good qualities he expects to find in the person of a friend but very few of us are careful to cultivate them in our selves  love and esteem are the first principles of friendship which always is imperfect where either of these two is wanting  as on the one hand we are soon ashamed of loving a man whom we cannot esteem so on the other tho we are truly sensible of a mans abilities we can never raise ourselves to the warmths of friendship without an affectionate goodwill towards his person  friendship immediately banishes envy under all its disguises a man who can once doubt whether he should rejoice in his friends being happier than himself may depend upon it that he is an utter stranger to this virtue  there is something in friendship so very great and noble that in those fictitious stories which are invented to the honour of any particular person the authors have thought it as necessary to make their hero a friend as a lover achilles has his patroclus and æneas his achates in the first of these instances we may observe for the reputation of the subject i am treating of that greece was almost ruind by the heros love but was preserved by his friendship  the character of achates suggests to us an observation we may often make on the intimacies of great men who frequently chuse their companions rather for the qualities of the heart than those of the head and prefer fidelity in an easy inoffensive complying temper to those endowments which make a much greater figure among mankind i do not remember that achates who is represented as the first favourite either gives his advice or strikes a blow thro the whole æneid  a friendship which makes the least noise is very often most useful for which reason i should prefer a prudent friend to a zealous one  atticus one of the best men of ancient rome was a very remarkable instance of what i am here speaking this extraordinary person amidst the civil wars of his country when he saw the designs of all parties equally tended to the subversion of liberty by constantly preserving the esteem and affection of both the competitors found means to serve his friends on either side and while he sent money to young marius whose father was declared an enemy of the commonwealth he was himself one of syllas chief favourites and always near that general  during the war between cæsar and pompey he still maintained the same conduct after the death of cæsar he sent money to brutus in his troubles and did a thousand good offices to antonys wife and friends when that party seemed ruined lastly even in that bloody war between antony and augustus atticus still kept his place in both their friendships insomuch that the first says cornelius nepos whenever he was absent from rome in any part of the empire writ punctually to him what he was doing what he read and whither he intended to go and the latter gave him constantly an exact account of all his affairs  a likeness of inclinations in every particular is so far from being requisite to form a benevolence in two minds towards each other as it is generally imagined that i believe we shall find some of the firmest friendships to have been contracted between persons of different humours the mind being often pleased with those perfections which are new to it and which it does not find among its own accomplishments besides that a man in some measure supplies his own defects and fancies himself at second hand possessed of those good qualities and endowments which are in the possession of him who in the eye of the world is looked on as his other self  the most difficult province in friendship is the letting a man see his faults and errors which should if possible be so contrived that he may perceive our advice is given him not so much to please ourselves as for his own advantage the reproaches therefore of a friend should always be strictly just and not too frequent  the violent desire of pleasing in the person reproved may otherwise change into a despair of doing it while he finds himself censurd for faults he is not conscious of a mind that is softened and humanized by friendship cannot bear frequent reproaches either it must quite sink under the oppression or abate considerably of the value and esteem it had for him who bestows them  the proper business of friendship is to inspire life and courage and a soul thus supported outdoes itself whereas if it be unexpectedly deprived of these succours it droops and languishes  we are in some measure more inexcusable if we violate our duties to a friend than to a relation since the former arise from a voluntary choice the latter from a necessity to which we could not give our own consent  as it has been said on one side that a man ought not to break with a faulty friend that he may not expose the weakness of his choice it will doubtless hold much stronger with respect to a worthy one that he may never be upbraided for having lost so valuable a treasure which was once in his possession  x

of latin on the head of this paper is part of a character extremely vicious but i have set down no more than may fall in with the rules of justice and honour cicero spoke it of catiline who he said lived with the sad severely with the chearful agreeably with the old gravely with the young pleasantly he added with the wicked boldly with the wanton lasciviously the two last instances of his complaisance i forbear to consider having it in my thoughts at present only to speak of obsequious behaviour as it sits upon a companion in pleasure not a man of design and intrigue to vary with every humour in this manner cannot be agreeable except it comes from a mans own temper and natural complection to do it out of an ambition to excel that way is the most fruitless and unbecoming prostitution imaginable to put on an artful part to obtain no other end but an unjust praise from the undiscerning is of all endeavours the most despicable a man must be sincerely pleased to become pleasure or not to interrupt that of others for this reason it is a most calamitous circumstance that many people who want to be alone or should be so will come into conversation it is certain that all men who are the least given to reflection are seized with an inclination that way when perhaps they had rather be inclined to company but indeed they had better go home and be tired with themselves than force themselves upon others to recover their good humour in all this the cases of communicating to a friend a sad thought or difficulty in order to relieve a   heavy heart stands excepted but what is here meant is that a man should always go with inclination to the turn of the company he is going into or not pretend to be of the party it is certainly a very happy temper to be able to live with all kinds of dispositions because it argues a mind that lies open to receive what is pleasing to others and not obstinately bent on any particularity of its own  this is that which makes me pleased with the character of my good acquaintance acasto you meet him at the tables and conversations of the wise the impertinent the grave the frolick and the witty and yet his own character has nothing in it that can make him particularly agreeable to any one sect of men but acasto has natural good sense good nature and discretion so that every man enjoys himself in his company and tho acasto contributes nothing to the entertainment he never was at a place where he was not welcome a second time without these subordinate good qualities of acasto a man of wit and learning would be painful to the generality of mankind instead of being pleasing witty men are apt to imagine they are agreeable as such and by that means grow the worst companions imaginable they deride the absent or rally the present in a wrong manner not knowing that if you pinch or tickle a man till he is uneasy in his seat or ungracefully distinguished from the rest of the company you equally hurt him  i was going to say the true art of being agreeable in company but there can be no such thing as art in it is to appear well pleased with those you are engaged with and rather to seem well entertained than to bring entertainment to others a man thus disposed is not indeed what we ordinarily call a good companion but essentially is such and in all the parts of his conversation has something friendly in his behaviour which conciliates mens minds more than the highest sallies of wit or starts of humour can possibly do the feebleness of age in a man of this turn has something which should be treated with respect even in a man no otherwise venerable the forwardness of youth when it proceeds from alacrity and not insolence has also its allowances the companion who is formed for such by nature gives to every character of life its due regards and is ready to account for their imperfections and receive their accomplishments as if they were his own it must appear that you receive law from and not give it to your company to make you agreeable  i remember tully speaking i think of anthony says that in eo facetiæ erant quæ nulla arte tradi possunt he had a witty mirth which could be acquired by no art this quality must be of the kind of which i am now speaking for all sorts of behaviour which depend upon observation and knowledge of life is to be acquired but that which no one can describe and is apparently the act of nature must be every where prevalent because every thing it meets is a fit occasion to exert it for he who follows nature can never be improper or unseasonable  how unaccountable then must their behaviour be who without any manner of consideration of what the company they have just now entered are upon give themselves the air of a messenger and make as distinct relations of the occurrences they last met with as if they had been dispatched from those they talk to to be punctually exact in a report of those circumstances it is unpardonable to those who are met to enjoy one another that a fresh man shall pop in and give us only the last part of his own life and put a stop to ours during the history if such a man comes from change whether you will or not you must hear how the stocks go and tho you are ever so intently employed on a graver subject a young fellow of the other end of the town will take his place and tell you mrs suchaone is charmingly handsome because he just now saw her but i think i need not dwell on this subject since i have acknowledged there can be no rules made for excelling this way and precepts of this kind fare like rules for writing poetry which tis said may have prevented ill poets but never made good ones  t    footnote   an                                             no                   saturday may                       addison      quid purè tranquillet    hor    in my last saturdays paper i spoke of chearfulness as it is a moral habit of the mind and accordingly mentioned such moral motives as are apt to cherish and keep alive this happy temper in the soul of man i shall now consider chearfulness in its natural state and reflect on those motives to it which are indifferent either as to virtue or vice  chearfulness is in the first place the best promoter of health repinings and secret murmurs of heart give imperceptible strokes to those delicate fibres of which the vital parts are composed and wear out the machine insensibly not to mention those violent ferments which they stir up in the blood and those irregular disturbed motions which they raise in the animal spirits i scarce remember in my own observation to have met with many old men or with such who to use our english phrase wear well that had not at least a certain indolence in their humour if not a more than ordinary gaiety and chearfulness of heart the truth of it is health and chearfulness mutually beget each other with this difference that we seldom meet with a great degree of health which is not attended with a certain chearfulness but very often see chearfulness where there is no great degree of health  chearfulness bears the same friendly regard to the mind as to the body it banishes all anxious care and discontent sooths and composes the passions and keeps the soul in a perpetual calm but having already touched on this last consideration i shall here take notice that the world in which we are placed is filled with innumerable objects that are proper to raise and keep alive this happy temper of mind  if we consider the world in its subserviency to man one would think it was made for our use but if we consider it in its natural beauty and harmony one would be apt to conclude it was made for our pleasure the sun which is as the great soul of the universe and produces all the necessaries of life has a particular influence in chearing the mind of man and making the heart glad  those several living creatures which are made for our service or sustenance at the same time either fill the woods with their musick furnish us with game or raise pleasing ideas in us by the delightfulness of their appearance fountains lakes and rivers are as refreshing to the imagination as to the soil through which they pass  there are writers of great distinction who have made it an argument for providence that the whole earth is covered with green rather than with any other colour as being such a right mixture of light and shade that it comforts and strengthens the eye instead of weakning or grieving it for this reason several painters have a green cloth hanging near them to ease the eye upon after too great an application to their colouring a famous modern philosopher   accounts for it in the following manner all colours that are more luminous overpower and dissipate the animal spirits which are employd in sight on the contrary those that are more obscure do not give the animal spirits a sufficient exercise whereas the rays that produce in us the idea of green fall upon the eye in such a due proportion that they give the animal spirits their proper play and by keeping up the struggle in a just ballance excite a very pleasing and agreeable sensation let the cause be what it will the effect is certain for which reason the poets ascribe to this particular colour the epithet of chearful  to consider further this double end in the works of nature and how they are at the same time both useful and entertaining we find that the most important parts in the vegetable world are those which are the most beautiful these are the seeds by which the several races of plants are propagated and continued and which are always lodged in flowers or blossoms nature seems to hide her principal design and to be industrious in making the earth gay and delightful while she is carrying on her great work and intent upon her own preservation the husbandman after the same manner is employed in laying out the whole country into a kind of garden or landskip and making every thing smile about him whilst in reality he thinks of nothing but of the harvest and encrease which is to arise from it  we may further observe how providence has taken care to keep up this chearfulness in the mind of man by having formed it after such a manner as to make it capable of conceiving delight from several objects which seem to have very little use in them as from the wildness of rocks and desarts and the like grotesque parts of nature those who are versed in philosophy may still carry this consideration higher by observing that if matter had appeared to us endowed only with those real qualities which it actually possesses it would have made but a very joyless and uncomfortable figure and why has providence given it a power of producing in us such imaginary qualities as tastes and colours sounds and smells heat and cold but that man while he is conversant in the lower stations of nature might have his mind cheared and delighted with agreeable sensations in short the whole universe is a kind of theatre filled with objects that either raise in us pleasure amusement or admiration  the readers own thoughts will suggest to him the vicissitude of day and night the change of seasons with all that variety of scenes which diversify the face of nature and fill the mind with a perpetual succession of beautiful and pleasing images  i shall not here mention the several entertainments of art with the pleasures of friendship books conversation and other accidental diversions of life because i would only take notice of such incitements to a chearful temper as offer themselves to persons of all ranks and conditions and which may sufficiently shew us that providence did not design this world should be filled with murmurs and repinings or that the heart of man should be involved in gloom and melancholy  i the more inculcate this chearfulness of temper as it is a virtue in which our countrymen are observed to be more deficient than any other nation melancholy is a kind of demon that haunts our island and often conveys her self to us in an easterly wind a celebrated french novelist in opposition to those who begin their romances with the flowry season of the year enters on his story thus in the gloomy month of november when the people of england hang and drown themselves a disconsolate lover walked out into the fields c  every one ought to fence against the temper of his climate or constitution and frequently to indulge in himself those considerations which may give him a serenity of mind and enable him to bear up chearfully against those little evils and misfortunes which are common to humane nature and which by a right improvement of them will produce a satiety of joy and an uninterrupted happiness  at the same time that i would engage my reader to consider the world in its most agreeable lights i must own there are many evils which naturally spring up amidst the entertainments that are provided for us but these if rightly considerd should be far from overcasting the mind with sorrow or destroying that chearfulness of temper which i have been recommending this interspersion of evil with good and pain with pleasure in the works of nature is very truly ascribed by mr locke in his essay on human understanding to a moral reason in the following words    beyond all this we may find another reason why god hath scattered up   and down several degrees of pleasure and pain in all the things that   environ and affect us and blended them together in almost all that   our thoughts and senses have to do with that we finding imperfection   dissatisfaction and want of compleat happiness in all the enjoyments   which the creatures can afford us might be led to seek it in the   enjoyment of him with whom there is fulness of joy and at whose   right hand are pleasures

budgell      meliora pii docuere parentes    hor    nothing has more surprized the learned in england than the price which a small book intitled spaccio della bestia triom fante   bore in a late auction this book was sold for thirty   pound as it was written by one jordanus brunus a professed atheist with a design to depreciate religion every one was apt to fancy from the extravagant price it bore that there must be something in it very formidable  i must confess that happening to get a sight of one of them my self i could not forbear perusing it with this apprehension but found there was so very little danger in it that i shall venture to give my readers a fair account of the whole plan upon which this wonderful treatise is built  the author pretends that jupiter once upon a time resolved on a reformation of the constellations for which purpose having summoned the stars together he complains to them of the great decay of the worship of the gods which he thought so much the harder having called several of those celestial bodies by the names of the heathen deities and by that means made the heavens as it were a book of the pagan theology momus tells him that this is not to be wondered at since there were so many scandalous stories of the deities upon which the author takes occasion to cast reflections upon all other religions concluding that jupiter after a full hearing discarded the deities out of heaven and called the stars by the names of the moral virtues  this short fable which has no pretence in it to reason or argument and but a very small share of wit has however recommended it self wholly by its impiety to those weak men who would distinguish themselves by the singularity of their opinions  there are two considerations which have been often urged against atheists and which they never yet could get over the first is that the greatest and most eminent persons of all ages have been against them and always complied with the publick forms of worship established in their respective countries when there was nothing in them either derogatory to the honour of the supreme being or prejudicial to the good of mankind  the platos and ciceros among the ancients the bacons the boyles and the lockes among our own countrymen are all instances of what i have been saying not to mention any of the divines however celebrated since our adversaries challenge all those as men who have too much interest in this case to be impartial evidences  but what has been often urged as a consideration of much more weight is not only the opinion of the better sort but the general consent of mankind to this great truth which i think could not possibly have come to pass but from one of the three following reasons either that the idea of a god is innate and coexistent with the mind it self or that this truth is so very obvious that it is discoverd by the first exertion of reason in persons of the most ordinary capacities or lastly that it has been delivered down to us thro all ages by a tradition from the first man  the atheists are equally confounded to which ever of these three causes we assign it they have been so pressed by this last argument from the general consent of mankind that after great search and pains they pretend to have found out a nation of atheists i mean that polite people the hottentots  i dare not shock my readers with a description of the customs and manners of these barbarians who are in every respect scarce one degree above brutes having no language among them but a confused gabble   which is neither well understood by themselves or others  it is not however to be imagind how much the atheists have gloried in these their good friends and allies  if we boast of a socrates or a seneca they may now confront them with these great philosophers the hottentots  tho even this point has not without reason been several times controverted i see no manner of harm it could do religion if we should entirely give them up this elegant part of mankind  methinks nothing more shews the weakness of their cause than that no division of their fellowcreatures join with them but those among whom they themselves own reason is almost defaced and who have little else but their shape which can entitle them to any place in the species  besides these poor creatures there have now and then been instances of a few crazed people in several nations who have denied the existence of a deity  the catalogue of these is however very short even vanini   the most celebrated champion for the cause professed before his judges that he believed the existence of a god and taking up a straw which lay before him on the ground assured them that alone was sufficient to convince him of it alledging several arguments to prove that twas impossible nature alone could create anything  i was the other day reading an account of casimir liszynski a gentleman of poland who was convicted and executed for this crime   the manner of his punishment was very particular as soon as his body was burnt his ashes were put into a cannon and shot into the air towards tartary  i am apt to believe that if something like this method of punishment should prevail in england such is the natural good sense of the british nation that whether we rammed an atheist whole into a great gun or pulverized our infidels as they do in poland we should not have many charges  i should however propose while our ammunition lasted that instead of tartary we should always keep two or three cannons ready pointed towards the cape of good hope in order to shoot our unbelievers into the country of the hottentots  in my opinion a solemn judicial death is too great an honour for an atheist tho i must allow the method of exploding him as it is practised in this ludicrous kind of martyrdom has something in it proper enough to the nature of his offence  there is indeed a great objection against this manner of treating them zeal for religion is of so active a nature that it seldom knows where to rest for which reason i am afraid after having discharged our atheists we might possibly think of shooting off our sectaries and as one does not foresee the vicissitude of human affairs it might one time or other come to a mans own turn to fly out of the mouth of a demiculverin  if any of my readers imagine that i have treated these gentlemen in too ludicrous a manner i must confess for my own part i think reasoning against such unbelievers upon a point that shocks the common sense of mankind is doing them too great an honour giving them a figure in the eye of the world and making people fancy that they have more in them than they really have  as for those persons who have any scheme of religious worship i am for treating such with the utmost tenderness and should endeavour to shew them their errors with the greatest temper and humanity but as these miscreants are for throwing down religion in general for stripping mankind of what themselves own is of excellent use in all great societies without once offering to establish any thing in the room of it i think the best way of dealing with them is to retort their own weapons upon them which are those of scorn and mockery  x    footnote   the book was bought in      for £   by mr walter clavel at the sale of the library of mr charles barnard it had

scandalous people who love to defame their neighbours and make the unjustest interpretation of innocent and indifferent actions they describe their own behaviour so unhappily that there indeed lies some cause of suspicion upon them it is certain that there is no authority for persons who have nothing else to do to pass away hours of conversation upon the miscarriages of other people but since they will do so they who value their reputation should be cautious of appearances to their disadvantage but very often our young women as well as the middleaged and the gay part of those growing old without entering into a formal league for that purpose to a woman agree upon a short way to preserve their characters and go on in a way that at best is only not vicious the method is when an illnaturd or talkative girl has said any thing that bears hard upon some part of anothers carriage this creature if not in any of their little cabals is run down for the most censorious dangerous body in the world thus they guard their reputation rather than their modesty as if guilt lay in being under the imputation of a fault and not in a commission of it orbicilla is the kindest poor thing in the town but the most blushing creature living it is true she has not lost the sense of shame but she has lost the sense of innocence if she had more confidence and never did anything which ought to stain her cheeks would she not be much more modest without that ambiguous suffusion which is the livery both of guilt and innocence modesty consists in being conscious of no ill and not in being ashamed of having done it when people go upon any other foundation than the truth of their own hearts for the conduct of their actions it lies in the power of scandalous tongues to carry the world before them and make the rest of mankind fall in with the ill for fear of reproach on the other hand to do what you ought is the ready way to make calumny either silent or ineffectually malicious spencer in his fairy queen says admirably to young ladies under the distress of being defamed    the best said he that i can you advise     is to avoid th occasion of the ill   for when the cause whence evil doth arise     removed is th effect surceaseth still   abstain from pleasure and restrain your will     subdue desire and bridle loose delight   use scanted diet and forbear your fill     shun secrecy and talk in open sight   so shall you soon repair your present evil plight    instead of this care over their words and actions recommended by a poet in old queen besss days the modern way is to do and say what you please and yet be the prettiest sort of woman in the world if fathers and brothers will defend a ladys honour she is quite as safe as in her own innocence many of the distressed who suffer under the malice of evil tongues are so harmless that they are every day they live asleep till twelve at noon concern themselves with nothing but their own persons till two take their necessary food between that time and four visit go to the play and sit up at cards till towards the ensuing morn and the malicious world shall draw conclusions from innocent glances short whispers or pretty familiar railleries with fashionable men that these fair ones are not as rigid as vestals it is certain say these goodest creatures very well that virtue does not consist in constraind behaviour and wry faces that must be allowd but there is a decency in the aspect and manner of ladies contracted from an habit of virtue and from general reflections that regard a modest conduct all which may be understood tho they cannot be described a young woman of this sort claims an esteem mixed with affection and honour and meets with no defamation or if she does the wild malice is overcome with an undisturbed perseverance in her innocence to speak freely there are such coveys of coquets about this town that if the peace were not kept by some impertinent tongues of their own sex which keep them under some restraint we should have no manner of engagement upon them to keep them in any tolerable order  as i am a spectator and behold how plainly one part of womankind ballance the behaviour of the other whatever i may think of talebearers or slanderers i cannot wholly suppress them no more than a general would discourage spies the enemy would easily surprize him whom they knew had no intelligence of their motions it is so far otherwise with me that i acknowledge i permit a sheslanderer or two in every quarter of the town to live in the characters of coquets and take all the innocent freedoms of the rest in order to send me information of the behaviour of their respective sisterhoods  but as the matter of respect to the world which looks on is carried on methinks it is so very easie to be what is in the general called virtuous that it need not cost one hours reflection in a month to preserve that appellation it is pleasant to hear the pretty rogues talk of virtue and vice among each other she is the laziest creature in the world but i must confess strictly virtuous the peevishest hussy breathing but as to her virtue she is without blemish she has not the least charity for any of her acquaintance but i must allow rigidly virtuous as the unthinking part of the male world call every man a man of honour who is not a coward so the crowd of the other sex terms every woman who will not be a wench virtuous  t    footnote   f q bk vi canto vi st                                                  no                   thursday may

resentments and give himself up to the entreaties of his countrymen the poet in order to make him speak in character ascribes to him a speech full of those fables and allegories which old men take delight in relating and which are very proper for instruction the gods says he suffer themselves to be prevailed upon by entreaties when mortals have offended them by their transgressions they appease them by vows and sacrifices you must know achilles that prayers are the daughters of jupiter they are crippled by frequent kneeling have their faces full of cares and wrinkles and their eyes always cast towards heaven they are constant attendants on the goddess ate and march behind her this goddess walks forward with a bold and haughty air and being very light of foot runs thro the whole earth grieving and afflicting the sons of men she gets the start of prayers who always follow her in order to heal those persons whom she wounds he who honours these daughters of jupiter when they draw near to him receives great benefit from them but as for him who rejects them they intreat their father to give his orders to the goddess ate to punish him for his hardness of heart this noble allegory needs but little explanation for whether the goddess ate signifies injury as some have explained it or guilt in general as others or divine justice as i am the more apt to think the interpretation is obvious enough  i shall produce another heathen fable relating to prayers which is of a more diverting kind one would think by some passages in it that it was composed by lucian or at least by some author who has endeavourd to imitate his way of writing but as dissertations of this nature are more curious than useful i shall give my reader the fable without any further enquiries after the author    menippus   the philosopher was a second time taken up into heaven by   jupiter when for his entertainment he lifted up a trapdoor that was   placed by his footstool at its rising there issued through it such   a din of cries as astonished the philosopher upon his asking what   they meant jupiter told him they were the prayers that were sent up   to him from the earth menippus amidst the confusion of voices which   was so great that nothing less than the ear of jove could distinguish   them heard the words riches honour and long life repeated in   several different tones and languages when the first hubbub of sounds   was over the trapdoor being left open the voices came up more   separate and distinct the first prayer was a very odd one it came   from athens and desired jupiter to increase the wisdom and the beard   of his humble supplicant menippus knew it by the voice to be the   prayer of his friend licander the philosopher this was succeeded by   the petition of one who had just laden a ship and promised jupiter   if he took care of it and returned it home again full of riches he   would make him an offering of a silver cup jupiter thanked him for   nothing and bending down his ear more attentively than ordinary   heard a voice complaining to him of the cruelty of an ephesian widow   and begging him to breed compassion in her heart this says jupiter   is a very honest fellow i have received a great deal of incense from   him i will not be so cruel to him as to hear his prayers he was   then interrupted with a whole volly of vows which were made for the   health of a tyrannical prince by his subjects who prayd for him in   his presence menippus was surprized after having listned to prayers   offered up with so much ardour and devotion to hear low whispers from   the same assembly expostulating with jove for suffering such a tyrant   to live and asking him how his thunder could lie idle jupiter was so   offended at these prevaricating rascals that he took down the first   vows and puffed away the last the philosopher seeing a great cloud   mounting upwards and making its way directly to the trapdoor   enquired of jupiter what it meant this says jupiter is the smoke of   a whole hecatomb that is offered me by the general of an army who is   very importunate with me to let him cut off an hundred thousand men   that are drawn up in array against him what does the impudent wretch   think i see in him to believe that i will make a sacrifice of so many   mortals as good as himself and all this to his glory forsooth but   hark says jupiter there is a voice i never heard but in time of   danger tis a rogue that is shipwreckd in the ionian sea i savd him   on a plank but three days ago upon his promise to mend his manners   the scoundrel is not worth a groat and yet has the impudence to offer   me a temple if i will keep him from sinkingbut yonder says he is a   special youth for you he desires me to take his father who keeps a   great estate from him out of the miseries of human life the old   fellow shall live till he makes his heart ake i can tell him that for   his pains this was followed by the soft voice of a pious lady   desiring jupiter that she might appear amiable and charming in the   sight of her emperor as the philosopher was reflecting on this   extraordinary petition there blew a gentle wind thro the trapdoor   which he at first mistook for a gale of zephirs but afterwards found   it to be a breeze of sighs they smelt strong of flowers and incense   and were succeeded by most passionate complaints of wounds and   torments fires and arrows cruelty despair and death menippus   fancied that such lamentable cries arose from some general execution   or from wretches lying under the torture but jupiter told him that   they came up to him from the isle of paphos and that he every day   received complaints of the same nature from that whimsical tribe of   mortals who are called lovers i am so trifled with says he by this   generation of both sexes and find it so impossible to please them   whether i grant or refuse their petitions that i shall order a   western wind for the future to intercept them in their passage and   blow them at random upon the earth the last petition i heard was from   a very aged man of near an hundred years old begging but for one year   more of life and then promising to die contented this is the rarest   old fellow says jupiter he has made this prayer to me for above   twenty years together when he was but fifty years old he desired   only that he might live to see his son settled in the world i granted   it he then begged the same favour for his daughter and afterwards   that he might see the education of a grandson when all this was   brought about he puts up a petition that he might live to finish a   house he was building in short he is an unreasonable old cur and   never wants an excuse i will hear no more of him upon which he   flung down the trapdoor in a passion and was resolved to give no   more audiences that day  notwithstanding the levity of this fable the moral of it very well deserves our attention and is the same with that which has been inculcated by socrates and plato not to mention juvenal and persius who have each of them made the finest satire in their whole works upon this subject the vanity of mens wishes which are the natural prayers of the mind as well as many of those secret devotions which they offer to the supreme being are sufficiently exposed by it among other reasons for set forms of prayer i have often thought it a very good one that by this means the folly and extravagance of mens desires may be kept within due bounds and not break out in absurd and ridiculous petitions on so great and solemn an occasion  i    footnote   iliad bk ix   footnote   menippus was a cynic philosopher of gadara who made money in thebes by usury lost it and hanged himself he wrote satirical pieces

a relation of a coquet in the neighbourhood who had been   discovered practising before her glass to turn the discourse which   from being witty grew to be malicious the matron of the family took   occasion from the subject to wish that there were to be found   amongst men such faithful monitors to dress the mind by as we consult   to adorn the body she added that if a sincere friend were   miraculously changed into a lookingglass she should not be ashamed   to ask its advice very often this whimsical thought worked so much   upon my fancy the whole evening that it produced a very odd dream        methought that as i stood before my glass the image of a youth of   an open ingenuous aspect appeared in it who with a small shrill   voice spoke in the following manner      the lookingglass you see was heretofore a man even i the     unfortunate fidelio i had two brothers whose deformity in shape     was made out by the clearness of their understanding it must be     owned however that as it generally happens they had each a     perverseness of humour suitable to their distortion of body the     eldest whose belly sunk in monstrously was a great coward and     tho his splenetick contracted temper made him take fire     immediately he made objects that beset him appear greater than they     were the second whose breast swelled into a bold relievo on the     contrary took great pleasure in lessening every thing and was     perfectly the reverse of his brother these oddnesses pleased     company once or twice but disgusted when often seen for which     reason the young gentlemen were sent from court to study     mathematicks at the university      i need not acquaint you that i was very well made and reckoned a     bright polite gentleman i was the confident

bare     to themselves this was verifyd in my amour with narcissa who was     so constant to me that it was pleasantly said had i been little     enough she would have hung me at her girdle the most dangerous     rival i had was a gay empty fellow who by the strength of a long     intercourse with narcissa joined to his natural endowments had     formed himself into a perfect resemblance with her i had been     discarded had she not observed that he frequently asked my opinion     about matters of the last consequence this made me still more     considerable in her eye      tho i was eternally caressed by the ladies such was their opinion     of my honour that i was never envyd by the men a jealous lover of     narcissa one day thought he had caught her in an amorous     conversation for

brightened into an innocent smile quickly after she swelled     into an air of majesty and disdain then kept her eyes half shut     after a languishing manner then covered her blushes with her hand     breathed a sigh and seemd ready to sink down in rushed the furious     lover but how great was his surprize to see no one there but the     innocent fidelio with his back against the wall betwixt two

bed she stole     out of her chamber and found me all alone in an adjoining     apartment she ran with transport to her darling and without     mixture of fear lest i should dislike her but oh me what was her     fury when she heard me say i was afraid and shockd at so loathsome     a spectacle she stepped back swollen with rage to see if i had     the insolence to repeat it i did with this

denmark     copenhagen may      0    dear sir    the spring with you has already taken possession of the fields and   woods now is the season of solitude and of moving complaints upon   trivial sufferings now the griefs of lovers begin to flow and their   wounds to bleed afresh i too at this distance from the softer   climates am not without my discontents at present you perhaps may   laugh at me for a most romantick wretch when i have disclosed to you   the occasion of my uneasiness and yet i cannot help thinking my   unhappiness real in being confined to a region which is the very   reverse of paradise the seasons here are all of them unpleasant and   the country quite destitute of rural charms i have not heard a bird   sing nor a brook murmur nor a breeze whisper neither have i been   blest with the sight of a flowry meadow these two years every wind   here is a tempest and every water a turbulent ocean i hope when you   reflect a little you will not think the grounds of my complaint in   the least frivolous and unbecoming a man of serious thought since the   love of woods of fields and flowers of rivers and fountains seems   to be a passion implanted in our natures the most early of any even   before the fair sex had a being    i am sir c   could i transport my self with a wish from one country to another i should chuse to pass my winter in spain my spring in italy my summer in england and my autumn in france of all these seasons there is none that can vie with the spring for beauty and delightfulness it bears the same figure among the seasons of the year that the morning does among the divisions of the day or youth among the stages of life the english summer is pleasanter than that of any other country in europe on no other account but because it has a greater mixture of spring in it the mildness of our climate with those frequent refreshments of dews and rains that fall among us keep up a perpetual chearfulness in our fields and fill the hottest months of the year with a lively verdure  in the opening of the spring when all nature begins to recover her self the same animal pleasure which makes the birds sing and the whole brute creation rejoice rises very sensibly in the heart of man i know none of the poets who have observed so well as milton those secret overflowings of gladness which diffuse themselves thro the mind of the beholder upon surveying the gay scenes of nature he has touched upon it twice or thrice in his paradise lost and describes it very beautifully under the name of vernal delight in that passage where he represents the devil himself as almost sensible of it    blossoms and fruits at once of golden hue   appeard with gay enameld colours mixt   on which the sun more glad impressd his beams   than in fair evening cloud or humid bow   when god hath showerd the earth so lovely seemd   that landskip and of pure now purer air   meets his approach and to the heart inspires   vernal delight and joy able to drive   all sadness but despair c    many authors have written on the vanity of the creature and represented the barrenness of every thing in this world and its incapacity of producing any solid or substantial happiness as discourses of this nature are very useful to the sensual and voluptuous those speculations which shew the bright side of things and lay forth those innocent entertainments which are to be met with among the several objects that encompass us are no less beneficial to men of dark and melancholy tempers it was for this reason that i endeavoured to recommend a chearfulness of mind in my two last saturdays papers and which i would still inculcate not only from the consideration of our selves and of that being on whom we depend nor from the general survey of that universe in which we are placed at present but from reflections on the particular season in which this paper is written the creation is a perpetual feast to the mind of a good man every thing he sees chears and delights him providence has imprinted so many smiles on nature that it is impossible for a mind which is not sunk in more gross and sensual delights to take a survey of them without several secret sensations of pleasure the psalmist has in several of his divine poems celebrated those beautiful and agreeable scenes which make the heart glad and produce in it that vernal delight which i have before taken notice of  natural philosophy quickens this taste of the creation and renders it not only pleasing to the imagination but to the understanding it does not rest in the murmur of brooks and the melody of birds in the shade of groves and woods or in the embroidery of fields and meadows but considers the several ends of providence which are served by them and the wonders of divine wisdom which appear in them it heightens the pleasures of the eye and raises such a rational admiration in the soul as is little inferior to devotion  it is not in the power of every one to offer up this kind of worship to the great author of nature and to indulge these more refined meditations of heart which are doubtless highly acceptable in his sight i shall therefore conclude this short essay on that pleasure which the mind naturally conceives from the present season of the year by the recommending of a practice for which every one has sufficient abilities  i would have my readers endeavour to moralize this natural pleasure of the soul and to improve this vernal delight as milton calls it into a christian virtue when we find our selves inspired with this pleasing instinct this secret satisfaction and complacency arising from the beauties of the creation let us consider to whom we stand indebted for all these entertainments of sense and who it is that thus opens his hand and fills the world with good the apostle instructs us to take advantage of our present temper of mind to graft upon it such a religious exercise as is particularly conformable to it by that precept which advises those who are sad to pray and those who are merry to sing psalms the chearfulness of heart which springs up in us from the survey of natures works is an admirable preparation for gratitude the mind has gone a great way towards praise and thanksgiving that is filled with such a secret gladness a grateful reflection on the supreme cause who produces it sanctifies it in the soul and gives it its proper value such an habitual disposition of mind consecrates every field and wood turns an ordinary walk into a morning or evening sacrifice and will improve those transient gleams of joy which naturally brighten up and refresh the soul on such occasions into an inviolable and perpetual state of bliss and happiness  i    footnote   paradise lost bk iv ll

not only in the common and indifferent accidents of life but also in matters of greater importance you see in elections for members to sit in parliament how far saluting rows of old women drinking with clowns and being upon a level with the lowest part of mankind in that wherein they themselves are lowest their diversions will carry a candidate a capacity for prostituting a mans self in his behaviour and descending to the present humour of the vulgar is perhaps as good an ingredient as any other for making a considerable figure in the world and if a man has nothing else or better to think of he could not make his way to wealth and distinction by properer methods than studying the particular bent or inclination of people with whom he converses and working from the observation of such their biass in all matters wherein he has any intercourse with them for his ease and comfort he may assure himself he need not be at the expence of any great talent or virtue to please even those who are possessd of the highest qualifications pride in some particular disguise or other often a secret to the proud man himself is the most ordinary spring of action among men you need no more than to discover what a man values himself for then of all things admire that quality but be sure to be failing in it your self in comparison of the man whom you court i have heard or read of a secretary of state in spain who served a prince who was happy in an elegant use of the latin tongue and often writ dispatches in it with his own hand the king shewed his secretary a letter he had written to a foreign prince and under the colour of asking his advice laid a trap for his applause the honest man read it as a faithful counsellor and not only excepted against his tying himself down too much by some expressions but mended the phrase in others you may guess the dispatches that evening did not take much longer time mr secretary as soon as he came to his own house sent for his eldest son and communicated to him that the family must retire out of spain as soon as possible for said he the king knows i understand latin better than he does  this egregious fault in a man of the world should be a lesson to all who would make their fortunes but a regard must be carefully had to the person with whom you have to do for it is not to be doubted but a great man of common sense must look with secret indignation or bridled laughter on all the slaves who stand round him with ready faces to approve and smile at all he says in the gross it is good comedy enough to observe a superior talking half sentences and playing an humble admirers countenance from one thing to another with such perplexity that he knows not what to sneer in approbation of but this kind of complaisance is peculiarly the manner of courts in all other places you must constantly go farther in compliance with the persons you have to do with than a mere conformity of looks and gestures if you are in a country life and would be a leading man a good stomach a loud voice and a rustick chearfulness will go a great way provided you are able to drink and drink any thing but i was just now going to draw the manner of behaviour i would advise people to practise under some maxim and intimated that every one almost was governed by his pride there was an old fellow about forty years ago so peevish and fretful though a man of business that no one could come at him but he frequented a particular little coffeehouse where he triumphed over every body at tricktrack and baggammon the way to pass his office well was first to be insulted by him at one of those games in his leisure hours for his vanity was to shew that he was a man of pleasure as well as business next to this sort of insinuation which is called in all places from its taking its birth in the housholds of princes making ones court the most prevailing way is by what betterbred people call a present the vulgar a bribe i humbly conceive that such a thing is conveyed with more gallantry in a billetdoux that should be understood at the bank than in gross money but as to stubborn people who are so surly as to accept of neither note or cash having formerly dabbled in chymistry i can only say that one part of matter asks one thing and another another to make it fluent but there is nothing but may be dissolved by a proper mean thus the virtue which is too obdurate for gold or paper shall melt away very kindly in a liquid the island of barbadoes a shrewd people manage all their appeals to greatbritain by a skilful distribution of citronwater among the whisperers about men in power generous wines do every day prevail and that in great points where ten thousand times their value would have been rejected with indignation  but to wave the enumeration of the sundry ways of applying by presents bribes management of people passions and affections in such a manner as it shall appear that the virtue of the best man is by one method or other corruptible let us look out for some expedient to turn those passions and affections on the side of truth and honour when a man has laid it down for a position that parting with his integrity in the minutest circumstance is losing so much of his very self selflove will become a virtue by this means good and evil will be the only objects of dislike and approbation and he that injures any man has effectually wounded the man of this turn as much as if the harm had been to himself this seems to be the only expedient to arrive at an impartiality and a man who follows the dictates of truth and right reason may by artifice be led into error but never can into guilt  t                                               to the right honourable charles earl of sunderland    my lord  very many

unhappily neglected and cæsars confidence cost him his life i am apt to flatter my self that my pretty readers had much more regard to the advice i gave them since i have yet received very few accounts of any notorious trips made in the last month  but tho i hope for the best i shall not pronounce too positively on this point till i have seen forty weeks well over at which period of time as my good friend sir roger has often told me he has more business as a justice of peace among the dissolute young people in the country than at any other season of the year  neither must i forget a letter which i received near a fortnight since from a lady who it seems could hold out no longer telling me she looked upon the month as then out for that she had all along reckoned by the new style  on the other hand i have great reason to believe from several angry letters which have been sent to me by disappointed lovers that my advice has been of very signal service to the fair sex who according to the old proverb were forewarned forearmd  one of these gentlemen tells me that he would have given me an hundred pounds rather than i should have publishd that paper for that his mistress who had promised to explain herself to him about the beginning of may upon reading that discourse told him that she would give him her answer in june  thyrsis acquaints me that when he desired sylvia

mistress upon chocolate going to wait upon her the first of may he found his usual treat very much changed for the worse and has been forced to feed ever since upon green tea  as i begun this critical season with a caveat to the ladies i shall conclude it with a congratulation and do most heartily wish them joy of their happy deliverance  they may now reflect with pleasure on the dangers they have escaped and look back with as much satisfaction on their perils that threatned them as their greatgrandmothers did formerly on the burning ploughshares after having passed through the ordeal tryal the instigations of the spring are now abated the nightingale gives over her lovelabourd song as milton phrases it the blossoms are fallen and the beds of flowers swept away by the scythe of the mower  i shall now allow my fair readers to return to their romances and chocolate provided they make use of them with moderation till about the middle of the month when the sun shall have made some progress in the crab nothing is more dangerous than too much confidence and security the trojans who stood upon their guard all the while the grecians lay before their city when they fancied the siege was raised and the danger past were the very next night burnt in their beds i must also observe that as in some climates there is a perpetual spring so in some female constitutions there is a perpetual may these are a kind of valetudinarians in chastity whom i would continue in a constant diet i cannot think these wholly out of danger till they have looked upon the other sex at least five years through a pair of spectacles will honeycomb has often assured me that its much easier to steal one of this species when she has passed her grand climacterick than to carry off an icy girl on this side five and twenty and that a rake of his acquaintance who had in vain endeavoured to gain the affections of a young lady of fifteen had at last made his fortune by running away with her grandmother  but as i do not design this speculation for the evergreens of the sex i shall again apply my self to those who would willingly listen to the dictates of reason and virtue and can now hear me in cold blood if there are any who have forfeited their innocence they must now consider themselves under that melancholy view in which chamont regards his sister in those beautiful lines   long she flourishd   grew sweet to sense and lovely to the eye   till at the last a cruel spoiler came   cropt this fair rose and rifled all its sweetness   then cast it like a loathsome weed away    on the contrary she who has observed the timely cautions i gave her and lived up to the rules of modesty will now flourish like a rose in june with all her virgin blushes and sweetness about her i must however desire these last to consider how shameful it would be for a general who has made a successful campaign to be surprized in his winter quarters it would be no less dishonourable for a lady to lose in any other month of the year what she has been at the pains to preserve in may  there is no charm in the female sex that can supply the place of virtue without innocence beauty is unlovely and quality contemptible goodbreeding degenerates into wantonness and wit into impudence it is observed that all the virtues are represented by both painters and statuaries under female shapes but if any one of them has a more particular title to that sex it is modesty i shall leave it to the divines to guard them against the opposite vice as they may be overpowerd by temptations it is sufficient for me to have warned them against it as they may be led astray by instinct  i desire this paper may be read with more than ordinary attention at all teatables within the cities of london and westminster  x

philobrune dear sir as you are by character a profest wellwisher to   speculation you will excuse a remark which this gentlemans passion   for the brunette has suggested to a brother theorist tis an offer   towards a mechanical account of his lapse to punning for he belongs   to a set of mortals who value themselves upon an uncommon mastery in   the more humane and polite part of letters a conquest by one of this   species of females gives a very odd turn to the intellectuals of the   captivated person and very different from that way of thinking which   a triumph from the eyes of another more emphatically of the fair sex   does generally occasion it fills the imagination with an assemblage   of such ideas and pictures as are hardly any thing but shade such as   night the devil

would not be a very serviceable expedient and abate   that overflow of light which shines within them so powerfully that it   dazzles their eyes and dances them into a thousand vagaries of error   and

farther observable   that the delicate spirits among us who declare against these nauseous   proceedings sip tea and put up for critic and amour profess   likewise an equal abhorrency for punning the ancient innocent   diversion of this society after all sir tho it may appear   something absurd that i seem to approach you with the air of an   advocate for punning you who have justified your censures of the   practice in a set dissertation upon that subject yet im confident   youll think it abundantly atoned for by observing that this humbler   exercise may be as instrumental in diverting us from any innovating   schemes and hypothesis in wit as dwelling upon honest orthodox logic   would be in securing us from heresie in religion had mr wns     researches been confined within the bounds of ramus or crackanthorp   that learned newsmonger might have acquiesced in what the holy   oracles pronounce upon the deluge like other christians and had the   surprising mr ly  been content

general they will not allow a wise man so much as to pity the afflictions of another if thou seest thy friend in trouble says epictetus thou mayst put on a look of sorrow and condole with him but take care that thy sorrow be not real   the more rigid of this sect would not comply so far as to shew even such an outward appearance of grief but when one told them of any calamity that had befallen even the nearest of their acquaintance would immediately reply what is that to me if you aggravated the circumstances of the affliction and shewed how one misfortune was followed by another the answer was still all this may be true but what is it to me  for my own part i am of opinion compassion does not only refine and civilize humane nature but has something in it more pleasing and agreeable than what can be met with in such an indolent happiness such an indifference to mankind as that in which the stoicks placed their wisdom as love is the most delightful passion pity is nothing else but love softned by a degree of sorrow in short it is a kind of pleasing anguish as well as generous sympathy that knits mankind together and blends them in the same common lot  those who have laid down rules for rhetorick or poetry advise the writer to work himself up if possible to the pitch of sorrow which he endeavours to produce in others there are none therefore who stir up pity so much as those who indite their own sufferings grief has a natural eloquence belonging to it and breaks out in more moving sentiments than be supplied by the finest imagination nature on this occasion dictates a thousand passionate things which cannot be supplied by art  it is for this reason that the short speeches or sentences which we often meet with in histories make a deeper impression on the mind of the reader than the most laboured strokes in a wellwritten tragedy truth and matter of fact sets the person actually before us in the one whom fiction places at a greater distance from us in the other i

resentments of an injured woman and the sorrows of an imprisoned queen i need not acquaint my reader that this princess was then under prosecution for disloyalty to the kings bed and that she was

fellow has a thin body swift step demure looks sufficient sense and knows the town this man carried cynthios first letter to flavia and by frequent errands ever since is well known to her the fellow covers his knowledge of the nature of his messages with the most exquisite low humour imaginable the first he obliged flavia to take was by complaining to her that he had a wife and three children and if she did not take that letter which he was sure there was no harm in but rather love his family must go supperless to bed for the gentleman would pay him according as he did his business robin therefore cynthio now thought fit to make use of and gave him orders to wait before flavias door and if she called him to her and asked whether it was cynthio who passed by he should at first be loth to own it was but upon importunity confess it there needed not much search into that part of the town to find a welldressed hussey fit for the purpose cynthio designed her as soon as he believed robin was posted he drove by flavias lodgings in an hackneycoach and a woman in it robin was at the door talking with flavias maid and cynthio pulled up the glass as surprized and hid his associate the report of this circumstance soon flew up stairs and robin could not deny but the gentleman favoured his master yet if it was he he was sure the lady was but his cousin whom he had seen ask for him adding that he believed she was a poor relation because they made her wait one morning till he was awake flavia immediately writ the following epistle which robin brought to wills     june           sir    it is in vain to deny it basest falsest of mankind my maid as well   as the bearer saw you    the injurd flavia   after cynthio had read the letter he asked robin how she looked and what she said at the delivery of it robin said she spoke short to him and called him back again and had nothing to say to him and bid him and all the men in the world go out of her sight but the maid followed and bid him bring an answer  cynthio returned as follows     june   three afternoon         madam    that your maid and the bearer has seen me very often is very certain   but i desire to know being engaged at picket what your letter means   by tis in vain to deny it i shall stay here all the evening    your amazed cynthio   as soon as robin arrived with this flavia answered     dear cynthio    i have walked a turn or two in my antichamber since i writ to you   and have recovered my self from an impertinent fit which you ought to   forgive me and desire you would come to me immediately to laugh off a   jealousy that you and a creature of the town went by in an   hackneycoach an hour ago i am your most humble servant    flavia    i will not open the letter which my cynthio writ upon the   misapprehension you must have been under when you writ for want of   hearing the whole circumstance   robin came back in an instant and cynthio answered     half hour six minutes after three    june   wills coffeehouse    madam it is certain i went by your lodgings with a gentlewoman to   whom i have the honour to be known she is indeed my relation and a   pretty sort of woman but your starting manner of writing and owning   you have not done me the honour so much as to open my letter has in   it something very unaccountable and alarms one that has had thoughts   of passing his days with you but i am born to admire you with all   your little imperfections    cynthio   robin run back and brought for answer     exact sir that are at wills coffeehouse six minutes after three   june   one that has had thoughts and all my little imperfections   sir come to me immediately or i shall determine what may perhaps not   be very pleasing to you   flavia   robin gave an account that she looked excessive angry when she gave him the letter and that he told her for she asked that cynthio only looked at the clock taking snuff and writ two or three words on the top of the letter when he gave him his  now the plot thickened so well as that cynthio saw he had not much more to do to accomplish being irreconciliably banished he writ     madam   i have that prejudice in favour of all you do that it is not possible   for you to determine upon what will not be very pleasing to your   obedient servant   cynthio   this was delivered and the answer returned in a little more than two seconds    sir   is it come to this you never loved me and the creature you were with   is the properest person for your associate i despise you and hope i   shall soon hate you as a villain to   the credulous flavia   robin ran back with     madam   your credulity when you are to gain your point and suspicion when you   fear to lose it make it a very hard part to behave as becomes your   humble slave   cynthio   robin whipt away and returned with     mr wellford   flavia and cynthio are no more i relieve you from the hard part of   which you complain and banish you from my sight for ever   ann heart   robin had a crown for his afternoons work and this is published to admonish cecilia to avenge the injury done to flavia  t                                        no                   saturday june                        addison      ut nemo in sese tentat descendere    pers    hypocrisie at the fashionable end of the town is very different from hypocrisie in the city the modish hypocrite endeavours to appear more vicious than he really is the other kind of hypocrite more virtuous the former is afraid of every thing that has the shew of religion in it and would be thought engaged in many criminal gallantries and amours which he is not guilty of the latter assumes a face of sanctity and covers a multitude of vices under a seeming religious deportment  but there is another kind of hypocrisie which differs from both these and which i intend to make the subject of this paper i mean that hypocrisie by which a man does not only deceive the world but very often imposes on himself that hypocrisie which conceals his own heart from him and makes him believe he is more virtuous than he really is and either not attend to his vices or mistake even his vices for virtues it is this fatal hypocrisie and selfdeceit which is taken notice of in those words who can understand his errors cleanse thou me from secret faults    if the open professors of impiety deserve the utmost application and endeavours of moral writers to recover them from vice and folly how much more may those lay a claim to their care and compassion who are walking in the paths of death while they fancy themselves engaged in a course of virtue i shall endeavour therefore to lay down some rules for the discovery of those vices that lurk in the secret corners of the soul and to show my reader those methods by which he may arrive at a true and impartial knowledge of himself the usual means prescribed for this purpose are to examine our selves by the rules which are laid down for our direction in sacred writ and to compare our lives with the life of that person who acted up to the perfection of human nature and is the standing example as well as the great guide and instructor of those who receive his doctrines though these two heads cannot be too much insisted upon i shall but just mention them since they have been handled by many great and eminent writers  i would therefore propose the following methods to the consideration of such as would find out their secret faults and make a true estimate of themselves  in the first place let them consider well what are the characters which they bear among their enemies our friends very often flatter us as much as our own hearts they either do not see our faults or conceal them from us or soften them by their representations after such a manner that we think them too trivial to be taken notice of an adversary on the contrary makes a stricter search into us discovers every flaw and imperfection in our tempers and though his malice may set them in too strong a light it has generally some ground for what it advances a friend exaggerates a mans virtues an enemy inflames his crimes a wise man should give a just attention to both of them so far as they may tend to the improvement of the one and diminution of the other plutarch has written an essay on the benefits which a man may receive from his enemies   and among the good fruits of enmity mentions this in particular that by the reproaches which it casts upon us we see the worst side of our selves and open our eyes to several blemishes and defects in our lives and conversations which we should not have observed without the help of such illnatured monitors  in order likewise to come at a true knowledge of our selves we should consider on the other hand how far we may deserve the praises and approbations which the world bestow upon us whether the actions they celebrate proceed from laudable and worthy motives and how far we are really possessed of the virtues which gain us applause among those with whom we converse such a reflection is absolutely necessary if we consider how apt we are either to value or condemn ourselves by the opinions of others and to sacrifice the report of our own hearts to the judgment of the world  in the next place that we may not deceive our selves in a point of so much importance we should not lay too great a stress on any supposed virtues we possess that are of a doubtful nature and such we may esteem all those in which multitudes of men dissent from us who are as good and wise as our selves we should always act with great cautiousness and circumspection in points where it is not impossible that we may be deceived intemperate zeal bigotry and persecution for any party or opinion how praiseworthy soever they may appear to weak men of our own principles produce infinite calamities among mankind and are highly criminal in their own nature and yet how many persons eminent for piety suffer such monstrous and absurd principles of action to take root in their minds under the colour of virtues for my own part i must own i never yet knew any party so just and reasonable that a man could follow it in its height and violence and at the same time be innocent  we should likewise be very apprehensive of those actions which proceed from natural constitution favourite passions particular education or whatever promotes our worldly interest or advantage in these and the like cases a mans judgment is easily perverted and a wrong bias hung upon his mind these are the inlets of prejudice the unguarded avenues of the mind by which a thousand errors and secret faults find admission without being observed or taken notice of a wise man will suspect those actions to which he is directed by something besides   reason and always apprehend some concealed evil in every resolution that is of a disputable nature when it is conformable to his particular temper his age or way of life or when it favours his pleasure or his profit  there is nothing of greater importance to us than thus diligently to sift our thoughts and examine all these dark recesses of the mind if we would establish our souls in such a solid and substantial virtue as will turn to account in that great day when it must stand the test of infinite wisdom and justice  i shall conclude this essay with observing that the two kinds of hypocrisie i have here spoken of namely that of deceiving the world and that of imposing on our selves are touched with wonderful beauty in the hundred and thirty ninth psalm the folly of the first kind of hypocrisie is there set forth by reflections on gods omniscience and omnipresence which are celebrated in as noble strains of poetry as any other i ever met with either sacred or profane the other kind of hypocrisie whereby a man deceives himself is intimated in the two last verses where the psalmist addresses himself to the great searcher of hearts in that emphatical petition try me o god and seek the ground of my heart prove me and examine my thoughts look well if there be any way of wickedness in me and lead me in the way everlasting  l    footnote   psalm xix      footnote   see

corrected when there is a tenderness or admiration expressed which partakes the passion licentious language has something brutal in it which disgraces humanity and leaves us in the condition of the savages in the field but it may be askd to what good use can tend a discourse of this kind at all it is to alarm chaste ears against such as have what is above called the prevailing gentle art masters of that talent are capable of cloathing their thoughts in so soft a dress and something so distant from the secret purpose of their heart that the imagination of the unguarded is touched with a fondness which grows too insensibly to be resisted much care and concern for the ladys welfare to seem afraid lest she should be annoyed by the very air which surrounds her and this uttered rather with kind looks and expressed by an interjection an ah or an oh at some little hazard in moving or making a step than in my direct profession of love are the methods of skilful admirers they are honest arts when their purpose is such but infamous when misapplied it is certain that many a young woman in this town has had her heart irrecoverably won by men who have not made one advance which ties their admirers tho the females languish with the utmost anxiety i have often by way of admonition to my female readers give them warning against agreeable company of the other sex except they are well acquainted with their characters women may disguise it if they think fit and the more to do it they may be angry at me for saying it but i say it is natural to them that they have no manner of approbation of men without some degree of love for this reason he is dangerous to be entertaind as a friend or visitant who is capable of gaining any eminent esteem or observation though it be never so remote from pretensions as a lover if a mans heart has not the abhorrence of any treacherous design he may easily improve approbation into kindness and kindness into passion there may possibly be no manner of love between them in the eyes of all their acquaintance no it is all friendship and yet they may be as fond as shepherd and shepherdess in a pastoral but still the nymph and the swain may be to each other no other i warrant you than pylades and orestes    when lucy decks with flowers her swelling breast   and on her elbow leans dissembling rest   unable to refrain my madding mind   nor

i did amiss    such good offices as these and such friendly thoughts and concerns for one another are what make up the amity as they call it between man and woman  it is the permission of such intercourse that makes a young woman come to the arms of her husband after the disappointment of four or five passions which she has successively had for different men before she is prudentially given

the company of agreeable women as much as possible and must confess that i have though a tolerable good philosopher but a low opinion of platonick love for which reason i thought it necessary to give

have often confessd that you are not displeased your paper   should sometimes convey the complaints of distressed lovers to each   other i am in hopes you will favour one who gives you an undoubted   instance of her reformation and at the same time a convincing proof   of the happy influence your labours have had over the most   incorrigible part of the most incorrigible sex you must know sir i   am one of that species of women whom you have often characterizd   under the name of jilts and that i send you these lines as well to   do publick penance for having so long continued in a known error as   to beg pardon of the party offended i the rather chuse this way   because it in some measure answers the terms on which he intimated the   breach between us might possibly be made up as you will see by the   letter he sent me the next day after i had discarded him which i   thought fit to send you a copy of that you might the better know the   whole case    i must further acquaint you that before i jilted him there had been   the greatest intimacy between us for an year and half together during   all which time i cherished his hopes and indulged his flame i leave   you to guess after this what must be his surprize when upon his   pressing for my full consent one day i told him i wondered what could   make him fancy he had ever any place in my affections his own sex   allow him sense and all ours goodbreeding his person is such as   might without vanity make him believe himself not incapable to be   beloved our fortunes indeed weighed in the nice scale of interest   are not exactly equal which by the way was the true case of my   jilting him and i had the assurance to acquaint him with the   following maxim that i should always believe that mans passion to be   the most violent who could offer me the largest settlement i have   since changed my opinion and have endeavoured to let him know so much   by several letters but the barbarous man has refused them all so   that i have no way left of writing to him but by your assistance if   we can bring him about once more i promise to send you all gloves and   favours and shall desire the favour of sir roger and your self to   stand as godfathers to my first boy   i am sir   your most obedient   most humble servant   amoret       philander to amoret      madam      i am so surprised at the question you were pleased to ask me     yesterday that i am still at a loss what to say to it at least my     answer would be too long to trouble you with as it would come from     a person who it seems is so very indifferent to you instead of     it i shall only recommend to your consideration the opinion of one     whose sentiments on these matters i have often heard you say are     extremely just a generous and constant passion says your favourite     author in an agreeable lover where there is not too great a     disparity in their circumstances is the greatest blessing that can     befal a person beloved and if overlookd in one may perhaps never     be found in another      i do not however at all despair of being very shortly much better     beloved by you than antenor is at present since whenever my fortune     shall exceed his you were pleased to intimate your passion would     encrease accordingly      the world has seen me shamefully lose that time to please a fickle     woman which might have been employed much more to my credit and     advantage in other pursuits i shall therefore take the liberty to     acquaint you however harsh it may sound in a ladys ears that tho     your lovefit should happen to return unless you could contrive a     way to make your recantation as well known to the publick as they     are already apprised of the manner with which you have treated me     you shall never more see philander        amoret to philander      sir      upon reflection i find the injury i have done both to you and my     self to be so great that though the part i now act may appear     contrary to that decorum usually observed by our sex yet i     purposely break through all rules that my repentance may in some     measure equal my crime i assure you that in my present hopes of     recovering you i look upon antenors estate with contempt the fop     was here yesterday in a gilt chariot and new liveries but i refused     to see him tho i dread to meet your eyes after what has passd i     flatter my self that amidst all their confusion you will discover     such a tenderness in mine as none can imitate but those who love i     shall be all this month at lady ds in the country but the woods     the fields and gardens without philander afford no pleasures to     the unhappy amoret     i must desire you dear mr spectator to publish this my letter to

which can have no recourse to any legal power for redress and seem to have written rather to vent their sorrow than to receive consolation     mr spectator    i am a young woman of beauty and quality and suitably married to a   gentleman who doats on me but this person of mine is the object of an   unjust passion in a nobleman who is very intimate with my husband   this friendship gives him very easie access and frequent   opportunities of entertaining me apart my heart is in the utmost   anguish and my face is covered over with confusion when i impart to   you another circumstance which is that my mother the most mercenary   of all women is gained by this false friend of my husband to sollicit   me for him i am frequently chid by the poor believing man my husband   for shewing an impatience of his friends company and i am never   alone with my mother but she tells me stories of the discretionary   part of the world and such a one and such a one who are guilty of as   much as she advises me to she laughs at my astonishment and seems to   hint to me that as virtuous as she has always appeared i am not the   daughter of her husband it is possible that printing this letter may   relieve me from the unnatural importunity of my mother and the   perfidious courtship of my husbands friend i have an unfeigned love   of virtue and am resolved to preserve my innocence the only way i   can think of to avoid the fatal consequences of the discovery of this   matter is to fly away for ever which i must do to avoid my husbands   fatal resentment against the man who attempts to abuse him and the   shame of exposing the parent to infamy the persons concerned will   know these circumstances relate to em and though the regard to   virtue is dead in them i have some hopes from their fear of shame   upon reading this in your paper which i conjure you to do if you   have any compassion for injured virtue    sylvia     mr spectator    i am the husband of a woman of merit but am fallen in love as they   call it with a lady of her acquaintance who is going to be married   to a gentleman who deserves her i am in a trust relating to this   ladys fortune which makes my concurrence in this matter necessary   but i have so irresistible a rage and envy rise in me when i consider   his future happiness that against all reason equity and common   justice i am ever playing mean tricks to suspend the nuptials i have   no manner of hopes for my self emilia for so ill call her is a   woman of the most strict virtue her lover is a gentleman who of all   others i could wish my friend but envy and jealousie though placed   so unjustly waste my very being and with the torment and sense of a   daemon i am ever cursing what i cannot but approve i wish it were   the beginning of repentance that i sit down and describe my present   disposition with so hellish an aspect but at present the destruction   of these two excellent persons would be more welcome to me than their   happiness mr spectator pray let me have a paper on these terrible   groundless sufferings and do all you can to exorcise crowds who are   in some degree possessed as i am    canniball     mr spectator    i have no other means but this to express my thanks to one man and my   resentment against another my circumstances are as follows i have   been for five years last past courted by a gentleman of greater   fortune than i ought to expect as the market for women goes you must   to be sure have observed people who live in that sort of way as all   their friends reckon it will be a match and are marked out by all the   world for each other in this view we have been regarded for some   time and i have above these three years loved him tenderly as he is   very careful of his fortune i always thought he lived in a near   manner to lay up what he thought was wanting in my fortune to make up   what he might expect in another within few months i have observed his   carriage very much altered and he has affected a certain air of   getting me alone and talking with a mighty profusion of passionate   words how i am not to be resisted longer how irresistible his wishes   are and the like as long as i have been acquainted with him i could   not on such occasions say downright to him you know you may make me   yours when you please but the other night he with great frankness and   impudence explained to me that he thought of me only as a mistress i   answered this declaration as it deservd upon which he only doubled   the terms on which he proposed my yielding when my anger heightned   upon him he told me he was sorry he had made so little use of the   unguarded hours we had been together so remote from company as   indeed continued he so we are at present i flew from him to a   neighbouring gentlewomans house and tho her husband was in the   room threw my self on a couch and burst into a passion of tears my   friend desired her husband to leave the room but said he there is   something so extraordinary in this that i will partake in the   affliction and be it what it will she is so much your friend that   she knows she may command what services i can do her the man sate   down by me and spoke so like a brother that i told him my whole   affliction he spoke of the injury done me with so much indignation   and animated me against the love he said he saw i had for the wretch   who would have betrayed me with so much reason and humanity to my   weakness that i doubt not of my perseverance his wife and he are my   comforters and i am under no more restraint in their company than if   i were alone and i doubt not but in a small time contempt and hatred   will take place of the remains of affection to a rascal    i am    sir    your

respective customs manners and interests the courts of two countries do not so much differ from one another as the court and city in their peculiar ways of life and conversation in short the inhabitants of st jamess notwithstanding they live under the same laws and speak the same language are a distinct people from those of cheapside who are likewise removed from those of the temple on the one side and those of smithfield on the other by several climates and degrees in their way of thinking and conversing together  for this reason when any publick affair is upon the anvil i love to hear the reflections that arise upon it in the several districts and parishes of london and westminster and to ramble up and down a whole day together in order to make my self acquainted with the opinions of my ingenious countrymen by this means i know the faces of all the principal politicians within the bills of mortality and as every coffeehouse has some particular statesman belonging to it who is the mouth of the street where he lives i always take care to place my self near him in order to know his judgment on the present posture of affairs the last progress that i made with this intention was about three months ago when we had a current report of the king of frances death as i foresaw this would produce a new face of things in europe and many curious speculations in our british coffeehouses i was very desirous to learn the thoughts of our most eminent politicians on that occasion  that i might begin as near the fountain head as possible i first of all called in at st jamess where i found the whole outward room in a buzz of politics the speculations were but very indifferent towards the door but grew finer as you advanced to the upper end of the room and were so very much improved by a knot of theorists who sat in the inner room within the steams of the coffeepot that i there heard the whole spanish monarchy disposed of and all the line of bourbon provided for in less than a quarter of an hour  i afterwards called in at giless where i saw a board of french gentlemen sitting upon the life and death of their grand monarque those among them who had espoused the whig interest very positively affirmed that he departed this life about a week since and therefore proceeded without any further delay to the release of their friends on the gallies and to their own reestablishment but finding they could not agree among themselves i proceeded on my intended progress  upon my arrival at jenny mans i saw an alerte young fellow that cocked his hat upon a friend of his who entered just at the same time with my self and accosted him after the following manner well jack the old prig is dead at last sharps the word now or never boy up to the walls of paris directly with several other deep reflections of the same nature  i met with very little variation in the politics between charingcross and coventgarden and upon my going into wills i found their discourse was gone off from the death of the french king to that of monsieur boileau racine corneile and several other poets whom they regretted on this occasion as persons who would have obliged the world with very noble elegies on the death of so great a prince and so eminent a patron of learning  at a coffeehouse near the temple i found a couple of young gentlemen engaged very smartly in a dispute on the succession to the spanish monarchy one of them seemed to have been retained as advocate for the duke of anjou the other for his imperial majesty they were both for regulating the title to that kingdom by the statute laws of england but finding them going out of my depth i passed forward to pauls churchyard where i listend with great attention to a learned man who gave the company an account of the deplorable state of france during the minority of the deceased king i then turned on my right hand into fishstreet where the chief politician of that quarter upon hearing the news after having taken a pipe of tobacco and ruminated for some time if says he the king of france is certainly dead we shall have plenty of mackerell this season our fishery will not be disturbed by privateers as it has been for these ten years past he afterwards considered how the death of this great man would affect our pilchards and by several other remarks infused a general joy into his whole audience  i afterwards entered a by coffeehouse that stood at the upper end of a narrow lane where i met with a nonjuror engaged very warmly with a laceman who was the great support of a neighbouring conventicle the matter in debate was whether the late french king was most like augustus cæsar or nero the controversie was carried on with great heat on both sides and as each of them looked upon me very frequently during the course of their debate i was under some apprehension that they would appeal to me and therefore laid down my penny at the bar and made the best of my way to cheapside  i here gazed upon the signs for some time before i found one to my purpose the first object i met in the coffeeroom was a person who expressed a great grief for the death of the french king but upon his explaining himself i found his sorrow did not arise from the loss of the monarch but for his having sold out of the bank about three days before he heard the news of it upon which a haberdasher who was the oracle of the coffeehouse and had his circle of admirers about him called several to witness that he had declared his opinion above a week before that the french king was certainly dead to which he added that considering the late advices we had received from france it was impossible that it could be otherwise as he was laying these together and dictating to his hearers with great authority there came in a gentleman from garraways who told us that there were several letters from france just come in with advice that the king was in good health and was gone out a hunting the very morning the post came away upon which the haberdasher stole off his hat that hung upon a wooden pegg by him and retired to his shop with great confusion this intelligence put a stop to my travels which i had prosecuted with much   satisfaction not being a little pleased to hear so many different opinions upon so great an event and to observe how naturally upon such a piece of news every one is apt to consider it with a regard to his own particular interest and advantage  l    footnote   great                                               no  0                 friday june

course and sphere of action from which if it in the least deviates it becomes unfit to answer those ends for which it was designed in like manner it is in the dispositions of society the civil oeconomy is formed in a chain as well as the natural and in either case the breach but of one link puts the whole into some disorder it is i think pretty plain that most of the absurdity and ridicule we meet with in the world is generally owing to the impertinent affectation of excelling in characters men are not fit for and for which nature never designed them  every man has one or more qualities which may make him useful both to himself and others nature never fails of pointing them out and while the infant continues under her guardianship she brings him on in this way and then offers her self for a guide in what remains of the journey if he proceeds in that course he can hardly miscarry nature makes good her engagements for as she never promises what she is not able to perform so she never fails of performing what she promises but the misfortune is men despise what they may be masters of and affect what they are not fit for they reckon themselves already possessed of what their genius inclined them to and so bend all their ambition to excel in what is out of their reach thus they destroy the use of their natural talents in the same manner as covetous men do their quiet and repose they can enjoy no satisfaction in what they have because of the absurd inclination they are possessed with for what they have not  cleanthes had good sense a great memory and a constitution capable of the closest application in a word there was no profession in which cleanthes might not have made a very good figure but this wont satisfie him he takes up an unaccountable fondness for the character of a fine gentleman all his thoughts are bent upon this instead of attending a dissection frequenting the courts of justice or studying the fathers cleanthes reads plays dances dresses and spends his time in drawingrooms instead of being a good lawyer divine or physician cleanthes is a downright coxcomb and will remain to all that knew him a contemptible example of talents misapplied it is to this affectation the world owes its whole race of coxcombs nature in her whole drama never drew such a part she has sometimes made a fool but a coxcomb is always of a mans own making by applying his talents otherwise than nature designed who ever bears an high resentment for being put out of her course and never fails of taking her revenge on those that do so opposing her tendency in the application of a mans parts has the same success as declining from her course in the production of vegetables by the assistance of art and an hot bed we may possibly extort an unwilling plant or an untimely sallad but how weak how tasteless and insipid just as insipid as the poetry of valerio valerio had an universal character was genteel had learning thought justly spoke correctly twas believed there was nothing in which valerio did not excel and twas so far true that there was but one valerio had no genius for poetry yet hes resolved to be a poet he writes verses and takes great pains to convince the town that valerio is not that extraordinary person he was taken for  if men would be content to graft upon nature and assist her operations what mighty effects might we expect tully would not stand so much alone in oratory virgil in poetry or cæsar in war to build upon nature is laying the foundation upon a rock every thing disposes its self into order as it were of course and the whole work is half done as soon as undertaken ciceros genius inclined him to oratory virgils to follow the train of the muses they piously obeyed the admonition and were rewarded had virgil attended the bar his modest and ingenious virtue would surely have made but a very indifferent figure and tullys declamatory inclination would have been as useless in poetry nature if left to her self leads us on in the best course but will do nothing by compulsion and constraint and if we are not satisfied to go her way we are always the greatest sufferers by it  wherever nature designs a production she always disposes seeds proper for it which are as absolutely necessary to the formation of any moral or intellectual excellence as they are to the being and growth of plants and i know not by what fate and folly it is that men are taught not to reckon him equally absurd that will write verses in spite of nature with that gardener that should undertake to raise a jonquil or tulip without the help of their respective seeds  as there is no good or bad quality that does not affect both sexes so it is not to be imagined but the fair sex must have suffered by an affectation of this nature at least as much as the other the ill effect of it is in none so conspicuous as in the two opposite characters of cælia and iras cælia has all the charms of person together with an abundant sweetness of nature but wants wit and has a very ill voice iras is ugly and ungenteel but has wit and good sense if cælia would be silent her beholders would adore her if iras would talk her hearers would admire her but cælias tongue runs incessantly while iras gives her self silent airs and soft languors so that tis difficult to persuade ones self that cælia has beauty and iras wit each neglects her own excellence and is ambitious of the others character iras would be thought to have as much beauty as cælia and cælia as much wit as iras  the great misfortune of this affectation is that men not only lose a good quality but also contract a bad one they not only are unfit for what they were designed but they assign themselves to what they are not fit for and instead of making a very good figure one way make a very ridiculous one another if semanthe would have been satisfied with her natural complexion she might still have been celebrated by the name of the olive beauty but semanthe has taken up an affectation to white and red and is now distinguished by the character of the lady that paints so well in a word could the world be reformed to the obedience of that famed dictate follow nature which the oracle of delphos pronounced to cicero when he consulted what course of studies he should pursue we should see almost every man as eminent in his proper sphere as tully was in his and should in a very short time find impertinence and affectation banished from among the women and coxcombs and false characters from among the men for my part i could never consider this preposterous repugnancy to nature any otherwise than not only as the greatest folly but also one of the most heinous crimes since it is a direct opposition to the disposition of providence and as tully expresses it like the sin of the giants an actual rebellion against heaven  z    footnote      continuo has leges æternaque foedera certis   imposuit natura locis  virg                                               no  0

  hom    i am very sorry to find by the opera bills for this day that we are likely to lose the greatest performer in dramatick musick that is now living or that perhaps ever appeared upon a stage i need not acquaint my reader that i am speaking of signior nicolini   the town is highly obliged to that excellent artist for having shewn us the italian musick in its perfection as well as for that generous approbation he lately gave to an opera of our own country in which the composer endeavoured to do justice to the beauty of the words by following that noble example which has been set him by the greatest foreign masters in that art  i could heartily wish there was the same application and endeavours to cultivate and improve our churchmusick as have been lately bestowed on that of the stage our composers have one very great incitement to it they are sure to meet with excellent words and at the same time a wonderful variety of them there is no passion that is not finely expressed in those parts of the inspired writings which are proper for divine songs and anthems  there is a certain coldness and indifference in the phrases of our european languages when they are compared with the oriental forms of speech and it happens very luckily that the hebrew idioms run into the english tongue with a particular grace and beauty our language has received innumerable elegancies and improvements from that infusion of hebraisms which are derived to it out of the poetical passages in holy writ they give a force and energy to our expressions warm and animate our language and convey our thoughts in more ardent and intense phrases than any that are to be met with in our own tongue there is something so pathetick in this kind of diction that it often sets the mind in a flame and makes our hearts burn within us how cold and dead does a prayer appear that is composed in the most elegant and polite forms of speech which are natural to our tongue when it is not heightened by that solemnity of phrase which may be drawn from the sacred writings it has been said by some of the ancients that if the gods were to talk with men they would certainly speak in platos style but i think we may say with justice that when mortals converse with their creator they cannot do it in so proper a style as in that of the holy scriptures  if any one would judge of the beauties of poetry that are to be met with in the divine writings and examine how kindly the hebrew manners of speech mix and incorporate with the english language after having perused the book of psalms let him read a literal translation of horace or pindar he will find in these two last such an absurdity and confusion of style with such a comparative poverty of imagination as will make him very sensible of what i have been here advancing  since we have therefore such a treasury of words so beautiful in themselves and so proper for the airs of musick i cannot but wonder that persons of distinction should give so little attention and encouragement to that kind of musick which would have its foundation in reason and which would improve our virtue in proportion as it raised our delight the passions that are excited by ordinary compositions generally flow from such silly and absurd occasions that a man is ashamed to reflect upon them seriously but the fear the love the sorrow the indignation that are awakened in the mind by hymns and anthems make the heart better and proceed from such causes as are altogether reasonable and praiseworthy pleasure and duty go hand in hand and the greater our satisfaction is the greater is our religion  musick among those who were styled the chosen people was a religious art the songs of sion which we have reason to believe were in high repute among the courts of the eastern monarchs were nothing else but psalms and pieces of poetry that adored or celebrated the supreme being the greatest conqueror in this holy nation after the manner of the old grecian lyricks did not only compose the words of his divine odes but generally set them to musick himself after which his works tho they were consecrated to the tabernacle became the national entertainment as well as the devotion of his people  the first original of the drama was a religious worship consisting only of a chorus which was nothing else but an hymn to a deity as luxury and voluptuousness prevailed over innocence and religion this form of worship degenerated into tragedies in which however the chorus so far remembered its first office as to brand every thing that was vicious and recommend every thing that was laudable to intercede with heaven for the innocent and to implore its vengeance on the criminal  homer and hesiod intimate to us how this art should be applied when they represent the muses as surrounding jupiter and warbling their hymns about his throne i might shew from innumerable passages in ancient writers not only that vocal and instrumental musick were made use of in their religious worship but that their most favourite diversions were filled with songs and hymns to their respective deities had we frequent entertainments of this nature among us they would not a little purifie and exalt our passions give our thoughts a proper turn and cherish those divine impulses in the soul which every one feels that has not stifled them by sensual and immoderate pleasures  musick when thus applied raises noble hints in the mind of the hearer and fills it with great conceptions it strengthens devotion and advances praise into rapture it lengthens out every act of worship and produces more lasting and permanent impressions in the mind than those which accompany any transient form of words that are uttered in the ordinary method of religious worship  o    footnote   see note on p    vol i footnote   of no    he took leave june    in the opera of antiochus                                               no  0                 monday

taste in solitude for i know no fault in the description of ardent desires provided they are honourable     dear sir    you have obliged me with a very kind letter by which i find you shift   the scene of your life from the town to the country and enjoy that   mixt state which wise men both delight in and are qualified for   methinks most of the philosophers and moralists have run too much into   extreams in praising entirely either solitude or publick life in the   former men generally grow useless by too much rest and in the latter   are destroyed by too much precipitation as waters lying still   putrifie and are good for nothing and running violently on do but   the more mischief in their passage to others and are swallowed up and   lost the sooner themselves those who like you can make themselves   useful to all states should be like gentle streams that not only   glide through lonely vales and forests amidst the flocks and   shepherds but visit populous towns in their course and are at once   of ornament and service to them but there is another sort of people   who seem designed for solitude those i mean who have more to hide   than to shew as for my own part i am one of those of whom seneca   says tum umbratiles sunt ut putent in turbido esse quicquid in luce   est some men like pictures are fitter for a corner than a full   light and i believe such as have a natural bent to solitude are like   waters which may be forced into fountains and exalted to a great   height may make a much nobler figure and a much louder noise but   after all run more smoothly equally and plentifully in their own   natural course upon the ground the consideration of this would make   me very well contented with the possession only of that quiet which   cowley calls the companion of obscurity but whoever has the muses too   for his companions can never be idle enough to be uneasie thus sir   you see i would flatter my self into a good opinion of my own way of

mistresses this is addressed by the lover to his raindeer   which is the creature that in that country supplies the want of   horses the circumstances which successively present themselves to him   in his way are i believe you will think naturally interwoven the   anxiety of absence the gloominess of the roads and his resolution of   frequenting only those since those only can carry him to the object   of his desires the dissatisfaction he expresses even at the greatest   swiftness with which he is carried and his joyful surprize at an   unexpected sight of his mistress as she is bathing seems beautifully   described in the original    if all those pretty images of rural nature are lost in the imitation   yet possibly you may think fit to let this supply the place of a long   letter

    addison      abest facundis gratia dictis    ovid    most foreign writers who have given any character of the english nation whatever vices they ascribe to it allow in general that the people are naturally modest it proceeds perhaps from this our national virtue that our orators are observed to make use of less gesture or action than those of other countries our preachers stand stockstill in the pulpit and will not so much as move a finger to set off the best sermons in the world we meet with the same speaking statues at our bars and in all publick places of debate our words flow from us in a smooth continued stream without those strainings of the voice motions of the body and majesty of the hand which are so much celebrated in the orators of greece and rome we can talk of life and death in cold blood and keep our temper in a discourse which turns upon every thing that is dear to us though our zeal breaks out in the finest tropes and figures it is not able to stir a limb about us i have heard it observed more than once by those who have seen italy that an untravelled englishman cannot relish all the beauties of italian pictures because the postures which are expressed in them are often such as are peculiar to that country one who has not seen an italian in the pulpit will not know what to make of that noble gesture in raphaels picture of st paul preaching at athens where the apostle is represented as lifting up both his arms and pouring out the thunder of his rhetorick amidst an audience of pagan philosophers  it is certain that proper gestures and vehement exertions of the voice cannot be too much studied by a publick orator they are a kind of comment to what he utters and enforce every thing he says with weak hearers better than the strongest argument he can make use of they keep the audience awake and fix their attention to what is delivered to them at the same time that they shew the speaker is in earnest and affected himself with what he so passionately recommends to others violent gesture and vociferation naturally shake the hearts of the ignorant and fill them with a kind of religious horror nothing is more frequent than to see women weep and tremble at the sight of a moving preacher though he is placed quite out of their hearing as in england we very frequently see people lulled asleep with solid and elaborate discourses of piety who would be warmed and transported out of themselves by the bellowings and distortions of enthusiasm  if nonsense when accompanied with such an emotion of voice and body has such an influence on mens minds what might we not expect from many of those admirable discourses which are printed in our tongue were they delivered with a becoming fervour and with the most agreeable graces of voice and gesture  we are told that the great latin orator very much impaired his health by this laterum contentio this vehemence of action with which he used to deliver himself the greek orator was likewise so very famous for this particular in rhetorick that one of his antagonists whom he had banished from athens reading over the oration which had procured his banishment and seeing his friends admire it could not forbear asking them if they were so much affected by the bare reading of it how much more they would have been alarmed had they heard him actually throwing out such a storm of eloquence  how cold and dead a figure in comparison of these two great men does an orator often make at the british bar holding up his head with the most insipid serenity and streaking the sides of a long wigg that reaches down to his middle the truth of it is there is often nothing more ridiculous than the gestures of an english speaker you see some of them running their hands into their pockets as far as ever they can thrust them and others looking with great attention on a piece of paper that has nothing written in it you may see many a smart rhetorician turning his hat in his hands moulding it into several different cocks examining sometimes the lining of it and sometimes the button during the whole course of his harangue a deaf man would think he was cheapning a beaver when perhaps he is talking of the fate of the british nation i remember when i was a young man and used to frequent westminsterhall there was a counsellor who never pleaded without a piece of packthread in his hand which he used to twist about a thumb or a finger all the while he was speaking the waggs of those days used to call it the thread of his discourse for he was not able to utter a word without it one of his clients who was more merry than wise stole it from him one day in the midst of his pleading but he had better have let it alone for he lost his cause by his jest  i have all along acknowledged my self to be a dumb man and therefore may be thought a very improper person to give rules for oratory but i believe every one will agree with me in this that we ought either to lay aside all kinds of gesture which seems to be very suitable to the genius of our nation or at least to make use of such only as are graceful and expressive  o                                               no  0

lover of your speculations as well in   regard to the subject as to your manner of treating it human nature   i always thought the most useful object of human reason and to make   the consideration of it pleasant and entertaining i always thought   the best employment of human wit other parts of philosophy may   perhaps make us wiser but this not only answers that end but makes   us better too hence it was that the oracle pronounced socrates the   wisest of all men living because he judiciously made choice of human   nature for the object of his thoughts an enquiry into which as much   exceeds all other learning as it is of more consequence to adjust the   true nature and measures of right and wrong than to settle the   distance of the planets and compute the times of their   circumvolutions    one good effect that will immediately arise from a near observation of   human nature is that we shall cease to wonder at those actions which   men are used to reckon wholly unaccountable for as nothing is   produced without a cause so by observing the nature and course of the   passions we shall be able to trace every action from its first   conception to its death we shall no more admire at the proceedings of   catiline or tiberius when we know the one was actuated by a cruel   jealousie the other by a furious ambition for the actions of men   follow their passions as naturally as light does heat or as any other   effect flows from its cause reason must be employed in adjusting the   passions but they must ever remain the principles of action    the strange and absurd variety that is so apparent in mens actions   shews plainly they can never proceed immediately from reason so pure   a fountain emits no such troubled waters they must necessarily arise   from the passions which are to the mind as the winds to a ship they   only can move it and they too often destroy it if fair and gentle   they guide it into the harbour if contrary and furious they overset   it in the waves in the same manner is the mind assisted or endangered   by the passions reason must then take the place of pilot and can   never fail of securing her charge if she be not wanting to her self   the strength of the passions will never be accepted as an excuse for   complying with them they were designed for subjection and if a man   suffers them to get the upper hand he then betrays the liberty of his   own soul    as nature has framed the several species of beings as it were in a   chain so man seems to be placed as the middle link between angels and   brutes hence he participates both of flesh and spirit by an admirable   tie which in him occasions perpetual war of passions and as a man   inclines to the angelick or brute part of his constitution he is then   denominated good or bad virtuous or wicked if love mercy and   goodnature prevail they speak him of the angel if hatred cruelty   and envy predominate they declare his kindred to the brute hence it   was that some of the ancients imagined that as men in this life   inclined more to the angel or brute so after their death they should   transmigrate into the one or the other and it would be no unpleasant   notion to consider the several species of brutes into which we may   imagine that tyrants misers the proud malicious and illnatured   might be changed    as a consequence of this original all passions are in all men but   all appear not in all constitution education custom of the country   reason and the like causes may improve or abate the strength of   them but still the seeds remain which are ever ready to sprout forth   upon the least encouragement i have heard a story of a good religious   man who having been bred with the milk of a goat was very modest in   publick by a careful reflection he made on his actions but he   frequently had an hour in secret wherein he had his frisks and   capers and if we had an opportunity of examining the retirement of   the strictest philosophers no doubt but we should find perpetual   returns of those passions they so artfully conceal from the publick i   remember matchiavel observes that every state should entertain a   perpetual jealousie of its neighbours that so it should never be   unprovided when an emergency happens   in like manner should the   reason be perpetually on its guard against the passions and never   suffer them to carry on any design that may be destructive of its   security yet at the same time it must be careful that it dont so   far break their strength as to render them contemptible and   consequently it self unguarded    the understanding being of its self too slow and lazy to exert it self   into action its necessary it should be put in motion by the gentle   gales of the passions which may preserve it from stagnating and   corruption for they are as necessary to the health of the mind as   the circulation of the animal spirits is to the health of the body   they keep it in life and strength and vigour nor is it possible for   the mind to perform its offices without their assistance these   motions are given us with our being they are little spirits that are   born and dye with us to some they are mild easie and gentle to   others wayward and unruly yet never too strong for the reins of   reason and the guidance of judgment    we may generally observe a pretty nice proportion between the strength   of reason and passion the greatest geniuss have commonly the   strongest affections as on the other hand the weaker understandings   have generally the weaker passions and tis fit the fury of the   coursers should not be too great for the strength of the charioteer   young men whose passions are not a little unruly give small hopes of   their ever being considerable the fire of youth will of course abate   and is a fault if it be a fault that mends every day but surely   unless a man has fire in youth he can hardly have warmth in old age   we must therefore be very cautious lest while we think to regulate   the passions we should quite extinguish them which is putting out   the light of the soul for to be without passion or to be hurried   away with it makes a man equally blind the extraordinary severity   used in most of our schools has this fatal effect it breaks the   spring of the mind and most certainly destroys more good geniuss   than it can possibly improve and surely tis a mighty mistake that   the passions should be so intirely subdued for little irregularities   are sometimes not only to be borne with but to be cultivated too   since they are frequently attended with the greatest perfections all   great geniuss have faults mixed with their virtues and resemble the   flaming bush which has thorns amongst lights    since therefore the passions are the principles of human actions we   must endeavour to manage them so as to retain their vigour yet keep   them under strict command we must govern them rather like free   subjects than slaves lest while we intend to make them obedient they   become abject and unfit for those great purposes to which they were   designed for my part i must confess i could never have any regard to   that sect of philosophers who so much insisted upon an absolute   indifference and vacancy from all passion for it seems to me a thing   very inconsistent for a man to divest himself of humanity in order to   acquire tranquility of mind and to eradicate the very principles of   action because its possible they may produce ill effects    i am sir    your affectionate admirer    t b

  gratian very often recommends the fine taste   as the utmost perfection of an accomplished man as this word arises very often in conversation i shall endeavour to give some account of it and to lay down rules how we may know whether we are possessed of it and how we may acquire that fine taste of writing which is so much talked of among the polite world  most languages make use of this metaphor to express that faculty of the mind which distinguishes all the most concealed faults and nicest perfections in writing we may be sure this metaphor would not have been so general in all tongues had there not been a very great conformity between that mental taste which is the subject of this paper and that sensitive taste which gives us a relish of every different flavour that affects the palate accordingly we find there are as many degrees of refinement in the intellectual faculty as in the sense which is marked out by this common denomination  i knew a person who possessed the one in so great a perfection that after having tasted ten different kinds of tea he would distinguish without seeing the colour of it the particular sort which was offered him and not only so but any two sorts of them that were mixt together in an equal proportion nay he has carried the experiment so far as upon tasting the composition of three different sorts to name the parcels from whence the three several ingredients were taken a man of a fine taste in writing will discern after the same manner not only the general beauties and imperfections of an author but discover the several ways of thinking and expressing himself which diversify him from all other authors with the several foreign infusions of thought and language and the particular authors from whom they were borrowed  after having thus far explained what is generally meant by a fine taste in writing and shewn the propriety of the metaphor which is used on this occasion i think i may define it to be that faculty of the soul which discerns the beauties of an author with pleasure and the imperfections with dislike if a man would know whether he is possessed of this faculty i would have him read over the celebrated works of antiquity which have stood the test of so many different ages and countries or those works among the moderns which have the sanction of the politer part of our contemporaries if upon the perusal of such writings he does not find himself delighted in an extraordinary manner or if upon reading the admired passages in such authors he finds a coldness and indifference in his thoughts he ought to conclude not as is too usual among tasteless readers that the author wants those perfections which have been admired in him but that he himself wants the faculty of discovering them  he should in the second place be very careful to observe whether he tastes the distinguishing perfections or if i may be allowed to call them so the specifick qualities of the author whom he peruses whether he is particularly pleased with livy for his manner of telling a story with sallust for his entering into those internal principles of action which arise from the characters and manners of the persons he describes or with tacitus for his displaying those outward motives of safety and interest which give birth to the whole series of transactions which he relates  he may likewise consider how differently he is affected by the same thought which presents it self in a great writer from what he is when he finds it delivered by a person of an ordinary genius for there is as much difference in apprehending a thought cloathed in ciceros language and that of a common author as in seeing an object by the light of a taper or by the light of the sun  it is very difficult to lay down rules for the acquirement of such a taste as that i am here speaking of the faculty must in some degree be born with us and it very often happens that those who have other qualities in perfection are wholly void of this one of the most eminent mathematicians of the age has assured me that the greatest pleasure he took in reading virgil was in examining æneas his voyage by the map as i question not but many a modern compiler of history would be delighted with little more in that divine author than in the bare matters of fact  but notwithstanding this faculty must in some measure be born with us there are several methods for cultivating and improving it and without which it will be very uncertain and of little use to the person that possesses it the most natural method for this purpose is to be conversant among the writings of the most polite authors a man who has any relish for fine writing either discovers new beauties or receives stronger impressions from the masterly strokes of a great author every time he peruses him besides that he naturally wears himself into the same manner of speaking and thinking  conversation with men of a polite genius is another method for improving our natural taste it is impossible for a man of the greatest parts to consider anything in its whole extent and in all its variety of lights every man besides those general observations which are to be made upon an author forms several reflections that are peculiar to his own manner of thinking so that conversation will naturally furnish us with hints which we did not attend to and make us enjoy other mens parts and reflections as well as our own this is the best reason i can give for the observation which several have made that men of great genius in the same way of writing seldom rise up singly but at certain periods of time appear together and in a body as they did at rome in the reign of augustus and in greece about the age of socrates i cannot think that corneille racine moliere boileau la fontaine bruyere bossu or the daciers would have written so well as they have done had they not been friends and contemporaries  it is likewise necessary for a man who would form to himself a finished taste of good writing to be well versed in the works of the best criticks both ancient and modern i must confess that i could wish there were authors of this kind who beside the mechanical rules which a man of very little taste may discourse upon would enter into the very spirit and soul of fine writing and shew us the several sources of that pleasure which rises in the mind upon the perusal of a noble work thus although in poetry it be absolutely necessary that the unities of time place and action with other points of the same nature should be thoroughly explained and understood there is still something more essential to the art something that elevates and astonishes the fancy and gives a greatness of mind to the reader which few of the criticks besides longinus have considered  our general taste in england is for epigram turns of wit and forced conceits which have no manner of influence either for the bettering or enlarging the mind of him who reads them and have been carefully avoided by the greatest writers both among the ancients and moderns i have endeavoured in several of my speculations to banish this gothic taste which has taken possession among us i entertained the town for a week together with an essay upon wit in which i endeavoured to detect several of those false kinds which have been admired in the different ages of the world and at the same time to shew wherein the nature of true wit consists i afterwards gave an instance of the great force which lyes in a natural simplicity of thought to affect the mind of the reader from such vulgar pieces as have little else besides this single qualification to recommend them i have likewise examined the works of the greatest poet which our nation or perhaps any other has produced and particularized most of those rational and manly beauties which give a value to that divine work i shall next saturday enter upon an essay on the pleasures of the imagination which though it shall consider that subject at large will perhaps suggest to the reader what it is that gives a beauty to many passages of the finest writers both in prose and verse as an undertaking of this nature is entirely new i question not but it will be received with candour  o    footnote   see note on p   0 ante footnote   of no     this fine taste was the cultismo the taste for false concepts which

haurire    lucr    our sight is the most perfect and most delightful of all our senses it fills the mind with the largest variety of ideas converses with its objects at the greatest distance and continues the longest in action without being tired or satiated with its proper enjoyments the sense of feeling can indeed give us a notion of extension shape and all other ideas that enter at the eye except colours but at the same time it is very much streightned and confined in its operations to the number bulk and distance of its particular objects our sight seems designed to supply all these defects and may be considered as a more delicate and diffusive kind of touch that spreads it self over an infinite multitude of bodies comprehends the largest figures and brings into our reach some of the most remote parts of the universe  it is this sense which furnishes the imagination with its ideas so that by the pleasures of the imagination or fancy which i shall use promiscuously i here mean such as arise from visible objects either when we have them actually in our view or when we call up their ideas in our minds by paintings statues descriptions or any the like occasion we cannot indeed have a single image in the fancy that did not make its first entrance through the sight but we have the power of retaining altering and compounding those images which we have once received into all the varieties of picture and vision that are most agreeable to the imagination for by this faculty a man in a dungeon is capable of entertaining himself with scenes and landskips more beautiful than any that can be found in the whole compass of nature  there are few words in the english language which are employed in a more loose and uncircumscribed sense than those of the fancy and the imagination i therefore thought it necessary to fix and determine the notion of these two words as i intend to make use of them in the thread of my following speculations that the reader may conceive rightly what is the subject which i proceed upon i must therefore desire him to remember that by the pleasures of the imagination i mean only such pleasures as arise originally from sight and that i divide these pleasures into two kinds my design being first of all to discourse of those primary pleasures of the imagination which entirely proceed from such objects as are before our   eyes and in the next place to speak of those secondary pleasures of the imagination which flow from the ideas of visible objects when the objects are not actually before the eye but are called up into our memories or formed into agreeable visions of things that are either absent or fictitious  the pleasures of the imagination taken in the full extent are not so gross as those of sense nor so refined as those of the understanding the last are indeed more preferable because they are founded on some new knowledge or improvement in the mind of man yet it must be confest that those of the imagination are as great and as transporting as the other a beautiful prospect delights the soul as much as a demonstration and a description in homer has charmed more readers than a chapter in aristotle besides the pleasures of the imagination have this advantage above those of the understanding that they are more obvious and more easie to be acquired it is but opening the eye and the scene enters the colours paint themselves on the fancy with very little attention of thought or application of mind in the beholder we are struck we know not how with the symmetry of any thing we see and immediately assent to the beauty of an object without enquiring into the particular causes and occasions of it  a man of a polite imagination is let into a great many pleasures that the vulgar are not capable of receiving he can converse with a picture and find an agreeable companion in a statue he meets with a secret refreshment in a description and often feels a greater satisfaction in the prospect of fields and meadows than another does in the possession it gives him indeed a kind of property in every thing he sees and makes the most rude uncultivated parts of nature administer to his pleasures so that he looks upon the world as it were in another light and discovers in it a multitude of charms that conceal themselves from the generality of mankind  there are indeed but very few who know how to be idle and innocent or have a relish of any pleasures that are not criminal every diversion they take is at the expence of some one virtue or another and their very first step out of business is into vice or folly a man should endeavour therefore to make the sphere of his innocent pleasures as wide as possible that he may retire into them with safety and find in them such a satisfaction as a wise man would not blush to take of this nature are those of the imagination which do not require such a bent of thought as is necessary to our more serious employments nor at the same time suffer the mind to sink into that negligence and remissness which are apt to accompany our more sensual delights but like a gentle exercise to the faculties awaken them from sloth and idleness without putting them upon any labour or difficulty  we might here add that the pleasures of the fancy are more conducive to health than those of the understanding which are worked out by dint of thinking and attended with too violent a labour of the brain delightful scenes whether in nature painting or poetry have a kindly influence on the body as well as the mind and not only serve to clear and brighten the imagination but are able to disperse grief and melancholy and to set the animal spirits in pleasing and agreeable motions for this reason sir francis bacon in his essay upon health has not thought it improper to prescribe to his reader a poem or a prospect where he particularly dissuades him from knotty and subtile disquisitions and advises him to pursue studies that fill the mind with splendid and illustrious objects as histories fables and contemplations of nature  i have in this paper by way of introduction settled the notion of those pleasures of the imagination which are the subject of my present undertaking and endeavoured by several considerations to recommend to my reader the pursuit of those pleasures i shall in my next paper examine the several sources from whence these pleasures are derived    o    footnote   present to the   footnote   from a ms notebook of addisons met with in      mr j dykes campbell printed at glasgow in        0 copies of some portions of the first draught of these papers on imagination with the essay on jealousy no     and that on fame no     the ms was an old calf bound  vo volume obtained from a dealer there were about    pages written on one

published in      when he was    years old was suggested by these papers many disquisitions upon taste were written towards the close of the last century they formed a new province in literature of which addison here appears as the founder and first lawgiver                                               no                    monday june                         addison      divisum sic breve fiet opus    mart    i shall first consider those pleasures of the imagination which arise from the actual view and survey of outward objects and these i think all proceed from the sight of what is great uncommon or beautiful there may indeed be something so terrible or offensive that the horror or loathsomeness of an object may overbear the pleasure which results from its greatness novelty or beauty but still there will be such a mixture of delight in the very disgust it gives us as any of these three qualifications are most conspicuous and prevailing  by greatness i do not only mean the bulk of any single object but the largeness of a whole view considered as one entire piece such are the prospects of an open champain country a vast uncultivated desart of huge heaps of mountains high rocks and precipices or a wide expanse of waters where we are not struck with the novelty or beauty of the sight but with that rude kind of magnificence which appears in many of these stupendous works of nature our imagination loves to be filled with an object or to grasp at any thing that is too big for its capacity we are flung into a pleasing astonishment at such unbounded views and feel a delightful stillness and amazement in the soul at the apprehensions of them the mind of man naturally hates every thing that looks like a restraint upon it and is apt to fancy it self under a sort of confinement when the sight is pent up in a narrow compass and shortned on every side by the neighbourhood of walls or mountains on the contrary a spacious horizon is an image of liberty where the eye has room to range abroad to expatiate at large on the immensity of its views and to lose it self amidst the variety of objects that offer themselves to its observation such wide and undetermined prospects are as pleasing to the fancy as the speculations of eternity or infinitude are to the understanding but if there be a beauty or uncommonness joined with this grandeur as in a troubled ocean a heaven adorned with stars and meteors or a spacious landskip cut out into rivers woods rocks and meadows the pleasure still grows upon us as it rises from more than a single principle  every thing that is new or uncommon raises a pleasure in the imagination because it fills the soul with an agreeable surprize gratifies its curiosity and gives it an idea of which it was not before possest we are indeed so often conversant with one set of objects and tired out with so many repeated shows of the same things that whatever is new or uncommon contributes a little to vary human life and to divert our minds for a while with the strangeness of its appearance it serves us for a kind of refreshment and takes off from that satiety we are apt to complain of in our usual and ordinary entertainments it is this that bestows charms on a monster and makes even the imperfections of nature please   us it is this that recommends variety where the mind is every instant called off to something new and the attention not suffered to dwell too long and waste it self on any particular object it is this likewise that improves what is great or beautiful and make it afford the mind a double entertainment groves fields and meadows are at any season of the year pleasant to look upon but never so much as in the opening of the spring when they are all new and fresh with their first gloss upon them and not yet too much accustomed and familiar to the eye for this reason there is nothing that more enlivens a prospect than rivers jetteaus or falls of water where the scene is perpetually shifting and entertaining the sight every moment with something that is new we are quickly tired with looking upon hills and vallies where every thing continues fixed and settled in the same place and posture but find our thoughts a little agitated and relieved at the sight of such objects as are ever in motion and sliding away from beneath the eye of the beholder  but there is nothing that makes its way more directly to the soul than beauty which immediately diffuses a secret satisfaction and complacency through the imagination and gives a finishing to any thing that is great or uncommon the very first discovery of it strikes the mind with an inward joy and spreads a chearfulness and delight through all its faculties there is not perhaps any real beauty or deformity more in one piece of matter than another because we might have been so made that whatsoever now appears loathsome to us might have shewn it self agreeable but we find by experience that there are several modifications of matter which the mind without any previous consideration pronounces at first sight beautiful or deformed thus we see that every different species of sensible creatures has its different notions of beauty and that each of them is most affected with the beauties of its own kind this is no where more remarkable than in birds of the same shape and proportion where we often see the male determined in his courtship by the single grain or tincture of a feather and never discovering any charms but in the colour of its species    scit thalamo servare fidem sanctasque veretur   connubii leges non illum in pectore

constat crescitque quotannis   lucida progenies castos confessa parentes   dum virides inter saltus lucosque sonoros   vere novo exultat plumasque decora juventus   explicat ad solem patriisque coloribus ardet    there is a second kind of beauty that we find in the several products of art and nature which does not work in the imagination with that warmth and violence as the beauty that appears in our proper species but is apt however to raise in us a secret delight and a kind of fondness for the places or objects in which we discover it this consists either in the gaiety or variety of colours in the symmetry and proportion of parts in the arrangement and disposition of bodies or in a just mixture and concurrence of all together among these several kinds of beauty the eye takes most delight in colours we no where meet with a more glorious or pleasing show in nature than what appears in the heavens at the rising and setting of the sun which is wholly made up of those different stains of light that shew themselves in clouds of a different situation for this reason we find the poets who are always addressing themselves to the imagination borrowing more of their epithets from colours than from any other topic as the fancy delights in every thing that is great strange or beautiful and is still more pleased the more it finds of these perfections in the same object so is it capable of receiving a new satisfaction by the assistance of another sense thus any continued sound as the musick of birds or a fall of water awakens every moment the mind of the beholder and makes him more attentive to the several beauties of the place that lye before him thus if there arises a fragrancy of smells or perfumes they heighten the pleasures of the imagination and make even the colours and verdure of the landskip appear more agreeable for the ideas of both senses recommend each other and are pleasanter together than when they enter the mind separately as the different colours of a picture when they are well disposed set off one another and receive an additional beauty from the advantage of their situation  o    footnote   to please   footnote   addisons

pleasure we must own that it is impossible for us to assign the necessary cause of this pleasure because we know neither the nature of an idea nor the substance of a human soul which might help us to discover the conformity or disagreeableness of the one to the other and therefore for want of such a light all that we can do in speculations of this kind is to reflect on those operations of the soul that are most agreeable and to range under their proper heads what is pleasing or displeasing to the mind without being able to trace out the several necessary and efficient causes from whence the pleasure or displeasure arises  final causes lye more bare and open to our observation as there are often a great variety that belong to the same effect and these tho they are not altogether so satisfactory are generally more useful than the other as they give us greater occasion of admiring the goodness and wisdom of the first contriver  one of the final causes of our delight in any thing that is great may be this the supreme author of our being has so formed the soul of man that nothing but himself can be its last adequate and proper happiness because therefore a great part of our happiness must arise from the contemplation of his being that he might give our souls a just relish of such a contemplation he has made them naturally delight in the apprehension of what is great or unlimited our admiration which is a very pleasing motion of the mind immediately rises at the consideration of any object that takes up a great deal of room in the fancy and by consequence will improve into the highest pitch of astonishment and devotion when we contemplate his nature that is neither circumscribed by time nor place nor to be comprehended by the largest capacity of a created being  he has annexed a secret pleasure to the idea of any thing that is new or uncommon that he might encourage us in the pursuit after knowledge and engage us to search into the wonders of his creation for every new idea brings such a pleasure along with it as rewards any pains we have taken in its acquisition and consequently serves as a motive to put us upon fresh discoveries  he has made every thing that is beautiful in our own species pleasant that all creatures might be tempted to multiply their kind and fill the world with inhabitants for tis very remarkable that whereever nature is crost in the production of a monster the result of any unnatural mixture the breed is incapable of propagating its likeness and of founding a new order of creatures so that unless all animals were allured by the beauty of their own species generation would be at an end and the earth unpeopled  in the last place he has made every thing that is beautiful in all other objects pleasant or rather has made so many objects appear beautiful that he might render the whole creation more gay and delightful he has given almost every thing about us the power of raising an agreeable idea in the imagination so that it is impossible for us to behold his works with coldness or indifference and to survey so many beauties without a secret satisfaction and complacency things would make but a poor appearance to the eye if we saw them only in their proper figures and motions and what reason can we assign for their exciting in us many of those ideas which are different from any thing that exists in the objects themselves for such are light and colours were it not to add supernumerary ornaments to the universe and make it more agreeable to the imagination we are every where entertained with pleasing shows and apparitions we discover imaginary glories in the heavens and in the earth and see some of this visionary beauty poured out upon the whole creation but what a rough unsightly sketch of nature should we be entertained with did all her colouring disappear and the several distinctions of light and shade vanish in short our souls are at present delightfully lost and bewildered in a pleasing delusion and we walk about like the enchanted hero of a romance who sees beautiful castles woods and meadows and at the same time hears the warbling of birds and the purling of streams but upon the finishing of some secret spell the fantastick scene breaks up and the disconsolate knight finds himself on a barren heath or in a solitary desart it is not improbable that something like this may be the state of the soul after its first separation in respect of the images it will receive from matter tho indeed the ideas of colours are so pleasing and beautiful in the imagination that it is possible the soul will not be deprived of them but perhaps find them excited by some other occasional cause as they are at present by the different impressions of the subtle matter on the organ of sight  i have here supposed that my reader is acquainted with that great modern discovery which is at present universally acknowledged by all the enquirers into natural philosophy namely that light and colours as apprehended by the imagination are only ideas in the mind and not qualities that have any existence in matter as this is a truth which has been proved incontestably by many modern philosophers and is indeed one of the finest speculations in that science if the english reader would see the notion explained at large he may find it in the eighth chapter of the second book of mr locks essay on human understanding  o   to addisons short paper there was added in number     of the spectator the following letter which was not included in the reprint into volumes     june            mr spectator    i would not divert the course of your discourses when you seem bent   upon obliging the world with a train of thinking which rightly   attended to may render the life of every man who reads it more easy   and happy for the future the pleasures of the imagination are what   bewilder life when reason and judgment do not interpose it is   therefore a worthy action in you to look carefully into the powers of   fancy that other men from the knowledge of them may improve their   joys and allay their griefs by a just use of that faculty i say   sir i would not interrupt you in the progress of this discourse but   if you will do me the favour of inserting this letter in your next   paper you will do some service to the public though not in so noble   a way of obliging as that of improving their minds allow me sir to   acquaint you with a design of which i am partly author though it   tends to no greater a good than that of getting money i should not   hope for the favour of a philosopher in this matter if it were not   attempted under all the restrictions which you sages put upon private   acquisitions    the first purpose which every good man is to propose to himself is   the service of his prince and country after that is done he cannot   add to himself but he must also be beneficial to them this scheme of   gain is not only consistent with that end but has its very being in   subordination to it for no man can be a gainer here but at the same   time he himself or some other must succeed in their dealings with   the government it is called the multiplication table and is so far   calculated for the immediate service of her majesty that the same   person who is fortunate in the lottery of the state may receive yet   further advantage in this table and i am sure nothing can be more   pleasing to her gracious temper than to find out additional methods of   increasing their good fortune who adventure anything in her service   or laying occasions for others to become capable of serving their   country who are at present in too low circumstances to exert   themselves the manner of executing the design is by giving out   receipts for half guineas received which shall entitle the fortunate   bearer to certain sums in the table as is set forth at large in the   proposals printed the   rd instant there is another circumstance in   this design which gives me hopes of your favour to it and that is   what tully advises to wit that the benefit is made as diffusive as   possible every one that has half a guinea is put into a possibility   from that small sum to raise himself an easy fortune when these   little parcels of wealth are as it were thus thrown back again into   the redonation of providence we are to expect that some who live   under hardship or obscurity may be produced to the world in the   figure they deserve by this means i doubt not but this last argument   will have force with you and i cannot add another to it but what   your severity will i fear very little regard which is that   i am sir your greatest admirer   richard steele                                               no                    wednesday june                       addison    alterius sic altera poscit opem res et conjurat amicè  hor    if we consider the works of nature and art as they are qualified to entertain the imagination we shall find the last very defective in comparison of the former for though they may sometimes appear as beautiful or strange they can have nothing in them of that vastness and immensity which afford so great an entertainment to the mind of the beholder the one may be as polite and delicate as the other but can never shew her self so august and magnificent in the design there is something more bold and masterly in the rough careless strokes of nature than in the nice touches and embellishments of art the beauties of the most stately garden or palace lie in a narrow compass the imagination immediately runs them over and requires something else to gratifie her but in the wide fields of nature the sight wanders up and down without confinement and is fed with an infinite variety of images without any certain stint or number for this reason we always find the poet in love with a countrylife where nature appears in the greatest perfection and furnishes out all those scenes that are most apt to delight the imagination    scriptorum chorus omnis amat nemus et fugit urbes    hor     hic secura quies et nescia fallere vita   dives opum variarum hic latis otia fundis   speluncæ vivique lacus hic frigida tempe   mugitusque boum mollesque sub arbore somni    virg  but tho there are several of these wild scenes that are more delightful than any artificial shows yet we find the works of nature still more pleasant the more they resemble those of art for in this case our pleasure rises from a double principle from the agreeableness of the objects to the eye and from their similitude to other objects we are pleased as well with comparing their beauties as with surveying them and can represent them to our minds either as copies or originals hence it is that we take delight in a prospect which is well laid out and diversified with fields and meadows woods and rivers in those accidental landskips of trees clouds and cities that are sometimes found in the veins of marble in the curious fretwork of rocks and grottos and in a word in any thing that hath such a variety or regularity as may seem the effect of design in what we call the works of chance  if the products of nature rise in value according as they more or less resemble those of art we may be sure that artificial works receive a greater advantage from their resemblance of such as are natural because here the similitude is not only pleasant but the pattern more perfect the prettiest landskip i ever saw was one drawn on the walls of a dark room which stood opposite on one side to a navigable river and on the other to a park the experiment is very common in opticks here you might discover the waves and fluctuations of the water in strong and proper colours with the picture of a ship entering at one end and sailing by degrees through the whole piece on another there appeared the green shadows of trees waving to and fro with the wind and herds of deer among them in miniature leaping about upon the wall i must confess the novelty of such a sight may be one occasion of its pleasantness to the imagination but certainly the chief reason is its near resemblance to nature as it does not only like other pictures give the colour and figure but the motion of the things it represents  we have before observed that there is generally in nature something more grand and august than what we meet with in the curiosities of art when therefore we see this imitated in any measure it gives us a nobler and more exalted kind of pleasure than what we receive from the nicer and more accurate productions of art on this account our english gardens are not so entertaining to the fancy as those in france and italy where we see a large extent of ground covered over with an agreeable mixture of garden and forest which represent every where an artificial rudeness much more charming than that neatness and elegancy which we meet with in those of our own country it might indeed be of ill consequence to the publick as well as unprofitable to private persons to alienate so much ground from pasturage and the plow in many parts of a country that is so well peopled and cultivated to a far greater advantage but why may not a whole estate be thrown into a kind of garden by frequent plantations that may turn as much to the profit as the pleasure of the owner a marsh overgrown with willows or a mountain shaded with oaks are not only more beautiful but more beneficial than when they lie bare and unadorned fields of corn make a pleasant prospect and if the walks were a little taken care of that lie between them if the natural embroidery of the meadows were helpt and improved by some small additions of art and the several rows of hedges set off by trees and flowers that the soil was capable of receiving a man might make a pretty landskip of his own possessions  writers who have given us an account of china tell us the inhabitants of that country laugh at the plantations of our europeans which are laid out by the rule and line because they say any one may place trees in equal rows and uniform figures they chuse rather to shew a genius in works of this nature and therefore always conceal the art by which they direct themselves they have a word it seems in their language by which they express the particular beauty of a plantation that thus strikes the imagination at first sight without discovering what it is that has so agreeable an effect our british gardeners on the contrary instead of humouring nature love to deviate from it as much as possible our trees rise in cones globes and pyramids we see the marks of the scissars upon every plant and bush i do not know whether i am singular in my opinion but for my own part i would rather look upon a tree in all its luxuriancy and diffusion of boughs and branches than when it is thus cut and trimmed into a mathematical figure and cannot but fancy that an orchard in flower looks infinitely more delightful than all the little labyrinths of the more   finished parterre but as our great modellers of gardens have their magazines of plants to dispose of it is very natural for them to tear up all the beautiful plantations of fruit trees and contrive a plan that may most turn to their own profit in taking off their evergreens and the like moveable plants with which their shops are plentifully stocked  o    footnote   most                                               no                   thursday june                         addison      adde tot egregias urbes operumque laborem    virg    having already shewn how the fancy is affected by the works of nature and afterwards considered in general both the works of nature and of art how they mutually assist and compleat each other in forming such scenes and prospects as are most apt to delight the mind of the beholder i shall in this paper throw together some reflections on that particular art which has a more immediate tendency than any other to produce those primary pleasures of the imagination which have hitherto been the subject of this discourse the art i mean is that of architecture which i shall consider only with regard to the light in which the foregoing speculations have placed it without entring into those rules and maxims which the great masters of architecture have laid down and explained at large in numberless treatises upon that subject  greatness in the works of architecture may be considered as relating to the bulk and body of the structure or to the manner in which it is built as for the first we find the ancients especially among the eastern nations of the world infinitely superior to the moderns  not to mention the tower of babel of which an old author says there were the foundations to be seen in his time which looked like a spacious mountain what could be more noble than the walls of babylon its hanging gardens and its temple to jupiter belus that rose a mile high by eight several stories each story a furlong in height and on the top of which was the babylonian observatory i might here likewise take notice of the huge rock that was cut into the figure of semiramis with the smaller rocks that lay by it in the shape of tributary kings the prodigious basin or artificial lake which took in the whole euphrates till such time as a new canal was formed for its reception with the several trenches through which that river was conveyed i know there are persons who look upon some of these wonders of art as fabulous but i cannot find any grand   for such a suspicion unless it be that we have no such works among us at present there were indeed many greater advantages for building in those times and in that part of the world than have been met with ever since the earth was extremely fruitful men lived generally on pasturage which requires a much smaller number of hands than agriculture there were few trades to employ the busie part of mankind and fewer arts and sciences to give work to men of speculative tempers and what is more than all the rest the prince was absolute so that when he went to war he put himself at the head of a whole people as we find semiramis leading her three   millions to the field and yet overpowered by the number of her enemies tis no wonder therefore when she was at peace and turned her thoughts on building that she could accomplish so great works with such a prodigious multitude of labourers besides that in her climate there was small interruption of frosts and winters which make the northern workmen lie half the year idle i might mention too among the benefits of the climate what historians say of the earth that it sweated out a bitumen or natural kind of mortar which is doubtless the same with that mentioned in holy writ as contributing to the structure of babel slime they used instead of mortar  in egypt we still see their pyramids which answer to the descriptions that have been made of them and i question not but a traveller might find out some remains of the labyrinth that covered a whole province and had a hundred temples disposed among its several quarters and divisions  the wall of china is one of these eastern pieces of magnificence which makes a figure even in the map of the world altho an account of it would have been thought fabulous were not the wall it self still extant  we are obliged to devotion for the noblest buildings that have adornd the several countries of the world it is this which has set men at work on temples and publick places of worship not only that they might by the magnificence of the building invite the deity to reside within it but that such stupendous works might at the same time open the mind to vast conceptions and fit it to converse with the divinity of the place for every thing that is majestick imprints an awfulness and reverence on the mind of the beholder and strikes in with the natural greatness of the soul  in the second place we are to consider greatness of manner in architecture which has such force upon the imagination that a small building where it appears shall give the mind nobler ideas than one of twenty times the bulk where the manner is ordinary or little thus perhaps a man would have been more astonished with the majestick air that appeared in one of lysippuss   statues of alexander tho no bigger than the life than he might have been with mount athos had it been cut into the figure of the hero according to the proposal of phidias   with a river in one hand and a city in the other  let any one reflect on the disposition of mind he finds in himself at his first entrance into the pantheon at rome and how his imagination is filled with something great and amazing and at the same time consider how little in proportion he is affected with the inside of a gothick cathedral tho it be five times larger than the other which can arise from nothing else but the greatness of the manner in the one and the meanness in the other  i have seen an observation upon this subject in a french author which very much pleased me it is in monsieur frearts parallel of the ancient and modern architecture i shall give it the reader with the same terms of art which he has made use of i am observing says he a thing which in my opinion is very curious whence it proceeds that in the same quantity of superficies the one manner seems great and magnificent and the other poor and trifling the reason is fine and uncommon i say then that to introduce into architecture this grandeur of manner we ought so to proceed that the division of the principal members of the order may consist but of few parts that they be all great and of a bold and ample relievo and swelling and that the eye beholding nothing little and mean the imagination may be more vigorously touched and affected with the work that stands before it for example in a cornice if the gola or cynatium of the corona the coping the modillions or dentelli make a noble show by their graceful projections if we see none of that ordinary confusion which is the result of those little cavities quarter rounds of the astragal and i know not how many other intermingled particulars which produce no effect in great and massy works and which very unprofitably take up place to the prejudice of the principal member it is most certain that this manner will appear solemn and great as on the contrary that it will have but a poor and mean effect where there is a redundancy of those smaller ornaments which divide and scatter the angles of the sight into such a multitude of rays so pressed together that the whole will appear but a confusion  among all the figures in architecture there are none that have a greater air than the concave and the convex and we find in all the ancient and modern architecture as well in the remote parts of china as in countries nearer home that round pillars and vaulted roofs make a great part of those buildings which are designed for pomp and magnificence the reason i take to be because in these figures we generally see more of the body than in those of other kinds there are indeed figures of bodies where the eye may take in two thirds of the surface but as in such bodies the sight must split upon several angles it does not take in one uniform idea but several ideas of the same kind look upon the outside of a dome your eye half surrounds it look up into the inside and at one glance you have all the prospect of it the entire concavity falls into your eye at once the sight being as the center that collects and gathers into it the lines of the whole circumference in a square pillar the sight often takes in but a fourth part of the surface and in a square concave must move up and down to the different sides before it is master of all the inward surface for this reason the fancy is infinitely more struck with the view of the open air and skies that passes through an arch than what comes through a square or any other figure the figure of the rainbow does not contribute less to its magnificence than the colours to its beauty as it is very poetically described by the son of sirach look upon the rainbow and praise him that made it very beautiful it is in its brightness it encompasses the heavens with a glorious circle and the hands of the most high   have bended it  having thus spoken of that greatness which affects the mind in architecture i might next shew the pleasure that arises in the imagination from what appears new and beautiful in this art but as every beholder has naturally a greater taste of these two perfections in every building which offers it self to his view than of that which i have hitherto considered i shall not trouble my reader with any reflections upon it it is sufficient for my present purpose to observe that there is nothing in this whole art which pleases the imagination but as it is great uncommon or beautiful  o    footnote   grounds

  quatenûs hoc simile est oculis quod mente videmus    lucr    i at first divided the pleasures of the imagination into such as arise from objects that are actually before our eyes or that once entered in at our eyes and are afterwards called up into the mind either barely by its own operations or on occasion of something without us as statues or descriptions we have already considered the first division and shall therefore enter on the other which for distinction sake i have called the secondary pleasures of the imagination when i say the ideas we receive from statues descriptions or such like occasions are the same that were once actually in our view it must not be understood that we had once see the very place action or person which are carved or described it is sufficient that we have seen places persons or actions in general which bear a resemblance or at least some remote analogy with what we find represented since it is in the power of the imagination when it is once stocked with particular ideas to enlarge compound and vary them at her own pleasure  among the different kinds of representation statuary is the most natural and shews us something likest the object that is represented to make use of a common instance let one who is born blind take an image in his hands and trace out with his fingers the different furrows and impressions of the chissel and he will easily conceive how the shape of a man or beast may be represented by it but should he draw his hand over a picture where all is smooth and uniform he would never be able to imagine how the several prominencies and depressions of a human body could be shewn on a plain piece of canvas that has in it no unevenness or irregularity description runs yet further from the things it represents than painting for a picture bears a real resemblance to its original which letters and syllables are wholly void of colours speak of languages but words are understood only by such a people or nation for this reason tho mens necessities quickly put them on finding out speech writing is probably of a later invention than painting particularly we are told that in america when the spaniards first arrived there expresses were sent to the emperor of mexico in paint and the news of his country delineated by the strokes of a pencil which was a more natural way than that of writing tho at the same time much more imperfect because it is impossible to draw the little connexions of speech or to give the picture of a conjunction or an adverb it would be yet more strange to represent visible objects by sounds that have no ideas annexed to them and to make something like description in musick yet it is certain there may be confused imperfect notions of this nature raised in the imagination by an artificial composition of notes and we find that great masters in the art are able sometimes to set their hearers in the heat and hurry of a battel to overcast their minds with melancholy scenes and apprehensions of deaths and funerals or to lull them into pleasing dreams of groves and elisiums  in all these instances this secondary pleasure of the imagination proceeds from that action of the mind which compares the ideas arising from the original objects with the ideas we receive from the statue picture description or sound that represents them it is impossible for us to give the necessary reason why this operation of the mind is attended with so much pleasure as i have before observed on the same occasion but we find a great variety of entertainments derived from this single principle for it is this that not only gives us a relish of statuary painting and description but makes us delight in all the actions and arts of mimickry it is this that makes the several kinds of wit pleasant which consists as i have formerly shewn in the affinity of ideas and we may add it is this also that raises the little satisfaction we sometimes find in the different sorts of false wit whether it consists in the affinity of letters as in anagram acrostick or of syllables as in doggerel rhimes ecchos or of words as in punns quibbles or of a whole sentence or poem to wings and altars the final cause probably of annexing pleasure to this operation of the mind was to quicken and encourage us in our searches after truth since the distinguishing one thing from another and the right discerning betwixt our ideas depends wholly upon our comparing them together and observing the congruity or disagreement that appears among the several works of nature  but i shall here confine my self to those pleasures of the imagination which   proceed from ideas raised by words because most of the observations that agree with descriptions are equally applicable to painting and statuary  words when well chosen have so great a force in them that a description often gives us more lively ideas than the sight of things themselves the reader finds a scene drawn in stronger colours and painted more to the life in his imagination by the help of words than by an actual survey of the scene which they describe in this case the poet seems to get the better of nature he takes indeed the landskip after her but gives it more vigorous touches heightens its beauty and so enlivens the whole piece that the images which flow from the objects themselves appear weak and faint in comparison of those that come from the expressions the reason probably may be because in the survey of any object we have only so much of it painted on the imagination as comes in at the eye but in its description the poet gives us as free a view of it as he pleases and discovers to us several parts that either we did not attend to or that lay out of our sight when we first beheld it as we look on any object our idea of it is perhaps made up of two or three simple ideas but when the poet represents it he may either give us a more complex idea of it or only raise in us such ideas as are most apt to affect the imagination  it may be here worth our while to examine how it comes to pass that several readers who are all acquainted with the same language and know the meaning of the words they read should nevertheless have a different relish of the same descriptions we find one transported with a passage which another runs over with coldness and indifference or finding the representation extreamly natural where another can perceive nothing of likeness and conformity this different taste must proceed either from the perfection of imagination in one more than in another or from the different ideas that several readers affix to the same words for to have a true relish and form a right judgment of a description a man should be born with a good imagination and must have well weighed the force and energy that lye in the several words of a language so as to be able to distinguish which are most significant and expressive of their proper ideas and what additional strength and beauty they are capable of receiving from conjunction with others the fancy must be warm to retain the print of those images it hath received from outward objects and the judgment discerning to know what expressions are most proper to cloath and adorn them to the best advantage a man who is deficient in either of these respects tho he may receive the general notion of a description can never see distinctly all its particular beauties as a person with a weak sight may have the confused prospect of a place that lies before him without entering into its several parts or discerning the variety of its colours in their full glory and perfection  o    footnote   that
